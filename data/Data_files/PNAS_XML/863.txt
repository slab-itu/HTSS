title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trends in micamica adhesion reflect the influence of molecular details on long-range dispersion forces underlying aggregation and coalignment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crystal growth through nanoparticle assembly appears to be a common phenomenon in synthetic, biological, and geochemical settings, and can lead to formation of hierarchical structures with unique properties tied to this nonclassical assembly process, but the underlying forces driving assembly are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using custom-made single-crystal atomic force microscopy tips, we measured the adhesion force between mica surfaces in the solvent-separate regime as a function of crystallographic orientation and solution parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed dependencies are predicted using a continuum description of the electrostatic and electrodynamic interactions that includes short-range molecular details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings show that the attractive interaction driving nanoparticle assembly and orientation results from the coupling between the short-range solution response and the long-range van der Waals interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oriented attachment of nanocrystalline subunits is recognized as a common crystallization pathway that is closely related to formation of nanoparticle superlattices, mesocrystals, and other kinetically stabilized structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approaching particles have been observed to rotate to achieve coalignment while separated by nanometer-scale solvent layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known about the forces that drive coalignment, particularly in this solvent-separated regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain a mechanistic understanding of this process, we used atomic-force-microscopy-based dynamic force spectroscopy with tips fabricated from oriented mica to measure the adhesion forces between mica (001) surfaces in electrolyte solutions as a function of orientation, temperature, electrolyte type, and electrolyte concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results reveal an 60° periodicity as well as a complex dependence on electrolyte concentration and temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A continuum model that considers the competition between electrostatic repulsion and van der Waals attraction, augmented by microscopic details that include surface separation, water structure, ion hydration, and charge regulation at the interface, qualitatively reproduces the observed trends and implies that dispersion forces are responsible for establishing coalignment in the solvent-separated state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Dependence of Fad on relative in-plane orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Fad plotted as Fmax/Fmin vs. rotation angle for a mica (001) tip against a mica (001) face (red diamonds and green solid circles) and an amorphous SiO2 surface (blue triangles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotation step between individual measurements (red diamonds) is 2° except between 20 and 100°, where it is 5 ± 1° due to instrumental limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Green solid circles are averages of data points taken within 10° intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a number of the maxima, the data suggest a small minimum (i.e., at 40, 90, and 150°) near the peak; 0° is arbitrary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error bar stands for 1 SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fmin is taken from the individual data set for the Fad(theta)/Fad(min) plots of both the average and individual measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B and C) Schematic showing monoclinic structure of mica as viewed along [010] and [001] directions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Schematic of experimental setup highlighting the distinct values of the dielectric function, , in the three regions and its tensorial nature within the solid regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion_and_Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The findings presented here suggest that, in the absence of attractive dispersion forces, only the repulsive interactions of electrostatics and hydration forces would be present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is the dispersion force that is responsible for nanocrystals retaining their proximity to one another for sufficient time to allow the (de)hydration barriers to be overcome through fluctuations of solvent layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An important aspect of this study is to include some of the important molecular granularity present in the solution through its response to the mica surface to calculate the long-range interactions needed to predict the observed trends in adhesion force with temperature and electrolyte type and concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a better molecular description that includes, for example, correct ion distributions as a function of separation and concentration, and nonlocal dielectric response will be necessary to obtain a quantitative prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, whereas obtaining a purely molecular picture through molecular simulations would be desirable, the potentials available for such simulations typically use cutoffs for the molecular interaction on the order of 1 nm; thus, the ability to predict nanoparticle interactions at the large length scales relevant to this studyand thus to the solvent-separated regimeusing such methods at present seem problematic (see SI Appendix for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our use of a continuum theory modified to include molecular details also enables us to estimate the surface separation to be 1 nm, which is consistent with estimates based on comparison of maximum pressures applied in the AFM experiments with those measured in previous SFA experiments for which surface separation is accurately known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These molecular details include the structure of the surface hydration layers and the number density of ionizable surface groups, to elucidate the subtle competition of long-range vdW and electrostatic forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, neither a simple continuum theory with spatial homogeneity nor molecular simulation using isotropic pairwise-additive interactions can provide a quantitative explanation of the azimuthally resolved variation of the adhesion force between mica sheets (see SI Appendix for discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a more rigorous treatment of vdW forces arising from a spatially varying and anisotropic dielectric response in conjunction with the role of heff at different mismatch angles is needed and will be the focus of future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, taking advantage of the near-equilibrium nature of the force measurements (Fad  Feq), the present study shows that Feqand hence the equilibrium binding energybetween mica surfaces in the solvent-separated regime has an 60° periodicity related to crystal structure and depends strongly on electrolyte type, concentration, and temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonmonotonic variation of Fad with electrolyte concentration indicates the magnitude of Fad is determined by competing forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis shows these features are all consistent with an attractive interaction induced by vdW forces that is indeed competing with electrostatic and hydration forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such balance is predicted to be very sensitive to the short-range surface hydration structure, which can be controlled via electrolyte type, concentration, and temperature, leading to changes in the dependence of force on separation and consequent variations in heff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings imply that a simple model system, such as the (001) face of mica, exhibits the complexities germane to a quantitative understanding of OA of nanocrystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analyses reported herein highlight the strong interplay between experiment and theory needed to quantify the magnitude and define the origin of the forces that drive OA, and the key theoretical findings implicate the molecular details of the solution in response to the anisotropy of the crystal in determining driving forces for assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fundamental understanding arising from this study will affect phenomena beyond OA such as aggregation/disaggregation, and contraction and swelling of soil minerals in response to wetting cycles, which are largely driven by the interplay of interfacial and hydrodynamic forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Tip_Fabrication_and_Force_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crystallographically oriented face-specific AFM mica tips with a (001) plane for a force probe were fabricated using focused ion-beam milling (Helios NanoLab 600i, FEI) and microlithography methods (see SI Appendix for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mica single crystal as substrate was mounted on the AFM substrate holder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force measurements were performed with a commercial AFM (MFP3D or Cypher, Asylum Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adhesion forces (or rupture forces) were determined by a cantilever deflection and calibrated spring constant of the cantilever.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retract velocity was changed after every approach/retract cycle (keeping the approach velocity constant) to obtain a distribution of the adhesion forces at different loading rates, ranging from 2 to 150 nN/s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 25100 measurements were taken at each loading rate, the dwell time of the tip with the substrate was 36 s, and an external force of a few nanonewtons was applied on the cantilever before pulling away.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry of the tip and substrate contact remains constant during the rotation of the substrate, and it does not influence the effect of crystal orientation on Fad between mica surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the orientation-dependent interactions, a rotation stage was mounted on the substrate holder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrate was rotated from 0° to 360° while the orientation of the AFM cantilever tip was fixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mismatch angle was recorded for one set of experiments (see SI Appendix for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spring constants of all cantilevers were calibrated by the thermal fluctuation method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements presented here were performed with two different cantilevers with spring constants of 50 and 700 pN/nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All measurements were performed at room temperature unless noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, unless noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fad was determined at a pH of 5.6 ± 0.1 for a range of tip retraction rates, NaCl concentrations (0100 mM), electrolyte species (NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2), relative tipsubstrate rotation angles (0360°), and temperatures (1545 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mismatch angle was kept constant during the measurement while changing the salt concentration, temperature, and ionic species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For more detailed information please see SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
