Atomic structure of granulin determined from native nanocrystalline granulovirus using an X-ray free-electron laser  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The room temperature structure of natively formed protein nanocrystals consisting of 9,000 unit cells has been solved to 2 Å resolution using an unattenuated X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) beam, representing, by far, the smallest protein crystals used for protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiation damage limits structure determination from protein crystals using synchrotron techniques, whereas femtosecond X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers enable much higher tolerable doses, extracting more signal per molecule, allowing the study of submicrometer crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiation-sensitive features, such as disulfide bonds, are well resolved in the XFEL structure despite the extremely high dose (1.3 GGy) used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of signal levels obtained in this experiment indicates that structure determination from even smaller protein crystals could be possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand how molecules function in biological systems, new methods are required to obtain atomic resolution structures from biological material under physiological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intense femtosecond-duration pulses from X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) can outrun most damage processes, vastly increasing the tolerable dose before the specimen is destroyed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn allows structure determination from crystals much smaller and more radiation sensitive than previously considered possible, allowing data collection from room temperature structures and avoiding structural changes due to cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, high-resolution structures obtained from XFEL data mostly use crystals far larger than 1 m3 in volume, whereas the X-ray beam is often attenuated to protect the detector from damage caused by intense Bragg spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe the 2 Å resolution structure of native nanocrystalline granulovirus occlusion bodies (OBs) that are less than 0.016 m3 in volume using the full power of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and a dose up to 1.3 GGy per crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystalline shell of granulovirus OBs consists, on average, of about 9,000 unit cells, representing the smallest protein crystals to yield a high-resolution structure by X-ray crystallography to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The XFEL structure shows little to no evidence of radiation damage and is more complete than a model determined using synchrotron data from recombinantly produced, much larger, cryocooled granulovirus granulin microcrystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measurements suggest that it should be possible, under ideal experimental conditions, to obtain data from protein crystals with only 100 unit cells in volume using currently available XFELs and suggest that single-molecule imaging of individual biomolecules could almost be within reach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Granulovirus OBs contain a single virion surrounded by a crystalline protein layer that diffracts to high resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Powder X-ray diffraction from a pellet of granulovirus OBs at 100 K (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein diffraction rings extend to a resolution between 3 and 3.5 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detector panels on the left with enhanced contrast show evidence of diffraction at even higher resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resolution rings are shown at 4, 3.5, and 3 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Freeze etch electron micrograph showing the uniform size distribution of the particles (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Cryo-EM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of four 20 e/Å2 exposures shows the effects of radiation damage on granulovirus OBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystalline lattice is visible only in the first image and hydrogen gas bubbles produced by radiolysis eventually reveal the virion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Scale bar, 100 nm.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
XFEL_Data_Collection_and_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Granulovirus OBs were produced in C. pomonella larvae, purified, and injected into the XFEL beam using a gas dynamic virtual nozzle (GDVN) (3133) at a concentration of 1013 particles per mL in water at a temperature of 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 1.5 million detector frames were collected (3.5 h of data collection) during experiment L767 using the CXI microfocus instrument at LCLS, from which 487,184 crystal diffraction patterns were identified as crystal diffraction hits in the data-processing step using Cheetah (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained a complete dataset to 2 Å resolution merged from 82,603 indexed crystal diffraction patterns, with an overall Rsplit of 7.89%, demonstrating the overall internal consistency of the data (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observe that 1% of the indexed diffraction patterns contained visible diffraction peaks extending to the corners of the detector at 1.9 Å resolution (see example in Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals are randomly distributed in the 34-µm diameter liquid stream, and the XFEL beam is focused to a 1.3-µm FWHM spot, surrounded by a much larger but less intense halo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, many of the observed patterns are probably due to particles that only partially intersect the brightest part of the XFEL beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate that for uniformly distributed 200 × 200 × 400 nm3 spheroids at the concentration and flow rate used (34 L/min) in these experiments, the expected diffraction intensity distribution would have a larger contribution from exposures with weak illumination, where the crystal is hit by the X-ray beam outside its FWHM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although granulovirus particles have a narrow size distribution, there is a 12% outlier fraction of larger crystals (Fig S1) that may also have contributed to the strongest diffraction peaks at high resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CrystFEL data processing suite provides an estimated resolution limit of each diffraction pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude the possibility that the high-resolution signal was entirely derived from the small population of larger crystals, we identified patterns that extended beyond 2.5 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excluding those patterns did not appreciably alter the structure or other merging figures of merit, leading us to conclude that the structure was indeed derived from the whole population of measured crystals and not dominated by a few strong patterns from outlier larger crystals (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the remaining 99% of the indexed diffraction patterns showed little evidence of diffraction beyond 3 Å resolution, averaged data from thousands of patterns revealed that granulovirus OBs diffract to at least 2 Å resolution, limited by detector distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2A we show 25 × 25 pixel regions of 225 detector frames centered at the predicted location of reflection 21 26 29 after first accounting for an indexing ambiguity (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reflection was predicted to occur in 3,176 frames in the dataset and corresponds to 2.3 Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sum of the pixel regions from all 3,176 detector frames is shown in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar improvement occurred in all peaks in this resolution shell, and Fig 2C shows the dependence of signal-to-noise ratio of reflections in the highest resolution shell on the number of patterns included in the dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Averaging over thousands of patterns (Fig S4) significantly improved data quality, revealing Bragg peaks not visible in individual patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structure_Determination_of_Granulin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The granulin structure was determined from the XFEL data by molecular replacement using a search model based on Wiseana nucleopolyhedrovirus (WNPV) polyhedrin [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 3JVB] (28), which shares 51.6% overall sequence identity (69.0% overall sequence similarity determined with EMBOSS Needle and the EBLOSUM62 matrix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Automatic model building followed by iterative refinement led to a final model with Rwork/Rfree (%) of 14.9/19.0 to a resolution of 2.0 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is referred to below as SFX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SFX structure was compared with a previously determined structure (referred to as SYN) obtained by molecular replacement using the same 3JVB model and 1.66 Å resolution synchrotron data from 21 recombinant 5-µm CpGV granulin crystals collected at beamline X06SA at the Swiss Light Source (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall SFX electron density is well defined, which allowed all but the five N-terminal residues to be modeled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cryocooled SYN structure, 24 of the 248 residues could not be modeled (residues 112 of the N terminus and loop residues 177188) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Granulin_Structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The central part of the granulin structure consists of a compact -sandwich, with two additional -helices H2/3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perpendicular to the main body, granulin shows an extruding N terminus, perpendicular to the central part, beginning with a short -hairpin structure, followed by a long, bent -helix H1 (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Granulin shows a high level of structural similarity to WNPV polyhedrin (PDB ID code 3JVB), with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.634 Å across 173 C positions (28), as expected from sequence homology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, three flexible loop regions in the central part (146149, 176190, 200207) as well as several residues at the N terminus (613, 4143) are well defined in the XFEL granulin structure (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4) but are completely absent in the WNPV polyhedrin structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Sample_Preparation_of_in_Vivo_Grown_Granulovirus_OBs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
OBs of CpGV (Mexican strain) were produced by infection of fourth instar larvae of C. pomonella and purified as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, OBs from raw larval homogenates or from commercial preparations were filtered through cotton wool and repeatedly washed by centrifugation (18,000 g, 30 min) followed by resuspending the pellet in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentrated OB suspension was then purified using a discontinuous glycerol gradient 3080% (vol/vol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OB band was collected, resupended in water, and pelleted again (3,200 × g, 45 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the required purity was not achieved, the glycerol gradient purification was repeated once.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collected OBs were three times washed by centrifugation (3,200 g, 45 min) followed by resuspending the pellet in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OB suspension was stored at 18 °C until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Size_Estimate_of_Granulovirus_OBs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Close inspection of electron micrographs like Fig 1 revealed occasional larger particles with a similar shape and rare elongated particles with similar diameter but up to five times longer than average granulovirus particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the possibility that these larger particles may dominate the SFX dataset, we needed unbiased size distribution statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a system to dry particles from a thin liquid layer on glow-discharged carbon-coated electron microscope grids so that most of the particles are oriented with the long axis approximately parallel to the grid surface and made low-magnification images like that shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) to trace the outlines of all of the particles in these images and Python scripts to estimate particle crystal volumes from fitted ellipse outlines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Powder_Diffraction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CpGV OBs in water were pelleted using a bench top centrifuge and the pellet resuspended in an equal volume of ethylene glycol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant slurry was applied to a MiteGen grid and allowed to dry before cooling by insertion into a 100 K cryostream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grid was exposed for 15 s to a flux of 1.56 × 1012 0.97 Å photons per s focused to 80 × 40 microns using the X06SA beamline at the Swiss Light Source synchrotron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detector used was a Pilatus 6M at a camera length of 630 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated exposures did not show evidence of radiation damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Collection_for_Synchrotron_Structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recombinantly grown CpGV granulin crystals in 50% (vol/vol) ethylene glycol were applied to Mitegen 400/50 mesh grids and cooled in liquid nitrogen before transfer to the cryostream at the MD2 microdiffractometer (Maatel) used for data collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diffraction data for recombinant CpGV granulin at 100 K were collected in 1° rotations from beamline PXI (X06SA) of the Swiss Light Source, Switzerland, with synchrotron radiation (1012 photons per s, beam size of 5 × 15 m2 FWHM) at a wavelength of 1.0 Å (0.02% bandwidth) using a Mar225 CCD detector (MarResearch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were indexed and integrated with XDS (37), scaled and merged with AIMLESS (38), and converted to structure factor amplitudes with CTRUNCATE (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Merging statistics were calculated with phenix.merging_statistics (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure was determined and refined in the same manner as the XFEL structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high-resolution limit of 1.66 Å for the SYN structure as well as the 2 Å for the SFX structure was determined by paired-refinement and correlation coefficient analysis, ensuring CCwork or CCfree did not exceed CC* across the full resolution range (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Collection_by_SFX  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SFX experiments with CpGV OBs were carried out at the CXI instrument of LCLS (beamtime ID: L767), at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LCLS X-ray beam with an estimated pulse duration of 50 fs and a photon energy of 7.9 keV was focused using X-ray optics in a KirkpatrickBaez geometry to a beam size of about 1.3 × 1.3 m2 FWHM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average pulse energy was 2.7 mJ, and the pulse repetition rate was 120 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Granulovirus OBs were injected as a liquid suspension into the X-ray interaction region as a liquid jet formed by a gas-focused nozzle (3133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this system, the liquid suspension was pushed through a 50-m inner diameter capillary to subsequently form a jet of about 34 m diameter at the interaction region by the action of a coaxially flowing helium stream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow rate of the sample was 1015 L/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Granulovirus OB settling was prevented by the use of an antisettling sample-delivery instrument (42) equipped with syringe-temperature control (set to 20 °C) for injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velocity of the jet was sufficient to fully replenish the sample between X-ray pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffraction data were collected on CSPAD (43), a multipanel detector consisting of 64 individual tiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detector was set to a distance of 130 mm, giving a maximum diffraction resolution of 1.88 Å at its corner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SFX_Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individual hits, defined as diffraction patterns containing more than 20 Bragg peaks with a signal-to-noise larger than 6, were identified using the software Cheetah (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average hit rate fluctuated between 10% and 60% during the experiment, for a total of 487,085 frames containing crystal diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of them showed diffraction to the corner of the detector (Fig S2 as an example).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these patterns, 82,603 were indexed using CrystFEL (17) (version 0.5.2+93d0472).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Granulin crystals belong to space group I23, a space group with arbitrary choice of two different orientations of the unit-cell axes that are compatible with a particular set of Bragg peak locations in the diffraction pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ambiguity can be overcome by examining the relative intensities of the Bragg peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SFX, this is complicated by the unknown degree of partiality of the recorded Bragg peaks and other sources of error in the individual intensity measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indexing ambiguity was resolved using the CrystFEL ambigator tool (44), which uses an algorithm related to that devised by Brehm and Diederichs (45), comparing the average Pearson correlation between a single diffraction pattern and every other in the dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, approximately half of the 82,603 frames (42,143) were initially indexed inconsistently and were corrected according to the average correlation coefficients (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bragg peaks were integrated using the Monte Carlo approach as implemented in CrystFEL (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averaged intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes by Xdsconv (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 shows the quality of the final dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Molecular replacement was performed using Phaser (47) using a search model of a homologous polyhedrin with 52.5% sequence identity (PDB ID code 3JVB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial model was subjected to automatic model building using phenix.autobuild (48), followed by iterative cycles of manual model (re)building using Coot (49) and refinement with phenix.refine (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive difference density in five previously undefined regions was identified, which enabled us to model a loop region of 15 residues (176190; KKGFAFPLTCLQSVY); residues 4143 (IRE), 146149 (AHPD), and 200207 (DVLWPYFY); and additional 8 residues (613; SLRYSRHD) at the N terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All residues of the granulin amino acid sequence but the first five at the N terminus were defined by electron density and were included in the final model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PISA (51) was used to calculate the biological assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron density maps were generated with Phenix (50), and figures were generated with Pymol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high-resolution limit (2 Å) was determined by paired-refinement and correlation coefficient analysis, ensuring CCwork or CCfree did not exceed CC* across the full resolution range (41), as for the synchrotron structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cryo-EM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Granulovirus OBs at a concentration of 1 × 1011 OBs per mL were adsorbed to glow-discharged lacey-carbon on 300 mesh copper grids (Ted Pella).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30-s incubation, the grid was blotted for 2 s using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI Company) and then immediately plunge-frozen into liquid ethane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was imaged on a Philips CM200 (FEI Company) transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV equipped with a TemCam-F416 (TVIPS) CCD detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were collected at a nominal magnification of 50,000× corresponding to a 2.14 Å pixel size and a defocus of around 2.5 m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diffraction simulations were performed using the MOLTRANS software package, developed by E. Weckert (DESY  available upon request).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MOLTRANS calculates the scattered amplitude from each atom of the structure arriving at each pixel of the detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex-valued wavefield scattered from all atoms in one individual unit cell is first calculated, from which the wavefield from the entire crystal is determined through a coherent summation that takes the relative positions of different unit cells in the crystal into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity at the detector has to be scaled according to the incident pulse flux density and the detection efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incident flux density depends on the pulse energy, the beamline transmission from the position of the pulse energy monitor (60%, depending on KB mirror efficiency), and the area of the beam at the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the pulse energy and the overlap of the beam with the sample varies from shot to shot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, simulations were compared with the brightest patterns to find the photon flux in the center of the beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the patterns with very narrow Bragg peaks, corresponding to the particles with a diameter greater than 400 nm, were excluded from this analysis to avoid attributing the effect of the brightest patterns to the small fraction of bigger granulovirus OBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such analysis suggests that the X-ray flux density was close to 1012 photons per µm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These simulations deliberately omit background scattering and assume an ideal overlap of 1012 photons in a 1-m2 top-hat X-ray focus with the sample during the exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two different simulations were performed: (i) one dataset calculated for a crystal of 9,000 unit cells, which was used for comparison with the collected data (Fig S5A), and (ii) one dataset calculated for a very small crystal of spherical shape consisting of 123 unit cells (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For dataset 2, we generated more than 5,000 diffraction patterns from these crystals in random orientation and indexed those (4,350 indexed from 5,043).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that indexing was successfully achieved on individual diffraction patterns indicates that such small crystals should be of sufficient size for high-resolution structure determination, given noise-free and background-free detection of the X-ray diffraction patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using submicron-sized (0.01 m3) naturally occurring granulovirus OBs, where each particle contains only 9,000 unit cells, we have determined the room-temperature structure of granulin to 2-Å resolution using X-ray pulses that imparted a dose of up to 1.3 GGy per crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the high dose applied and the small size of the crystals, we obtained a structure of CpGV granulin with good crystallographic statistics (Table 1), revealing features that are absent in the structure of recombinant granulin (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final dataset contained 82,603 indexed diffraction patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis clearly shows that averaging over more diffraction patterns improves all figures of merit (Fig S4), with an improvement of signal-to-noise ratio increasing with the square root of the number of patterns (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 82,603 crystals contributing to the final dataset represent a maximum probed crystalline volume of less than 900 m3, equivalent to a single cube-shaped crystal of 10 m per side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Room-temperature measurement from a single large crystal of equivalent volume using conventional (rotation) data collection would be severely limited in resolution and completeness, because of radiation-induced damage accumulating over many exposures of a single crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposing many small crystals to femtosecond-duration X-ray pulses using serial crystallography is possible because of the tolerance of a much higher dose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the high dose per crystal used in the SFX measurements, we looked for evidence of predicted local radiation damage (13, 14) in the vicinity of radiation-sensitive disulfide bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 shows that the disulfide bond between the two Cys135 molecules is largely intact in the SFX structure (occupancy 0.68), indicating that the structure is preserved even at sites of atoms that are strongly photo-absorbing, such as sulfur, despite the high dose used in the SFX experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This 2-Å structure, obtained from 0.01 m3-size crystals, raises the following question: How small is the smallest crystal that could be studied at an XFEL facility?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the crystal size diminishes, so too does the intensity of the Bragg spots, and thus the size of the smallest crystal depends on the number of patterns that can be measured and indexed to build up a sufficiently accurate estimate of the integrated intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that indexing can be carried out, two other parameters that determine the ability to accurately estimate structure factors are the incident pulse flux density and the background level of the diffraction pattern (e.g., from scattering from the jet carrier liquid).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further study this scaling, we simulated diffraction patterns from a perfect granulin crystal of 9,000 unit cells (Materials and Methods) and compared the average Bragg peak counts from individual diffraction patterns with our measured data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this comparison we conclude that the incident flux density was of the order of 1012 photons per 1 µm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second simulation using the same beam parameters and zero background shows that a crystal of 123 unit cells would be sufficient to produce indexable diffraction patterns using the same dose of 1.3 GGy (Fig S5) and that these data could be assembled into a complete high-resolution dataset given a sufficient number of measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the same beam parameters and focus size, it might therefore be possible to study crystals with 100 times smaller volume than those studied here, containing as few as 123 unit cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Going further, these rough estimates indicate that single-molecule imaging of a protein of molecular weight equal to one unit cell of granulin would require at least a 10010,000-fold increase in X-ray peak flux density incident on a single unit cell to obtain continuous diffraction pattern with comparable numbers of scattered photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, single-molecule diffraction would require reducing the background scattering to much lower levels than achieved in serial crystallography measurements with a liquid microjet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the goal is to achieve background-free injection, where photon-counting statistics are predicted to become the dominant source of error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, detector performance must be sufficiently well controlled to detect the presence of these particles and determine their orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A factor of 100 increase in X-ray intensity (which would impart a dose of 100 GGy) can in principle already be delivered in the 100-nm FWHM focus chamber of the CXI instrument under ideal conditions and perfect focus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simple scaling calculations indicate that at least a perfect focus, background-free measurements, and a noise-free detector capable of measuring single photons would be needed to perform single-molecule imaging of larger molecular weight macromolecules at LCLS, properties that are yet to be satisfied both individually and simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under the described limitations and assumptions, it should be possible to reach the border between crystallography and the field of single-particle X-ray imaging at ambient temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further increasing the flux density in parallel with improved signal-to-noise ratio of the data will open completely novel routes to structure determination of biological molecules at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short pulses available from free-electron lasers allow structure determination from crystals much smaller or more radiation sensitive than previously considered possible for study by X-ray diffraction as well as time-resolved experiments on the ultrafast timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
