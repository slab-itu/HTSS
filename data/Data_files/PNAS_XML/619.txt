EHD2 restrains dynamics of caveolae by an ATP-dependent, membrane-bound, open conformation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The EHD2 protein controls the association of membrane pits termed caveolae to cell surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caveolae are implicated in muscle, pulmonary, and lipid disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We establish functionally, and structurally, how EHD2 cycles between an active, membrane-bound state and an inactive state in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present an approach to resolve the structure of proteins in their membrane-bound state, which is difficult to obtain otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A dramatic conformational change of EHD2 upon membrane binding is demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATP binding is required for partial membrane insertion and subsequent oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In solution, internal regulatory regions inhibit the conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stringently regulated mechanistic cycle might be prototypical for a large family of proteins involved in membrane fission and may open avenues to control the process in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The EH-domaincontaining protein 2 (EHD2) is a dynamin-related ATPase that confines caveolae to the cell surface by restricting the scission and subsequent endocytosis of these membrane pits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, EHD2 is thought to first bind to the membrane, then to oligomerize, and finally to detach, in a stringently regulated mechanistic cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is still unclear how ATP is used in this process and whether membrane binding is coupled to conformational changes in the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the regulatory N-terminal residues and the EH domain keep the EHD2 dimer in an autoinhibited conformation in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By significantly advancing the use of infrared reflectionabsorption spectroscopy, we demonstrate that EHD2 adopts an open conformation by tilting the helical domains upon membrane binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that ATP binding enables partial insertion of EHD2 into the membrane, where G-domainmediated oligomerization occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATP hydrolysis is related to detachment of EHD2 from the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate that the regulation of EHD2 oligomerization in a membrane-bound state is crucial to restrict caveolae dynamics in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Membrane_Insertion_of_EHD2_Requires_ATP_Binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the first step in the mechanistic cycle of EHD2, the binding of purified wild-type or mutated EHD2 to a lipid monolayer was studied in an adsorption trough.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For preparation of the monolayer, we used a lipid composition of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (sodium salt) (POPS)/l--phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (porcine brain, ammonium salt) [PI(4,5)P2], known to bind EHD2 (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EHD2 was preincubated with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP to mimic ATP-binding conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injection of AMP-PNPbound EHD2 under the equilibrated lipid monolayer resulted in an immediate steep rise in surface pressure (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that the protein spontaneously adsorbs to and partially inserts into the planar lipid monolayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, with an excess of ADP in the protein solution, the surface pressure increased only slightly (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that ATP is required for EHD2 to bind to membranes by partial insertion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the mutants, where the EH domain (EHD2 EH 1404) or the N terminus together with the EH domain (EHD2 NEH, 19404) were deleted, bound to the membrane in a nucleotide-dependent manner similar to the wild-type protein (Fig 1B and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These domains are thus not essential for membrane insertion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ATP-Dependent_Oligomerization_of_EHD2_Is_Mediated_via_the_Loop_in_the_G_Domain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies have suggested that oligomers of EHD2 on caveolae membranes restrain caveolar dynamics (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To refine our understanding of the proposed oligomerization of EHD2 on lipid membranes in vitro, we developed an assay based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) that detects oligomerization over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, a cysteine residue was introduced at position 474 in the EH domain (Fig 1A) in an EHD2 variant devoid of the three internal cysteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both cysteines 474 of the EHD2 dimer were then fluorescently labeled by the same partner of the FRET-pair Alexa 488 or Alexa 594 (Förster radius dFRET, 60 Å), yielding two populations of differently labeled EHD2 dimers (Fig 2A), acting as donor and acceptor for FRET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mixing of the two differently labeled populations together with nucleotides did not result in any detectable energy transfer (Fig S2A), proving that there is neither an interchange of monomers between EHD2 dimers of the two populations, nor oligomerization under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the labeled protein populations were added to liposomes in the presence of ATP, a steep increase in the apparent FRET efficiency within the first 100 s was observed (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial steep rise in fluorescence intensity was confirmed by stopped-flow analysis (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that the EH domains of adjacent EHD2 dimers came into close proximity (in the range of Förster radius) upon membrane binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance between the two dyes, hence the distance between the EH domains, is consistent with an assembly of EHD2 dimers in oligomers rather than binding of isolated EHD2 dimers to the liposomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the experiment was repeated with the F122A/F128A mutant that is proposed not to oligomerize, the apparent FRET efficiency was markedly smaller, indicating reduced oligomerization (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We verified that the lower apparent FRET efficiency for the nonoligomerizing mutant was not due to altered ability to bind to membranes (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, wild-type EHD2 and F122A/F128A EHD2 were labeled with Alexa 555 as acceptor at position L303 in the helical domain and incubated with liposomes containing 1% Marina Blue-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine lipid as donor dye (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FRET in this case is an indicator for membrane binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data showed that both wild-type EHD2 and EHD2 F122A/F128A proteins have the same propensity to bind to membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we confirmed that, in ATP-binding conditions, the F122A/F128A mutant inserts into lipid monolayers (Fig 1B) and binds to lipid bilayers (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results imply that the wild-type protein effectively oligomerizes when partially inserted into lipid membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F122A/F128A mutant binds to membranes but does not oligomerize, showing that the KPFxxxNPF loop in the G domain is important for oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also demonstrates that oligomerization is not required for membrane binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test how oligomerization at the membrane surface is influenced by nucleotide binding, we preincubated a mix of the two populations of EHD2 labeled with different Alexa dyes together with ATP, ADP, AMP-PNP, or without nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the addition of liposomes, the extent of FRET was low and independent of the type of nucleotide present (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of liposomes resulted in a marked increase in apparent FRET efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase was significantly higher in samples in the presence of ATP or AMP-PNP compared with samples incubated with ADP or without nucleotides (Fig 2 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior is consistent with our finding in the monolayer experiments (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the apparent FRET efficiency appeared to reach a plateau within 1 h in the presence of ATP but continued to rise for AMP-PNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ATP can be hydrolyzed but AMP-PNP cannot, we conclude that the total amount of oligomerized EHD2 is limited by ATP hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative increase in apparent FRET efficiency following addition of liposomes even for the samples without ATP or AMP-PNP shows that EHD2, to some degree, is capable of lipid-induced oligomerization under the in vitro conditions used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results confirm that ATP binding is necessary for membrane binding and that oligomerization is mediated via the KPFxxxNPF loop as a second step of the mechanistic cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EHD2_Inserts_into_the_Membrane_in_an_Open_Conformation_as_Determined_by_an_Analysis_Tool_for_IR_ReflectionAbsorption_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the structure of membrane-bound EHD2, we established a method based on IR reflectionabsorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hereby pioneer orientational and conformational analysis of large proteins and even oligomerizing proteins by IRRAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To acquire reflectionabsorption spectra of EHD2 in its membrane-bound state, the proteins are injected underneath a lipid monolayer assembled at an air/water interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Buffer and lipid composition as well as the initial lateral pressure are chosen to mimic natural binding conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adsorption of EHD2 to the lipid layer yields a perfectly oriented sample at the air/water interface including protein and lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRRA spectra of this surface film are recorded as a function of the angle of incidence () and the polarization (p or s) of the incoming IR light (Fig 3 A and B, and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity of the IR absorption of peptide groups depends on the angle of their transition dipole moments with respect to the direction of the incoming light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the data contain information on the orientation of all secondary structural elements with respect to the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3B shows an IRRAS data set in the amide I spectral region for EHD2 EH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This deletion mutant was investigated to reduce the complexity in the IRRAS data analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depicted amide I bands contain contributions of all secondary structures elements of EHD2 EH (18 helices, 8 -strands, unordered loops, turns).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, computed IRRA spectra based on the crystal structure of EHD2 (Fig 1A, Left) did not reproduce the experimental spectra (Fig S4), indicating a large-scale conformational change upon binding to the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain information on the nature and extent of this conformational change, we calculated theoretical IRRA spectra for many different EHD2 EH conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we assumed that each EHD2 EH monomer consists of two rigid domains, the G domain and the helical domain, with their internal structure as determined by X-ray crystallography (PDB ID code 4CID).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The internal structures of both domains are assumed to be invariant upon binding to the lipid monolayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the helical domain is allowed to reorient with respect to the G domain, with the proline 286 acting as the hinge for consecutive tilting (angle ) and twisting (angle ) rotations (as defined in Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformation of the crystal structure (PDB ID code 4CID) is chosen to be the reference for any rotation, that is, both the tilt angle  and the twist angle  of the helical domain in the crystal structure are equal to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The G domain is fixed in the orientation it would have in the crystal structure when the lowermost tips of the helical domains are inserting into the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tilt angle  and the twist angle  of the helical domain were incremented for calculating a series of IRRA spectra (Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed by theoretical calculation that the shapes and intensities of the amide I bands (all angles of incidence and both polarizations) of EHD2 EH are sensitive to the reorientation of the helical domain (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess how well the calculated spectra describe the experimental spectra, their difference is evaluated as root-mean-square deviation (rmsd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cumulative rmsd of the calculated versus experimental spectra for both polarizations and all angles of incidence is color-coded in Fig 3C (and Fig S6 A and B for alternative error definitions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate spectra calculated for many possible orientations of the helical domain, the rmsd is presented as a function of the helical domain tilt angle  and the twist angle .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A blue-colored minimum in this rmsd error map means that the spectra calculated with the respective tilt and twist angels accurately describe the experimental spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a good agreement between calculated and experimental spectra is observed for helical domain tilt angles  of 4060°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dependence of the rmsd on the twist angle  is much less pronounced, that is, there is no pronounced minimum with varying twist angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the helical domain is mainly composed of parallel -helices, and the rotation about an -helix main axis is indistinguishable by IRRAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis of the IRRA spectra shows that the most plausible conformation and orientation of membrane-bound EHD2 EH is with the G domains upright and the helical domains rotated outward (Fig 3D and Fig S7A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of IRRA spectra of wild-type EHD2 and EHD2 NEH showed that these proteins adopt an open conformation as well (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EHD2_Is_Autoinhibited_via_the_N_Terminus_and_the_EH_Domain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on previous findings, we hypothesized that the N terminus and the EH domain of EHD2 might regulate the transition from a closed autoinhibited state to the open membrane-bound state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the diameter of EHD2 loaded with AMP-PNP in solution by dynamic light scattering (DLS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrodynamic diameter was found to be 10.4 nm, which matches the theoretical diameter of an EHD2 dimer in the closed conformation (10.8 nm) (Fig 4A and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of the N terminus increased the diameter of the protein to 13.9 nm (EHD2 N in Fig 4A), which correlates with the estimated diameter of the open conformation (14.0 nm) (Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the N terminus is involved in restricting the open conformation of EHD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the N terminus and the EH domains influence the extent of membrane binding of EHD2, we examined cosedimentation of the wild-type and truncated proteins with liposomes in the presence of AMP-PNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of protein bound to liposomes was significantly increased by the individual removal of the N terminus (EHD2 N) or the EH domain (EHD2 EH) compared with wild-type EHD2 (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the deletion of both the N terminus and the EH domain (EHD2 NEH), resulted in an even higher extent of binding to liposomes (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This additive effect suggests that the removal of the regulatory regions increases the affinity to membranes by altering both the conformation and the ability of EHD2 to oligomerize.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether this effect would subsequently affect membrane curvature, proteins were incubated with liposomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amounts of tubulated liposomes were visualized using electron microscopy and quantified by counting the number of tubules per area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously shown (8), EHD2 was able to generate tubules from liposomes with a diameter of 70 nm (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our results clearly showed that the amount of tubulated liposomes was almost doubled when the liposomes where incubated with EHD2 NEH compared with wild-type EHD2 (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that removal of the N terminus and EH domain primes the protein for membrane binding and oligomerization, which facilitates membrane tubulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, oligomerization is uncontrolled, resulting in increased membrane tubulation without these protein parts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Stability_of_Caveolae_Is_Mediated_by_the_Tightly_Regulated_Mechanistic_Cycle_of_EHD2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having clarified the mechanistic cycle of EHD2, we aimed to study how EHD2 influenced caveolae in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we expressed mCherry-tagged EHD2 and truncation mutants in caveolin-GFP FlpIn cells, where the integral membrane protein caveolin 1 was used to mark caveolae (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution images, obtained by Airyscan confocal microscopy, showed that EHD2-mCherry intensity clustered around caveolae (Fig 5A, Left), in agreement with previous results (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the EHD2 NEH-mCherry mutant was detected in long tubular structures (Fig 5A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, caveolin-GFP was frequently associated with the tip of the tubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EHD2 NEH-mCherry mutant was also found in clusters in the absence of caveolae, and a large fraction of caveolae in these cells appeared to lack EHD2 NEH-mCherry (Fig 5A and Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar phenotype was observed for EHD2 N-mCherry (Fig S8 B and C), suggesting that both these deletion mutants were mistargeted to membrane areas without caveolin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed that the NEH and N deletion mutations reduced the rate and total percentage of fluorescence recovery compared with wild-type EHD2 (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that EHD2 NEH and EHD2 N were more slowly exchanged at caveolae and that the mobile fraction of the deletion mutants was decreased (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with our in vitro results, these data suggested that removal of the regulatory domains (the N terminus and the EH domain) led to uncontrolled membrane binding and oligomerization of the protein, resulting in unspecific membrane tubulation and caveolae neck elongation (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study whether the mutants were able to stabilize caveolae at the cell surface, we used live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EHD2-mCherry colocalized with assemblies of caveolin-GFP that were stably located in the plane of the membrane (Fig 5C), as previously shown (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Software tracking and quantification verified that the caveolae displayed a significantly increased duration time and lowered spatial displacement at the cell surface in cells expressing EHD2-mCherry, compared with control cells without EHD2-mCherry expression (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrarily, in cells expressing the EHD2 NEH deletion mutant, the caveolae were not stabilized and EHD2 NEH was detected as stable assemblies at the membrane even in areas lacking caveolin-GFP (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification showed that neither of the deletion mutants was able to stabilize the surface dynamics of caveolae in comparison with EHD2-mCherry (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that the intrinsic regulation of the mechanistic cycle of EHD2, accomplished by the N terminus and the EH domain, is essential for stabilizing caveolae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taking our results together, we conclude that EHD2 regulates caveolae dynamics via ATP-mediated oligomerization of an open state of the protein partially inserting into the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on our results, we propose how the membrane binding and oligomerization of EHD2 is regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EHD2 is present in an autoinhibited state in solution, which is sustained by the regulatory N-terminal regions and the EH domains (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These domains apparently prevent the formation of the open conformation and the oligomerization of EHD2 in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein binds and partially inserts into membranes in an open conformation that is formed by tilting of the helical domains and insertion of the N terminus into the membrane (step 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this conformation, the restraint on oligomerization is released, and the protein can form membrane-bound oligomers (step 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our finding that membrane binding (step 1) is only possible when ATP is bound to EHD2, we propose that ATP enables the open conformation and oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the final step of the cycle, the ATP is hydrolyzed, and the oligomers are disassembled and released (step 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The autoinhibited conformation is restored and ADP is replaced by ATP due to the high affinity and concentration of ATP in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How the hydrolysis step is regulated is not clear from our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be that a certain membrane curvature triggers ATP hydrolysis, possibly in conjunction with the regulatory EH domain and the N-terminal stretch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies of structural rearrangements in proteins at the membrane interface have been hampered by the lack of techniques providing sufficient structural details in this context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present an approach based on IRRAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique, which delivers low-resolution structural information, can be applied to membrane-bound proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample is prepared by spontaneous adsorption of the protein to a preassembled lipid monolayer at the air/water interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRRAS can be conducted at physiological temperature, at desired buffer and lipid compositions, and at low initial protein concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRRAS has previously been used to determine the orientation of short peptides in lipid monolayers (1217), and secondary-structure changes of proteins upon adsorption to various interfaces (1821).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in the shape of IRRA bands were also used to postulate protein reorientations (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we extended the analysis to accurately determine the orientation of entire domains within large peripheral membrane proteins, taking into account their internal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All possible orientations are systematically evaluated, and the complete experimental band contours are reproduced by calculated spectra with optimized spectral and geometrical parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRRAS thereby fills a gap between crystallography, NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy, as it is not limited by protein size and as it examines the membrane-bound state of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed that the crystal structure of EHD2 (PDB ID code 4CID) is not consistent with the IRRAS data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the helical domains in the membrane-bound EHD2 are tilted with respect to the crystal structure by  = 4060°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that this movement occurs around proline 286.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prolines at homologous positions in dynamins and MxA (24) mediate nucleotide-dependent conformational changes involving the straightening of the adjacent -helices (2528).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that a tilt angle of the helical domain of  = 5070° could align the helices 7 and 8 in EHD2 as well, depending on the extent of rotation about the other axes (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining these considerations with the results of the IRRAS analysis, we propose a reorientation of the helical domains by a twist of  = 4090° and a tilt of  = 4050°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The determined twist angle  can be understood as a combination of both (i) the rotation of the helical domain about their main axes and (ii) the direction of the tilting movement in the plane of the membrane (Fig S7A, Bottom Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed reorientation is in agreement with the crystal structure of the structurally related N-terminally deleted EHD4 (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The described conformational change allows the N terminus of EHD2 to be inserted into the lipid layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the amino acids in the lipid-binding motif at the lower tip of the helical domains are facing the lipid layer in the conformation proposed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the N terminus and the lipid-binding motif were previously found to insert into the lipid layer (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DLS experiments suggest that the removal of the N terminus might be sufficient to induce the open conformation in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition between open and closed state might be a dynamic equilibrium, rather than a conformational rearrangement of the helical domains that is caused by ATP binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data show that EHD2 forms oligomers and that not only the previously proposed G-domain interface (8) but also the conserved KPFxxxNPF loop in the G domain plays a role in oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea is that the assembly of EHD2 into ring-like structures creates the scaffold that generates and/or stabilizes membrane curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oligomerization was significantly enhanced in the presence of ATP, suggesting that the membrane-inserted open conformation of the EHD2 provides an optimized template for oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, under in vitro conditions, EHD2 is to some degree capable of membrane binding and oligomerization in the absence of ATP (Fig 2) (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the multiple regulatory features and structural rearrangements in EHD2 provide stringency to the mechanistic cycle of EHD2 in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This cycle implies a dual role for ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of this nucleotide enables membrane insertion in the open conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATP hydrolysis enables detachment of the protein from the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two steps allow EHD2 to oligomerize when bound to the membranes, but not in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy that is necessary to deform the membrane is defined by the bending modulus (12 kcal/mol for a typical lipid bilayer) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that this energy appears to be drawn from the association of EHD2 into membrane-bound oligomers and not from ATP hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the hydrolysis may primarily control the kinetics of the dissociation of the protein scaffold, which is important for a tight regulation of the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overexpression of EHD2 has been shown to affect the morphology of caveolae by tubulation of the caveolae neck (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we found that the removal of regulatory N termini and the EH domains appeared to greatly enhance this phenotype and increase the dynamics of caveolae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that the regulation of the formation of functional oligomers of EHD2 at the membrane is a key to controlling caveolae dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins in the dynamin superfamily of GTPases have been found to influence the stability of lipid bilayers in various ways (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although dynamins are known to promote membrane scission (31), atlastins are suggested to support membrane fusion (32) and EHDs are proposed to stabilize curved membranes (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that, within the dynamin family, G-domainmediated oligomerization and helical reorientation can be adapted to modify the equilibrium between membrane scission and fusion events or to stabilize an intermediate state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mouse EHD2 constructs (wild-type, N19-543, EH1-404, NEH19-404, L303CC96S C138S C356S, T474CC96S C138S C356S, F122A/F128A/L303CC96S C138S C356S F122A/F128A/T474CC96S C138S C356S) were expressed as N-terminal His6-tag fusion proteins in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) and purified as previously described (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fluorescent labeling, the DTT was removed from the cysteine mutants using PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten-time molar excess of Alexa 488 maleimide, Alexa 555 maleimide, or Alexa 594 maleimide (Life Technologies) was added to react with the cysteine overnight at +4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excess dye was removed by dilution followed by centrifugation in Vivaspin 4 MWCO 50,000 (Sartourius).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labeled protein was separated from uncoupled dye using PD-10 columns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were quantified by measuring the absorbance at  = 280 nm ( = 54,890 cm1M1) and at the absorption maximum of the specific fluorescence dye (AF-555:  = 555 nm,  = 155,000 cm1M1; AF-488:  = 496 nm,  = 71,000 cm1M1; AF-594:  = 590 nm,  = 73,000 cm1M1) for determination of the protein (6080 µM) and the dye concentration, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of both values yielded 1:1 (dye:EHD monomer) labeling ratios for all samples used here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The surface pressure  was recorded as a function of time using a circular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) trough (6-cm diameter, 0.3-cm depth) equipped with a filter paper Wilhelmy plate microbalance (Riegler and Kirstein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trough was thermostated at 10 °C (Julabo), and the whole setup was contained in a box to prevent temperature and humidity fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D2O buffer subphase [99.9 atom % D; Sigma-Aldrich; pD 7.0; 20 mM Hepes (high purity grade; VWR), 300 mM NaCl (pro analysis grade; Merck), 1 mM MgCl2 (pro analysis grade; Merck)] was stirred by a magnetic stirrer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DOPC, POPS, and PI(4,5)P2 (Avanti Polar Lipids) were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (3:1, vol/vol) (Sigma-Aldrich; Fisher Scientific) and a small amount of H2O to prepare mixtures (DOPC:POPS:PIP2 = 70:27:3) with a total lipid concentration of 1 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lipid mixture was spread onto the subphase to reach initial surface pressures 0 of 2025 mN/m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lipid monolayer was allowed to equilibrate for 1 h before the protein solution was injected through the film using a thin syringe needle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proteins were incubated with a 3,000-fold excess (mol) of AMP-PNP (Calbiochem) or ADP (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final protein concentration in the trough was 30 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FRET  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FRET experiments were performed in a cuvette (1-cm path length) on a Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the donoracceptor pair AF-488 and AF-594, the donor fluorophore was excited at 488 nm and emission was recorded at 518 and 615 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Marina Blue DHPE and AF555, the donor was excited at 360 nm, and emission was recorded at both 470 and 570 nm using software Cary Eclipse Scan, version 1.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For FRET analysis between liposomes and protein, wild-type EHD2 or EHD2 F122A/F128A labeled at L303C with AF-555 was titrated against liposomes made from the Folch extract of total bovine brain lipids (Sigma-Aldrich) at final concentration of 0.025 mg/mL containing 1% Marina Blue-labeled DHPE (Life Technologies) in 25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl2 along with 1 mM AMP-PNP (Calbiochem).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EHD2 wild-type or F122A/F128A labeled at T474C with AF-488 and AF-594 were mixed at 1:1 ratio in 25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl2 along with 1 mM AMP-PNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After an incubation of 600 s, Folch liposomes at a final concentration of 0.025 mg/mL were added, and after an incubation of 120 s, the apparent FRET efficiency Eapp was determined every 60 s over a time period of 600 s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In case of nucleotide influence on oligomerization, EHD2 wild type labeled at T474 with AF-488 and AF-594 was mixed either with AMP-PNP or ATP (Sigma-Aldrich) or ADP (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1 mM concentration or no nucleotide in presence of Folch liposome (0.025 mg/mL final lipid concentration) and 1 mM MgCl2, and incubated in total for 420 s, after which the apparent FRET efficiency Eapp was determined every 120 s over a time period of 3,600 s. For quantification of different nucleotide conditions, the apparent FRET efficiency Eapp was calculated after 3,600 s as mean value with an according SD resulting from three independent experiments:Eapp=IaccIdon+Iacc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The apparent FRET efficiency was calculated according to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, where Idon and Iacc indicate the fluorescence intensities of the donor and acceptor dye at the wavelength of maximum emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured peak values of fluorescence emission were corrected for background fluorescence before liposome addition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the acceptor intensities were corrected for spectral overlapping with the donor emission by fractional subtraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the FRET experiment is an ensemble method averaging single distance effects, the FRET efficiency determined in this manner is still labeled as apparent FRET efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time-dependent measurements (Fig 2 B and E) were fitted with exponential functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the fit in Fig 2B, a biexponential was applied, where an offset of Eapp = 0.035 (background FRET) at t = 0 s (addition of liposomes) was assumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yields an exemplary fit with a fast and a slow component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2E, the experimental data for each condition are fitted with a monoexponential function, where the rates for increase are in the range of 3104 to 9104 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the instrument time delay of 420 s impedes simulation of an initial fast component with sufficient reliability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fits were only used to guide the eye in the respective figures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For stopped-flow experiments, wild-type EHD2 labeled at T474C with AF-488 or AF-594, respectively, were mixed in a 1:1 ratio in 25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMP-PNP was added to the mix to yield a final concentration of 1 mM and incubated for 600 s. The acceptor fluorescence of the labeled EHD2 (AF-594) was measured when the labeled protein mixture was mixed with Folch liposomes (0.05 mg/mL) in a 1:1 ratio using a Chirascan spectrometer equipped with a stopped-flow unit (Applied Photophysics) collecting data points every 0.12 s. The measured acceptor fluorescence was mediated by FRET from the donor, which was directly excited at 488 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence intensity was recorded using a 605-nm cutoff filter (Thor Laboratories) during 120 s using the Pro-Data Chirascan software, version 4.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental fluorescence data (IFluo), measured by the stopped-flow technique, was fitted with a biexponential yielding a fast rate of 0.1 s1 and a slow rate of 37104 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IRRAS_and_Data_Reduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IRRA spectra were recorded with the equipment as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33 comprising a Bruker Vertex 70 FTIR spectrometer equipped with an A 511 reflection unit (Bruker) including the film balance trough (Riegler and Kirstein) and an external mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reflectance unit is enclosed in a container flushed with dry air to stabilize the humidity in the optical path.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trough system comprises the circular sample trough described above and a reference trough filled with buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample and reference spectra are recorded within short time intervals by alternately shuttling both troughs into the IR beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of the subphases were kept constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IR light beam was polarized linearly to be parallel (p) or perpendicular (s), and the incidence angle () was varied between 25° and 70° with respect to the normal of the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam is collected after specular reflection and guided to a narrow band MCT detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reflectanceabsorbance spectra [lg(R/R0), with R being the single beam reflectance of the sample and R0 the single beam reflectance of the reference] were recorded with a resolution of 8 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each single beam spectrum, 1,000 scans or 500 scans for p-polarized light and s-polarized light, respectively, were recorded at a scanner frequency of 80 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zero filling by a factor of 2 was applied to the resulting interferogram, before fast Fourier transformation using Blackman-Harris three-term appodization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before analysis, all spectra were set to a common baseline level by subtracting the mean intensity in the range of 1,9501,850 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each angle of incidence and polarization, three to six spectra were averaged and corrected by a spectrum of buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectra were cut from 1,500 to 1,783 cm1, and a first-order polynomial baseline was subtracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C=O stretching vibration and the amide II and amino acid side-chain contributions were fitted with a single band each and subtracted from the spectra (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pretreated experimental spectra were used for comparison with calculated spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculation_of_IRRA_Spectra_and_Comparison_with_Experimental_Spectra  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Calculation of spectra and a comparison with experimental IRRA spectra were performed using a program written by C.S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in MATLAB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, a nonlinear global fit was performed to obtain input parameters [band positions 0, and full width at half-maximum (fwhm)] related to the individual vibrational components, arising from -helices, -sheets, unfolded loops, and turns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, theoretical spectra were calculated for a large number of protein conformations using these input parameters and compared with the experimental spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual steps are described in more detail below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All reflectionabsorption spectra were calculated according to the three-layer model of Kuzmin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (34), using the optical constants of the subphase D2O as in Bertie et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35) and following the procedure as in Schwieger et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (33) to calculate spectra with multiple-bands contributions of the individual secondary-structure elements [-helices, -sheets (including one additional band for antiparallel -sheets), turns, and unstructured loops].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorption of the IR light is not isotropic, that is, it has different components in the x, y, and z directions, depending on the orientation of the respective secondary-structure elements within the monolayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectra are measured and simulated with p-polarized and s-polarized light and angles of incidence between 25° and 70° in steps of 3°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Angles between 52° and 58° were omitted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective film thickness d was fitted independently (33) to d = 2.5 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The polarizer quality is set to  = 0.007 in all simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nmax = 1.41 is the refractive index of the interfacial film in the IR spectral range and was used as reported for lipid monolayers (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DLS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hydrodynamic diameter of EHD2 wild-type and EHD2 N in presence of AMP-PNP or ADP were analyzed by Zetasizer Nano (Malvern) instrument (measurement range, 0.3 nm to 10 µm) (measuring scattered light at 173°, 630-nm light source).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins samples were passed through 0.2-m filters, and 100-L samples at 0.5 mg/mL were measured in a BRAND UV cuvettes (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each experiment consisted of 50 scans of 120 s, using StokesEinstein equation for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments were repeated twice yielding similar results regarding the main peaks: EHD2 AMP-PNP (10.4 nm, 10.4 nm), EHD2 ADP (10.4 nm, 10.3 nm), EHD2 N AMP-PNP (13.9 nm, 13.4 nm), and EHD2 N ADP (13.4 nm, 13.1 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The autocorrelation curves were fitted with software provided by the instrument manufacturer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Liposome_Cosedimentation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Folch fraction of total bovine brain lipids (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in chloroform with methanol were dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in 25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and sonicated to generate liposomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EHD2 variants (2.5 M) were mixed with 1 mM AMP-PNP and 1 mM MgCl2 before incubating with liposomes (final lipid concentration, 0.05 mg/mL) for 10 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and supernatant and pellet were analyzed by Coomassie-stained SDS/PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EHD2 wild-type and F122A/F128A were examined as above except for protein concentration of 1 M and final lipid concentration of 0.025 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_Liposome_Tubulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Folch liposomes at final concentration of 0.05 mg/mL were incubated in the presence or absence of EHD2 or EHD2 NEH (1 and 2 M each) in 25 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, along with 1 mM AMP-PNP and 1 mM MgCl2 for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples (6 L) were applied to glow discharged carbon formvar-coated EM grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and negative stained with 1.5% (wt/vol) filtered uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane morphologies were examined using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Zeiss Merlin) with STEM mode at accelerating voltage of 30 kV and probe current of 300 pA. For quantification of tubulated liposomes, five random regions on the EM grid with total area of 5 mm2 were investigated, resulting in 45 images per sample type and concentration with three replicates each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Culture_and_Transfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The caveolin 1-FlpIn T-Rex HeLa cell line was generated and maintained as previously described (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EHD2 constructs were cloned into the pmCherry-N1 vector (Clontech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection was made with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with a 10-fold and 7-fold reduction of DNA and Lipofectamine, respectively, from the manufacturers instructions, and the medium was replaced after 6 h. Caveolin 1 was induced with 0.75 ng/mL doxycycline hyclate (Sigma-Aldrich) 1 h before transfection, and the experiments were done after an additional 1218 h. For live-cell TIRF imaging, 80,000 cells were seeded on 1.5 high-tolerance glass coverslips (25 mm) (Warner Instruments), and for Airyscan confocal microscopy, 20,000 cells were seeded on 12-mm #0 coverslips (Menzel), both 24 h before the start of transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Imaging_and_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For live-cell TIRF microscopy, the media was replaced with live-cell media [DMEM high glucose, no phenol red (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (wt/vol) FBS (Invitrogen) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco)] 12 h before the start, and the cells were incubated in a live-cell growth chamber (5% CO2, 37 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired for 5 min at 3-s intervals with each fifth definitive focus using a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 inverted microscope that was equipped with an EMCCD camera iXon Ultra from ANDOR and an alpha Plan-Apochromat TIRF 100×/1.46 oil objective controlled by ZEN software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative kymographs and movies were made from TIRF imaging with ImageJ (NIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each kymograph represents a 20-m section of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For quantitative analysis of caveolin 1-GFP dynamics, hundreds of caveolin 1-GFP assemblies from individual time series were followed with the Imaris V7.5 (Bitplane) tracking mode as previously described (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least four independent movies of one or more cells were compared with control cells (only caveolin 1-GFP positive) in three independent experiments, and the data were summarized with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells examined by Airyscan confocal microscopy were washed with PBS, fixed in 3% (wt/vol) PFA for 10 min, and washed again before mounting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal images were acquired with a Zeiss Confocal LSM 800 with Airyscan, equipped with an Axio Observer.Z1 inverted microscope and a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.40 oil objective controlled by ZEN software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximum projection images were made with ImageJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FRAP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were grown and transfected as for the live-cell imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were imaged on TIRF using the Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 inverted microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions with structures positive for both caveolin 1-GFP and EHD2-mCherry were chosen, and three prebleached images were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region of interest was photobleached for 800 ms using maximum power of the 561-nm laser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FRAP of the chosen structures was measured every 5 s for a total of 45 frames.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensities of the bleached regions were corrected for background signal and photobleaching of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence intensity before bleaching was normalized to 100% and directly after bleaching to 0%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from eight bleached regions from each EHD2 construct was plotted as recovery curves using GraphPad Prism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each experiment was repeated three times independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
