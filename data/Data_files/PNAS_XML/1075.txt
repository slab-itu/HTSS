Ocean convergence and the dispersion of flotsam  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ocean currents move material released on the ocean surface away from the release point and, over time, spread it over an increasingly large area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, observations also show high concentrations of the material even after significant spreading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work examines a mechanism for creating such concentrations: downwelling of water at the boundaries of different water masses concentrates floating material at this boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hundreds of satellite-tracked drifters were released near the site of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, most of these gathered into a single cluster less than 100 m in size, dramatically demonstrating the strength of this mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Floating oil, plastics, and marine organisms are continually redistributed by ocean surface currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prediction of their resulting distribution on the surface is a fundamental, long-standing, and practically important problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dominant paradigm is dispersion within the dynamical context of a nondivergent flow: objects initially close together will on average spread apart but the area of surface patches of material does not change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this paradigm is likely valid at mesoscales, larger than 100 km in horizontal scale, recent theoretical studies of submesoscales (less than 10 km) predict strong surface convergences and downwelling associated with horizontal density fronts and cyclonic vortices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that such structures can dramatically concentrate floating material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than half of an array of 200 surface drifters covering 20 × 20 km2 converged into a 60 × 60 m region within a week, a factor of more than 105 decrease in area, before slowly dispersing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted, the convergence occurred at density fronts and with cyclonic vorticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A zipperlike structure may play an important role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyclonic vorticity and vertical velocity reached 0.001 s1 and 0.01 ms1, respectively, which is much larger than usually inferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a paradigm in which nearby objects form submesoscale clusters, and these clusters then spread apart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these effects set both the overall extent and the finescale texture of a patch of floating material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Material concentrated at submesoscale convergences can create unique communities of organisms, amplify impacts of toxic material, and create opportunities to more efficiently recover such material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ocean surface currents converge and sink at a density front separating light and heavy water, sweeping floating material to the front where it accumulates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Observations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measurements were made in February 2016 in the northern Gulf of Mexico near the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velocity of the upper 65 cm was measured by 326 satellite-tracked surface drifters, only 187 of which operated properly for longer than 14 d (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ship-based surveys of temperature, salinity, and velocity in the upper 150 m; aircraft surveys; and oceanic and atmospheric modeling (SI Materials and Methods) provided context for the drifter measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Setting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The measurements occurred in a region of strong lateral density change on the western side of the DeSoto Canyon, 60100 km from the mouth of the Mississippi River (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gradient is formed by the contrast between the fresh, cold, and light water from the Mississippi and the saltier, warmer, and denser water from the central Gulf of Mexico.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The northern edge of the Loop Current is 150 km south of the region, so the mesoscale flow is weak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, several 1050 km eddies (Fig 3A) (12) stir the two different water masses to form a complex pattern of submesoscale filaments and fronts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-resolution aircraft surveys of sea surface temperature (SST) (SI Materials and Methods) were used to overcome the limited accuracy and resolution of real-time models and satellite images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The survey in Fig 3B shows a cyclonic vortex about 10 km in diameter advecting warm and cold water into a set of fronts and filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An array of 326 drifters with a nominal spacing of 1 km was deployed here (white circles) over a period of 5 × 104 s. Here, we report on the evolution of this array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Clustering_and_Dispersion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4A shows the drifter array at the time of the last drifter deployment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is about 25 km in diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About a week later (Fig 4D), some of the drifters (colored magenta in Fig 4) have converged into a region 60 m in diameter (Fig 4E), a factor of 400 smaller, while the rest of the drifters have spread over a region roughly 100 km in diameter (mostly off the frame of the figure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the major result of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the drifters disperse over a region much larger than their initial spread, they also converge into clusters much smaller than their initial separations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4, Top, show the evolution of the array; it is a subset of the supplementary animation (SI Animation of Drifter Evolution), which gives a much better visual illustration of the converging flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the first 2 d (Fig 4 A and B), the magenta drifters circulate in several cyclonic eddies, and the uncolored drifters mostly move off to the southwest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A storm on yearday 40 disrupts the evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the next 3 d, the magenta drifters collect into a line (Fig 4C) that wraps into a cyclonic eddy only a few kilometers in diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eddy shrinks, with individual drifters spiraling inward to form a tight cluster (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cluster slowly disperses over the next few weeks (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4G shows the evolution of the distribution of drifter pair separations as a function of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their initial distribution has a single broad peak with separations of 1 to 30 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the array evolves, the distribution develops two modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some drifter separations increase, the upward-moving gray band, corresponding mostly to the separation between the magenta-colored and other drifters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is dispersion and is described well by the increase in rms separation (red line), a traditional metric (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other drifter separations decrease, the downward-moving band, corresponding to the formation of clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smallest separations occur on yearday 46 (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this time, 30% of the drifter pairs are less than 200 m apart, 62% are more than 10 km apart, and only 8% are between 200 m and 10 km apart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, the clusters slowly disperse with their peak moving to larger scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These distributions are far from Gaussian and cannot be described by the rms separation alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We separate the dispersive and convergent components by examining clusters of drifters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clusters were chosen using one of many possible clustering algorithms, agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (SI Drifter Cluster Analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cluster is defined as a group of drifters containing at least three drifters, such that the distance between drifters is less than 1 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This single-link metric was chosen to allow long linear clusters characteristic of drifters accumulating on a front; most other metrics create circular clusters not appropriate for this problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis defined 10 distinct clusters from the drifter positions on yearday 46.62 (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These included 85% of the drifters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magenta cluster was the largest (127 members).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The others contained between three and seven members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drifters converged to these clusters during the 8 d between deployment and the cluster definition time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4H isolates this convergent behavior by plotting the distribution of the separation between each drifter and the average position of its cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution is very similar to that of the lower mode of Fig 4G, moving to smaller scales until day 46 and then slowly moving to larger scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4I isolates the dispersive component by plotting the distribution of the separation between the centers of different clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution is similar to that of the upper mode of Fig 4G, monotonically moving to larger scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This analysis suggests the coexistence of submesoscale convergent structures with scales as small as a few meters embedded within and advected by the currents of larger mesoscale structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The submesoscale structures aggregate drifters into clusters, and the mesoscale separates these and the drifters within them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drifters, and by inference other floating materials, are thus distributed over a wide region while intermittently being concentrated into a small fraction of this region as seen in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Submesoscale convergence occurs within specific structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The line of drifters that forms on yeardays 40 and 41 (Fig 4 B and C) separates lighter water to the west from denser water to the east (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drifter line is thus at a front, the boundary between the two water masses, less than a kilometer in width (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The densest water (yellow) is found just east of the front, forming a dense filament that, like the drifters, wraps into the core of the eddy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These density contrasts extend to only about 80 m and are underlaid by a broader density slope supporting a velocity signal that extends to about 200 m (SI Velocity Structure of the Cyclonic Eddy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accurate measurements of divergence and vorticity are made at the front and in the eddy using the many drifters within these features (SI Estimating Vorticity and Divergence from Drifter Data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both features are convergent and cyclonic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Near the front (Fig 5 C and D) /f and /f have values of 2.1 ± 1.6 and 3.5 ± 2.1, respectively (mean and SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A day later, in the eddy (Fig 5 E and F) they become 0.5 ± 0.9 and 3.3 ± 1.6, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The drifters reveal a convergent zipper structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At yearday 42.52 (Fig 5 C and D), the line of drifters wraps around the eddy, forming a complete circle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The front of the line merges with a trailing segment in a process visually similar to the operation of a zipper fabric closure (SI Zippers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two lines of drifters intersect at an acute angle as they converge into a single line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The junction point moves in the opposite direction of the individual drifters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this convergent region, the drifters measure divergences of 2 to 6 f and cyclonic vorticities of 38 f. Ship velocity measurements through the zipper (red section in Fig 5A) confirm these large-velocity gradients (SI Zippers), and show that they coincide with the density gradients, i.e., the front, to within less than a kilometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animation (SI Animation of Drifter Evolution) shows multiple transient zipper structures surrounding the eddy, suggesting that this structure may be characteristic of strongly convergent submesoscale regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples are shown in Fig S10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, the surface convergence occurs at scales of a kilometer or smaller, with local values larger than f. It is accompanied by cyclonic vorticity of similar magnitude and large density gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characteristic structures include linear fronts that wrap into a cyclonic vortex and merge in a distinctive zipper pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Vertical_Exchange  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conservation of mass implies that surface convergences should feed subsurface downwelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bolus of lighter water at 60 m depth and 5 km in Fig 5B provides indirect evidence of such sinking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water of the same potential density, potential temperature, and salinity is present at the surface on the edges of the cyclonic vortex (dark orange in Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bolus water has the same properties as this surface water, suggesting that it originated at the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vertical velocity was directly measured using a neutrally buoyant Lagrangian float (SI Lagrangian Float) designed to follow the 3D motion of water parcels through a combination of neutral buoyancy and a large drag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertical velocity was measured by two independent methods: from the vertical motion of the float measured by on-board pressure sensors and from an upward-looking acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) that measured a profile of vertical velocity above the float.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The floats horizontal position was estimated (SI Float Navigation) from the launch and recovery positions, from the motion of nearby drifters, and by matching the density measured by the float with that measured by ship surveys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The float was deployed on the west side of the dense filament (Fig 6A, top star), moved southward at the surface (white triangles in Fig 6 A and B) along the western flank of the eddy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured water density steadily increased, implying an eastward motion of the float toward denser water (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the white square, the float left the surface, following the downward motion of the water to a maximum depth of 33.8 m (small white circle) with an average vertical speed of 1.3 cm/s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ADCP measured a similar average downward speed of 1.5 cm/s (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During its descent, the measured potential density was nearly constant (SI Lagrangian Float) so that the float followed a surface of constant potential density downward and back under the front (Fig 6B, red line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The float then slowly rose to the surface, circling eastward around the southern side of the eddy before ending its mission (lower white star in Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upward motion is due to a combination of the floats small upward buoyancy and a weak upwelling (SI Lagrangian Float).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, observations show that the surface water converging at the front sinks with vertical velocities of 12 cm/s, and flows back under the front as shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These observations support recent numerical and theoretical predictions about submesoscale structure and dynamics (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Submesoscale-resolving numerical models of ocean circulation predict surface vertical vorticity with magnitudes of many f. Cyclonic vorticity has a larger magnitude than anticyclonic, and thus occupies a smaller fraction of the surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cyclonic vorticity is concentrated into vortices and fronts visually resembling a soup of cyclonic eddies and connecting filaments embedded in a weakly anticyclonic background (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, Fig 5 and Fig S10 and the animation show the predicted large values of vertical vorticity and its concentration in cyclonic fronts and vortices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Submesoscale-resolving models predict a transfer of energy from larger scales to these submesoscale features (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfer occurs by the straining of mesoscale gradients into fronts and filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3B, 4, and 6A and the animation (Fig S5) show the presence and formation of such features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lateral density gradients in these fronts are a source of potential energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models predict that submesoscale motions release this energy (16) by preferentially moving heavy water downward and lighter water upward, i.e., a negative density flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, a dense filament is observed to sink, as predicted (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Submesoscale-resolving models predict downwelling at submesoscale fronts (8), as observed here (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the frontal vertical velocities of 102 m s1 (1,000 m d1) are much larger than the 10100 m d1 typically inferred by indirect methods (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the surface convergence, downwelling, and associated vertical exchange appear to be concentrated both at the fronts and within the cyclonic vortices into which the fronts converge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In light of the above data and analyses, we return to Fig 1 and offer an interpretation of the images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The green color in Fig 1B is due to buoyant cyanobacteria (20) that commonly form summer blooms, often toxic, on the surface of the Baltic Sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patterns in Fig 1B and the patterns of the Lgrangian Submesoscale Experiment (LASER) drifters (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4C and 5C, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10 and S5) both show long lines of high concentration spiraling into a cyclonic eddy with zippers joining the lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that the two situations are analogous, the cyanobacteria, like the drifters, are concentrated at surface convergences and thus mark the locations of downwelling at density fronts as shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistically, Baltic eddies similar to those in Fig 1B are indeed associated with lateral density gradients (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we interpret the bright lines of oil concentration in Fig 1A as marking convergence and downwelling at density fronts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The concentration of the phytoplankton bloom in Fig 1B into submesoscale convergence zones suggests that such zones may form a unique near-surface habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a convergence zone, water continually sweeps past the floating plankton, potentially renewing the supply of necessary nutrients and removing metabolic products, thereby potentially enhancing growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it similarly makes predation easier by supplying predators with concentrated prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical rise velocities (21) of cyanobacteria are 0.20.4 mm/s, much less than the interior downwelling speeds in Fig 6C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It thus seems likely that some cyanobacteria are swept downward from the convergence zone into the interior, thereby limiting the surface concentration, spreading plankton across the mixed layer, and promoting export of carbon fixed by the plankton (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These measurements demonstrate that surface convergence can dramatically concentrate floating materials in the ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magenta cluster of drifters decreases in area by a factor of about 104 from deployment to its minimal extent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An oil spill advected in the same way would increase its thickness by the same factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a spill covering a region 10 km wide and with a thickness of 10 m would converge into a region 100 m wide and have a thickness of 10 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to predict such a change would have important implications for estimating impacts and directing mitigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
