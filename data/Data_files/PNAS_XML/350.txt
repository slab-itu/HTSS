title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Visual guidance of forward flight in hummingbirds reveals control based on image features instead of pattern velocity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Birds can steer a precise course at high speed, but little is known about how they avoid collisions with surrounding objects and the ground.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We manipulated the visual environment of hummingbirds as they flew across a long chamber to evaluate how they use visual information for course control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that lateral course control is based on the vertical size of features, rather than the strategy observed in insects of regulating foreaft image velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, like insects, birds use image velocity in the vertical axis for altitude control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that in natural settings, birds may avoid collisions by monitoring the vertical size, expansion, and relative position of obstacles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Information about self-motion and obstacles in the environment is encoded by optic flow, the movement of images on the eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decades of research have revealed that flying insects control speed, altitude, and trajectory by a simple strategy of maintaining or balancing the translational velocity of images on the eyes, known as pattern velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been proposed that birds may use a similar algorithm but this hypothesis has not been tested directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the influence of pattern velocity on avian flight by manipulating the motion of patterns on the walls of a tunnel traversed by Annas hummingbirds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to prediction, we found that lateral course control is not based on regulating nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, birds closely monitored feature height in the vertical axis, and steered away from taller features even in the absence of nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For vertical course control, we observed that birds adjusted their flight altitude in response to upward motion of the horizontal plane, which simulates vertical descent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our results suggest that birds avoid collisions using visual cues in the vertical axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we propose that birds monitor the vertical extent of features in the lateral visual field to assess distances to the side, and vertical pattern velocity to avoid collisions with the ground.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These distinct strategies may derive from greater need to avoid collisions in birds, compared with small insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Birds were video-recorded in a 5.5-m-long flight tunnel to study their course control strategies (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An automated tracking system determined 3D flight trajectories from eight camera views (A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample trajectories are shown for a bird flying to the feeder and then back to the perch when both walls presented vertical gratings (B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trajectories were analyzed between meters 1 and 5 within the tunnel to exclude the take-off, feeder approach, and landing phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For illustration purposes, the bird, perch, and stimulus features are not to scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first asked if birds, like insects, steer by balancing pattern velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our first experiment manipulated the motion of vertical grating patterns on the left and right sides of the 59-cm-wide tunnel (Fig 2A) (n = 297 flights by 6 birds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grating pattern on one wall was moved at a rate of 0.34 m/s either toward or away from the feeder while the pattern on the other wall was held stationary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control treatment had stationary gratings on both sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental manipulations would have resulted in a ±17% change in nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity on one side for a bird flying at the average forward flight speed of 2.0 m/s [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8, 2.2] along the midline of the chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds using a strategy of balancing nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity are predicted to remain centered on the midline in the control condition, and to deviate laterally by about 2.5 cm in the motion treatments (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to prediction, there was no significant difference in average lateral position when comparing the treatments to the controls (all P  0.25), even though we had sufficient statistical power to detect the predicted deviation (see CIs in Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We selected a vertical stripe grating for our first experiment because it is a salient pattern for other flying animals (3, 6, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is possible that this grating pattern may have inhibited a response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this possibility, we conducted a second experiment where we manipulated the pattern velocity of dot fields (Fig 2B) (n = 860 flights by 10 birds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatments had dot patterns that moved 0.26 m/s in opposing axial directions on the left and right sides, to achieve an even greater imbalance in pattern velocity than in our first experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stationary dot-field patterns were used as the controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These treatments resulted in an 11% increase in pattern velocity on one side and an 11% decrease on the other side for a bird flying at the average forward speed of 2.2 m/s (95% CI 1.9, 2.5) on the midline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested three dot densities: 0.47, 0.95, and 1.89 dots/cm2, using 0.29-cm-wide dots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of these motion treatments significantly affected the birds lateral position as predicted (Fig 2B) (comparisons with controls, all P  0.50), even though we had sufficient power to detect the predicted deviation of 3.5 cm on average (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of our first two experiments did not support the hypothesis that birds steer to regulate nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next asked whether the hummingbirds would respond to other types of visual motion during forward flight, as they do during hover (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we conducted a third experiment in which birds were presented with horizontal gratings that moved up on both side walls, or down on both side walls, synchronously at 0.34 m/s (Fig 2C) (n = 148 flights by 5 birds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the patterns moved upward, the hummingbirds flew about 4.2 cm (95% CI 0.9, 7.6) higher in the tunnel, on average, relative to stationary controls (P = 0.02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds flew about 2.8 cm (95% CI 0.8, 6.4 cm) lower than stationary controls when patterns moved downward, although this effect was not significant (P = 0.21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that birds steer upward in response to pattern velocities that simulate descent, similar to Drosophila (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The conclusion that birds respond to vertical but not nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity seems to conflict with the results of Bhagavatula et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this pioneering study of avian visual guidance, Bhagavatula et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (11) found that budgerigars consistently steered away from a stationary vertical grating that generated strong nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if there is a fundamental difference between the visual guidance strategies of budgerigars and hummingbirds, we performed a fourth experiment with stationary horizontal and vertical gratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took advantage of hummingbirds tendency to perform many trips to the feeder to test a broad range of spatial period sizes of the gratings (Fig 3A) (n = 1,180 flights by 10 birds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allowed us to explore the hypothesis that birds might be sensitive to expansion (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger features expand faster for a given distance and approach rate (19), and thus we predicted that birds may steer further away from gratings with larger period sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Like Bhagavatula et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (11), we found that the hummingbirds steered toward horizontal gratings and away from vertical gratings, but only when the gratings had spatial period sizes of 1.15 and 2.3 cm (all P less_than 0.004).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatments with smaller (0.58 cm) and larger (4.6, 9.2, and 18.4 cm) grating period sizes did not cause any significant deviation away from the vertical stripes (all P  0.29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of effect of the smallest period size may be because the birds flew fast enough for the vertical stripes in this treatment to fuse as a result of motion blur, such that the vertical grating could not be resolved (Fig 3B; also see SI Appendix and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertical gratings with a spatial period smaller than 3 cm may have fused for a considerable proportion of the trip, depending on a birds forward flight speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, birds never flew fast enough for the vertical stripes to fuse with the largest grating period sizes (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of effect in these treatments must therefore be because the birds steered away from the large-period horizontal gratings, or because they were less repelled by the large-period vertical gratings [which have a lower spatial frequency (3, 6)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test these two visual guidance strategies, we conducted a fifth experiment examining all possible combinations of horizontal and vertical stripe gratings with intermediate (2.3 cm) and large (18.4 cm) period sizes (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results revealed a strong influence of the period size of the horizontal grating (Fig 4A and Movie S2) (n = 474 flights by 6 birds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we observed a strong steering response when the horizontal grating had a 2.3-cm period (all P less_than 0.0001), but this effect was diminished when the horizontal grating had an 18.4-cm period (P = 0.02 and P  0.99 for vertical period sizes 18.4 and 2.3 cm, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the difference between the two horizontal gratings was highly significant (P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there was no significant difference between the two vertical gratings (P = 0.06), and if anything, the birds were more repelled by the vertical grating with the larger period size (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this experiment demonstrated that birds steer away from horizontal gratings with larger period sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior was confirmed in additional treatments with gratings that had the same orientation on both sides (Fig 4B) (n = 236 flights by 6 birds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we observed that hummingbirds steered away from horizontal gratings with a larger period size (Fig 4B) (P less_than 0.001), even in the absence of nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity (Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our other results, there was no significant tendency to steer toward either of the vertical gratings tested (Fig 4B) (P = 0.08).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on previous studies of insects and budgerigars, we hypothesized that pattern velocity would influence how birds steer during forward flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of our first two experiments did not support this hypothesis or the specific prediction that hummingbirds would steer to regulate nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity (Fig 2 A and B and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did find that the birds responded to pattern velocity in the vertical axis, indicating that pattern velocity may be used for altitude control to avoid collisions with the ground (Fig 2C) (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our fourth and fifth experiments revealed that lateral steering is instead guided by a mechanism that appears to be based on feature size: the birds steered away from features that had a greater vertical extent (i.e., height), including vertical stripe gratings and horizontal gratings that had a large period size (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4 and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What visual response mechanism could lead to this strategy for lateral course control?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that birds use visual expansion for distance estimation (18, 21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expansion, another type of optic flow, is defined as the change in image size as an object or feature is approached, and the rate of expansion increases more rapidly for larger features (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thought that birds use expansion is used for a variety of deceleration and interception behaviors (2326), and it has been experimentally shown that expansion influences the ability of hovering birds to hold station (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, the birds may have evaluated expansion of features on the side walls during slight lateral oscillations in flight: for example, when they were halfway to the feeder, the hummingbirds moved laterally at up to ±0.1 m/s on average (SI Appendix, Table S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons that compute expansion have been identified in the nucleus rotundus of the pigeon brain, part of the tectofugal pathway (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This same nucleus also contains cells that respond to expansion scaled by apparent size (equal to 1/, where  is the time-to-collision) and expansion scaled by an exponential function of apparent size (known as ) (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cues can inform an animal about the nearness in time of an impending collision, triggering an appropriately timed response without knowledge of the true size or distance of the approaching object (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was recently discovered that the zebra finch nucleus rotundus also contains cells that respond during simulated flight if an approaching feature is located at the point of expansion, suggesting that the tectofugal pathway may also be involved in flight control (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, the birds steered toward positions that would have reduced feature expansion, , in the vertical axis resulting from any additional lateral deviation (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In treatments with the same pattern on both sides, the birds remained on average centered over the midline (Fig 5D; see the SI Appendix for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that the birds were not necessarily attracted to the fine horizontal gratings, suggesting instead that they may have been less repelled by them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional experiments are needed to test whether lateral course control is indeed based on our proposed mechanism of expansion reduction (because smaller features do not expand as rapidly) (Fig 5), as opposed to an attraction effect or an effect of feature size independent of expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the avian visual system may be tuned to particular feature sizes or spatial frequencies that may be easy to resolve visually and track (5, 18, 29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies that directly manipulate expansion are needed to test these alternatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another question is whether this differs across bird species with diverse visual systems and flight styles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results do not rule out the use of pattern velocity altogether.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we suggest that birds use vertical pattern velocity to maintain flight altitude, similar to Drosophila (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that we might have been able to observe an effect of nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity on lateral course control with much larger manipulations, or manipulations in other parts of the visual field [e.g., ventral (8)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that like the hummingbirds in our study, the budgerigars and honey bees in other studies also had extensive experience in the flight chamber (6, 11, 12), and both birds and bees are capable of sophisticated spatial memory and mapping (10, 3133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike previous studies, our results conclusively demonstrate that birds use the vertical extent (i.e., height) of features in the lateral visual field to guide flight, even in the absence of strong nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity cues (Fig 4 and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding has implications for studies across other taxa: a tendency to steer away from vertical gratings does not necessarily imply a response to nasal-to-temporal pattern velocity (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, our findings suggest that birds control forward flight by monitoring changes in the vertical axis: specifically, the height of features and vertical pattern velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with other laboratory studies showing that flying birds rapidly stabilize key features in their visual field (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In nature, collisions may be avoided by monitoring changes in the apparent size of features (22), such as trees and branches, as well as changes in the vertical position of those features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our experiments focused on manipulating a limited number of cues, we do not suggest that these represent the only visual guidance strategies used by birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the birds in our study and in previous studies could avoid collisions despite a variety of visual patterns (Movie S2) (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birds may also monitor and stabilize features in the frontal optic flow field (1, 22, 26, 36), which in our study would have included features such as the perch, feeder, and edges of the rectangular end walls of the chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural scenes provide an even richer mosaic of optic flow cues for distance estimation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expansion may be especially useful in this context (27), because most natural objects are large enough that the expansion rate rises very rapidly even at slow approach velocities (e.g., 0.1 m/s in Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The discovery of a visual guidance algorithm based on the vertical extent of features in the lateral visual field leads to exciting new questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there have been multiple experiments with insects that demonstrate different mechanisms of forward flight control, the manipulations presented here represent a unique set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, an experiment comparing horizontal grating period sizes (Fig 4) has not been performed with insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we do not know if their visual guidance of forward flight is also influenced by the vertical extent of features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key distinction between fruit flies (1 mg), honey bees (100 mg), and especially hummingbirds (4,000 mg) is that the magnitude of change in momentum during a collision is much greater for birds, because of their larger body mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, explains why bumblebees and other insects often collide with vegetation (37, 38), whereas collisions are a major source of mortality in birds (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences in the risk of damage may lead to different visual guidance strategies, in addition to divergent sensory and neurobiological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the most intriguing results across visual guidance studies in insects is that different algorithms are used to control different flight modes (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16 and 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because hummingbird flight is very amenable to study in the laboratory, this presents a powerful opportunity to determine if feature size in general and image expansion in particular are used for guiding different flight modes or restricted to only some aspects of forward flight control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that these questions about visual guidance behavior will also stimulate further research in systems neuroscience that can confirm the proposed mechanisms at a cellular level (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eighteen adult male Annas hummingbirds (Calypte anna) were caught in Vancouver, BC, Canada between March 2014 and April 2015 and housed individually (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures were approved by the University of British Columbia Animal Care Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Rig  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The flight tunnel consisted of an aluminum frame with acrylic side walls (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interior acrylic surface was coated in a frosted window covering (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulus images were back-projected by six ultrashort-throw DLP projectors (NEC U310w; 120-Hz refresh rate) outside the tunnel (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two separate video cards (2GB MSI GeForce GT 640) and splitters (360 MHz VGA) were used to link three projectors on each side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These displays were synchronized by Psychtoolbox-3 (40) for Matlab (Mathworks R2013b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The floor of the tunnel was gray linoleum and the ceiling was nylon netting to permit filming from above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The walls at each end were covered in white paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We positioned the feeder and a 10-cm-wide perch 15 cm below the ceiling of the tunnel at either end (Fig 1A) on the midline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pilot studies indicated that birds would not descend much lower, as hummingbirds prefer to fly and perch several meters above the ground.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulus animations were projected over a depth of 37 cm (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The walls were blank below the stimulus to facilitate tracking by overhead cameras.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a bird at the average cruising altitude of 1.5 m on the midline, the stimulus subtended 57° vertically on each side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds never collided with the walls of the chamber during experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Stimuli  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stimulus animations were controlled using Psychtoolbox-3 (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used red because the DLP projectors produce white by sequentially flashing each of the red-green-blue (RGB) primaries at 120-Hz intervals, and at the outset of this study we did not know that the temporal resolution of Annas hummingbird vision is below 70 Hz (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red was chosen to stimulate the long-wavelength and double-cone photoreceptors involved in motion processing (41) and avian flight behavior (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For stripe gratings (50% red and 50% black), the average luminance of red features was 8.7 cd/m2 (95% CI 8.4, 9.0) and the average luminance of black features was 1.5 cd/m2 (95% CI 1.46, 1.54) (Minolta LS-110 photometer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small incandescent lamp (40 W, 120 Hz) was positioned 1.5 m above the perch to provide additional light and encourage perching at that end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate filming, near-infrared LED strips (850-nm 5050 lights, environmentallights.com) were affixed along the top of each side of the tunnel, facing the midline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This near-infrared light was detected by our cameras but not the birds because the retinal cones of hummingbirds are not stimulated by wavelengths  700 nm (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For stimuli consisting of stationary horizontal stripes, the color of the topmost stripe was matched for the two walls and was determined randomly, so that birds were sometimes exposed to red on top and sometimes to black on top, depending on the treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified that the color of the top stripe did not significantly affect the birds lateral position for treatments with 18.4-cm period horizontal gratings (all P  0.27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Birds in the tunnel were fed ad libitum from a syringe containing 7.5 g/100 mL (wt/vol) sucrose solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before an experiment, birds were allowed to explore the stimulus-free tunnel with overhead fluorescent lighting, similar to their aviary housing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A training stimulus consisted of stationary red and black vertical stripe gratings on both side walls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 10-min intervals, the grating period size was changed (using period sizes 0.58, 1.15, 2.3, 4.6, 9.2, and 18.4 cm, in a different randomly selected order for each bird), with the cycle repeating after 60 min to ensure that birds would be familiar with all sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once birds had begun to feed at regular intervals, the fluorescent lights were turned off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 60-min training period was repeated at the beginning of each day to ensure motivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For experiments using dot stimuli, the training stimulus consisted of stationary dot fields with 20 min at each of the three dot densities (0.47, 0.95, and 1.89 dots/cm2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Collection_and_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental treatments were applied in blocks, such that the stimulus changed after a bird was observed to have fed five times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define a feeding event as the bird traversing the tunnel to dock at the feeder before returning to the perch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The order of treatment blocks was randomized for each bird.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight cameras (Prosilica GE680, Allied Vision Technologies; Computar H2Z0414C-MP lenses) filmed from above at 100 frames per second (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flydra image-based tracking software was used to automatically track the birds flight trajectories and compute the birds 3D position (x, y, and z coordinates) in each frame (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We limited our analyses to times when the birds were within positions 15 m along the axial (x) length of the tunnel to omit take-off, landing, and feeder docking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified trajectories during feeding events that had a consistent axial flight direction (i.e., toward or away from the feeder), and if more than one trajectory occurred as a bird traversed the chamber, we selected the trajectory with the longest axial (x) distance for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a bird was tracked for fewer than 2.5 m, that flight was discarded as having insufficient data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 75 of 3,270 flights were discarded (2%) and these were not biased toward any particular treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the hummingbirds varied their flight speeds, the times when they flew slowly are represented with more data points in the output of the tracking system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore grouped position and velocity data into 1-cm bins along the axial (x) axis, taking the mean for each bin, and then taking the mean of the bins for each flight to represent the average value while traversing the tunnel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movie S1 illustrates how average lateral position was calculated from sample flight trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All statistical analyses were performed on these flight averages using R 3.2.1 (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed average position using mixed-effects regression models in the nlme package 3.1-120 (45), with a random effect of treatment block nested within individual to account for nonindependence of repeated measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypotheses were evaluated using the glht function in the multcomp package 1.4-0 (46), and P values less_than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data and analyses are provided at https://figshare.com/articles/statistical_supplement_flight_course_control_R/3382759 and in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
