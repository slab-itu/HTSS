Lsd1 prevents age-programed loss of beige adipocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over time, beige adipocytes gain a white adipocyte morphology and lose their thermogenic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that levels of the epigenetic eraser lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1) decrease in aging inguinal white adipose tissue concomitantly with beige fat cell decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maintaining adipocyte-specific expression of Lsd1 in transgenic mice preserves the pool of beige adipocytes in old mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vice versa, using GFP reporter mice, we traced the fate of beige adipocytes and showed that adipocyte-specific loss of Lsd1 results in a premature beige-to-white adipocyte transition in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maintenance of beige adipocytes is mediated by the Lsd1 target gene peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (Ppara) and pharmacological activation of Ppara rescues the loss of beige adipocytes in Lsd1-KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, we identified Lsd1 as a regulator of beige adipocyte maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aging is accompanied by major changes in adipose tissue distribution and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, with time, thermogenic-competent beige adipocytes progressively gain a white adipocyte morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms controlling the age-related transition of beige adipocytes to white adipocytes remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1) is an epigenetic eraser enzyme positively regulating differentiation and function of adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that Lsd1 levels decrease in aging inguinal white adipose tissue concomitantly with beige fat cell decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, adipocyte-specific increase of Lsd1 expression is sufficient to rescue the age-related transition of beige adipocytes to white adipocytes in vivo, whereas loss of Lsd1 precipitates it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lsd1 maintains beige adipocytes by controlling the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (Ppara), and treatment with a Ppara agonist is sufficient to rescue the loss of beige adipocytes caused by Lsd1 ablation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our data provide insights into the mechanism controlling the age-related beige-to-white adipocyte transition and identify Lsd1 as a regulator of beige fat cell maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Lsd1_Is_Essential_for_the_Maintenance_of_Basal_Beige_Adipocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate whether Lsd1 might contribute to the age-programmed loss of basal beige adipocytes, we analyzed Lsd1 expression in WAT of mice at 10 wk (young adult) and 30 wk (old) of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lsd1 transcript and protein levels dramatically decreased in epWAT and ingWAT of old compared with young WT mice (Fig 1 A and B and Fig S1A), which was not observed in other tissues such as liver (Fig 1A and Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H&E staining of WT ingWAT displayed an age-related conversion from beige to white adipocyte morphology (Fig 1C) as previously reported (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus hypothesized that Lsd1 might play a role in the maintenance of beige adipocytes and that the gradual loss of Lsd1 with age might be responsible for the morphological changes observed in ingWAT of older mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate this hypothesis, we aimed to maintain Lsd1 expression selectively in adipocytes during aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We engineered transgenic mice in which the flag-tagged human Lsd1 coding sequence followed by a floxed translational stop cassette is under the control of the chicken -actin promoter (Methods and Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transgenic mice were crossed with the well described adiponectin (Adipoq)-Cre deleter strain (16) to generate adipocyte-specific Lsd1-overexpressing mice, hereafter named Lsd1cTg (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis confirmed that Lsd1 levels remained high in 30-wk-old Lsd1cTg mice but decreased with age in control mice (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ingWAT of young Lsd1cTg mice, we did not observe any morphological changes compared with age-matched control mice (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the typical age-related phenotypic beige-to-white adipocyte transition was robustly impaired in ingWAT of old Lsd1cTg mice (Fig 1C), and old Lsd1cTg mice conserved their pool of Ucp1-positive beige fat cells to a similar extent as young WT animals (Fig 1D and Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested whether the transcription levels of beige-selective markers (17) and genes involved in thermogenesis and oxidative metabolism were altered in ingWAT during aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the observed morphological changes, analyzed markers were strongly down-regulated with age in ingWAT of control mice (Fig 1E and Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, this decrease was less severe in old Lsd1cTg mice, and the expression pattern resembled that of young mice (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, the expression of general adipogenic markers was not altered (Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that maintaining Lsd1 levels in ingWAT during aging is sufficient to preserve basal beige adipocyte morphology and gene expression program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Loss_of_Lsd1_in_Adipocytes_Causes_Premature_Beige-to-White_Transition_of_ingWAT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the presence of Lsd1 protein seems to be essential to maintain basal beige fat cells in ingWAT, we hypothesized that loss of Lsd1 in adipocytes would lead to a premature loss of the beige fat cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we crossed mice harboring conditional Lsd1 alleles (Lsd1p/p mice) (18) with the Adipoq-Cre deleter strain, resulting in Cre-mediated loss of Lsd1 selectively in adipocytes, hereafter named Lsd1cKO mice (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, beige adipocytes emerged in ingWAT of control and Lsd1cKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, already at 6 wk of age, ingWAT of Lsd1cKO mice morphologically resembled that of 10-wk-old control mice (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, at 10 wk of age, ingWAT of Lsd1cKO mice elicited uniformly white adipocyte appearance (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, Ucp1 protein levels were decreased (Fig 2B and Fig S2 B and D), and transcript levels of beige fat-selective markers were down-regulated in 10-wk-old Lsd1cKO mice compared with their control littermates and were similar to the levels of 30-wk-old control mice (Fig 2B and Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the loss of beige adipocytes in Lsd1cKO mice was not caused by apoptosis as shown by transcript levels of Bax and Bcl2 and protein levels of Parp and Casp3 (Fig S2 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, beige adipocytes emerge in ingWAT in the absence of Lsd1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, beige adipocytes in young Lsd1cKO mice alter their morphology and transcriptional repertoire prematurely to resemble mature adipocytes of old WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that Lsd1 loss contributes to the age-related depletion of beige adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To unravel the destiny of beige adipocytes in Lsd1cKO mice, i.e., to determine whether Ucp1-positive beige fat cells are progressively converted to white adipocytes with age, we crossed Lsd1cKO mice with the previously published Ucp1-diphtheria toxin receptor (Dtr)-GFP reporter strain (19) to generate Lsd1cKO-GFP mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice express GFP fused to a transmembrane protein, the Dtr, under the control of the Ucp1 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, GFP is selectively expressed and addressed to the membrane of Ucp1-positive cells, allowing us to trace the fate of Ucp1-expressing beige adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lsd1p/p mice expressing Ucp1-Dtr-GFP were used as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, a population of white adipocytes present in ingWAT of Lsd1cKO-GFP mice stained positive for GFP (Fig 2C), demonstrating that, in the absence of Lsd1, Ucp1-expressing basal beige adipocytes are formed but converted into cells with white adipocyte appearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lsd1_Is_Required_for_the_Maintenance_of_Beige_Adipocytes_in_Adult_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address whether Lsd1 is required for the maintenance of basal beige adipocytes at adult stage, we generated tamoxifen (Tam)-inducible Lsd1iKO-GFP mice by crossing Lsd1p/p mice with the Adipoq-CreERT2deleter (20) and the Ucp1-Dtr-GFP reporter strains (Fig S2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lsd1p/p mice expressing Ucp1-Dtr-GFP were used as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Lsd1iKO-GFP mice, adipocyte-specific Lsd1 ablation is induced upon Tam administration at 7 wk of age (Fig S2 HJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the data obtained from Lsd1cKO mice, we observed a beige-to-white adipocyte transition in ingWAT of Lsd1iKO-GFP mice 3 wk after depletion of Lsd1 (Fig S2K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, GFP tracing revealed that Lsd1-depleted white adipocytes in ingWAT of Lsd1iKO-GFP mice emerged from preexisting beige fat cells (Fig S2 L and M), confirming that Lsd1 is required to maintain the pool of basal beige fat cells in young adult mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our Lsd1-proficient and -deficient mouse models present Lsd1 as an important regulator of beige-to-white adipocyte transition in ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lsd1_Is_Required_for_the_Formation_and_Maintenance_of_Cold-Induced_Beige_Adipocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address whether Lsd1 is required for emergence and maintenance of induced beige adipocytes, we administered Tam to 7-wk-old control and Lsd1iKO-GFP mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 9 wk of age, mice were exposed for 10 d to cold (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the appearance of cold-induced beige adipocytes was evident in control mice (Fig S3A), very few cold-induced beige adipocytes emerged in ingWAT of Lsd1iKO-GFP mice (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rule out the possibility that induced beige adipocytes were formed in Lsd1iKO-GFP mice but immediately converted into white adipocytes, we traced GFP-positive cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon cold exposure, the number of GFP-positive beige adipocytes strongly increased in control mice, whereas no GFP-positive adipocytes displaying a beige morphology were detected in Lsd1iKO-GFP mice (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the impairment of cold-induced beige adipocyte formation affects the functional properties of ingWAT, we assayed mitochondrial respiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cold-induced respiratory capacities of ingWAT of Lsd1iKO-GFP mice were significantly hampered, contrary to that of control mice (Fig S3C), indicating an impaired thermogenic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, expression of oxidative and thermogenic markers was only slightly elevated in Lsd1iKO-GFP mice exposed to cold (Fig S3D), unlike their control littermates, which responded to cold by robust up-regulation of these markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we inquired whether Lsd1 also governs the maintenance of inducible beige adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, control and Lsd1iKO-GFP mice were exposed to cold to induce appearance of beige fat cells (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 d of cold treatment, mice were injected with Tam in the presence of the continuous cold stimulus and kept at 10 °C for another 2 wk (in total, 25 d of cold exposure; Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control mice exposed to cold for 25 d developed significantly more beige fat cells in ingWAT compared with mice exposed for 10 d (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, upon Lsd1 loss, cold-induced beige adipocytes in ingWAT of Lsd1iKO-GFP mice underwent a massive beige-to-white adipocyte transition (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, white adipocytes observed in mice with Lsd1 ablation were GFP-positive, indicating that they originated from Ucp1-expressing beige adipocytes (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of Lsd1 caused decreased mitochondrial respiration (Fig S3E) and down-regulation of beige fat-selective markers (Fig 3C), confirming that adipocytes from ingWAT have reduced thermogenic capacities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our data show that development and maintenance of cold-induced beige adipocytes critically depend on Lsd1 (Fig S3 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lsd1_Targets_Ppara_to_Maintain_Beige_Adipocytes_in_ingWAT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify Lsd1 target genes that contribute to the maintenance of beige adipocytes, we determined the transcriptome of Lsd1cKO and control mice at 6 wk of age, when beige adipocytes prevail in ingWAT of WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 727 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Lsd1cKO compared with control mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these 727 DEGs, 449 were up- and 278 were down-regulated (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathway analysis of the 449 up-regulated transcripts uncovered genes related to glucose metabolism (Table S1), similar to what we observed in BAT (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ppar signaling was one of the most enriched pathways among the 278 down-regulated genes (Fig S4B and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ppars are ligand-regulated nuclear receptors that have been shown to play important roles in fat differentiation and metabolism (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, Ppara is expressed at substantially higher levels in brown relative to white adipocytes (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed a 50% decrease in transcript levels of Ppara in Lsd1cKO compared with control mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that Lsd1, at least in part, might exert its action by regulating Ppara.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether Lsd1 associates with the Ppara locus, we used C3H-10T1/2 multipotent mesenchymal cells (26, 27) and immortalized preadipocytes isolated from the stromal vascular fraction from ingWAT, which can be differentiated into beige or white adipocytes (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon treatment with mixtures promoting beige or white adipogenesis, immortalized preadipocytes acquired the transcriptional repertoire of beige and white adipocytes, respectively (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In C3H-10T1/2 cells, beige adipocyte properties were stimulated by treating the cells with the 3AR agonist CL316,243 (15, 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cell lines, Ppara expression increased in beige compared with white adipocytes (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This induction was efficiently abolished by treating the cells with Lsd1-specific inhibitor QC6688 [Lsd1(i)] (21) (Fig S4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To unravel whether Lsd1 directly controls Ppara expression, both cell lines were subjected to ChIP followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of stimuli promoting beige adipogenesis, Lsd1 was enriched at the promoter of Ppara in both differentiated C3H-10T1/2 and immortalized adipocytes (Fig 4A and Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased Lsd1 occupancy was accompanied by recruitment of the coactivator protein p300 and increased PolII binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observed increased levels of the active histone marks histone H3 acetylated at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) and histone H3 di- and trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3; Fig 4A and Fig S4E), and decreased levels of the repressive histone marks histone H3 di- and trimethylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3; Fig 4A and Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, these marks were not enriched at an unrelated chromatin region (Fig S4 F and G) or when IgG was used as a control (Fig 4A and Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we addressed whether the role of Lsd1 catalytic activity is involved in the regulation of Ppara expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in the levels of Lsd1, p300, PolII, H3K27ac, and H3K4me3/me2 in beige adipocytes was abolished by treating the cells with Lsd1(i) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, treatment with Lsd1(i) increased the levels of the repressive marks H3K9me3/me2 (Fig 4A) and that of histone H3 in white and beige adipocytes, indicating chromatin compaction (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data demonstrate that Lsd1 enzymatic activity is essential for induced expression of Ppara in beige adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lsd1-Dependent_Maintenance_of_Beige_Adipocytes_Is_Mediated_by_Ppara  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate whether Lsd1-dependent maintenance of beige adipocytes is mediated by Ppara in vivo, we analyzed Ppara protein levels in ingWAT of young and old WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Lsd1, the expression of Ppara strongly decreased between 10 and 30 wk of age (Fig S4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we used GW9578, a potent synthetic Ppara agonist, to activate the residual Ppara protein present in 10 wk-old Lsd1cKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, treatment with GW9578 was sufficient to alleviate the premature beige-to-white adipocyte transition we observed in young Lsd1cKO mice (Fig S4I and S4J) and to increase the transcript levels of beige fat markers in control mice (Fig S4K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, in GW9578-treated Lsd1cKO mice, levels of these markers were comparable to those of vehicle-treated control mice (Fig S4K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that the Ppara agonist GW9578 efficiently rescues the loss of beige adipocytes caused by Lsd1 depletion in ingWAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further corroborate that Lsd1-dependent maintenance of beige adipocytes is mediated by Ppara, we treated 30-wk-old adipocyte-specific Lsd1-overexpressing Lsd1cTg mice with the Ppara antagonist GW6471.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H&E staining and Ucp1 immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that, upon GW6471 treatment, maintenance of beige adipocytes is abrogated, and beige adipocytes were barely detectable in old Lsd1cTg mice (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the increased transcription of beige fat markers observed in old Lsd1cTg mice was completely abolished upon GW6471 treatment, demonstrating that Ppara inhibition suffices to deactivate the Lsd1-dependent expression program of beige adipocytes (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, our data show that maintenance of beige adipocytes is mediated by the Lsd1 target gene Ppara.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding the development and maintenance of beige adipocytes provides exciting insights in establishing novel therapies against obesity and obesity-associated disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the broad interest these cells sparked in recent years, the process of progressive age-related beige-to-white transition (14) remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we identified Lsd1 as a regulator of beige adipocyte maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that, in WAT, Lsd1 mRNA and protein levels decrease concurrently with aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, adipocyte-specific Lsd1 ablation led to an untimely beige-to-white transition in early adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, adipocyte-specific elevation of Lsd1 expression was sufficient to maintain the pool of beige fat cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously suggested that ubiquitous Lsd1 overexpression induces appearance of beige fat cells in WAT (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings unravel that adipocyte-specific Lsd1 expression is essential to maintain beige adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our tracing experiments provide evidence that Lsd1 loss in beige adipocytes results in a beige-to-white adipocyte transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maintaining Lsd1 levels in adipocytes would therefore prevent the age-related beige-to-white transition that occurs in adipose tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we also analyzed the role of Lsd1 in the development and maintenance of the population of beige adipocytes that are induced upon external stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that ablation of Lsd1 robustly impaired the thermogenic response of ingWAT to cold stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Lsd1 expression was necessary to maintain inducible beige adipocytes and prevent them from acquiring white adipocyte morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In previous studies, Rosenwald et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  performed tracing experiments showing in mice that cold-induced beige adipocytes are converted into white adipocytes upon warm adaptation (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using a similar mouse model, we traced Ucp1-positive cells and showed that induced beige adipocytes are not formed in Lsd1-ablated ingWAT, contrary to the formation of basal beige adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, it remains unclear whether basal and induced beige adipocytes represent the same cell population, or if they emerge from different precursor cells (3032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings unravel that Lsd1 expression is required for the development of only induced beige adipocytes, whereas basal ones are formed in ingWAT even upon Lsd1 ablation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potential explanations for distinct Lsd1 functions might be that basal and induced beige adipocytes originate from different precursors or that their formation is regulated by diverse signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Lsd1 is necessary to prevent the progressive age-related beige-to-white transition in basal and induced beige adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lsd1 exerts its function in ingWAT by targeting a set of genes involved in thermogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and genes identified as beige fat markers (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, our transcriptome analysis in Lsd1cKO mice identified the nuclear receptor Ppara as an Lsd1 target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, Ppara-null mice present a phenotype close to what we observed in Lsd1cKO mice, as they also showed a reduced number of beige adipocytes (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed analysis of the Ppara locus by ChIP revealed that Lsd1 is recruited in a beige adipocyte-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using a pharmacological approach, we confirmed that Ppara mediates the effects of Lsd1 in mice to maintain beige adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ppara agonist GW9578 was already shown to reduce adiposity in vivo (34, 35) and to positively regulate the expression of Ucp1 in brown adipocytes in cell culture (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to our knowledge, we provide first evidence that the Ppara agonist GW9578 promotes expression of the thermogenic gene program in beige adipocytes and rescues the untimely beige-to-white fat transition phenotype induced by loss of Lsd1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, our data show that treatment of 30-wk-old Lsd1cTg mice with the Ppara antagonist GW6471 significantly impairs Lsd1-dependent expression program and counteracts the ability of Lsd1 to maintain beige adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings give pioneering insights in the potential use of pharmacological Ppara modulators to maintain beige adipocytes and prevent age-related beige-to-white fat transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because we applied systemic treatment of both Ppara agonist and antagonist, the observed effects might not be fully mediated by Ppara in adipose tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it would be of interest to cross Lsd1cTg and Lsd1cKO mice with adipocyte-specific Ppara-KO or -overexpressing mice, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adipose tissue is a plastic organ that can easily adapt to environmental cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this report, and in our former studies (15), we show that levels of the epigenetic modifier Lsd1 are affected by environmental stimuli in a two-way direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cold exposure and treatment with 3-adrenergic agonists enhance Lsd1 expression, which in turn will activate Ppara and a battery of thermogenic genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, with progressing age or upon a high-caloric diet, Lsd1 levels decrease and beige adipocytes lose their thermogenic functions and accumulate lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect, Lsd1 might be considered as a sensor of metabolic requirements in beige adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it will be important to better understand the regulation of Lsd1 expression to control maintenance and function of beige adipocytes to potentially fight obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

For the generation of the targeting vector, WT human Lsd1 was cloned by Gateway recombination in a p-actin-att-IRES-lo vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This vector expresses EmGFP (referred to as GFP in the text) flanked by LoxP sites under the control of the chicken -actin promotor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A polyadenylation signal was inserted between the 3 UTR of EmGFP and the distal loxP site preventing downstream transcription of Lsd1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second polyadenylation site was inserted downstream of the 3 UTR of Lsd1 ORF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  p-actin-att-IRES-lo_LSD1 vector was linearized, resuspended in microinjection buffer, and injected into the male pronuclei to be randomly inserted into mouse genome at a concentration of 2.0 ng/µL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injected eggs were transferred into the oviducts of 0.5 days postcoitum pseudopregnant CD1 foster mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injection background strain used was C57Bl6/NCrl (Charles River).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 102 animals were produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR (Table S2) for transgenic DNA identified eight positive founders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The founder with the strongest overexpression was used for further analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mitochondrial_Respiration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mitochondrial respiration was measured by high-resolution respiratory imaging using Oxygraph-2K (Oroboros Instruments) as previously described (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histological_and_Immunofluorescence_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paraffin sections (5 µm) were deparaffinized and rehydrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H&E staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence analyses were performed as described previously (15, 40) with anti-Lsd1 (R.S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  laboratory [15], 1/1,000), anti-Ucp1 (ab10983, 1/500; Abcam), or anti-GFP (ab13970, 1/500; Abcam) antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chicken or rabbit IgG were used as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (15, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot membranes were decorated by using the following antibodies: anti-Lsd1 [R.S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  laboratory (15), 1/1,000], anti-Ucp1 (ab10983, 1/1,000; Abcam), anti-Ppara (sc-9000, H-98, 1/500; Santa Cruz), anti-Parp (ab32138, 1/500; Abcam), antiCaspase-3 (9662, 1/500; Cell Signaling), anti-tubulin (T6074, 1/10,000; Sigma), and anti-Actin (A1978, 1/10,000; Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (GE Healthcare) were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C3H-10T1/2 cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (10 mM), l-glutamine (2 mM), and 10% FCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immortalized cell lines derived from the stromal-vascular fraction from inguinal depot of 129SVE mice were generated following the 3T3 immortalization protocol (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells showing adipogenic capacity and baseline low expression levels of Ucp1, but higher cellular binding to Irisin, were selected and used for further experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells were grown in DMEM/F12 GlutaMAX (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 10% FCS and 0.1% Normocin (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentiation of was induced by treatment by addition of 10 µg/mL insulin (Gibco), 1 µM dexamethasone (Calbiochem), 10 µM rosiglitazone (Cayman), and 500 µM isobutyl methylxanthine (Serva) in the presence of 10% FCS in DMEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentiation of immortalized preadipocytes was induced by treatment with 0.5 µg/mL insulin (Gibco), 5 µM dexamethasone (Calbiochem), 1 µM rosiglitazone (Cayman), 500 µM isobutyl methylxanthine (Serva), and 1 nM T3 (Sigma) in the presence of 10% FCS in DMEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For white adipogenesis, the differentiation medium was replaced 3 d later with medium supplemented with 10% FCS, and insulin for 2 d. For beige adipogenesis, the differentiation medium was replaced 3 d later with medium supplemented with 10% FCS, rosiglitazone, T3, and insulin for 2 d. Subsequently, cells were cultured in the same medium for a further 4 d in their corresponding medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lsd1 inhibitor QC6688 was applied to differentiated cells at 100 nM for 3 d. CL316,243 (Sigma) was applied at 1 mM for 24 h. Adipocytes were harvested and snap-frozen for RNA and protein experiments or fixed for 5 min with 1% PFA for ChIP experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
