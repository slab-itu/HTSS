Thermodynamic origin of surface melting on ice crystals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phase transitions of ice are a major source of a diverse set of natural phenomena on Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, quasi-liquid layers (QLLs) resulting from surface melting are recognized to be key players involved in various natural phenomena spanning from making snowballs to electrification of thunderclouds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the aid of in situ observations with our advanced optical microscopy combined with two-beam interferometry, we elucidate a thermodynamic origin of the formation of QLLs and their unique wetting behavior (pseudo-partial wetting and wetting transitions) on ice surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that QLLs are a metastable transient state formed through vapor growth and sublimation of ice that are absent at equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the pioneering prediction of surface melting by Michael Faraday, it has been widely accepted that thin water layers, called quasi-liquid layers (QLLs), homogeneously and completely wet ice surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to this conventional wisdom, here we both theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that QLLs have more than two wetting states and that there is a first-order wetting transition between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we find that QLLs are born not only under supersaturated conditions, as recently reported, but also at undersaturation, but QLLs are absent at equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that QLLs are a metastable transient state formed through vapor growth and sublimation of ice, casting a serious doubt on the conventional understanding presupposing the spontaneous formation of QLLs in icevapor equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a simple but general physical model that consistently explains these aspects of surface melting and QLLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model shows that a unique interfacial potential solely controls both the wetting and thermodynamic behavior of QLLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Description_of_the_Interfacial_Free_Energy_and_Interfacial_Tension_of_QLLs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A series of our recent studies (22, 2426) have assumed the presence of two different liquid phases (- and -QLL phases) to explain a variety of wetting morphologies of the QLLs without characterizing the order parameter distinguishing these two liquid phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hereafter we will show that such a nontrivial assumption is not necessary in the context of the standard wetting theory (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We start from a simple layered system (having flat interfaces) where a liquid (QLL) is sandwiched by solid (ice) and gas (vapor) with a thickness, e. The surface free energy of this system can be written asF(e)=SL++P(e),[1]where SL and  are the solidliquid (iceQLL) and the liquidgas (QLLvapor) interfacial tension, respectively (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set P(e) as an interfacial potential that includes both long-range van der Waals (vdW) forces (ea) and short-range forces (ea).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here a is the molecular size (3.7 Å for water).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because QLLs are quite thin (9 nm) (21), the P(e) term cannot be ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we do not know its specific form, P(e) is trivial for two limiting cases: P(0)=SVSL=S and P()=0, where SV is the solidgas (icevapor) interfacial tension and S the spreading coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former comes from F(0)=SV because e=0 in this system corresponds to just the solidgas (icevapor) interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is due to the nature of vdW forces generally showing power-law decay (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here note that  and SL are not always constant but are thickness-dependent variables in some cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our model does not include variables in  and SL explicitly, these can be incorporated into P(e) consistently (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our theoretical framework is applicable regardless of whether  and SL are constant or variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given F(e) explicitly, one can write the interfacial tension under the existence of the effective interfacial potential as follows (27):(e)=d(F(e)A)dASL=+P(e)+e(e),[2]where A is the area of the wetting surface and (e)=dP(e)/de the so-called disjoining pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subtraction by SL means that we now consider the interfacial tension not of the whole system but just of the film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the constant volume, Ae=const, is assumed to derive this equation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strictly speaking, however, this condition weakly breaks down because the formation of QLLs occurs at supersaturation and undersaturation, and their amount can vary with time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even so, the wetting morphology itself is determined by the force balance in the equilibrium condition (where Ae=const is validated), as with the case of the usual heterogeneous nucleation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_the_Wetting_Morphologies_of_QLLs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A key morphology for understanding the unique wetting behavior of QLLs is the so-called sunny-side-up-type state (Fig 1A), also known as pseudo-partial wetting or as frustrated-complete wetting in some cases (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First we consider this wetting state from the force balance of interfacial tensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1A, a droplet wets its own liquid film, whose thickness is em, with a contact angle E. In this state, two kinds of force balances hold (Fig 1B), the first of which is simply represented as e=cosE (at point A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here e is the interfacial tension of the film with em, given explicitly by e=+P(em)+em(em) from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second is the force balance acting on the film in the horizontal direction, written as e=SVSL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these, coexistence between two different thicknesses (e=0 and em) requires P(0)=Sc=P(em)+em(em) (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substitution of this relation into e straightforwardly yields e=+Sc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be rewritten as follows using the relation of e=cosE:Sc=(cosE1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]Due to the finite contact angle E, the spreading coefficient for this state is of negative sign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the interference image in Fig 1C its value is estimated as 0.6°, consequently giving Sc=4×106 N/m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the value of bulk water at 0°C (7.56 ×102 N/m) was used as .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the combination of the force balance equations at points A and B recovers the YoungDupré equation:cosE=(SVSL)/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]This means that, for S=Sc, partial wetting coexists with the pseudo-partial wetting with the same contact angle E. Actually, the interference image in Fig 1C, showing coexistence of these two states, demonstrates that the contact angle of the droplet (the red arrow) is 0.8°, which almost coincides with E. Here, note that the change in  induced by the curvature effect is sufficiently small to ignore because the curvature of the droplet is negligible due to its extremely small contact angle (also discussed below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also validates the assumption in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 that  is constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next we focus on the partial wetting state (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consider again the force balance acting at point A (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this state, the thin liquid layer emerging ahead of the nominal contact line is spontaneously destabilized, which requires SV(e+SL)less_than0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inserting e=+Sc in this equation yields Sless_thanSc as a criterion for partial wetting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As well as pseudo-partial wetting, we can experimentally assess the value of the contact angle as 2.3° using the interferometer (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consequently obtain S=6.1×105 N/m from the well-known relation of S=(cos1), which actually satisfies Sless_thanSc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that S and  are varied by the temperature and the vapor pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Link_Between_the_Interfacial_Potential_and_the_Wetting_Behavior_of_QLLs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although no specific forms have been defined in P(e) so far, the presence of pseudo-partial wetting imposes a strong restriction on its shape because P(e) should have a local minimum corresponding to the thin-layer state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Scless_than0 and the coexistence condition (Materials and Methods), each P(e) must be drawn as shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the chemical potential difference between ice and vapor, =kBTln(p/pe) (kB and pe being the Boltzmann constant and equilibrium vapor pressure of ice, respectively), is not explicitly included in P(e) (strictly speaking, e) because this term is cancelled in P(e)+e(e), and thus has no influence on the stability and the coexistent condition of QLLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We summarize below the tangent construction in each P(e) according to the type of wetting state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we show P(e) for partial wetting in Fig 2A (Sless_thanSc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, coexistence between e=0 and e (droplet) is energetically favored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although one can also draw the common tangent to e=0 and em, this coexistence, indicating thin liquid layers, has higher energy than that between e=0 and e. In Fig 2B, we show P(e) for pseudo-partial wetting (SSc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There exist two types of coexistence between e=0 and em (thin layer), and between em and e (sunny side up), both of which are acceptable as the stable wetting state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Which states are selected basically depends on the total amount of QLLs present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, coexistence between e=0 and e, the partial wetting state, whose contact angle is less than E, is energetically disfavored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show in Fig 2C the boundary case of S=Sc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can see only one common tangent to e=0, em and e. This means that three types of wetting morphologies, droplets, thin layers, and/or sunny side up, are allowed to coexist with each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, as discussed above, the pseudo-partial and the partial wetting state coexist with the same contact angle E (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the competition between S and the local minimum of P(e) solely controls the wetting transition of QLLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tangent construction of P(e) also allows us to characterize its local minimum straightforwardly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2C, on noting (em)= 0 for S=Sc, P(em) is simply given by Sc=P(em)= 4 ×106 N/m .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our recent analysis of the spreading dynamics of QLLs revealed em= 9 nm (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we note that Elbaum and Schick (30) have predicted the presence of the local minimum in the vdW potential with the Lifthitz theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, our experimental characterization of the local minimum in P(e) agrees well with their theoretical prediction [em= 3.6 nm, P(em)=4.4×106 N/m (30)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This excellent coincidence indicates that the potential minimum purely comes from the long-range vdW potential, governed by the dielectric properties of ice, water, and vapor (28, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the absence of the dielectric anomaly at the triple point, the shape of the vdW potential is expected to display almost no change with temperature and vapor pressure in our experimental regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the thickness of thin liquid layers does not diverge but remains a finite value, even when approaching the triple point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Instability_of_Thin_Liquid_Layers__Rupture_by_Dewetting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Examining the (in)stability of thin liquid layers provides direct insight into the short-range nature of P(e) (aless_thaneem), which is not accessible by the Lifthitz theory (a being the molecular size).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we follow the rupturing dynamics of thin liquid layers by dewetting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found two types of transformation kinetics by quenching a thin layer to droplet stable regimes: (i) hole nucleation and growth (Fig 3A and Movie S1) and (ii) spinodal dewetting (Fig 3B and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that these two are the characteristic pathways observed in dewetting of thin liquid films, which is, more generally, reminiscent of the first-order phase transition (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For i, holes exposing a bare ice surface are nucleated in the matrix of a thin liquid layer and grow with time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hole nucleation occurs stochastically when overcoming the potential barrier by interfacial fluctuations (discussed in the next section), which means that the thin liquid layer is a metastable wetting morphology against the droplet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along the line of the tangent construction discussed above, P(e) for i should be illustrated as shown in Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the metastability, P(e) is of positive sign around em despite Sless_thanSc, and P(e) has two common tangents, corresponding to the stable and the metastable wetting state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ii, however, the thin liquid layer is spontaneously destabilized with accompanying growth of zig-zag-like interfacial fluctuations, and finally transforms into droplets as a result of coarsening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that the thin liquid layer becomes unstable against the droplet; P(em)0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3D shows P(e) for ii; there exists only one common tangent corresponding to the droplet state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, note that the spinodal ring clearly appears at 2.69 s and the wavelength of the fast growing mode is m=2/qm= 3.6 m, where qm is the peak wavenumber (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experimental conditions indicate that the temperature gap between the bistable (coexistence or binodal; S=Sc) and the unstable (spinodal) state lies within only a 0.5-K window, strongly suggesting that the local minimum of P(e) is quite shallow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The vdW potential proposed by Elbaum and Schick (30) is composed of the nonretarded repulsive part, favoring thickening of wetting films, and the retarded attractive part, favoring thinning, the competition of which yields the minimum in the potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As stated above, the proposed vdW potential qualitatively supports our observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we can decompose P(e) as sketched in Fig 3F, which uncovers the existence of a short-range attractive potential not taken into account in the vdW approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although its origin is not clear at this stage, the structural coupling between SL and  may be a promising candidate for it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well known that water molecules localized in the vicinity of vapor are highly structured (32, 33), which may reduce SV due to their structural similarity when the two interfaces approach each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that SL is a thickness-dependent variable, SL(e), which can be also regarded as a kind of interfacial potential (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the correlation length of the structural ordering induced by the vapor is about 1 nm at most (32), SL(e) is expected to immediately recover the bulk value with increasing e, which can plausibly explain the behavior of this short-range potential shown in Fig 3F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thermal_Fluctuation_Effects__Droplet_Nucleation_from_Thin_Liquid_Layers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In earlier discussions, we have ignored thermal fluctuation effects on the interface between QLL and vapor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, our advanced optical microscopy is fully capable of in situ visualizing not only QLLs themselves but also their interfacial fluctuations in real space, which is conventionally accessible only through scattering techniques (34) and colloidal systems (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4, the interfacial fluctuations of a thin liquid layer are found to be thermally excited, which induces nucleation of droplets from the thin layer covering the ice surface (Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For small fluctuations (e1), the interfacial Hamiltonian can be described as H=edx[1+(e)21](e/2)dx(e)2=(e/2)k|ek|2k2, where ek is the thickness of the film for wavevector k in Fourier space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used the constant e instead of including P(e) explicitly in this Hamiltonian.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approximation is permitted at the first-order level because the thin layer is the state stably trapped in the local minimum in P(e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the equipartition theorem, we straightforwardly obtain the following relation: |ek|2=kBT/ek2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the correlation length in a direction perpendicular to the liquid film is given by 2=kBT[dk/(ek2)]=[kBT/(2e)]lna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that a and  in the factor are the small and the large wavelength cutoff for the integration, the latter of which is the lateral correlation length, corresponding to the so-called healing length (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we roughly estimated  as 5 m (the same order as m) from Fig 4C and Movie S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the earlier estimation of e, we can calculate  as 0.3 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that the layer thickness fluctuates with  in the well of the potential minimum (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Droplet (hole) nucleation is triggered when e reaches beyond the upper (lower) stability limit, esem+ (esem).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, for sufficiently large layers where we can ignore the suppression of the fluctuation by the finite size effect (), the interfacial fluctuation helps nucleation, a transition from thin layer to sunny side up (or from thin layer to droplet).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thermodynamic_Origin_of_the_Formation_of_QLLs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A thermodynamic criterion for the equilibrium presence of QLLs is given by the balance of the interfacial free energy between wet and bare ice surfaces: F(e)F(0)=F=P(e)S. This interfacial term is of crucial importance in the phase behavior because the chemical potentials of ice, water, and vapor are almost all the same near the triple point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Fless_than0, ice surfaces lower the total free energy by F by getting wet, which drives the spontaneous formation of QLLs and permits the equilibrium surface melting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we previously found the absence of QLLs at and near the icevapor equilibrium (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Movie S4, a droplet-type (partially wet) QLL gradually disappears on an ice surface at the icevapor equilibrium (T=1.5°C and p= 540 Pa) for sufficiently long time to observe the whole kinetics directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that we can strictly define the icevapor equilibrium by observing advancing and receding elementary steps with our advanced microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On noting that F0 for partial wetting as shown in Fig 2A, F is found to be positive at and near the icevapor equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For F0, ice surfaces pay the penalty by F to the total free energy when forming QLLs, which rules out their equilibrium presence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fact casts a serious doubt on the conventional theory presupposing S0 and Fless_than0, that is, the spontaneous formation of QLLs in icevapor equilibrium (e.g., see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3, 4, 13, and 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movie S4 indicates that even one small droplet, whose radius is only 15 m, takes 19 min to completely disappear, meaning that QLLs survive persistently on ice surfaces even in the thermodynamically unstable region once they form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a long timescale of the equilibration (the annihilation kinetics of QLLs) may mimic the equilibrium presence of QLLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the absence of QLLs in icevapor equilibrium, they can form as an intermediate state on their way to ice from vapor, or vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actually, we recently obtained supportive evidence that QLLs form kinetically under supersaturation conditions as the elementary steps of ice advance (22, 24, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A plausible explanation of this behavior is that the relationship of the free energy between vapor and QLL is reversed by crossing the vaporwater equilibrium line extrapolated inside the ice stable regime, which enables a vaporice transformation via metastable supercooled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all of our observations of QLLs so far have been performed under supersaturated conditions (22, 2426), this scenario further proposes the formation of QLLs at undersaturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate this experimentally, we directly followed the formation and the annihilation process of QLLs in undersaturated conditions (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 5A and Movie S5, we found that, starting from the equilibrium point and increasing the temperature at a constant vapor pressure, the bare ice surface is first hollowed by sublimation as the steps of ice recede, and then nucleation and growth of droplet-type QLLs follow from the hollowed surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With further increasing the temperature thin liquid layers subsequently appear through both nucleation and spreading of the existing droplets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a formation via nucleation reflects the presence of the energy barrier arising from the interfacial tension (for droplets), and that of the fringe and the line tension (for thin layers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that these tensions survive even for thin layers with F=P(em)Sless_than0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed the same nucleation (and spreading) behavior under supersaturation conditions (Movies S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, QLLs can be regarded as a metastable state possessing an intermediate free energy between ice and vapor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we checked the reverse process (Fig 5B and Movie S6); first thin liquid layers transform into droplets through dewetting, and then the droplets shrink and finally disappear on approaching the icevapor equilibrium point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 5C shows the wetting and phase behavior of QLLs in the pT plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red symbols represent the points at which QLLs disappear on ice surfaces, whereas the blue symbols represent the points at which thin layers are destabilized and transform into droplets through dewetting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former process, disappearance of QLLs, is a normal first-order transition, exhibiting hysteresis caused by the metastablity; their disappearance occurs at a different temperature from their formation (via droplet nucleation) at a fixed vapor pressure, as shown in Movies S5 and S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, although the latter process, the wetting transition of QLLs, is also first-order, the metastable wetting state is easily and immediately destabilized due to interfacial fluctuations of QLLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actually, we have confirmed no hysteresis; dewetting (complete-to-partial wetting) and spreading (partial-to-complete wetting) occur at almost the same temperature and vapor pressure (Movies S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the blue lines correspond to thermodynamically defined wetting transition lines, satisfying S=Sc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here it is also worth noting that no hysteresis in the wetting transition rules out the possibility that metastable thin liquid layers remain to cover ice surfaces even in icevapor equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the absence of interfacial fluctuations on ice surfaces is another direct piece of evidence denying this possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that ice basal faces have no roughening transition below the melting point (25), which means that there exists no interfacial fluctuation on bare ice basal faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, if there exist thin liquid layers in this condition, their interfacial fluctuations must be observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our direct observations have never detected these in this condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 5C we found that the metastable coexistence lines of QLLs for both supersaturation (QLLvapor) and undersaturation (QLLice) significantly deviate from those of bulk water, although the slope of each line shows a similar relationship to the corresponding bulk metastable lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly for the case of undersaturation, the metastable line of QLL penetrates inside the region where water never exists even as an intermediate state, which cannot be explained by only kinetic effects: the balance of a growth or evaporation rate (a mass transfer of water molecules) among three phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this deviation suggests that the thermodynamic properties of QLLs themselves are different from those of bulk water, which is consistent with our recent study assessing the surface tension-to-shear viscosity ratio of QLLs from their wetting dynamics (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We summarize in Fig 6 a thermodynamic route to form QLLs on ice surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For weak supersaturation (undersaturation) near the vaporice equilibrium where the free energy of a QLL is highest among the three phases, vapor (ice) directly transforms into ice (vapor) through the layer-by-layer process driven by 2D nucleation and/or spiral growth (surface hollowing mediated by defects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the standard process of crystal growth based on the terrace-step-kink picture (23, 3638).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, far from the vaporice equilibrium where the free energy of a QLL is intermediate between that of ice and vapor, vapor (ice) transforms into ice (vapor) with accompanying nucleation and growth of metastable QLLs on growing (sublimating) ice surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore fair to categorize the formation of QLLs not into just surface melting in the conventional and ambiguous way, but into two distinct types, surface condensation for supersaturation and surface melting for undersaturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we note that, although we have observed a signature of the advancing elementary steps in thin liquid layers (black arrow in Fig 1A), a detailed mechanism of crystal growth at QLLice interfaces, and more generally liquidcrystal interfaces, is still unknown and remains an interesting topic for future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we briefly remark on a possible link between surface melting and the thermal roughening transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous study (25) we investigated this link by observing QLLs on the prism face of ice crystals, exhibiting the roughening transition at 4 °C  2 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated that both the wetting behavior of QLLs and the condition of their existence on the prism face are basically same as those on the basal face, having no roughening transition below the bulk melting point, which tells us that the thermal roughening and surface melting are separate phenomena and do not compete with each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shed a light on the nature of the wetting transition of QLLs and the stability of each wetting state from statical and dynamical viewpoints, including their interfacial fluctuation effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With support from in situ observations with our advanced optical microscopy combined with two-beam interferometry, we have demonstrated that the unique shape of P(e) is responsible for the QLL wetting behavior, and it also plays a prominent role in determining the thermodynamic condition for the existence of QLLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the wetting and the phase behavior are seriously affected by the change in P(e), easily achieved by introducing defects on ice surfaces (24) and by replacing vapor with acid gases (39), metals, or other dielectrics (40) in our system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a more general perspective, our model also suggests that QLLs can manifest not only at equilibrium, as conventionally proposed, but also in nonequilibrium conditions via an Ostwald-like pathway (Fig 6), owing to the nature of P(e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, by extending the focus into the nonequilibrium regime, QLLs might potentially be observed on diverse crystalline surfaces where they are as yet unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that our theoretical framework is widely applicable regardless of the kind of substance due to its phenomenological description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, our findings may apply to another longstanding problem: how watervapor interfaces affect freezing in their vicinity, which plays a crucial role in ice crystallization of supercooled water nanodroplets (32, 4143).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the nucleation in the bulk, at the nanoscale not only S, which is conventionally discussed (41), but also P(e) becomes an important factor governing the ice nucleation behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model suggests that F=P(e)S is responsible for whether the ice nucleation is induced (F0) or suppressed (Fless_than0) by the watervapor interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, one important question still remains unanswered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why are ice surfaces not wet by their own melt, water, even though these two are made of same molecules?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elucidating its microscopic origin, which is intrinsically linked to the short-range attractive potential in P(e) predicted in Fig 3F, will lead to a more fundamental understanding of this phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will also provide a quantitative basis for our decomposition of P(e) shown in Fig 3F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actually, a similar low wettability behavior of melts on their own crystal surfaces has already been observed in alkali halide crystals and some metals (44) and has recently been investigated for the NaCl (100) surface by using extensive molecular dynamics simulations (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar numerical approach beyond the continuum picture would also be a promising path to further studies of our system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally, the direct and systematic assessment of the temperature and the vapor pressure dependence of S and  are also important to understanding the phase behavior of QLLs more deeply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Advanced_Optical_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our advanced microscopy system is a combination of laser confocal microscopy and differential interference contrast microscopy (LCM-DIM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser confocal system is designed to maximize the sensitivity (the height resolution) of differential interference contrast microscopy by avoiding deterioration of a high polarization ratio of the laser beam and by reducing the noise attributed to scattered light from out-of-focus planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a confocal system (FV300; Olympus Optical Co. Ltd.) attached to an inverted optical microscope (IX70; Olympus Optical Co. Ltd.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A super luminescent diode (ASLD68-050-B-FA, 680 nm; Amonics Ltd.) and a He-Ne laser (05-LHP-991, 633 nm; Melles Griot) were used for LCM-DIM observations and interferometric observations, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further detailed information of our microscopy is presented in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2224.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the differential interference contrast was adjusted as if the ice crystal surface were illuminated by a light beam slanted from the upper left to the lower right direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, convex (concave) objects showed brighter (darker) and darker (brighter) contrast on the upper left sides and the lower right sides, respectively, compared with a flat crystal surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In this study, we used ultrapure water (18.2 M cm) as a source of ice and vapor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purity of dry nitrogen gas filling the observation chamber is more than 99.99% (oxygen  50 vol ppm and the dew point 58 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface cleanliness of ice achieved by our experimental setup is generally far from the cleanliness achieved by so-called ultrahigh vacuum experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even so, it is worth noting that the pinning of elementary steps typically induced by surface impurities (46), which may affect the behavior of QLLs, has never been observed in all of our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It therefore seems that our ice crystal surfaces are clean enough for our purposes and surface impurities can be ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Control_of_Temperature_and_Vapor_Pressure_of_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observation chamber is composed of upper and lower Cu plates whose temperatures are separately controlled using Peltier elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the center of the upper Cu plate, a cleaved AgI crystal was attached as an ice nucleating agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We grew Ice Ih sample crystals on this AgI crystal at 15 °C from supersaturated vapor in a nitrogen environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also prepared other ice crystals on the lower Cu plate, as a source of vapor to the sample ice crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vapor pressure in the chamber is controlled by the temperature of the source ices, that is, their equilibrium vapor pressure at the corresponding temperature because a larger amount of source ices are attached to the lower plate compared with the sample crystals on the upper one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, separate control of the temperatures of the sample and source ice crystals allows us to adjust the temperature of the sample (T) and vapor pressure (p) independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that p is the partial pressure of H2O in a nitrogen environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total pressure is the atmospheric pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the observation of QLLs was only performed on basal faces of ice crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thickness_Dependence_of_Interfacial_Tensions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we shall simply assume that SL is a function of e in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, this corresponds to the case that SL is affected by the presence of the (highly structured) watervapor interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First we set SL(e) asSL(e)=SL0f(e),[5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where SL0 is SL() (the bulk value of SL),  is the deviation of SL led by the coupling between the two surfaces, and f(e) is a thickness-dependent contribution decaying from 1 to 0 as e increases from 0 to .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then reconstruct F(e) in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 asF(e)=+SL0+P(e)f(e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, even when SL is a variable, our theoretical framework still holds, replacing P(e)f(e) with P(e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, SL(e) can be regarded as a kind of the interfacial potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Coexistence_Between_Different_Thicknesses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coexistence between two different thicknesses (e and e) requires that the same interfacial tension acts between e and e: (e)=(e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This condition is explicitly represented as (27)P(e)+e(e)=P(e)+e(e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This demonstrates that, under the coexistence between e and e, one can draw a common tangent in P(e) at these two points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By replacing e and (e) with c and , respectively, this tangent construction can be regarded as the coexistence condition for a phase separated system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that c and  are a concentration of a binary mixture and its chemical potential, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, we need to pay attention when dealing with e, where the wetting morphology becomes the droplet due to its escaping from the influence of the interfacial potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strictly speaking, our model cannot describe a partial wetting state appropriately, assuming a simple layered system such that the thickness of QLLs is only one variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the positional dependence of e (or e(x)) is not taken into account here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, according to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7, coexistence between e=0 and e (partial wetting) incorrectly yields P(0)=P(), that is, S=0, meaning complete wetting of a macroscopic film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this relation, or the force balance in the horizontal direction, is correct on the top of the droplet,  should be replaced by its cosine component in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 except on the top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, at the vicinity of the contact line, however, where e still holds, the cosine component can be written using the macroscopic contact angle as cos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This replacement again gives the correct coexistence relation between e=0 and e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
