Hepatitis E virus ORF3 is a functional ion channel required for release of infectious particles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is responsible for an estimated 20 million enterically transmitted cases of viral hepatitis globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that one of HEVs three major gene products, ORF3, is an ion channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of ORF3 abrogates release of infectious virions, and we show that viral egress can be rescued by expressing the influenza A virus (IAV) matrix-2 protein in trans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of ORF3 facilitates ion flux across the plasma membrane, providing direct evidence for its viroporin activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify regions within ORF3 abrogating both ion channel activity and particle release, thereby linking these two processes for a quasienveloped human virus and providing an attractive potential target for antiviral drug development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the leading cause of enterically transmitted viral hepatitis globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of HEVs three ORFs, the function of ORF3 has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that via homophilic interactions ORF3 forms multimeric complexes associated with intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEV ORF3 shares several structural features with class I viroporins, and the function of HEV ORF3 can be maintained by replacing it with the well-characterized viroporin influenza A virus (IAV) matrix-2 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ORF3s ion channel function is further evidenced by its ability to mediate ionic currents when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we identified several positions in ORF3 critical for its formation of multimeric complexes, ion channel activity, and, ultimately, release of infectious particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our data demonstrate a previously undescribed function of HEV ORF3 as a viroporin, which may serve as an attractive target in developing direct-acting antivirals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

ORF3_Is_a_Transmembrane_Protein_Localized_at_ER_Membranes_and_Forms_Multimeric_Complexes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our initial bioinformatic analysis indicated that HEV ORF3 contained a putative transmembrane domain (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prediction was corroborated following expression of HEV ORF3 in HepG2C3A cells, a commonly used human hepatoma cell line permissive to HEV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cells, we observed colocalization of ORF3 with the ER-associated protein calnexin (Fig 1B), suggesting ORF3 associates with intracellular membranes presumably derived from the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The punctate pattern in which ORF3 was expressed motivated us to determine whether the protein forms larger complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FLAG-tagged ORF3 immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody in lysates derived from HepG2C3A cells coexpressing FLAG- and HA-tagged ORF3 (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, coexpression of HA-tagged STING, a well-characterized ER-resident protein (19), did not pull down ORF3, demonstrating that the interactions between different ORF3 molecules are specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, larger protein complexes were observed in Western blots of HepG2C3A lysates even under denaturing conditions, suggesting multimerization (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data confirm that HEV ORF3 is a transmembrane protein localized at ER membranes (20) and forms multimeric complexes, presumably through homophilic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HEV_ORF3_Resembles_a_Class_IA_Viroporin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When we examined the characteristics of ORF3 more closely, we noted its similarity to known viroporins, i.e., virally encoded protein complexes that serve as functional ion channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like other viroporins, ORF3 is a small hydrophobic protein that tends to oligomerize in ER-derived membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to class IA viroporins such as IAV M2 (21), HIV-1 Vpu (22), or the coronavirus E protein (23), ORF3 has a short tail at the N terminus that resides in the ER lumen and a long cytosolic tail at the C terminus that is prone to phosphorylation at a serine in position 70 (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enable direct analysis of ORF3s function, we expressed ORF2 and/or ORF3 lentivirally in HepG2C3A cells (Fig 2 A and B and Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells were subsequently transfected with in vitro transcribed RNA from a recombinant HEV genome derived from the KernowC1/p6 genome (17) in which ORF2 and ORF3 are replaced by a secreted version of Gaussia luciferase (Gluc), termed rHEVORF2/3[Gluc] (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants collected from these cultures at day 5 posttransfection were then used to infect na√Øve HepG2C3A cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recombinant HEV subgenome replicated equally efficiently in all cells, irrespective of ORF2/3 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells expressing ORF2 only, infectious virions assembled but were retained intracellularly (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only supernatants collected from HepG2C3A cells expressing HEV ORF2/3 together, and not separately, led to robust reinfection, as indicated by an 35- to 45-fold increase in luciferase activity over background (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these luciferase data HEV RNA was also only significantly increased in HepG2C3A cells that had been exposed to supernatants from rHEVORF2/3[Gluc] transfected ORF2/3 producer cells (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with previous reports showing that ORF2 is essential for packaging and ORF3 for release of infectious particles (16, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we aimed to determine whether ORF3s essential function in HEV release could be replaced by IAV M2, a well-characterized class IA viroporin (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, infection of HepG2C3A cells with supernatants from HepG2C3A cells in which transfection of rHEVORF2/3[Gluc] was complemented in trans with HEV ORF2 and IAV M2 (Fig S2 A and B) resulted in a 5- to 8-fold increase in Gluc activity (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signal was approximately twofold lower than the 8- to 15-fold increase in Gluc activity, resulting from infection with particles packaged in cells expressing HEV ORF2 and ORF3 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, IAV M2-mediated HEV particle release was dependent on M2s ion channel activity, as the IAV M2(A30P) mutant, which abolishes its ion channel activity (26), did not support HEV particle egress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with our observation that addition of rimantadine, a known inhibitor of the M2, during transcomplementation of the reporter subgenome inhibited particle release (Fig 3B), providing further evidence that the viroporin activity of M2 is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data strongly suggest that HEV ORF3 functions as an ion channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HEV_ORF3_Has_Ion_Channel_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To directly test the ability of ORF3 to facilitate ion fluxes across the plasma membrane, we used the two-electrode voltage-clamp procedure in X. laevis oocytes injected with in vitro transcribed wild-type ORF3, wild-type M2, or mutant M2(A30P) mRNAs (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ionic currents were measured from oocytes that were injected with mRNAs 2 d before the recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence imaging confirmed expression of ORF3 and the M2 proteins on the outer oocyte membrane (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The currents of oocytes expressing the wild-type ORF3, M2, or M2 mutant proteins were studied by holding the membrane voltage of the oocytes at 60 mV and then applying voltage step pulses every 10 mV from 90 to +60 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both hyperpolarization and depolarizing pulses induced large currents with minimal time dependence that increased to a steady value immediately after the voltage pulse was applied (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This current was significantly larger than the endogenous current evoked by identical changes of membrane voltage in control oocytes injected with M2 mutant (A30P) mRNA or mock injected but was very similar to that observed in oocytes injected with wild-type M2 mRNA (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-cell instantaneous currents were examined under different ionic conditions to estimate the selectivity properties of the HEV ORF3 channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little difference in the reversal potential for each of the tested solutions suggested that HEV ORF3 formed nonselective ion channels (Fig 3D and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, and in contrast to M2 channels that are selective to protons and display a shift in the reversal potential at acidic (5) and basic (10) pH, ORF3s do not show significant changes in the reversal potential as expected for nonselective channels (Fig 3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data demonstrate that HEV ORF3 serves as a functional ion channel but does not have selectivity for specific ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_Domains_Within_ORF3__Which_Are_Required_for_Viroporin_Function_and_Particle_Release  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we aimed to systematically identify regions within HEV ORF3, important for its ion channel function and release of infectious HEV particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis to change triplets of amino acids to alanine across the entire ORF3 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lentiviral delivery of individual ORF3 mutants, along with unmodified ORF2, led to high expression of the proteins in the majority of HepG2C3A cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dually transduced cells were subsequently transfected with rHEVORF2/3[Gluc] RNA and supernatants collected 5 d thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether any of the ORF3 mutants affected release of HEV, supernatants were used to infect na√Øve HepG2C3A cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several positions led to 90% reduction in particle release compared with HEV released from cells expressing wild-type ORF2 and ORF3 (Fig 4, Top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we confirmed that ORF3 residues 8689 and 9598, each containing a PXXP motif previously shown to be necessary for HEV release (14, 15, 18, 27), serve essential functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, mutations in positions 1113, 2940, 5961, 7173, and 8085 reduced virion release by 8095%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gluc levels in the transfected cells were equivalent across all experimental conditions, demonstrating that the observed differences cannot be simply attributed to differences in RNA transfection and/or HEV replication efficiency in the different producer cells (Fig 4, Bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we eliminated from the analysis ORF3 mutants that simply affected protein stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blots of lysates from HepG2C3A cells expressing HA-tagged ORF3 showed that all mutants except ORF3[RLA29-31AAA] and ORF3[VVV32-34AAA] could readily be detected with an anti-HA antibody (Fig S5A) and those that did express well, with the exception of ORF3[CCC11-13AAA], still formed higher molecular weight complexes indicative of multimerized ORF3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All stable mutants were then subjected to voltage-clamp experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, ORF3[CCC11-13AAA] and ORF3[IFI59-61AAA] exhibited a significant decrease in ion flux across the membrane compared with oocytes expressing wild-type ORF3 (Fig 5B and Fig S6 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ORF3[PLA86-88AAA] and ORF3[PSA95-97AAA], which had alanine triplets disrupting the PXXP motifs critical for interactions with components of the ESCRT machinery, and thereby interfere with the release of infectious particles through the vacuolar protein secretion pathway (1416, 18, 28), did not diminish ion channel activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, none of these mutants, including ORF3[CCC11-13AAA] and ORF3[IFI59-61AAA], displayed vastly different subcellular localization compared with wild-type ORF3 (Fig 5A and Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, residues 1113 and 5961 likely fall in regions important for ORF3s ion channel function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, our data demonstrate that ORF3s ion channel activity is important for particle release, which is an additional, distinct function to the previously described, essential interactions of HEV ORF3 with components of the ESCRT pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we provide evidence that HEV ORF3 is a functional ion channel required for the release of infectious virions from host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, viroporins have been identified in nine different viruses, including six enveloped viruses (HCV, HIV, IAV, rotavirus, alphavirus/Sindbis virus, and coronaviruses) but only three nonenveloped viruses [simian virus 40 (SV40), coxsackie B virus (CBV), and polio virus] (reviewed in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viroporins play a central role in promoting viral pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses, viroporin function can influence cell entry and genome replication but is most frequently linked to virus release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with our observations of HEV ORF3, viroporin-defective viruses are often impaired in their ability to properly assemble and release infectious particles (3136).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms underlying viroporin-mediated viral release remain opaque.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lysis and the subsequent release of infectious virions can be triggered by increased membrane permeability as a result of viroporin accumulation (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been proposed that viroporin insertion in cellular membranes may disrupt the electrochemical gradient by facilitating ion fluxes across membranes, thus dissipating the membrane potential of internal vesicles or the plasma membrane and thus stimulating viral budding (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HEV is a particularly intriguing example of a virus apparently reliant on viroporin function for viral release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although classically defined as a nonenveloped virus, recent work has shown it can be shed from infected cells as a quasienveloped virus (37) similar to hepatitis A virus (HAV) (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HAV and presumably other nonenveloped viruses, such as HEV, hijack intracellular membranes to shield from neutralizing antibody epitopes contained in the viral capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quasienvelopment is also thought to promote HAV spread within the liver but is mechanistically incompletely understood (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For HAV, it was demonstrated that the biogenesis of the membranes surrounding virions is dependent on host proteins associated with the ESCRT pathway, specifically VPS4B and ALIX (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEV also relies on components of the ESCRT pathway for virus budding through the interaction of PXXP motifs contained within ORF3 with TSG101 (15, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the important role of ORF3 viroporin activity was not known and thus adds a critical piece to forming a more complete picture of HEV release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our present study lays the foundation for also gaining a deeper understanding of the budding of nonenveloped and other quasienveloped viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will focus on elucidating the structural details of how the ORF3 ion channel may function and possibly regulate the release of infectious virions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because viroporins are essential for the release of a variety of viruses, they are attractive targets for antiviral therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it was previously shown that amantadine and rimantadine can inhibit the ion channel activity of M2 (40) and thereby interfere with the uncoating of IAV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, long alkyl iminosugar derivatives block HCV p7 function and decrease the release of infectious virions (4143), and amiloride derivatives impair the ion channel activity of HIV-1 Vpu and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) E (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides pegylated IFN and ribavirin, both of which have substantial side effects, there are currently no specific drugs approved for the treatment of hepatitis E that directly interfere with the viral life cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEV ORF3s function as a viroporin may serve as a potential druggable target and could pave the way for the discovery of therapeutics that block this ion channel and thus disrupt HEV infectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would address the important need for developing direct-acting antivirals to combat HEV in particularly vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals, who cannot be easily treated by current drug regimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
