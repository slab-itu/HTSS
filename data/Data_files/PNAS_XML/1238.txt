Convergence of marine megafauna movement patterns in coastal and open oceans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding the key drivers of animal movement is crucial to assist in mitigating adverse impacts of anthropogenic activities on marine megafauna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that movement patterns of marine megafauna are mostly independent of their evolutionary histories, differing significantly from patterns for terrestrial animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected a remarkable convergence in the distribution of speed and turning angles across organisms ranging from whales to turtles (epitome for the slowest animals on land but not at sea).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marine megafauna show a prevalence of movement patterns dominated by search behavior in coastal habitats compared with more directed, ballistic movement patterns when the animals move across the open ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The habitats through which they move will therefore need to be considered for effective conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The extent of increasing anthropogenic impacts on large marine vertebrates partly depends on the animals movement patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effective conservation requires identification of the key drivers of movement including intrinsic properties and extrinsic constraints associated with the dynamic nature of the environments the animals inhabit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the relative importance of intrinsic versus extrinsic factors remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyze a global dataset of 2.8 million locations from 2,600 tracked individuals across 50 marine vertebrates evolutionarily separated by millions of years and using different locomotion modes (fly, swim, walk/paddle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, movement patterns show a remarkable convergence, being strongly conserved across species and independent of body length and mass, despite these traits ranging over 10 orders of magnitude among the species studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents a fundamental difference between marine and terrestrial vertebrates not previously identified, likely linked to the reduced costs of locomotion in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movement patterns were primarily explained by the interaction between species-specific traits and the habitat(s) they move through, resulting in complex movement patterns when moving close to coasts compared with more predictable patterns when moving in open oceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distinct difference may be associated with greater complexity within coastal microhabitats, highlighting a critical role of preferred habitat in shaping marine vertebrate global movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts to develop understanding of the characteristics of vertebrate movement should consider the habitat(s) through which they move to identify how movement patterns will alter with forecasted severe ocean changes, such as reduced Arctic sea ice cover, sea level rise, and declining oxygen content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mean displacements per day (d in km/d; effective speed), referred to in the terrestrial animal movement literature as day range (DR) (21) or daily movement range (20), were mostly independent of body length and mass (SI Appendix, Fig S1) both among and within species groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exceptions include true seals (body length only) and turtles, but the latter is simply associated with the different mode of foraging of the largest turtle considered, the leatherback turtle, which constantly travels large distances in search of prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other turtle species included in the analysis tend to be neritic as adults, living most of their lives in shallow coastal waters where they move little.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The root-mean-square analysis of displacements (dRMS) scaled with time as a power law (dRMS  T) with exponents () mostly above the value of 0.5 (commonly associated with Brownian motion) (Fig 1B), indicating that most individuals moved superdiffusivelythat is, faster than expected in a normal diffusion process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using predetermined time windows of 1 d, we compared the probability density functions (PDFs) of the observed displacements for each individual using a dimensionless coefficient of PDF spread (CS), defined as the ratio between the second moment (average square displacement) and the square of the first moment (square of the average displacement).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our CS can be used for comparison across all individuals irrespective of scale and provides an estimate of the spread of the resulting PDF normalized by the square of the average displacement (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, CS  1 indicates wide distributions with heavy tails, such as a power law or lognormal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower values generally highlight a narrower range of displacements identified in the tracked movement resulting in a smaller spread of the PDFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our CS results show high variability among individuals within and among species (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Table S4), revealing substantial within-species variability in movement patterns, with increasing mean coefficient of variation from 22.94%, 38.10%, and 40.37% for species grouped within low, mixed, and high coastal affinity, respectively (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower CS values generally represented simpler, more linear paths, while higher values represented more varied, complex movement patterns (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model fits from boosted regression trees (BRTs; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33) to the resulting CSs for all individuals showed that species group and coastal affinity had the highest relative importance (74.0% and 21.5%, respectively) and identified an interaction (size = 36.0) between these two variables (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction highlights that the different movement patterns in the coastal and open ocean are not uniquely a species-specific trait and partly accounts for the high variability in movement patterns among individuals within species (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, life-history traits, such as breeding and foraging strategies, as well as allometric traits, such as body mass and length, were not shown to greatly influence CS and were mostly removed during the simplification procedure in the BRTs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our modeling results, CS increases with greater coastal affinity (Fig 2B), indicating a larger range of displacements observed when individuals move mostly through coastal areas (i.e., including small and very large displacements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An association between coastal affinity and the dRMS exponent (with 0.51.0 indicating normal random to superdiffusive, more directed, ballistic motion) was also detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher dRMS exponents were found for all displacements taking place in the open ocean, where depths  150 m (dRMS exponent = 0.7910.112 × ocean, where ocean is open ocean or coastal ocean, P less_than 0.001 for the linear model) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is congruent with simple, extensive, and directed movements in that habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also supported by the finding of prevailing frequency of angles of 0°that is, more directed, forward movement patterns in open ocean (depths 150 m), and less directed patterns for displacements in the coastal ocean (depths less_than150 m) with higher frequency of lateral and backward angles (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The KolmogorovSmirnov analysis of the distances between the cumulative distributions of displacements for each species pair was used to compute a dendrogram that resulted in two main clusters above and below California sea lions (a species with mixed coastal affinity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The split of clusters was consistent with a split between species moving in coastal and open oceans (i.e., high and low coastal affinities as shown in the color scale for Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting dendrogram was unrelated to phylogeny, such that closely related species were no more similar in their displacement patterns than were distantly related ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result further reinforces that habitat structure is an important driver of the movement patterns among marine megafauna and reiterates that differences are not fully dependent on intrinsic traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our integrated, multispecies study revealed that differences in movement patterns of large marine vertebrates are primarily defined by the species to which they belong (74% relative influence) but underpinned by a strong interaction with the habitat through which the animals move (open or coastal ocean; 21% relative influence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction partly accounts for the large variability in movement patterns among individuals of the same species (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S6) and is likely related to a combination of directed- and resident-type movements that can occur over the course of an individuals track in association with different behaviors (e.g., transiting and foraging, resting, breeding) (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used an analysis of displacements with no prior assumptions for the movement patterns observed and show that coastal and open ocean habitats directly influence the horizontal movement patterns of marine megafauna potentially in association with habitat complexity and related prey availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patterns we found emerged consistently across a diverse array of marine vertebrates and locomotion modes, confirming that habitat structure is a powerful driver of movement patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species with movements that occurred mostly in coastal environments displayed a greater variety of displacement lengths (indicated by the generally higher CS; Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S6), regardless of the intrinsic factors related to each species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, species moving mostly off-shelf in deep, oceanic habitat conformed to a relatively narrower range of displacements, which indicated less variability in displacement lengths (generally larger).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that this difference in behavior between on- and off-shelf movements is related to habitat complexity, with open water habitats off the continental shelves being comparatively less complex (i.e., more homogeneous physical habitat) despite their highly dynamic nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Open ocean species tend to use oceanographic features, such as fronts, eddies, and currents, as foraging and movement cues (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference may explain the convergence of movement behaviors characterized by more directed movement with generally higher dRMS exponents among species when moving off the continental shelf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, animals moving over the shelf and in the coastal ocean experience a much wider variety of structurally complex habitats (e.g., reef, seagrass) that support a diverse suite of varying resources (e.g., prey, refuges) and threats (e.g., predators, human disturbance), stimulating more complex movement patterns and covering a larger range of displacements (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This complex mix of features provides a rich and diverse array of opportunities for foraging, breeding, and other behaviors (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies of movement have also revealed different patterns exhibited by marine fish and foraging albatrosses in a manner consistent with prey distribution between coastal shelf and oceanic areas (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results reveal a remarkable convergence in movement patterns among a large range of marine vertebrates, departing from those reported for terrestrial animals in that the patterns we detected were independent of body length and mass (despite these ranging 10 orders of magnitude among the species studied).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, for a variety of terrestrial species, the DR is known to scale with body mass, following power laws with exponents around 0.25 (20, 21), with slight differences in the scaling for different taxonomic groups associated with diet types and foraging habitats (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding suggests that the fluid dynamics (air and water) of the ocean environment has lessened some of the physical constraints that operate on landfor example, the similarity between the density of seawater and animal bodies largely reduces the energetic costs of body mass displacement in the ocean compared with land (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the marine environment is a 3D foraging habitat, a factor that has also been found to decrease the scaling of DR for primates (which use the 3D habitat offered by forest canopies) in comparison with other terrestrial mammals (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no significant phylogenetic differences in the components of movement analyzed here despite the evolutionary histories of these animals spanning millions of years from turtles to polar bears with evolutionary ages of 157 million y and 150,000 y, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our comparative analysis of movement across this diverse group of marine megafauna contributes two key underpinnings to our understanding of their movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, internal factors that affect movement are species-specific and independent of the phylogenetic history or traits shared at higher taxonomic or functional groupings (such as family or taxa) and of life-history traits alone, such as breeding strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we identified that the key external factor influencing movement of marine megafauna species is their interaction with coastal or open ocean habitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was corroborated by the dendrogram based on the KolmogorovSmirnov distances between the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of displacements for each pair of species (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, there is a broad diversity of individual movement patterns, ranging from random searching patterns to more directed movement, largely in response to extrinsic forcing (i.e., depending on whether they occur in an offshore or coastal environment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such differences of scale are consistent with differences in oceanographic processes and the related biophysical coupling (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We highlight, however, that when available, the internal species-specific factors that may affect movement patterns should be included in future models to further assess how individual movement varies within species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study of the different movement behaviors of single species has mostly been framed within the random or optimality paradigms, but when applied in isolation, such theories fail to encompass all of the components associated with movement (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that a more encompassing framework for understanding animal movement, its connections with habitat, and the species-specific traits that influence it, would define how, where, and why animals move in three sequential levels of analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first level would focus on how animals move by analyzing the characteristics of their displacements, for example, as we have done here using predetermined time windows to understand and describe the observed movement patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second level would focus on quantifying the drivers of movement and specifically on where animals move, for example, by using models to estimate the relative importance of drivers throughout the range of habitats where movement occurs (e.g., open versus coastal oceans or microhabitats).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If habitat information is not available, discretizing space into low and high occupancy areas can also be a practical method (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final level would focus on why animals move and involve hypothesis testing for specific behaviors as commonly undertaken using the random and the optimality paradigms (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that a unifying framework of animal movement would consist of the integration of these multiple assessments rather than on the results from specific single assessments completed in isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hierarchical framework encompassing three levels of quantitative exploration to understand movement will provide a strong basis from which to predict potential changes in animal movement associated with forecasted severe environmental changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The common reason for moving sought by Aristotle and many others since appears to be, at least for the vast group of marine megafauna, largely associated with the contrasting use of the coastal and open ocean habitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The convergence of movement patterns across marine vertebrates separated by millions of years of evolution and using fundamentally different locomotion modes is remarkable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given recurring changes in the extent and location of continental shelves over the millennia, the influence of habitat change on the evolution of species should not be underestimated (4143).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the importance of understanding paleobiology in the conservation of terrestrial ecosystems was recently identified (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of habitat shaping the movement patterns of marine megafauna might also be associated with habitat-specific ecological roles of these large species and be key to identifying specific areas of behavioral interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study suggests that efforts to understand marine megafauna movement through analysis of its evolutionary history may yield fewer advances than a focus on understanding the habitats through which animals move (e.g., movement phases in coastal versus open ocean).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a shift in focus, together with the use of a more encompassing framework, will assist predicting the effects of changes already underway, for example, with the reduction in Arctic shelf areas (45) and predicted sea level rise during the next millennia (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The great behavioral plasticity of coastal marine vertebrates provides some hope of their higher resilience in a rapidly changing coastal marine environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Tracking_Datasets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our dataset spans three decades (19852015) and includes a total of 2,557 individuals from 50 marine vertebrate species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details are given in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Probabilistic_Analysis_of_Displacements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We characterized movement patterns from the time-series of displacements recorded in the spatial trajectories of tagged animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Displacements were measured as the shortest great circle distance between two locations separated by a predetermined time-window T (e.g., 1 d) along an individual track.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details are given in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Assessing_Coastal_Affinity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We considered coastal habitats to be those located in emerging and submerged lands within depths of 0150 m and calculated coastal affinity as the fraction of observed displacements completely occurring within coastal habitats for each individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are given in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BRTs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We fitted BRT models to the final set of 2,303 individuals across 38 species and the 12 predictor variables (SI Appendix, Tables S2S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modeling details are given in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dendrogram_of_Movement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculated the KolmogorovSmirnov distance between the set of displacements for each species pair when using a time window of 1 d. We then used these distances to produce the dendrogram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details are given in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
