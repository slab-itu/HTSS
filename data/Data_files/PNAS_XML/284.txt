Ancient and modern DNA reveal dynamics of domestication and cross-continental dispersal of the dromedary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dromedary is one of the largest domesticates, sustainably used in arid and hostile environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It provides food and transport to millions of people in marginal agricultural areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show how important long-distance and back-and-forth movements in ancient caravan routes shaped the species genetic diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a global sample set and ancient mitochondrial DNA analyses, we describe the population structure in modern dromedaries and their wild extinct ancestors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analyses of ancient and modern dromedaries suggest a history of restocking from wild animals from the southeast coast of the Arabian Peninsula.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dromedaries now extend the list of species for which classic models of domestication from a single center and from wild conspecific individuals in isolation are rejected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dromedaries have been fundamental to the development of human societies in arid landscapes and for long-distance trade across hostile hot terrains for 3,000 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Today they continue to be an important livestock resource in marginal agro-ecological zones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the history of dromedary domestication and the influence of ancient trading networks on their genetic structure have remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combined ancient DNA sequences of wild and early-domesticated dromedary samples from arid regions with nuclear microsatellite and mitochondrial genotype information from 1,083 extant animals collected across the species range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe little phylogeographic signal in the modern population, indicative of extensive gene flow and virtually affecting all regions except East Africa, where dromedary populations have remained relatively isolated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with archaeological findings, we identify wild dromedaries from the southeast Arabian Peninsula among the founders of the domestic dromedary gene pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximate Bayesian computations further support the restocking from the wild hypothesis, with an initial domestication followed by introgression from individuals from wild, now-extinct populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with other livestock, which show a long history of gene flow with their wild ancestors, we find a high initial diversity relative to the native distribution of the wild ancestor on the Arabian Peninsula and to the brief coexistence of early-domesticated and wild individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study also demonstrates the potential to retrieve ancient DNA sequences from osseous remains excavated in hot and dry desert environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

By examining modern genetic diversity and its global distribution, it is possible to gain insight into the domestication process, because, in the absence of recurrent introgression, populations close to the putative domestication centers are assumed to retain higher levels of ancestral polymorphism (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such distribution of genetic diversity has been suggested to explain the frequently observed negative correlation between genetic diversity and the geographic distance from the place of origin in numerous livestock species (2025).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the dromedary, before the introduction of the domestic form, there had been no representatives of Camelus on the African continent since the Late Pleistocene, and the Holocene native distribution of wild dromedaries seems to have been restricted to the Arabian Peninsula (6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern dromedary populations from the Arabian Peninsula therefore were expected to display the highest level of genetic diversity and variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this expectation, we combined two comprehensive datasets encompassing 759 mitochondrial (867 bp; end of cytochrome B, tRNAs threonine and proline, beginning of control region; MT-CR) and 970 multiloci (17 autosomal microsatellites) genotypes, covering five defined geographical regions (26): Eastern Africa (EAF, n = 170), Western and Northern Africa (WNAF, n = 233), North Arabian Peninsula (NAP, n = 349), South Arabian Peninsula (SAP, n = 181), and Southern Asia including Australia (SAS, n = 150) (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dromedarys fundamental role in the tradition of cross-continental caravan networks gave rise to an intense sharing of genetic variation, blurring genetic signals about ancestral diversity and possible center of domestication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, using a large modern DNA dataset in combination with a number of ancient sequences, we were able to support a scenario with an initial domestication followed by consecutive introgression from wild populations echoing findings from other species (57), such as horses (25, 44, 45), cattle (16), and pigs (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in dromedaries, this restocking occurred from an unsourced wild ghost population, a pattern thus far observed in only few other domestic species (e.g., pigs and dogs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A remarkable feature in the history of dromedary domestication is the substantial genetic diversity of the domestic population, given the temporally and geographically restricted coexistence of early-domestic animals and their wild ancestors, which already were heading to extinction when the domestic form emerged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern dromedary populations largely maintained and consolidated this ancestral diversity, often lost in other livestock, underlining their potential to adapt sustainably to future challenges of desertification and climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Modern_and_Ancestral_Genetic_Diversity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hair, blood, and saliva samples were collected commensally during routine veterinary treatments, and all owners agreed to the analysis; no further specific permissions were required from the Ethics Committee of the Vetmeduni Vienna for this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To infer the genetic diversity, population structure, and differentiation of the modern and ancient dromedary populations, we performed genetic analyses on a total of 1,083 modern dromedaries originating from 21 countries, seven early-domesticated (4001870 CE) specimens, and eight wild dromedary specimens (50001000 BCE) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild dromedaries were classified based on the archaeological context (SI Appendix) and morphological differentiation (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed information about samples is given in Dataset S1; collection, wet-laboratory, and in silico procedures are given in SI Appendix, Table S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Population_Genetics_and_Demographic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genetic diversity estimators, genetic distances on the nuclear and mitochondrial data, and neutrality tests (mtDNA) are detailed in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Test of the goodness of fit for the Poisson distribution to the pairwise differences between the haplotypes and minimal mitochondrial diversity in the initial pool of domesticated camels (SI Appendix) followed Luikart et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historical population demographic dynamics were assessed using the 448-bp MT-CR alignment from modern, early-domesticated, and wild samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The birthdeath skyline plot serial model (59) was implemented in BEAST 2.2.0 (60), accounting for serial samples taken at different time points (SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting substitution rate was used to compute BSPs for domestic and wild dromedaries separately (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coalescent simulations based on microsatellite diversity were implemented in MSVAR 1.3 (61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model assumes a single stable ancestral population N1 at some time t1 ago that experienced a demographic change (bottleneck or expansion) starting at time t and changed exponentially in size to the current population N0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulated two different demographic scenarios by choosing (i) larger prior lognormal distribution values for N0 than for N1 (expansion) and (ii) vice versa (a bottleneck).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of a species-specific microsatellite mutation rate in camels, we chose an average mammalian microsatellite mutation rate (63) of 104 (rate variation: 103105) (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ABC_Inferences_of_Four_Alternative_Domestication_Scenarios  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the hypotheses of one independent or multiple domestication scenarios vs. restocking from the wild, we used ABCtoolbox (43) on the combined (n = 642) mitochondrial and microsatellite dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the four scenarios (SI Appendix, Fig S6) we simulated a large number of datasets (1,000,000) using Fastsimcoal2 (64) under the coalescent model drawing parameter values from prior distribution ranges (SI Appendix, Table S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested a maximum of 11 historical parameters and generated 15 summary statistics for each simulation in Arlequin3.5 (65) (SI Appendix, Table S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summary statistics with highest pairwise correlations (R correlation test with Spearmans rho statistics; SI Appendix, Fig S9) were removed, resulting in 12 summary statistics for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the 5,000 simulations closest to the observed dataset, we evaluated model differentiation with the R package abc (66) (SI Appendix, Fig S10) and assessed model fit with the ABC-GLM postsampling adjustment step built into ABCtoolbox (43, 67) to calculate marginal densities and probability of each scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marginal distributions of each scenario were used to calculate PPs and BF for each pairwise comparison between scenarios; the alternative hypothesis can be rejected if the BF between two scenarios is greater than three (43, 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
