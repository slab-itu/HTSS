The tandem duplicator phenotype as a distinct genomic configuration in cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we provide the first detailed molecular characterization, to our knowledge, of a distinct cancer genomic configuration, the tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP), that is significantly enriched in the molecularly related triple-negative breast, serous ovarian, and endometrial carcinomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show here that TDP represents an oncogenic configuration featuring (i) genome-wide disruption of cancer genes, (ii) loss of cell cycle control and DNA damage repair, and (iii) increased sensitivity to cisplatin chemotherapy both in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the TDP is a systems strategy to achieve a protumorigenic genomic configuration by altering a large number of oncogenes and tumor suppressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TDP arises in a molecular context of joint genomic instability and replicative drive, and is consequently associated with enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next-generation sequencing studies have revealed genome-wide structural variation patterns in cancer, such as chromothripsis and chromoplexy, that do not engage a single discernable driver mutation, and whose clinical relevance is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We devised a robust genomic metric able to identify cancers with a chromotype called tandem duplicator phenotype (TDP) characterized by frequent and distributed tandem duplications (TDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enriched only in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and in ovarian, endometrial, and liver cancers, TDP tumors conjointly exhibit tumor protein p53 (TP53) mutations, disruption of breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), and increased expression of DNA replication genes pointing at rereplication in a defective checkpoint environment as a plausible causal mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant TDs in TDP augment global oncogene expression and disrupt tumor suppressor genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the TDP strongly correlates with cisplatin sensitivity in both TNBC cell lines and primary patient-derived xenografts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the TDP is a common cancer chromotype that coordinately alters oncogene/tumor suppressor expression with potential as a marker for chemotherapeutic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Homogeneous_Distribution_of_TDs_Across_Cancer_Genomes_as_a_Systematic_Measure_of_the_TDP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address the lack of a systematic approach to identify and score the TDP, we developed a reproducible metric of TD genomic distribution, which we refer to as the TDP score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each tumor sample, we tally the total number of TDs mapped by breakpoint analysis, and compare the observed (Obsi) and expected (Expi) numbers of TDs for each chromosome i:TDPScore=i|ObsiExpi|TD+k,where k equals the threshold value, which normalizes all values to the subsequently determined threshold for the TDP configuration (discussed below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This metric is easily able to distinguish between a genomic configuration characterized by localized segmental amplifications with TDs vs. the TDP, in which TDs are evenly distributed across all chromosomes (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address the incidence and genomic properties of the TDP, we combined WGS data from 277 human genomes representing 11 cancer types, including 96 breast tumors and cancer cell lines (4, 9, 10, 1522) (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the TDP score distribution in this dataset follows a trimodal pattern (Materials and Methods and Fig S1A), suggesting that cancers can be separated into distinct groups based on their propensity for TD formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon visual inspection of tumors within a range of TDP scores by Circos plots, those tumors with the highest scores show the characteristic TD distribution of the TDP (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to derive an unbiased threshold for classifying TDP tumors, we identified the threshold as the score that corresponds to 2 SDs from the second modal peak (0.71; Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simplify data presentation, we then set the TDP score to 0 at this defining threshold (k), resulting in positive and negative scores for TDP and non-TDP tumors, respectively (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this threshold, 18.1% of the tumors analyzed are classified as TDPs, each showing a high number of TDs (average number of TDs per sample = 112.2, range: 23416, modal TDP score = 0.19) that are broadly distributed throughout the genome (Fig 1A and Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, non-TDP samples are either associated with an intermediate number of TDs (10 to 100, modal TDP score = 0.50) that are invariably clustered in specific genomic regions or have a low number of TDs altogether (less_than20) indicative of a more stable genome (Fig 1A and Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We applied a similar scoring method to the three other basic rearrangements (deletion, inversion, and interchromosomal translocation), but found no evidence for distinct groups to manifest in multimodal score distributions as seen for TDs (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that the TDP is not merely an indicator of genomic instability but, instead, represents a unique tumor subgroup with a distinct structural phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous evidence has suggested a higher frequency of the TDP in TNBC and ovarian (OV) cancer (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using our more precise and quantitative TDP measure based on only the WGS dataset, we confirmed that the TDP occurs statistically more frequently in TNBC (P = 2.16E-04), OV carcinoma (P = 4.95E-02), and hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 2.92E-02) but that it is significantly depleted in non-TNBC (P = 5.27E-02), glioblastoma (P = 4.10E-02), and prostate cancer (P = 1.77E-03) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we rarely observed TDP samples in prostate cancer, in which chromoplexy and chromothripsis appear to be the predominant whole-genome rearrangement patterns (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that different mechanisms are active in different tumor types to produce specific dominant cancer genomic configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas the TDP score is based on the identification of TDs through the assignment of breakpoints, and relies on the availability of WGS data, Ng et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (15) estimated the prevalence of the TDP by counting the number of TD-like features from array-based copy number profiling in high-grade serous OV carcinoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wanted to compare the performance of our TDP scoring algorithm when applied to sequence- vs. array-based detection systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore analyzed Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array segmented copy number data from a subset of 81 tumor genomes profiled as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to compute copy number (array)-derived TDP scores and compare them with TDP scores obtained using paired-end WGS data (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using SNP array copy number data alone, we could identify TDP samples with high specificity (0.95; Fig S2 C and D) but lower sensitivity (0.57), likely due to the lower resolution of array data in detecting short segmental duplications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase the discrimination power of the SNP array-based TDP classification, we set a more stringent threshold to categorize non-TDP samples (Fig S2E) and improve the sensitivity of the technology to 0.80 (Fig S2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The advantage of analyzing array-based data is the availability of a larger number of cancer samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we classified 2,987 primary tumors from several TCGA datasets profiled using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array, we were able to reproduce our previous findings that the TDP is significantly enriched in TNBC (P = 1.23E-08) and OV cancer (P = 4.16E-94), whereas it is depleted in non-TNBC (P = 2.41E-20) (Table 1 and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, because of the greater number of available tumors in the TCGA array dataset, we found that uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) also is enriched in TDPs (P = 2.80E-09).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, most of the UCEC samples classified as TDPs belong to the recently described cluster 4 endometrial carcinoma subtype, which is characterized by an extensive degree of copy number variations (CNVs) and has been shown to share a similar molecular phenotype with TNBC and OV cancer (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consistent observation of TDP enrichment/depletion across alternative cancer datasets, generated via diverse genomic technologies and analysis protocols, suggests that our scoring approach is reproducible and generalizable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TD_Breakpoints_Occur_in_Regions_of_Open_Chromatin_and_Active_Transcription  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate possible molecular mechanisms for the generation of the TDP, we examined the genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional configurations of the chromosomal coordinates affected by TD events in TDP genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused our analysis on breast cancer [TNB and non-TNB (NTNB) WGS datasets, n = 23 TDP tumor genomes], because this type of cancer was the best-represented tumor type in our WGS sample cohort, and therefore provided adequate statistical power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first asked whether TDs in TDP occurred in functional regions of the genome enriched for genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a highly significant positive correlation between the number of TD breakpoints and the number of genes in local windows along the genome (R = 0.5, P = 1.8E-178; 10-Mb sliding windows, 1-Mb offset; Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, TD breakpoints were biased to occur within gene bodies (exons + introns) as opposed to intergenically (P less_than 1.0E-04; Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed the physiological expression levels of genes that are frequently affected by breast cancer TD breakpoints in normal breast tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on a collection of 106 normal breast epithelium samples from the TCGA breast cancer dataset, genes located at the boundaries of TDs show significantly higher levels of activity in the normal breast when compared with the entire gene population (P less_than 2.2E-16; Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with the positioning of TD boundaries near genes with antioncogenic signals, which would subsequently be disrupted during TD formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it also suggests that TD formation requires transcriptional activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we observed a significant enrichment of Pol2 binding sites as well as histone modification marks associated with an open chromatin configuration (H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac) in the proximity of TD breakpoints (P less_than 1.0E-04; Fig S3 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is in agreement with recent findings describing a strong affinity of structural variation breakpoints for genomic regions characterized by protein binding and euchromatin (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, H3K9me3 signals, which mark heterochromatin, were depleted from TD breakpoint regions (P less_than 1.0E-04; Fig S3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concordant results were obtained by testing different nonoverlapping symmetrical windows around the TD breakpoints, showing that significant associations between functionalized chromatin regions and TDs are maintained up to 200500 kb from the TD breakpoints (Fig S3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results concordantly indicate a significantly higher likelihood for TD breakpoints to affect transcriptionally active, easily accessible chromatin regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanistic underpinnings of this relationship are unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that if TDs are related to replisome stalling, collisions between the replisome and ongoing transcription might be more common in highly transcribed genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the TDs embedded within certain highly transcribed genes may be preferentially selected during tumor evolution (discussed below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genomic_Features_of_TDs_in_TDP_and_Non-TDP_Tumors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A comparison between the genomic properties of structural rearrangements occurring in TDP and non-TDP samples shows a striking difference in the per-sample median TD span size, with TDP samples having significantly smaller median spans (median span size = 89.9 kb for TDPs and 1,189.7 kb for non-TDPs; P = 7.23E-09; Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, by plotting the distribution of the collection of all individual TD spans for TDP and non-TDP genomes (WGS dataset; n = 50 and n = 227, respectively), we observed that whereas non-TDP tumors feature a continuum range of very large TDs reaching a plateau at around 1 Mb, TDP samples are characterized by two sharper TD span distribution modes at 10 kb and 250 kb (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that in TDP tumors, the mechanism for generating TDs may be different than for non-TDP tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We directly sequenced the rearrangement junctions of 122 TDs from 11 different TNBC cell lines of both TDP and non-TDP types, and analyzed the sequences at the breakpoint junctions for patterns indicative of specific DNA repair mechanisms (10, 21, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We classified the validated breakpoint junctions into those junctions characterized by the presence of short (less_than10 bps) or long insertions; short (less_than5 bps), long, or no microhomology (MH); or long-range imperfect homology (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large majority of TDs in TDP tumors (72%, range: 4682%) show overlapping MH between the two DNA segments contributing to the rearrangement junction, suggesting that the underlying mechanism entails MH-mediated end-joining or MH-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) (13, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, only 40% (range: 2786%) of TDs found in non-TDP tumors show a similar profile [odds ratio (OR) = 3.6, P = 6E-04; Fig 2C and Dataset S3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, TD rearrangements characterized by long-range imperfect homology, a signature indicative of nonallelic homologous repair (NAHR) (24), are prevalent in non-TDP tumors [23% (range: 050%) vs. 7% (range: 031%) in TDPs; OR = 0.25, P = 2E-02; Fig 2C and Dataset S3].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences further support the idea that distinct DNA repair mechanisms may underlie the formation of TDs in TDP and non-TDP tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent evidence has revealed meaningful correlations between DNA replication timing, genomic instability, and the emergence of DNA mutations (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found a significant association between TD-affected genes and replication timing (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes truncated by TD boundaries are found in late replication regions, and genes spanned by TDs are enriched in early replicating regions (P less_than 2.2E-16 and P less_than 2.2E-16 for the TDP set; P = 9.3E-07 and P less_than 2.2E-16 for the non-TDP set; Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This specific pattern of replication timing is consistent across all samples (TDPs and non-TDPs), and it may reflect a shortage of DNA repair opportunities in late S phase, leading to an increased incidence of misrepaired double-strand breaks resulting in CNVs (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that DNA replication typically encompasses 400- to 800-kb chromosomal domains, it is plausible that the shorter TDs found in TDP genomes are generated within intrareplication timing domains, whereas, the larger, non-TDP TDs are more likely to result from the spatial proximity of distinct replication domains through the tridimensional looping of chromatin structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TDP_Is_Characterized_by_the_Coordinated_Perturbation_of_Several_Cancer_Genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the most direct consequences of DNA segmental duplication is the increased expression of the genes that are entirely comprised within the rearrangement, whose copy number is thus augmented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that a genomic configuration generating a large number of segmental duplications would represent a cancer genomic mechanism for the modulation of hundreds of potential oncogenic signals, providing a selective advantage for the TDP cancer cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess this possibility, we first compared changes in gene expression between normal and tumor breast samples, with respect to the genes found to be most frequently affected by TDs in the TDP breast cancer WGS dataset (n = 23; Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As hypothesized, genes that are frequently found inside TDs are generally overexpressed in breast cancers when compared with the normal breast epithelium (median log2-fold change = 0.17, P = 4.0E-16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, genes frequently located at the boundaries of TDs appear to be down-regulated in breast cancers (median log2-fold change = 0.3, P = 5.0E-05) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, genes frequently encompassed by TD segments are enriched in known oncogenes (P = 1.2E-02) and genes whose increased expression levels are associated with a poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer (P = 3.3E-05), whereas genes that map to TD boundaries are most significantly associated with known (P = 5.9E-05) and putative tumor suppressor genes (STOP genes, P = 5.1E-04; good prognosis genes, P = 4.6E-12; Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed these findings by identifying the genes affected by TD-like features predicted using SNP array data, which provided a significantly larger dataset (n = 418 TDP tumor samples; Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, well-known oncogenes, such as paired box 8 (PAX8), erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2), and MYC, are among the most recurrent genes that are spanned by a TD across TDP samples, whereas known tumor suppressor genes, such as RAD51L, PTEN, and RB1, populate the list of the top genes affected by TD breakpoints (Fig S4B and Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This systems strategy to generating the cancer state supposes that many different combinations of oncogenic signals would suffice as opposed to a single dominant oncogenic cassette such as the cassette proposed for genes associated with ERBB2 amplification (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this strategy, we examined the frequency of specific one-gene and multiple-gene combinations affected by TDs across 418 TDP genomes assessed using SNP array data (TNB, NTNB, OV, and UCEC datasets) and found that only up to a maximum of 15.5% of tumors share TD-like features affecting a single common tumor suppressor gene (RAD51L1 and, at lower frequencies, WWOX, NF1, RB1, PTEN, and BRCA1; Fig S4B and Dataset S5), and, even less frequently, an oncogene (i.e., PAX8, duplicated in 10.5% of tumors, followed by ERBB2, ERBB3, TERC, STAT2, CDK2, and MYC; Fig S4B and Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, two-gene combinations are relatively rare, with the top-scoring gene pairs being those pairs that map within a short distance of each other, and are therefore affected by the same TDs (e.g., PAX8, PSD4, which are coordinately duplicated in 8.9% of the tumors examined, or PAX8, CBWD2, IL1RN, which are coordinately duplicated in 6% of the tumors examined (Fig S4 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much rarer are two-gene combinations comprising frequent TD-boundary genes (Fig S4C), arguing against the presence of a dominant TD-affected cancer gene or small gene set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intriguingly, we observed that the shorter span TDs seen exclusively in TDP (10 kb) do not cause the segmental duplication of full-length genes but disrupt gene body integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 38.2% (1,181 of 3,086) of the short-span TDs (span less_than 100 kb) present in the 50 TDP cancer genomes analyzed by WGS are completely embedded within a gene body, often disrupting the intron/exon structure (P less_than 0.001; Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we observed that the genes affected by these short TDs are more likely to function as anticancer as opposed to procancer genes, because they are enriched in TSGs (P = 1.5E-03) and putative TSGs (P = 1.8E-11), while being depleted for oncogenes (known oncogenes, P = 7.3E-03; poor prognosis genes, P = 3.1E-04; Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the consequence of generating many TDs is a genome-wide mechanism that simultaneously augments (albeit moderately) the expression of many oncogenes and suppresses the expression of antioncogenes/antitumor suppressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, there is no obvious genetic driver by virtue of levels of expression or the frequency of occurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given these findings, and the fact that the TDP characteristic is presumably established in the preneoplastic cells prior to the generation of TDs, we searched for genetic alterations that might cause a cell to adopt a TDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Insights_into_the_Molecular_Background_Favoring_TDP_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first analysis, we could not find enrichment of specific TDs in the TDP tumors that could explain the unique genomic features associated with the phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggested that there may be intrinsic molecular differences between TDP and non-TDP tumors that induce the TDP and that the changes in gene expression arising from tandem duplicons are a consequence of the TDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify factors that may correlate with the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotype, we investigated the characteristics of TDP as compared with non-TDP samples within each of the three most highly TDP-enriched tumor datasets: TNB, OV, and UCEC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we extended our analysis to non-TNBCs (NTNB dataset), which, although depleted in TDPs as a cancer group, comprised a sufficient number of TDP and non-TDP samples to perform statistical comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first computed the overall mutation burden as the total number of genes per sample that are affected by at least one nonsilent mutation as assessed by exome sequencing (23, 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the TNB, NTNB, and, to a lesser extent, OV datasets showed a significantly higher mutation burden in the TDP subgroup (P = 3.7E-05, P = 9.4E-06, and P = 4.0E-02, respectively), this trend was not consistent in the remaining dataset (UCEC; Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We therefore focused on individual gene mutations to search for genes that, when mutated, are associated with the TDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each cancer dataset analyzed, we compiled a list of frequently mutated genes (i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mutated in at least 15% of cases within either the TDP or non-TDP sample subgroup).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Somatic mutation frequencies were then compared between TDP and non-TDP tumors using Fishers exact test, and significant differences were assessed across cancer datasets (Dataset S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of a total of 56 frequently mutated genes, the TP53 gene is the only one whose somatic mutation rate is recurrently higher in TDP relative to non-TDP samples across different tumor types, with all of the four examined datasets showing a significant enrichment (TNB, OR = 7.6; NTNB, OR = 4.6; OV, OR = 5.2; UCEC, OR = 60.4) (Fig 4A and Dataset S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then asked whether TDP and non-TDP tumors show profiles of differential gene expression that distinguish these two states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TDP and non-TDP tumors within each tumor-type dataset, we performed a gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the lists of up- and down-DEGs to identify biological processes most commonly perturbed in association with the TDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up-regulation of genes engaged in biological processes relevant to cell proliferation and DNA replication appeared to be the most robustly and consistently enriched across all four analyzed datasets (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding strongly suggests that TDPs are more prone to increased/perturbed DNA replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the DNA replication genes most frequently up-regulated (in at least three of the four datasets examined), CCNE1 was the one with the highest cumulative fold change, followed by several critical DNA replication initiation factors, including CDT1, MCM2, MCM6, and MCM10 (30, 31) (Fig 4C and Dataset S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although no multigene cassettes engaged in specific biological processes appeared to be consistently down-modulated in the TDP datasets, we observed in the cancer subgroup of TNBC that the BRCA1 gene is among the most significantly down-regulated genes, with a greater than two-fold decrease in TDP vs. non-TDP tumors (P = 0.03; Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found a highly significant enrichment for TDP tumors in BRCA1 low expressors (27% of all TDP samples compared with 0% of non-TDP TNBC samples; P = 3.9E-05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validated the strong association between low BRCA1 expression and the TDP score in the NTNB (P = 1.3E-03) and OV (P = 3.4E-03) datasets (Fig 4D), and in two other independent TNBC datasets (P = 0.027 and P = 0.05), all showing an overall negative correlation between BRCA1 expression level and TDP score (Fig 4 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found a significant association between BRCA1 promoter methylation status and reduced BRCA1 expression levels in the TNB (R = 0.61, P = 2.3E-07) and OV (R = 0.74, P less_than 1.0E-05E) datasets (Fig S7C), pointing at epigenetic silencing as a key mechanism of transcriptional inactivation of BRCA1 in TDP tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas we did not find any enrichment in BRCA1 somatic mutations that distinguishes TDP, when we combined somatic and germline mutations and promoter hypermethylation, we did observe a significant increase in the frequency of BRCA1 disruption in TDP vs. non-TDP tumors in the TNB and OV datasets (OR = 9.8 and OR = 5.1, P = 8.0E-03 and P = 1.0E-03, respectively; Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, BRCA2 mutation rates did not show any association with the TDP and, instead, appeared to be modestly but consistently higher in the non-TDP tumor sets (Fig S7D), raising the hypothesis that the TDP is an exquisite feature of BRCA1 loss and not of BRCA2 loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When taken together, these results suggest that a combination of TP53 loss-of-function mutation, BRCA1 reduced expression/activity, and overexpression of DNA replication and cell cycle genes may be required for TDP generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have established that certain multigene expression changes are strongly associated with TDP tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked whether changes were a result of the TDs or preceded the induction of these structural mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 23 DEGs involved in DNA replication and cell cycle associated with TDP, only four (CALR, CCNE1, RAD51, and TK1) were also found inside TDs in multiple TDP samples but at modest frequencies of less_than5% (Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we removed the TDP tumor samples harboring physical TDs spanning these four differentially expressed DNA replication and cell cycle genes, the association of these genes with the TDP remains statistically significant (P less_than 1.0E-04; Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that their overexpression is likely to be engaged in the establishment of the TDP and is not simply a consequence of the phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TDP_as_a_Genomic_Marker_for_Drug_Sensitivity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We explored whether the TDP could represent a marker for drug sensitivity by searching the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database (32) for drugs and compounds that differed in their effect between the TDP and non-TDP breast cancer cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cisplatin was among six drugs showing a significant positive correlation between TDP scores (computed based on available WGS data) and IC50 values (Dataset S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the utility of platinum-based therapeutics as neoadjuvants in the clinical management of patients with TNBC (3335), and the reported association between platinum-based treatment clinical success and a BRCA-ness molecular profile (3638), we hypothesized that the TDP subset of TNBCs may be characterized by a better response to platinum-based chemotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore tested a total of 14 genomically characterized TNBC cell lines and found significant negative correlations between IC50 values relative to both cisplatin and carboplatin treatments and the TDP score (R = 0.57, P = 0.032 for cisplatin; R = 0.58, P = 0.029 for carboplatin) (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, olaparib, an inhibitor of the poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) shown to have antitumor activity in patients with BRCA-mutated cancer (39, 40), did not show any significant association with the TDP score when tested on our panel of TNBC cell lines (Dataset S9), suggesting that the sensitivity of TDP tumors to cisplatin may not be exclusively related to the mutational status of BRCA1 or BRCA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably, although the levels of BRCA1 expression correlate with the TDP score in the TNBC cell lines examined, we did not observe any significant association between BRCA1 levels and either cisplatin or carboplatin IC50 values (Dataset S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that platinum sensitivity correlates more directly with the TDP score than with BRCA1 expression levels and that the TDP score, which is modulated by other genes in addition to BRCA1, may be a key genomic predictor of cisplatin sensitivity in TNBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We explored this hypothesis further by testing the in vivo response to cisplatin treatment in eight independent patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a 3-wk-long cisplatin regimen, four of the five TDP PDX models showed remarkable levels of tumor shrinkage, including two complete responses (80% average tumor shrinkage across all animals in the treatment arm, PDX3 and PDX6) and two partial responses (3080% average tumor shrinkage, PDX7 and PDX10) (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, none of the three non-TDP models analyzed exhibited a reduction of the original tumor volume after 3 wk of treatment, and all three responses to the cisplatin regimen were classified as progressive disease (20% average tumor growth; Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in both established cell lines and in vivo PDXs, TDP status is strongly associated with cisplatin sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Recent studies have described previously unrecognized massive structural aberration events occurring on a genome-wide scale in human cancer (4, 5, 10, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fundamental challenge is to define a quantitative metric to identify these global genomic configurations in cancer samples systematically and to investigate the role they play in tumorigenesis (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we devised a mathematical approach to the unbiased recognition of the TDP (9, 10, 15, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By applying this TDP scoring metric to a collection of 3,000 tumors with genomic data (WGS and/or SNP array), we provide statistical evidence that the TDP is enriched in specific tumor types, suggesting a distinct biological mechanism underlying this phenotype that cuts across histological subtypes (Fig S9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanisms for the generation of segmental TDs have been previously explored in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Green et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (43) have shown how defects in the molecular machinery responsible for preventing DNA rereplication can result in head-to-tail segmental duplications in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the TDs in this study were mediated by NAHR between yeast transposon repetitive elements, a mechanism distinct from the MH-mediated mechanisms that dominate in the TDP tumors we have analyzed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors proposed a mechanism by which the increase in copy number of chromosomal segments can result from the molecular repair of stalled rereplication bubble structures emerging in a permissive molecular background (e.g., following the deregulation of DNA replication proteins).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They name this process rereplication-induced gene amplification (RRIGA) and speculate that it may play a critical role in oncogenesis (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Koszul et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (45) and Koszul and coworkers (46) identified an MH-mediated POL32-dependent replicative mechanism underlying segmental TD formation in S. cerevisiae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A genetic analysis of MH-mediated TD formation in Escherichia coli by Slack et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (47) implicated stalled replication as a trigger to the formation of these TDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are today collectively termed MMBIR (13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Costantino et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (48) demonstrated the significant enrichment of short-span copy number gains (less_than200 kb) in an artificial model of DNA replication stress induced through the ectopic overexpression of the CCNE1 gene in the U2OS human osteosarcoma cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work supports these observations in a spontaneous human cancer setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the size range of the DNA duplications generated via RRIGA in yeast and via CCNE1 overexpression in the U2OS cell line matches the size range of the TDs found in our TDP samples, which we have shown to be characterized by the significant overexpression of replication initiation genes, including CDT1 and CCNE1 (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore speculate that the mechanism of TD formation in the TDP chromotype may entail replicative mechanisms, such as MMBIR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas cancers with high amplification of a single locus in non-TDP tumors depend on a dominant driver oncogene, such as ERBB2 or MYC, the TDP is unusual in that there does not appear to be a discernable single cancer driver gene targeted by the TDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, different combinations of many potential drivers appear to be affected by the widespread genomic distribution of TDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in our analysis of genes perturbed by TDs in TDP, we could not find any individual gene that appears to be affected in more than 15.5% of the samples examined (Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the TDP configuration generates changes that affect the expression and function of hundreds of genes in a distributed manner within each tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, TDP tumors may derive selective growth advantage from a systemic process, namely, genome-wide segmental TD formation, which simultaneously targets many cancer genes distributed across the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In seeking to uncover the root genetic aberrations that may underlie the induction of the TDP, we looked at the gene expression and mutational profiles that are frequently found and most strongly associated with the TDP across a number of tumor types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that the TDP is induced by specific combinations of gene perturbations that (i) cause the loss of genome integrity (i.e., loss of TP53 and BRCA1) and (ii) drive the augmented expression of cell cycle and DNA replication genes (e.g., increased activity of CCNE1, CDT1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, combinations of these TDP-associated gene perturbations occur remarkably more frequently in TDP than in non-TDP TNBC tumors (OR = 17.2, P = 2.1E-05; Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier reports have suggested a BRCA1-independent mechanism for the TDP, based on the absence of BRCA1 mutations in samples (breast and OV carcinomas) with a large number of TDs (15, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed a strong negative correlation between BRCA1 gene expression and the TDP score, as well as the enrichment for BRCA1-defective tumors (assessed by the presence of somatic or germline mutations, or promoter hypermethylation) in TNBC and OV cancer (Fig 4 DG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding strongly supports a previously unrecognized critical role for BRCA1 loss of function in the induction of the TDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we find that the quantitative assessment of the TDP may have clinical relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe an association between the extent of TDP and greater sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy both in cell lines and in PDXs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that breast tumors with perturbations of BRCA1 respond better to cisplatin treatment (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our observations in vitro suggest that cisplatin sensitivity is better correlated with the TDP score than BRCA1 levels or mutational status, we suggest that the TDP score integrates multiple genetic factors, such as TP53 status and select driver gene expression (e.g., CDT1, CCNE1), which may be the genetic components needed for the sensitivity phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas recent neoadjuvant studies suggest that the effectiveness of cisplatin in TNBC is associated with loss of BRCA1 by mutation or low expression (34, 36, 38), it may be that the TDP score is a more robust predictor of response to platinum-based chemotherapies independent of tumor type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, high TDP scores are enriched in TNBC, in OV cancer, and in the recently described cluster 4 endometrial carcinoma, which have been shown to share a similar transcriptional and molecular profile (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the specific molecular determinants associated with the TDP across tumor types, it will be interesting to investigate the possible benefit of a cisplatin and PARP inhibitor combination in TDP tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we envision that the TDP assessment may provide a unique genome sequence-based predictive marker for platinum-based drug sensitivity and allow for detailed interrogation of more precise mechanisms of cisplatin sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WGS_Datasets_and_TDP_Classification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A catalog of somatic structural variation data was compiled from a number of WGS studies, comprising a total of 277 tumor samples, as listed in Dataset S1 (4, 9, 10, 1522).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We manually curated the available structural variation information (relative orientation and mapping coordinates of the discordant mate-pair or paired-end read clusters) from every individual study to classify each reported somatic event into one of the four basic rearrangements: deletion, TD, inversion, or interchromosomal translocation (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For studies that reported structural variation coordinates relative to the hg18 reference human genome, a lift over to hg19 was performed using the Galaxy Lift-Over tool (https://usegalaxy.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous attempts at describing the genomic features of the TDP have relied on a basic TD count or on the proportion of TDs relative to the total number of structural variations in a cancer genome (10, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These approaches lack in robustness, because they are prone to be influenced by observer and technical biases, such as sequencing coverage, and are not able to discriminate between the genome-wide TD prevalence that characterizes the TDP vs. abnormal TD accumulation in a few functional genomic loci, previously described in association with focal amplification (9, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our proposed metric to calculate the TDP score is described in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A visualization of the TDP score distribution density plot across all samples suggested a multimodal distribution (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the normalmixEM function of the mixtools package in R to fit different numbers of mixture components (up to five) to the TDP score value distribution (50), using default estimates as the starting values for the iterative procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the resulting mixture model estimates using the Bayesian information criterion and found that a trimodal distribution corresponded to the optimal fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TCGA_Genomic_Datasets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 CNV datasets for primary tumor tissues were downloaded from the TCGA Data Portal in the form of level 3 CNV data type (CNV segments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary tumor samples from the TCGA breast invasive carcinoma dataset were classified as TNBC (TNB) or non-TNBC (NTNB), according to TCGA clinical annotations (28) (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TCGA somatic mutation data for the TNB, NTNB, OV, and UCEC datasets were downloaded from the UCSC Cancer Genomic Browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu) as gene-based somatic mutation calls generated by the TCGA PANCANCER Analysis Working Group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sample, any gene affected by at least one nonsilent somatic mutation (nonsense, missense, short insertion/deletion, splice site mutation, stop codon read-through) was considered somatically mutated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) gene expression data for the TNB, NTNB, OV, and UCEC datasets were downloaded from the TCGA Data Portal in the form of level 3 RSEM raw expression estimates, generated using the TCGA RNA Sequencing Version 2 analysis pipeline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw gene read counts were then scale-normalized using the trimmed mean of M-values normalization method before being converted into log counts per million with associated precision weights using the voom transformation included in the limma package in R (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detection_of_TD-Like_Features_Based_on_Copy_Number_Profiling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the assumption that an isolated TD within any given genomic locus will result in a chromosomal segment with uniform, increased copy number compared with its two adjacent genomic regions, we scanned SNP array genomic data for CNV profiles indicative of TD-like features (i.e., copy number segments with a length ranging from 1 kb to 2 Mb, characterized by a copy number increase of one or more units and flanked by segments of equal copy number) (15) (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identified TD-like features were then used to compute TDP scores following the same metric and threshold applied for WGS data (as described in Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Differential_Gene_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify DEGs between any two given groups of samples, the RNA-seq expression dataset was first filtered and only genes whose expression value was 1 in at least n  1 samples [with n = number of samples in the smallest sample group (i.e., TDP, non-TDP)] were retained for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample group comparisons were carried out using the moderated t statistic of the limma package in R (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A false discovery rate-adjusted P-value threshold of 0.05 was used to identify DEGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

GO_Enrichment_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gene enrichment analyses for GO terms were carried out using the topGO package in R (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, predefined lists of interesting genes were tested for their enrichment in GO terms against the all-gene background using Fishers exact test as the test statistic and the eliminating genes (elim) algorithm as the method for GO graph structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GO terms with less than 10 annotated genes were removed from the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Culture_and_IC50_Determination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of the cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were authenticated by short tandem repeat DNA profiling and regularly tested for Mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert PLUS Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MB436, HCC38, HCC1187, HCC1395, MDA-MB231, HCC1937, HCC1599, HCC1143, HCC70, DU4475, MDA-MB157, and HCC1806 were maintained in RPMI with 10% (vol/vol) FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BT549 was maintained in DMEM with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, and Hs578T was maintained in DMEM with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 0.01 mg/mL bovine insulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IC50 value determinations were obtained by plating target cells in 96-well plates at a density of 15 × 103 cells per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, cisplatin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or carboplatin (Selleck Chemicals) was added in triplicate wells to the culture medium in half-log serial dilutions in the range of 3.3 nM to 100 M. Cells were incubated for 72 h before assessing cell viability using a WST-8 assay (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absorbance values were normalized to control wells (medium only), and IC50 values were calculated using the IC50 R package (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two independent replicate experiments were carried out for each cell line and each treatment, and the average IC50 value from the two experiments was used for the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

WGS_of_TNBC_Cell_Lines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell line genomic DNA was isolated from 1 × 106 cells using a DNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and fragmented using Covaris E220 (Covaris) to a range of sizes centered on 500 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paired-end DNA libraries were constructed using a NEBNext DNA Library Prep Master Mix set for Illumina (New England BioLabs), including a bead-based size selection to select for inserts with an average size of 500 bp and 10 cycles of PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting libraries were quantified by quantitative PCR and pooled in groups of two before being sequenced on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fastq files were paired and run through the next-generation sequencing (NGS) quality control (QC) Toolkit (version 2.3; IlluQC_PRLL.pl) with a quality control cutoff of 30, before alignment to the human reference genome (National Center for Biotechnology Information Build 37 from the 1000 Genomes Project) using bwa (version 0.7.4) and default parameters (bwa mem).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hydra-Multi algorithm (54) was used to predict structural variation events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All datasets were analyzed at the same time, and structural variation events were filtered as described by Malhotra et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only structural variations exclusive to individual datasets were considered for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WGS data are freely available from the Sequence Read Archive database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under project ID SRP057179.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

TD-Inside_and_TD-Boundary_Genes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A catalog of genes mapping to regions spanned by a TD [TD-inside genes (i.e., genes that are completely embedded inside a TD)] in breast cancer was generated by intersecting gene bodies coordinates (defined according to the TCGA General Annotation Files library) with TDs coordinates for the 23 TDP breast cancer samples analyzed, and requiring TDs to overlap 100% of each gene feature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 5% largest TDs were removed from the analysis, because they are more likely to generate gene count biases, which resulted in a total number of 3,475 TDs, with a maximum span size of 4.1 Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, gene features that are only partially spanned by any given TD (i.e., genes whose bodies are interrupted by at least one TD breakpoint) were labeled as TD-boundary genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify genes found inside or at the boundary of TDs at a statistically significant frequency (i.e., frequently TD-affected genes), we compared observed gene counts with expected values as estimated through 1,000 random gene samplings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sampling, we computed the number of TD-inside and TD-boundary genes and stored the value corresponding to the median gene count + 2 SDs to build empirical distributions of expected TD-inside and TD-boundary gene counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frequently TD-affected genes were then identified by setting a gene count threshold equal to the round-up integer of the maximum value obtained in the empirical distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to this calculation, we considered as significantly frequent any gene characterized by a count equal to or higher than 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full lists of frequently TD-affected genes are provided in Dataset S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a similar way, we computed lists of genes frequently affected by TD-like features using the TDs coordinates corresponding to a total of 418 TDP tumors analyzed using SNP array data (TNB, NTNB, OV, and UCEC datasets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the gene count empirical distribution obtained by generating 1,000 random gene samplings, we set significance thresholds at 5 and 11 for genes frequently found at the TD boundaries and inside TDs, respectively (Fig S4B and Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cancer_Gene_Lists  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A list of 1,035 known tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) was generated as the union of (i) known recessive TSGs according to the Cancer Gene Census (56), (ii) homozygously inactivated genes observed by WGS in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database (57), (iii) genes tagged by Entrez Query: Tumour Suppressor in the CancerGenes database (58) (genes that also matched the Entrez Query: Oncogene search were considered ambiguous and manually reassigned to the correct gene list in case of clear literature evidence or excluded from both lists in case of uncertainty), and (iv) human protein coding TSGs as described in the TSGene database (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these genes, 1,020 matched gene symbols reported in the TCGA expression dataset and were used for enrichment analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A list of 962 known oncogenes was generated as the union of (i) genes tagged by Entrez Query: Oncogene: in the CancerGenes database (58) (genes that also matched the Entrez Query: Tumour Suppressor search were considered ambiguous and manually reassigned to the correct gene list in case of clear literature evidence or excluded from both lists in case of uncertainty), (ii) genes amplified and overexpressed in cancer (60), or (iii) essential genes (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these genes, 921 matched gene symbols reported in the TCGA expression dataset and were used for enrichment analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
STOP and GO genes were identified as genes that negatively and positively regulate cell proliferation, respectively, through a genome-wide shRNA screening by Solimini et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 3,596 STOP and 1,127 GO genes identified in the study, 3,377 and 1,039 matched gene symbols reported in the TCGA expression dataset, respectively, and were used for enrichment analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genes associated with the prognosis data (good and poor prognosis genes) of patients with breast cancer were identified as previously described (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pol2_and_Histone_Modification_ChIP-Sequencing_Data_Retrieval_and_Enrichment_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peaks corresponding to a total of 43 Pol2 ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments across a variety of cell lines were downloaded from the ENCODE January 2011 data freeze (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histone modification peaks relative to the human mammary epithelial cell line (HMEC) were downloaded from ENCODE, under accession number GSE29611.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histone modification data relative to the variant human mammary epithelial cell line (vHMEC) were obtained from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project (accession number GSE16368) (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peaks were called using MACS2.09 software (64, 65) with the following settings macs2 callpeak --nomodel and --shiftsize 100 --broad --keep-dup=1, and using matching input ChIP-seq datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The enrichment of Pol2 binding and histone modification marks in the vicinity of TD breakpoints was calculated as described elsewhere (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, for each breast cancer TD breakpoint, we defined a symmetrical genomic window extending 200 kb upstream and downstream of the breakpoint coordinate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then computed the fraction of Pol2 binding regions or histone modification peaks falling within the collection of TD breakpoint windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we calculated ORs and z-scores of the enrichment/depletion of Pol2 protein binding or histone modification marks within the defined TD breakpoint windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PDXs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TNBC PDX models were established at The Jackson Laboratory campus (JAX-West) and tested for cisplatin sensitivity as previously published (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, patient tumor material acquired from biopsy or surgical resection was implanted subcutaneously into the flank of NOD-scid IL-2r gamma-chain null female mice (810 weeks old).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models were considered established when log-phase growth in a second passage was evident.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual tumor-bearing mice were randomized into treatment cohorts of at least six animals each on an accrual basis when tumors reached a volume of 150 mm3 (day 0), at which point each tumor model was assessed for its response to cisplatin treatment administered at a dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight and following a 3-wk regimen consisting of one i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection per week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in tumor volumes were measured twice a week for a full 4 wk from the beginning of the treatment or until tumor volumes reached the 1,500-mm3 end point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment outcome was evaluated in terms of total response (percentage of tumor shrinkage/growth at day 20 relative to day 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the seven TNBC PDX models that were available as part of The Jackson Laboratory inventory of TNBC PDX live tumor-bearing mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination with a high number of replicates per model (610 animals per treatment arm), we obtained enough power to observe the statistically significant effect of the TDP configuration on cisplatin response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A fragment of the original engrafted tumors was used for DNA and RNA isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nextera mate-pair genomic libraries were generated and sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 Illumina platform, as described elsewhere (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequenced reads were analyzed through Xenome (67) against a combined human Hg19 and mouse Mm10 reference to identify and remove any mouse contaminant read pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural variations were then predicted using a custom structural variation pipeline that combines the Hydra-Multi (54, 55) and DELLY (68) algorithms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural variation data obtained from the peripheral blood lymphocyte DNA of four independent individuals (9) were used to remove germline variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA-seq libraries were generated following the Illumina TruSeq paired-end library preparation protocol and were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 Illumina platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the filtering of mouse reads using Xenome, human-specific paired-end reads were aligned to the hg19/GRCh37-based UCSC gene reference transcriptome using Bowtie2, and RSEM (69) was used to estimate the abundance of each individual gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upper quartile normalization was performed within each tumor sample after discarding genes with no counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, gene expression levels were adjusted using a percentile rank transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Response_Calls  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The in vivo response to chemotherapy treatment was measured based on the percentage tumor volume change (Vol) at day 20 compared with its baseline (day 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The criteria for response were adapted from Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria (70) and defined as follows: complete response, Vol less_than 80%; partial response, 80% less_than Vol less_than 30%; stable disease, 30% less_than Vol less_than 20%; progressive disease, Vol  20%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

OncoPrints  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
OncoPrints were generated using the OncoPrinter tool from the cBioPortal website (71, 72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
