Full superconducting dome of strong Ising protection in gated monolayer WS2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compared with 3D superconductors, atomically thin superconductors are expected to be easier to engineer for electronic applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use field effect gating to induce superconductivity in a monolayer semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide, WS2, grown by chemical vapor deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remarkable doping range allows access to a cascade of electronic phases from a band insulator, a superconductor, to a reentrant insulator at high doping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large spin-orbit coupling of 30 meV makes the Ising paring in WS2 arguably the most strongly protected superconducting state against external magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wide tunability revealed by spanning over a complete superconducting dome paves the way for the integration of monolayer superconductors to functional electronic devices exploiting the field effect control of quantum phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many recent studies show that superconductivity not only exists in atomically thin monolayers but can exhibit enhanced properties such as a higher transition temperature and a stronger critical field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, besides being unstable in air, the weak tunability in these intrinsically metallic monolayers has limited the exploration of monolayer superconductivity, hindering their potential in electronic applications (e.g., superconductorsemiconductor hybrid devices).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that using field effect gating, we can induce superconductivity in monolayer WS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition, a typical ambient-stable semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), and we are able to access a complete set of competing electronic phases over an unprecedented doping range from band insulator, superconductor, to a reentrant insulator at high doping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the superconducting dome, the Cooper pair spin is pinned by a strong internal spinorbit interaction, making this material arguably the most resilient superconductor in the external magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reentrant insulating state at positive high gating voltages is attributed to localization induced by the characteristically weak screening of the monolayer, providing insight into many dome-like superconducting phases observed in field-induced quasi-2D superconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The monolayer WS2 flakes used in our experiments are grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high quality of the as-grown crystalline sheets is confirmed by the observation of strong photoluminescence (PL) and a mobility of   300 cm2/Vs at 10 K and at optimal gating, which is comparable to or higher than for its cleaved counterparts (38) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An electronically homogeneous part exhibiting a uniform PL is isolated by etching a standard Hall-bar from a pristine triangular monolayer (Supporting Information, section 1) and fabricated into a dual-gate configured device composed of an ionic liquid top gate (VTG) and a dielectric back gate (285 nm SiO2 on a highly doped silicon substrate, VBG) as shown in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dual-gating method allows both coarse and fine electrostatic control of quantum phases (Supporting Information, section 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying first an ionic gate at T 220 K, we can introduce an extremely strong electrostatic field effect, which is subsequently fixed by freezing the ionic liquid below its glass transition temperature Tg  190 K. By grounding the ionic gate and sequentially warming the device slightly above Tg, we are then able to create dense coarse doping states (color coded in Fig 1B), which can be seamlessly linked at low temperatures by VBG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quasi-continuous transfer curve thus obtained (black curve in Fig 1B) defines electronic phases as a function of effective gate voltage Veff (Supporting Information, section 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that on both sides of optimal doping, the dependence of Hall carrier density on Veff is opposite: positive on the left, but negative on the right, relating to the reentrant insulating phase at low temperatures (for more discussion see Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Around optimal doping, there is a crossover linking two monotonic correspondences (as elaborated in Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we use Veff instead of Hall carrier density to label states across the whole spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a simple capacitance model cannot be applied directly to our dual gated device (39), Veff generally scales linearly with the number of charge carriers injected into the sample, which is equivalent to the nominal stoichiometry of intercalated/doped bulk compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Veff dependence of the sheet resistance Rs (Fig 1B) at 2 K (diamond), 10 K (triangle), 70 K (square), and 150 K (circle) gives an overview of the whole spectrum of electronic states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between two insulating phases, metallic transport appears at intermediate values of Veff accompanied by a transition into a superconducting state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At Veff = 1,130 V, optimal transport shows the lowest Rs and the highest superconducting transition temperature Tc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The temperature dependence of Rs on the left and right sides of optimal doping is shown in Fig 1 C and D, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The curves reveal that superconductivity emerges from a nonmetallic state (dRs/dT less_than 0, Fig 1C) when approaching optimal doping from the low gating side and quenches into another insulating state at high gating (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, a full spectrum of electronic phases can be prepared using a single tuning parameter Veff, allowing the properties of different quantum phasessuch as the quantitative dependence of superconductivity on Veff (Insets in Fig 1 C and D)to be analyzed in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The full phase diagram is shown in Fig 2, with the superconducting dome spanning the range 0.8 kV  Veff  1.6 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Throughout, Tc is defined as the temperature at which Rs falls to 50% of its normal state value.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Veff dependence of the Hall carrier density nHall (Fig 2, Lower) indicates that Tc is mainly driven by changes in the carrier density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the separation between the maxima of Tc and nHall (10 K) suggests that Tc may also be affected by electron-impurity scattering, as inferred from the opposite Veff dependence of carrier mobility  (T = 10 K, right axis in Fig 2, Lower) extracted from Rs (Fig 1B) above and below the Tc maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably in MoS2 (27), a similarly gated superconducting dome follows Tc  (n2D  n0)zv, where zv  0.6 is the product of exponents for correlation length (z) and correlation time (v) in scaling theory (3, 7), in analogy to that found for LaSrO3/SrTiO3 interfaces (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present monolayer superconductor, the limited temperature range precludes a resolution of the scaling exponents and the exact locations of the two quantum critical points (QCPs, denoted roughly by two dashed circles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, within the experimentally accessible phase space, the voltage dependence of Tc does not contradict the relationship seen in the other two systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In many quasi-2D superconductors, quasi-metallic (qM) regions have been inferred (7, 40, 41), in which Rs exhibits a temperature dependence weaker than exponential although overall dRs/dTless_than0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we define Tmin as the temperature at which Rs reaches a minimum (Fig 1 C and D) presumably from competition between electron-phonon scattering and Anderson localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2, the trace of Tmin (empty squares, Upper) marks the boundary of the qM regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that the qM region here is manifest in a finite-size sample at intermediate temperatures, which might cross over to insulating behavior at lower temperatures and/or in larger samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We leave this question open to future investigations to be conducted at milliKelvin temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An outstanding feature of the 2D superconductivity in TMD materials is the Ising pairing (23, 36, 37) that originates from the valley coupled spin texture found in monolayer TMDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this circumstance, the spins of the Cooper pairs become pinned by a strong out-of-plane effective magnetic field that is generated by an intrinsic Zeeman-type spinorbit interaction (SOC) pointing oppositely in K/K valleys (Fig 3B, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Zeeman fieldnormally the universal pair-breaking mechanism in superconductorshere strongly protects the Cooper pair against an orthogonal (in-plane) external magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with other quasi-2D Ising superconductors such as ion-gated multilayer MoS2, where the electronic wave function is confined to the uppermost layer and Ising pairing is protected by SOC 6 meV (36), the much heavier transition metal in WS2 creates SOC that is five times larger (30 meV) (42), pointing to an even higher in-plane upper critical field Bc2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stronger SOC in WS2, and hence larger spin splitting, can result in an archetypal spin texture for Ising pairing, which avoids the crossing of two lower lying spin-split conduction bands in MoS2 when the Fermi level moves further away from the band edge at K/K points (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, the SOC in WS2 is more than one order of magnitude larger than the superconducting order parameter calculated from maximum Tc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this sense, monolayer WS2 may provide an elegant platform to probe unconventional Ising pairing theoretically predicted for this system (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Guided by the phase diagram established in Fig 2A, we succeeded to induce superconductivity in another sample B with an optimal Tc = 3.15 K (Fig 3A, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed lower Tc here is possibly due to the more defective crystal, as the interaction between electrons and charged scatterers would renormalize the superconducting order parameter (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also consistent with the lower mobility of sample B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bc2s were measured in three representative regions of the dome, as shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the strongest Ising protection was measured near the lower edge of the dome, where relatively weak electric fields cause a minimum Rashba effect (36) (Fig 3A, Upper: Tc = 1.54 K only shifted by Tc = 0.08 K for an in-plane field B// as high as 35 T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following mean-field theory (36) (also see Supporting Information, section 6), we can estimate the contribution from Zeeman-type SOC and Rashba splitting to the enhancement of Bc2 (relative to the Pauli limit Bp = 1.86 Tc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison with experimental data (solid red points) is shown in Fig 3B (red line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a Rashba effect created through ionic gating of order 0.7 meVthat is, as found near the left QCP of MoS2 (36)the obtained Zeeman-type SOC is found to be 30 meV, consistent with theoretical calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neglecting the Rashba contribution, our data set a lower bound of 19.5 meV for Zeeman SOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the very large Bc2 for states at the peak (Fig 3A, Middle) and the upper edge (Fig 3A, Lower) of the dome, the change of Tc at a maximum field of 12 T is below the measurement accuracy for extracting quantitative values of the SOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 3B, we compared the ratio Bc2/Bp of other superconductors where the Pauli limit is significantly violated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the gated monolayer WS2, Bc2/Bp is at least as large as those in the UCoGe (47) and the submonolayer Pb film (48) protected by triplet pairing and Rashba splitting, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is much larger than other recently discovered Ising-protected superconductors such as multilayer MoS2 (36) and monolayer NbSe2 (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the Zeeman SOC in the NbSe2 (70 meV, valence band) is even larger than that in both MoS2 (6 meV) and WS2 (30 meV), yet the level of protection in monolayer NbSe2 and bulk (LaSe)1.14(NbSe2) (49) (resembling decoupled monolayers at low temperatures) merely approaches that found in gated MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar mismatch also appears in TaS2(Py)0.5 (50), where the pairing occurs also in the valence band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction in Ising protection could be influenced by a competing charge density wave (CDW) phase and the contributions from a spin degenerate  point (51), which might effectively weaken the strong Ising pairing formed at the K/K valleys of NbSe2 and TaS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another prominent feature of the data is the reversible reentrance into a strongly insulating state at high Veff, which is closely related to how the superconductivity is suppressed beyond optimal doping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we rule out the possibility of electrochemical reaction between WS2 and ion liquid as seen from the high repeatability of sample performances in consecutive gating processes (comparison of transport behavior is shown in Fig S6, and more is elaborated in Supporting Information, section 3.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, recent advances in studies of semiconducting WS2 (42) could safely exclude many exotic(intrinsic) mechanisms as well, such as the opening of a Mott, CDW, or Kondo gap, and the enhanced correlation effects (52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, extrinsic mechanisms, which take into account the charged ions on the sample surface (54), may be more relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical examples include narrow-band materials such as rubrene (55) and ReS2 (56) where Mott- and Anderson-type localization were proposed, respectively, and wide-band materials like silicon inversion layers (54, 57, 58) with Coulomb traps and strong short-range scattering from rough surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this universal insulating phase, in the following, we focus on the common fact that all of the above examples involve ionic gating (either by ion liquid or alkaline metal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inspection of Arrhenius plots (Fig 4A) yields similar insulating behavior at high temperatures for both the low and high gating sides of the dome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without knowledge of the underlying transport mechanism, we tentatively extract a characteristic energy scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4B, although the two energy scales are similar in magnitude, their dependences on Veff have the opposite sign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature dependence of nHall also confirms insulating behavior at large Veff, manifesting as a freeze-out of carriers within a large range of gate voltages including the whole superconducting dome (Veff from 0.8 to 1.6 kV, Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a nearly temperature-independent nHall is observed only in the qM region near the left QCP at low Veff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To account for the above observation about activation energy and Hall carrier density, we adopt a scenario of a gate-induced band variation as sketched in Fig 4D, which is based on the fact that randomly arranged charged ions can trap the induced carriers (54, 58) as well as disturb periodic lattice potential (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a truly 2D system, weak out-of-plane screening exposes induced carriers directly to the potential of ions lying on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localization effect depends on the distance l between induced carriers and charge centers of the cations (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low Veff less_thanless_than 1.1 kV, ions accumulated by the weak electric field create a uniform potential, while at large Veff  1.1 kV, the discreteness of the ions at a reduced l can no longer be averaged out by the characteristically weak 2D screening effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased randomness enlarges the band tail (Fig 4E) where more carriers localize, reducing the number of free carriers available for band transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the high gating limit and low temperature, every induced carrier is localized/bounded on site by the potential of an adjacent ionthat is, forming electroncation pairs that mimic the hydrogen impurity model (Fig 4E, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strongly localized electrons in the reentrant regime would form an impurity band, thereby reducing the Fermi level with increasing gate voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the temperature is lower, charge transport deviates from single thermal activation from impurity band to conduction band, which is likely due to an additional conduction channel involving hopping between localization centers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With this physical picture in mind, we can understand the shift in maxima between nHall (10 K) and Tc in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from Veff 1,130 V, where Tc peaks, nHall decreases from 160 K to10 K more rapidly at higher Veff, due to the stronger localization originating from more and deeper Coulomb traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such localization of induced carriers neutralizes Coulomb traps (Fig 4D, dashed line), which then acts as short-range scattering centers and leads to a decrease in mobility (Fig 2, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, compared with its counterpart (with the same Tc) on the left side of the dome peak, the state on the right side resides in a more disordered environment that cancels out the effect of higher carrier density on critical temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the interplay between carrier density and disorder shapes the superconducting dome versus Veff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering that electrostatic gating by polarizing dielectrics (polarized dipole) and ionic media (cationanion pair) is similar in principle, the competing quantum phases induced in the present study represent the high field limit with respect to those superconducting domes reported previously (27, 29, 3133, 40, 53) (Fig S7), where either a very strong field effect or an isolated monolayer crystal was missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this truly 2D system, localized states can now be easily formed because of the slow 1/r3 decay of the ion potential, indicating that any disorder in the potential landscape has a long-range effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in quasi-2D systems, gate-induced carriers always extend to a finite thickness; strong gating populates multiple subbands, causing crossover to 3D, which enhances screening and thereby reduces carrier localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this sense, the proposed scenario provides a clear understanding of the power law/logarithmic correction in the normal state resistance as the precursor of a reentrant insulator in ion-gated bulky materials (silicon, rubrene, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and universally observed superconducting dome in gated multilayer MoS2 (27), TiSe2 (31), ZrNCl (32), as well as LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface (40, 59), where accessing the right QCP and the insulating state subsequent to the superconducting dome is prohibited by the enhanced screening in these quasi-2D systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
