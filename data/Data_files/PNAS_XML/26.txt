Fibroblast growth factor 9 is a novel modulator of negative affect  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Molecular mechanisms mediating negative emotion and contributing to major depression remain elusive: here, we present evidence implicating fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) as a key mediator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use whole-transcriptome studies of postmortem human tissue to demonstrate that FGF9 is elevated in depression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reverse translation animal studies demonstrate that both endogenous and exogenous FGF9 promotes anxiety- and depression-like behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, localized blockade of endogenous FGF9 expression decreases anxiety behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this paper is the first description of hippocampal FGF9 function and the first evidence implicating FGF9 in negative affect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, FGF9 represents a novel target for treating affective disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our findings suggest that FGF2 and FGF9 work in functional opposition; we hypothesize that the balance between FGF factors may prove critical for optimal regulation of mood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both gene expression profiling in postmortem human brain and studies using animal models have implicated the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family in affect regulation and suggest a potential role in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FGF2, the most widely characterized family member, is down-regulated in the depressed brain and plays a protective role in rodent models of affective disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, using three microarray analyses followed by quantitative RT-PCR confirmation, we show that FGF9 expression is up-regulated in the hippocampus of individuals with MDD, and that FGF9 expression is inversely related to the expression of FGF2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because little is known about FGF9s function in emotion regulation, we used animal models to shed light on its potential role in affective function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that chronic social defeat stress, an animal model recapitulating some aspects of MDD, leads to a significant increase in hippocampal FGF9 expression, paralleling the elevations seen in postmortem human brain tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic intracerebroventricular administration of FGF9 increased both anxiety- and depression-like behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, knocking down FGF9 expression in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus using a lentiviral vector produced a decrease in FGF9 expression and ameliorated anxiety-like behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results suggest that high levels of hippocampal FGF9 play an important role in the development or expression of mood and anxiety disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the relative levels of FGF9 in relation to other members of the FGF family may prove key to understanding vulnerability or resilience in affective disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This series of studies is the first, to our knowledge, to link the dysregulation of hippocampal FGF9 to affective disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using microarray data from several analyses with qRT-PCR validation, we showed that FGF9 expression is increased in the postmortem hippocampus of individuals diagnosed with MDD relative to nonpsychiatric controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that FGF9 expression is negatively correlated with FGF2 expression, as well as with three FGF receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address the functional significance of these observations in human brain, we performed a complementary series of experiments in a rodent model to better characterize the role of FGF9 in affective processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic social defeat stress decreased social interaction and body weight in our animals and was associated with increased hippocampal FGF9 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic FGF9 administration increased both anxiety- and depression-like behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, knocking down FGF9 expression in the dentate gyrus decreased anxiety-like behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These animal studies provide converging, complementary evidence for the role of FGF9 as an anxiogenic and prodepressant agent in the rodent brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, this body of work suggests that FGF9 is an endogenous factor that enhances vulnerability to negative affect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we believe that FGF9 is the first growth factor to be described as having a sustained anxiogenic and prodepressant role in the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an agent that blocks the effects of FGF9 may be useful in treating human affective disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FGF9_Expression_Is_Dysregulated_in_the_Postmortem_Hippocampus_from_Individuals_Diagnosed_with_MDD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using microarray and qRT-PCR, we observed a significant increase in hippocampal FGF9 expression in individuals with MDD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe a decrease in BDNF, GDNF, or FGF2 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In previous studies, other groups have observed a decrease in hippocampal FGF2 expression in depressed patients using mRNA ISH (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason behind the discrepancy in our results is not clear, but may be due to differences in technique (microarray vs. mRNA ISH) or because tissue pH was higher in our study, and low pH can impact gene expression (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, factors such as comorbid anxiety or a treatment history that includes antidepressant drugs would likely influence these transcripts, and we could not fully account for these factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We uncovered a significant negative correlation between hippocampal FGF9 expression and FGF2 expression in postmortem hippocampal tissue, and this relationship may indicate that these transcripts work in functional opposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this idea, we have previously observed contrasting patterns of FGF2 and FGF9 expression in other brain regions from individuals diagnosed with MDD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, FGF2 expression was reduced and FGF9 expression was elevated in the frontal cortices (3) and locus coeruleus (4) of the depressed brain relative to controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The negative correlations between FGF9 expression and other FGFs also underscore the biological significance of FGF9 dysregulation in affective disorders: these relationships indicate that FGF9 may be acting in a complex network of molecules, and the alterations in FGF9 expression are concurrent with changes in other FGF family members that we have previously observed to impact affective behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these human studies are, by nature, correlational, and do not address whether these changes are a by-product of an underlying pathology associated with MDD or if they are part of the disease process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, many of the patients had a treatment history including antidepressants and/or other psychoactive drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the clinical and the toxicology data revealed a great deal of heterogeneity in drug exposure, making it difficult to analyze the impact of these drugs on the expression of FGF9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it will be important for future animal studies to ascertain whether psychoactive drugs can modify the expression of FGF9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted above, such studies on FGF2 indicate that the dysregulation we observed in MDD is not secondary to these treatments, but occurs despite them: antidepressants induce FGF2 and mediate their actions in part through that induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether antidepressants inhibit FGF9 expression remains to be ascertained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FGF9_Expression_Mediates_Affect_in_an_Animal_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously demonstrated that hippocampal FGF2 expression is decreased in rats subjected to 4 days of social defeat stress (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that hippocampal FGF2 expression correlates with variability in anxiety- and depression-like behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, endogenous hippocampal FGF2 expression correlated with spontaneous open arm time on the EPM in outbred rats (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, animals that naturally exhibit high anxiety-like behavior have low levels of hippocampal FGF2 (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we have demonstrated here that ten days of social defeat stress up-regulates hippocampal FGF9 expression while decreasing body weight and social interactions, correlates of increased depression-like behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are congruent with our observations from human studies and indicate that hippocampal FGF9 may play an important role in stress responsiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chronic administration of FGFs produced coordinate effects on anxiety- and depression-like behavior: FGF2 reduced anxiety- (12) and depression-like (7) behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we demonstrate here that chronic FGF9 administration increases anxiety-like and depression-like behavior, demonstrating again that the two FGFs have opposing effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that antidepressant and anxiolytic medications induce growth factor expression (911), it may be that administering growth factors directly activates the same physiological mechanisms as classical anxiolytics and antidepressants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, work from others indicates FGF2 is necessary for the positive effect of antidepressants (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, one limitation of our FGF9 administration studies is the lack of anatomical specificity: that is, that administration into the lateral ventricle likely affects many brain regions in addition to the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other regions, including the prefrontal cortices, are also likely to be involved in the behavioral expression of these changes in negative affect, and future studies can better elucidate the function of FGF9 in these regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altering endogenous gene expression using transgenic mice or viral-mediated knockdown can be used to demonstrate that hippocampal growth factor expression is necessary for appropriate spontaneous regulation of affective behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously used a lentiviral vector to knock down FGF2 expression in the dentate gyrus of outbred rats, increasing anxiety-like behavior on the EPM (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, knocking down hippocampal FGF2 eliminated basal behavioral differences in selectively bred rats that typically exhibit differences in spontaneous anxiety-like behavior (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we demonstrate here that using a lentiviral vector to knock down FGF9 expression bilaterally in the dentate gyrus decreases anxiety-like behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, unlike the results of the administration experiments, our knockdown experiments have produced effects on anxiety-like, but not depression-like, behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings may result from several factors: (i) the magnitude of the knockdown: the degree of FGF9 knockdown (30%) may not be sufficient to alter depression-like behavior; (ii) partial effect: FGF9 knockdown in the dentate gyrus may increase vulnerability to depression-like behavior, but stress exposure may be required to uncover behavioral changes; and/or (iii) anatomical specificity: our injections were highly localized to the dentate gyrus and had limited spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region may be critical to the regulation of anxiety behavior, but may be less pivotal in the control of depression-like behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, FGF9 may play somewhat different roles in separate components of the negative affect circuitry, regulating anxiety in the dentate gyrus but depression-like behavior in other brain regions, including the prefrontal cortices and/or mesolimbic dopamine system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is quite plausible as we have previously observed effects exclusive to anxiety-like behavior after knocking down FGF2 expression selectively in the dentate gyrus (14, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies can examine these possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It should be noted that MDD and anxiety disorders are often comorbid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically 75% of MDD patients exhibit comorbid anxiety (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our records document the existence of comorbid clinical anxiety in 58% of the MDD subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This figure is likely an underestimate due to the methods for psychological autopsy in our Brain Bank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, additional studies are needed to examine whether factors known to influence gene expression in MDD, including comorbid anxiety, impact hippocampal FGF9 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, it will be of interest to study the role of FGF9 in other brain regions implicated in MDD, including the prefrontal cortices and mesolimbic dopamine circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may also be fruitful to more fully explore the impact of classical antidepressants on hippocampal FGF9 levels in postmortem human tissue, and animal studies involving antidepressant administration and other resilience-inducing manipulations (including environmental enrichment) can be used to clarify effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrated here that FGF9 is an anxiogenic and prodepressant growth factor in the hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FGF9 expression was up-regulated in the postmortem hippocampus of individuals with MDD, and psychosocial stress, a model of depression in rodents, increased FGF9 gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronically, exogenous FGF9 increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior, whereas knocking down endogenous FGF9 expression reduced anxiety-like behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results contrast to a body of work indicating that high levels of hippocampal FGF2 may promote resilience (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we hypothesize that FGF2 and FGF9 act as physiological antagonists to mediate emotionality and vulnerability to mood disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, this body of work suggests that blocking the actions of hippocampal FGF9 offers a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of anxiety and depression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To understand the regulation of key FGF ligands and receptors after our experimental procedures, tissue was collected 24 h following the last behavioral task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All rats were killed by rapid decapitation, and their brains were removed, snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane, and stored at 80 °C until sectioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue was sectioned at 20 °C at 10 µm (n = 56/group for social defeat and FGF9 administration experiments, n = 1014/group for knockdown experiments), sliced in series throughout the hippocampus, mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific), and returned to 80 °C until processing .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were taken every 200 µm through the hippocampus, and ISH methodology was performed as previously described in detail elsewhere (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All in situ probes were synthesized in our laboratory, and exposure times were experimentally determined for optimal signal and are as follows: FGF2 (7 d), FGF9 (1421 d), FGFR1 (7 d), and eGFP (7 d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rat mRNA sequences used for generating probes was complimentary to the following RefSeq database numbers: FGF2 (NM_019395, 716994), FGF9 (NM_012952, 661880), FGFR1 (NM_024146, 320977).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All cDNA segments were extracted (Qiaquick Gel Extraction kit; Qiagen), subcloned in Bluescript SK (Stratagene), and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probes were labeled in a reaction mixture of 1 g of linearized plasmid, 1× transcription buffer (Epicentre Technologies), 125 Ci of 35S-labeled UTP, 125 Ci of 35-S labeled CTP, 150 M ATP and GTP, 12.5 mM DTT, 1 L RNase inhibitor, and 1.5 L T7 or T3 RNA polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After hybridizing the labeled probes to the sectioned tissue, sections were thoroughly washed and exposed to Kodak BioMax MR Scientific Imaging Film (Sigma Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ISH_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Radioactive signals were quantified using computer-assisted optical densitometry software, Scion Image (Scio Corporation), or ImageJ (National Institutes of Health).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expanded quantification methods were used for knockdown experiments, described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all other experiments, integrated optical densities were determined by outlining a subfield (CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus) of the hippocampus on each hemisphere and were corrected for background plus 3.5× its SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only pixels with gray values exceeding the threshold were included in the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from multiple sections per animal were averaged resulting in a mean for each animal and an average was taken for each group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For quantification of sections from animals in the FGF9 knockdown study, we used a modified quantification approach to enable us to quantify expression of a gene target (e.g., FGF9, FGF2, or FGFR1) only where we saw concurrent expression of eGFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach also facilitated careful analysis of hippocampal anatomy impacted by viral infection on an animal-by-animal basis, which we then used to create inclusion/exclusion criteria for the behavioral analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We digitally overlaid a transparent copy of the eGFP autoradiogram (from an adjacent section) on the image of the probe of interest then outlined only the region with eGFP expression to take measurements for the probe of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there was variability in infection spread, we chose to disregard area in calculating the quantified measurements for these experiments; therefore, we present the data in terms of average optical density (mean signal background).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
eGFP autoradiograms were separately analyzed for the specific animal-by-animal infection pattern, and these data were used to define strict inclusion criteria for behavioral analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals in the knockdown study were only included in the final behavioral analysis if they showed robust expression of eGFP (the marker for successful viral infection) in the dentate gyrus of both hemispheres in at least four adjacent sections (800 µm) without additional eGFP labeling of other hippocampal or extrahippocampal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After exclusion, 8 animals were included in the shNS control group, whereas 10 animals were included in the shFGF9 group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A separate cohort of animals (n = 4 animals per group; shNS, shFGF9) underwent the same surgical procedures as those described in the behavioral knockdown study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three weeks after surgery, animals were transcardially perfused using 4% (vol/vol) PFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brains were removed and postfixed for 1 h in fresh 4% PFA and then transferred to 30% sucrose solution for 2448 h. Brains were subsequently snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane and stored at 80 °C until sectioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue was sectioned at 15 °C at 45 µm, and free-floating sections were stored in PBS at 4 °C until processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free-floating sections were rinsed three times in PBS and then blocked for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker [blocking solution: 0.3% Triton × 100 (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% normal goat serum (Invitrogen), and 1% BSA (Fisher Scientific) in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After blocking, sections were incubated overnight at room temperature on the orbital shaker in the blocking solution with the following primary antibodies: eGFP (chicken anti-GFP, 1:2,000; Abcam), NeuN (rabbit anti-NeuN, 1:300; Abcam), and GFAP (mouse anti-GFAP, 1:500; Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After primary antibody incubation, sections were washed three times in PBS and then transferred to blocking solution with the following three secondary antibodies with conjugated fluorophores (AlexaFluor488 goat anti-chicken IgG, 1:200; AlexaFluor568 goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:200; AlexaFluor 647 goat anti-mouse, 1:200; Life Technologies) to incubate for 2 h at room temperature on the orbital shaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After secondary incubation, sections were washed four to five times in PBS and mounted onto Superfrost Plus slides and coverslipped using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were imaged on an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 confocal microscope with a multiline argon laser (457, 488, and 515 nm), 405-nm diode laser, and 543- and 633-nm HeNe lasers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscope control and image acquisition was achieved using Olympus FV10 software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
