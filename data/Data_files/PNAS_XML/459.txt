title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An advanced modeling study on the impacts and atmospheric implications of multiphase dimethyl sulfide chemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Climate models indicate the importance of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation in new aerosol particle formation and the activation of cloud condensation nuclei over oceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects contribute to strong natural negative radiative forcing and substantially influence the Earths climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the DMS oxidation pathway is not well-represented, because earlier model studies only parameterized gas-phase DMS oxidation and neglected multiphase chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we performed the most comprehensive current mechanistic studies on multiphase DMS oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The studies imply that neglecting multiphase chemistry leads to significant overestimation of SO2 production and subsequent new particle formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings show that an advanced treatment of multiphase DMS chemistry is necessary to improve marine atmospheric chemistry and climate model predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oceans dominate emissions of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the major natural sulfur source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DMS is important for the formation of non-sea salt sulfate (nss-SO42) aerosols and secondary particulate matter over oceans and thus, significantly influence global climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism of DMS oxidation has accordingly been investigated in several different model studies in the past.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these studies had restricted oxidation mechanisms that mostly underrepresented important aqueous-phase chemical processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These neglected but highly effective processes strongly impact direct product yields of DMS oxidation, thereby affecting the climatic influence of aerosols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these shortfalls, an extensive multiphase DMS chemistry mechanism, the Chemical Aqueous Phase Radical Mechanism DMS Module 1.0, was developed and used in detailed model investigations of multiphase DMS chemistry in the marine boundary layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The performed model studies confirmed the importance of aqueous-phase chemistry for the fate of DMS and its oxidation products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aqueous-phase processes significantly reduce the yield of sulfur dioxide and increase that of methyl sulfonic acid (MSA), which is needed to close the gap between modeled and measured MSA concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the simulations imply that multiphase DMS oxidation produces equal amounts of MSA and sulfate, a result that has significant implications for nss-SO42 aerosol formation, cloud condensation nuclei concentration, and cloud albedo over oceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings show the deficiencies of parameterizations currently used in higher-scale models, which only treat gas-phase chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this study shows that treatment of DMS chemistry in both gas and aqueous phases is essential to improve the accuracy of model predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies with the box model SPACCIM (27) were performed to investigate multiphase DMS chemistry in the MBL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical mechanism applied combines the MCMv3.2 (25, 26) for the description of the gas phase, the CAPRAM4.0 for the description of the aqueous phase, and marine chemistry described by the multiphase mechanism HM2.1 and the newly developed CAPRAM DM1.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HM2.1 was adapted from the CAPRAM Halogen Module 2.0 (24) for the use with the MCMv3.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiphase DMS chemistry in the MBL under pristine ocean conditions was investigated based on the model scenario from the work by Br√§uer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario was extended for multiphase DMS chemistry by implementing the DMS emission rate from the work by Lana et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28) as well as new initial concentrations and deposition rates for DMS oxidation products (Materials and Methods and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other than the base run (termed as full), different sensitivity runs were performed to study the influence of various chemical subsystems on DMS product yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All runs had identical meteorological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An outline of the different sensitivity runs is given in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The DM1.0 was developed by an extensive literature study using the most recent kinetic and mechanistic data as well as the state of the art mechanism MCMv3.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It contains 103 gas-phase reactions, five phase transfers, and 54 aqueous-phase reactions and is designed for varying atmospheric conditions ranging from a clean, remote marine atmosphere to polluted coastal conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiphase_DMS_Oxidation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A key issue in DMS chemistry is the contribution of different oxidants to its oxidation in both the gas and aqueous phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most important reaction pathways (those that contribute at least 5% to the total sink flux of multiphase DMS chemistry) including the mean reaction fluxes of each pathway over the whole simulation are presented for the full run in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It includes the main chemical processes in the gas and aqueous phases as well as phase transfer interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage contributions outlined below generally correspond to the averages over the whole simulation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the gas phase, oxidation of DMS occurs by either an H-abstraction or an addition pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abstraction pathway leads to a peroxyl radical in the first generation, whereas the addition pathway mainly results in DMSO formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition pathway dominates over the abstraction pathway, mainly because of the reaction with BrO, which accounts for 46% of DMS oxidation averaged over the whole model run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining gas-phase oxidation is mostly triggered by reaction with the chlorine atom (Cl; 3% by addition and 15% by H-abstraction) and the hydroxyl radical (OH; 9% by addition and 11% by H-abstraction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show the importance of DMS oxidation by halogens, which are mainly ignored in current parameterizations of CTMs and GCMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neglecting this chemistry will lead to inaccurate predictions of the formation of new aerosol particles, the activation of CCN, and natural radiative forcing (5, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clouds significantly lower the gas-phase concentrations of OH, Cl, and BrO (24, 30) and modify the prevailing chemistry, such that aqueous-phase reactions take over and dominate the oxidation of DMS and its oxidation products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During cloud periods, 78% of DMS (in all phases) is oxidized in the aqueous phase by ozone (O3) to DMSO (SI Appendix, Multiphase Chemistry of DMS and Its Oxidation Products, and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reaction contributes 7% to multiphase DMS oxidation over the whole model run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although consistent with the previous simulations by von Glasow and Crutzen (5), this finding is unexpected, because less than 0.01% of DMS partitions to the aqueous phase (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution is explained by the very fast kinetics of the O3 reaction, so that a large flux is established because of the reactive uptake of DMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During in-cloud periods, the overall rate of DMS degradation decreases, with the result that the gas-phase DMS concentration increases slightly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, this study has shown that halogens contribute significantly to DMS oxidation and that, during cloud periods, the aqueous-phase oxidation of DMS by O3 is dominant, whereas the overall degradation decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An overview of the fractional contributions of different oxidants in the DM1.0 to DMS oxidation in the gas and aqueous phases is given in SI Appendix, Table S13 along with fractional contributions to the oxidation of DMSO, methyl sulfinic acid (MSIA), and MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the sake of completeness, the modeled evolution of the concentrationtime profiles of DMS, DMSO, MSIA, and MSA along with comparisons with field measurements and mass flux analyses are discussed in detail in SI Appendix, Multiphase Chemistry of DMS and Its Oxidation Products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Processing_of_the_Main_DMS_Oxidation_Products  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The additional conversion of DMS oxidation products must also be considered to determine the effect of the overall DMS oxidation on natural radiative forcing and thus, Earths climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this section, we first consider the additional processing of H-abstraction products and then, examine the reactions of DMS products of the addition pathway (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main product of the H-abstraction pathway is SO2, whereas only small amounts of MSA and SO3 are formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, accumulation of reservoir gases, especially S-methyl thioformate (CH3SCHO), may reduce the conversion of DMS to SO2 because of CH3SCHO deposition to the ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, the understanding is that SO2 forms gaseous H2SO4 from OH oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results indicate that the thermal decay of CH3SO3 into SO3 represents the main contributor to gaseous H2SO4 over the open ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gaseous CH3SO3 is predominantly formed from gaseous CH3SO2, which is mainly generated by the isomerization of gaseous CH3S(OO) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the atmosphere, SO3 reacts rapidly with water vapor to form gaseous H2SO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 94% of the gaseous H2SO4 is formed because of thermal decay of CH3SO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the isomerization of gaseous CH3S(OO) is very important in determining gaseous concentrations of H2SO4 (additional details are in SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only 4% of DMS is converted into gaseous SO3, whereas 24% of DMS is converted into SO2 (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strongly reduced importance of SO2 to gaseous H2SO4 formation results from the presence of noon clouds, which enhance uptake processes and significantly reduce both the OH and SO2 concentrations, thereby suppressing gaseous production of H2SO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daytime clouds, therefore, greatly reduce the significance of SO2 as an intermediate species in the formation of gaseous H2SO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, even in the woCloud run, in which no clouds are implemented, 80% of H2SO4 is formed via the thermal decomposition of CH3SO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that, other than the gas-phase oxidation of SO2, the thermal decomposition of CH3SO3 is a main contributor to new particle formation in the MBL in the presence of clouds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the thermal decomposition of CH3SO3 may explain the gap between modeled and measured gaseous H2SO4 concentrations in coastal regions as it has been proposed before (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DMSO, formed via the oxidation of DMS by OH and BrO, is a key intermediate of the addition pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent oxidation of DMSO strongly alters new aerosol formation in the MBL (5), because it reduces the yield of SO2 from DMS oxidation by forming additional stable oxidation products, like dimethyl sulfone (DMSO2) and MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DMSO is mostly oxidized by OH to MSIA in both the gas and aqueous phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidation by halogens is of minor importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 presents the partitioning of DMSO, DMSO2, MSIA, and MSA in deliquesced particles and cloud droplets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 1% and 2% of DMSO and DMSO2, respectively, partition into deliquesced particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the less effective partitioning of DMSO into aerosols (Fig 2) compared with the more oxidized products MSIA and MSA, the aqueous-phase oxidation mainly occurs in cloud droplets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also noteworthy that, although the production of DMSO is suppressed in cloud droplets, its oxidation is increased (SI Appendix, Fig S7 and Table S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is explained by the partitioning of DMSO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the onset of cloud formation, DMSO and DMSO2 partition almost completely into cloud droplets because of their high Henrys Law coefficients (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The simulation results imply that DMSO2 formed through the OH-addition pathway or DMSO oxidation is only a minor product of DMS oxidation in a marine environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, DMSO2 oxidation is not further considered in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MSIA is the major DMSO oxidation product, and about 1040% of MSIA partitions into marine aerosols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSIA has a diurnal profile, showing stronger partitioning at night (gray shaded bars in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high solubility and formation in the aqueous phase increase the importance of aqueous-phase chemistry for the MSIA fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSIA is almost completely degraded during daytime in the aqueous phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidation is decreased during night, explaining the diurnal partitioning profile in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main oxidants are dissolved O3, OH, and Cl2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strongest sink flux is the reaction of MSIA and dissociated methyl sulfinic acid (MSI) with O3 (42%) to form MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DM1.0 is the first mechanism that has implemented these reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cl2 and OH react mainly with MSI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two oxidations have to be differentiated between oxidation in deliquesced particles and cloud droplets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxidation by Cl2 is dominant in deliquesced particles, whereas oxidation by OH dominates in cloud droplets (SI Appendix, Table S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are clearly different from the assumption in the work by Zhu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21), in which the cloud droplet Cl2 concentration was kept constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total contributions of Cl2 and OH to aqueous-phase MSIA oxidation are 10% and 19%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As explained in SI Appendix, Model and Mechanism Description, both reactions occur via an electron transfer reaction leading to high amounts of CH3SO2(O2), which reacts further with MSI to form dissolved MSA and CH3SO3 (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CH3SO3 mainly decomposes to CH3 and SO3, but small reaction fluxes with MSI occur, also forming MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the oxidation of MSI by Cl2 and OH leads to a net destruction of at least two MSIA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the reactions of MSI with CH3SO2(O2) and CH3SO3 account for 29% of MSIA depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of these reactions, MSI oxidation by Cl2 and OH produces dissolved MSA and SO3 in nearly equal amounts and oxidizes more MSIA/MSI than the O3 reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In total, 58% of the modeled MSA is produced by the aqueous-phase reactions of MSIA/MSI with O3, and 40% is caused by the aqueous-phase reactions of MSI with its oxidation products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the gas-phase formation only accounts for 2% of MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the gas-phase MSA as well as gaseous H2SO4 production depend strongly on the rate constant of the thermal decay of CH3SO3, which is very uncertain (details are in SI Appendix, Model and Mechanism Description).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, additional laboratory investigations of this thermal decay are warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSA remains almost entirely in the aqueous phase throughout the whole model run (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results, therefore, indicate that only aqueous-phase oxidation of MSA is important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of its high stability, only 2% of MSA is oxidized further by Cl2 and dissolved OH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, MSA sinks do not compete with its production, and MSA accumulates in the aerosol phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the tropospheric lifetime of marine aerosols is between 1 and 7 d (32), wet and dry deposition are likely the dominant tropospheric sinks of MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, modeling of DMS oxidation shows that the H-abstraction pathway in the gas phase leads predominantly to SO2 and that the thermal decay of gaseous CH3SO3 is the main contributor to gaseous H2SO4 formation, whereas the addition pathway leads to MSA involving multiphase processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, DMS oxidation leads to MSA and sulfate production in nearly equal amounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large fraction of MSA formed through aqueous-phase processes is different from parameterizations of the DMS addition pathway currently applied in GCMs mostly implemented after the work by Chin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SO2_and_MSA_Yields_and_Atmospheric_Implications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The contribution of DMS oxidation to natural radiative forcing is strongly influenced by the yields of SO2 and MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 shows the importance of both gas- and aqueous-phase reactions in determining product yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiphase chemistry causes a shift in the product distribution of DMS chemistry from SO2 toward MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result highlights the deficiencies of current parameterizations in climate models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from multiphase chemistry in general, the results presented in Fig 1 also highlight specific chemical subsystems (e.g., halogen chemistry or chemistry in cloud droplets) that strongly influence DMS conversion yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different sensitivity runs (Table 1) were performed to investigate the influence of these chemical subsystems on DMS conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 2 shows the results of the sensitivity runs for (i) the total yield of SO2, (ii) the yield of total MSA from DMS, and (iii) the conversion of MSA into sulfur VI [S(VI)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High background concentrations of O3 and NO2 enhance the production of SO2 and decrease the conversion into MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, oxidation of MSA increases strongly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar, albeit weaker, effect appears when halogen chemistry is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decreased conversion to MSA in the woHM2 run arises from the orders of magnitude lower gas-phase concentrations of BrO and Cl owing to the restricted halogen chemistry schemes in the MCMv3.2 and the CAPRAM4.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher MSA oxidation is caused by the slightly higher OH concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher OH concentration arises from reduced ozone depletion by halogens, which enhance the photolysis of O3 and therefore, OH production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, reactive Cl and bromine species strongly affect DMS oxidation and conversion efficiency into SO2 and MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, knowledge of tropospheric halogen chemistry is still quite restricted and needs additional investigation as Simpson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (33) have outlined in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a cloud-free MBL, the MSA yield decreases, and SO2 and MSA are produced in equal amounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect results from the higher production of Cl and BrO in a cloud-free MBL, because clouds strongly suppress halogen activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cl activation in particular is reduced during cloud periods (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H-abstraction pathway is more important under these circumstances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, marine clouds shift the DMS oxidation toward a higher production of MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neglecting aqueous-phase DMS chemistry (as in most GCMs) leads to an overestimation of SO2 formation and an underestimation of MSA production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of MSA is formed and resides in the aqueous phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an important result, because the described aqueous-phase chemistry does not lead to the formation of new particles but rather, results in an increase of aerosol mass of already existing particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This crucial finding implies that not considering multiphase DMS chemistry in CTMs and GCMs will strongly affect the modeled number concentration and mass of marine aerosols and thereby, modify radiative forcing and climate predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supposed influences are schematically depicted in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ignoring multiphase DMS chemistry could lead to an overestimation of the nss-SO42 aerosol concentration and the number of CCNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, predicted cloud albedos would be higher under these conditions, and GCMs would strongly overestimate the negative natural radiative forcing by clouds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study shows that the role of DMS on Earths climate is still not well-understood, despite many global model studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations suggest that enhanced DMS emission results in higher particulate mass but not necessarily to appreciably higher aerosol number concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model findings are also relevant to geoengineering concepts based on aerosol production via DMS generated by ocean fertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous calculations on the efficiency of this approach often assumed a total DMS to SO2 yield of unity (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of advanced multiphase modeling of DMS oxidation indicate that SO2 production is likely to be greatly suppressed and that changes in cloud albedo will likely be weaker than expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atmospheric multiphase chemistry simulations of a pristine ocean scenario show that the conversion of DMS to MSA is strongly underestimated when DMS aqueous-phase chemistry is omitted and correspondingly, that formation of SO2 is overestimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HalogenDMS interactions are also essential for the conversion efficiency of DMS to SO2 and MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations show that, despite the low solubility of DMS, marine clouds can have a major influence on DMS oxidation product yields and formation and growth of new nss-SO42 aerosols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, halogenDMS interactions and DMS aqueous-phase chemistry have a strong impact on: (i) the conversion of DMS into SO2 and MSA, (ii) the aging of marine aerosols, (iii) the production of nss-SO42 aerosols, and (iv) the radiative properties of marine clouds and aerosols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, neglecting multiphase DMS chemistry in CTMs and GCMs greatly increases the uncertainties of model predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Implementation of a near-explicit multiphase DMS mechanism, such as the DM1.0, is computationally expensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, future work will focus on the reduction of the DM1.0 for application in CTMs and parameterization development for application in GCMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model_Description  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Marine multiphase chemistry simulations were carried out with the box model SPACCIM [details are in the work by Wolke et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (27)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPACCIM allows the complex chemical processing in clouds and deliquesced particles to be investigated by combining a detailed microphysical model with a fine-resolved particle/droplet spectrum and a complex multiphase chemistry model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The applied chemical mechanism combined the MCMv3.2, the CAPRAM4.0, the HM2.1, and the DM1.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 10,212 species and 21,928 reactions were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations started on June 19 at 45¬∞ N and ran for 108 h with an assumed temperature of 280 K. In the model scenario, an air parcel is moved along a predefined trajectory starting at 850 hPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scenario includes eight cloud passages, which are achieved by lifting the air parcel from 850 to 800 hPa for about 2 h at noon and midnight, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the adiabatic cooling as the air parcel rises, the temperature falls to about 276.5 K. The in-cloud residence time of about 2 h was chosen based on the calculations by Pruppacher and Jaenicke (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noon and midnight clouds were chosen to study differences in nighttime and daytime clouds on multiphase chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanism_Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the gas-phase reactions considered in the MCMv3.2, an extended multiphase DMS chemistry mechanism, the DM1.0, has been developed in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, an extensive aqueous-phase chemistry mechanism was designed using the most recent kinetic and mechanistic data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The gas-phase reaction scheme in the DM1.0 is largely based on the DMS gas-phase oxidation mechanism of the MCMv3.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MCMv3.2 contains one of the most detailed gas-phase DMS oxidation mechanisms and is able to reproduce experimental findings (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the MCMv3.2 does not contain DMS reactions with halogen species and is also missing some reactions that are potentially important in the marine environment (e.g., reactions with the hydroperoxyl radical).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reactions can be critical for the multiphase chemistry in the MBL (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical scheme in the MCMv3.2 was extended by 23 reactions of reactive halogen compounds and 14 reactions of nonhalogen compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the gas-phase mechanism scheme of the DM1.0 contains 103 reactions, including nine photolysis processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SPACCIM calculates phase transfer processes according to the approach by Schwartz (37) by considering the gas-phase diffusion coefficient Dg, the mass accommodation coefficient , and the Henrys Law coefficient HA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parameters were implemented in the DM1.0 for uptake of DMS, DMSO, DMSO2, MSIA, and MSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The aqueous-phase mechanism of the DM1.0 contains many more intermediate steps and reaction pathways of DMS, DMSO, DMSO2, MSIA, and MSA than any other DMS aqueous-phase mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rate constants for these reactions were chosen from recent measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No literature data were available for some types of reactions (such as oxygen addition at carbon-centered radicals), and they were estimated according to the treatment of this reaction kind in the CAPRAM (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the aqueous-phase mechanism of the DM1.0 contains 49 reactions and five dissociations and represents the most detailed aqueous-phase DMS chemistry mechanism to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Briefly, the module described explicitly the tropospheric oxidation of DMS and its oxidation products by several oxidants (mainly OH, NO3, Cl, ClO, Br, BrO, Cl2, and SO4) in the gas and aqueous phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For additional information, the reader is referred to SI Appendix, Model and Mechanism Description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
