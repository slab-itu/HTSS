Targeting autophagy inhibits melanoma growth by enhancing NK cells infiltration in a CCL5-dependent manner  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The failure in achieving a durable clinical immune response against cancer cells depends on the ability of cancer cells to establish a microenvironment that prevent cytotoxic immune cells to infiltrate tumors and kill cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the key approach to achieving successful antitumor immune response is to harness strategies allowing the reorientation of immune cells to the tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein we reveal that inhibiting autophagy induces a massive infiltration of natural killer immune cells into the tumor bed, and a subsequent dramatic decrease in the tumor volume of melanomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results highlight the role of targeting autophagy in breaking the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment barrier, thus allowing the infiltration of natural killer cells into the tumor to kill cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While blocking tumor growth by targeting autophagy is well established, its role on the infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells into tumors remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigate the impact of targeting autophagy gene Beclin1 (BECN1) on the infiltration of NK cells into melanomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that, in addition to inhibiting tumor growth, targeting BECN1 increased the infiltration of functional NK cells into melanoma tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that driving NK cells to the tumor bed relied on the ability of autophagy-defective tumors to transcriptionally overexpress the chemokine gene CCL5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such infiltration and tumor regression were abrogated by silencing CCL5 in BECN1-defective tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, we show that the up-regulated expression of CCL5 occurred through the activation of its transcription factor c-Jun by a mechanism involving the impairment of phosphatase PP2A catalytic activity and the subsequent activation of JNK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to BECN1, targeting other autophagy genes, such as ATG5, p62/SQSTM1, or inhibiting autophagy pharmacologically by chloroquine, also induced the expression of CCL5 in melanoma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinically, a positive correlation between CCL5 and NK cell marker NKp46 expression was found in melanoma patients, and a high expression level of CCL5 was correlated with a significant improvement of melanoma patients survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that this study highlights the impact of targeting autophagy on the tumor infiltration by NK cells and its benefit as a novel therapeutic approach to improve NK-based immunotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Targeting_Autophagy_Related_Gene_BECN1_Improves_the_Recruitment_of_Functional_NK_Cells_into_the_Tumor_Bed  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously reported that targeting BECN1 significantly reduces the growth of B16-F10 mouse tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is primarily related to the improvement of NK-mediated tumor cell killing, as such reduction was no longer observed in NK cell-depleted mice (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although NK cells seem to play a major role in the control of B16-F10 tumor growth, it should be emphasized that the reduced BECN1-defective (BECN1) B16-F10 tumor volume was also rescued, but to a lesser extent, by the depletion of CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we investigated whether targeting BECN1 inhibits the tumor growth by improving the infiltration of NK cells into the tumor bed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry staining of tumor sections revealed a massive infiltration of NK cells into BECN1 compared with control (Ctrl) tumors (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since NK cell-infiltrating tumors could be functionally impaired/exhausted (25), we then assessed the functional properties of the NK cells that infiltrated BECN1 tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometry analysis, performed based on the gating strategy described in Fig S1, on Ctrl and BECN1 B16-F10 tumors confirmed our results obtained by immunohistochemistry result and revealed an almost twofold increase in the number of NK cell-infiltrating BECN1 tumors compared with Ctrl (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our data show that infiltrated NK cells were CD69+ and GzmB+, indicating that they were fully functional in the BECN1 tumor bed (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when reported to the total number of NK cells, no difference in the activation status of NK cells infiltrating both Ctrl and BECN1 tumors was found (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result shows that targeting BECN1 increases the number of infiltrated NK cells without affecting their activation properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data highlight that targeting BECN1 presumably inhibits the growth of B16-F10 tumors at least in part by improving the homing of functional NK cells into the tumor bed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Targeting_Autophagy_Induces_the_Expression_of_CCL5__Which_Is_Involved_in_the_Migration_of_NK_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is well established that tumors displaying high number of cytotoxic immune cells secrete high amounts of attracting chemokines (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we evaluated whether the improvement of the infiltration of NK cells into BECN1 B16-F10 tumors is related to the regulation of some chemokines involved in the migration of NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cytokine profiling assay, performed using the conditioned medium of tumor cells, revealed that targeting BECN1 increased the secretion of several chemokines, including CCL5, CXCL10, and TIMP1 (Fig 2A, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantification of the results obtained by cytokine arrays revealed that CCL5 was the predominant up-regulated cytokine in BECN1 tumor cells compared with CXCL10 or TIMP1 (Fig 2A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these data, we focused our interest on CCL5 and quantified its level in the conditioned media of Ctrl and BECN1 B16-F10 tumor cells by ELISA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2B shows that BECN1 cells secreted 4.5-fold more CCL5 compared with Ctrl cells (525 and 112 pg/mL for BECN1 and Ctrl, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The impact of targeting BECN1 on the expression of CCL5 was further assessed in human melanoma cell lines displaying low levels of CCL5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, according the expression value (log2) of CCL5 in 62 human melanoma cell lines reported by the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/), we selected three human melanoma cell linesA375, IPC298, and MelJusodisplaying a relatively low expression level of CCL5 mRNA (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2C shows that, similarly to B16-F10 cells, targeting BECN1 in A375, IPC298, and MelJuso human melanoma cell lines induced a significant increase in the secretion of CCL5, indicating that the up-regulation of CCL5 resulting from targeting BECN1 is not restricted to B16-F10 but can also be observed in other human melanoma cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further determine the involvement of CCL5 in the migration of NK cells, we tracked the migration of human NK cells toward a CCL5 gradient, using ibidi slides and a cell IQ platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2D shows that, in the absence of CCL5, NK cells migrate randomly (50% of cells to the upper and 50% to the lower compartments) in short-distance migration trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the presence of a CCL5 gradient in the upper compartment induced directional long-distance migration of 80% of the NK cells toward that compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strongly suggest that CCL5 is a key determinant for the migration of NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A growing body of evidence has revealed that, in addition to its role in autophagy, BECN1 has several nonautophagic functions (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated whether targeting other autophagy genes could also induce CCL5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first determined whether CCL5 is regulated at mRNA level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results (Fig 2E) show that, in BECN1 tumor cells, CCL5 is up-regulated at the transcription level as a significant increase in the mRNA of CCL5 was observed in BECN1 B16-F10 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, to determine to what extent the autophagy process is involved in the regulation of CCL5, we evaluated the impact of targeting other autophagy genes on the expression of CCL5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that, similarly to BECN1, targeting ATG5 or p62/SQSTM1 or treating cells with chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor (Fig 2F), resulted in a significant increase in the expression of CCL5 mRNA in B16-F10 melanoma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data provide clear evidence thatnot only BECN1 but also the autophagy processare involved in the regulation of CCL5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Targeting_BECN1_Induces_the_Expression_of_CCL5_Transcription_Factor_c-Jun  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain more insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the up-regulation of CCL5 mRNA in BECN1 B16-F10 cells, we focused our interest on the major transcription factor involved in the regulation of the CCL5 transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the promoter region of mouse and human CCL5 contains several binding sites for well-defined transcription factors (29), including AP-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first assessed whether c-Jun binds to the CCL5 promoter in B16-F10 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed in silico identification of consensus (5-TGA[C/G]TCA-3) (30) and nonconsensus (5-TGACTgA-3 or 5-TGACTCc-3) (31) motifs for the Jun/Fos AP-1 binding site on the mouse CCL5 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The promoter containing fragment has been defined using the Eukaryotic Promoter Database (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) from 8,000 to +100 bp relative to the transcription start site (TSS) of the mouse CCL5 gene (RefSeq NM_013653.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fuzznuc EMBOSS searches for patterns in nucleotide sequences software identified two consensus and two nonconsensus AP-1 binding sites, highlighted in red and green, respectively, on the sequence (shown in Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positions of the consensus motifs were 7,668 and 5,489 and those of the nonconsensus motifs were 7,636 and 5,129 (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP was performed on CCL5-overexpressing BECN1 B16-F10 cells using antic-Jun ChIP grade antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results, depicted in Fig S3C, show that c-Jun strongly binds to the nonconsensus 5-TGACTgA-3 motif containing region C of the CCL5 promoter, indicating that CCL5 is a direct c-Jun target gene in BECN1 B16-F10 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated the expression and the activation of c-Jun, the AP-1 founding member (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that c-Jun is transactivated by phosphorylation at the N terminal Ser-63 and Ser-73 residues (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results showed that the total and the phosphorylated level of c-Jun at both Ser-63 and Ser-73 residues were higher in BECN1 compared with control B16-F10 cells (Fig 3A, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in the phosphorylation of c-Jun was also observed in BECN1 tumor extracts (Fig 3A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
c-Jun phosphorylation is mediated by the upstream kinase JNK, which in turn is exclusively phosphorylated by MKK4 kinase (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While no difference was observed in the total expression and the phosphorylation levels of MKK4, a significant increase in the phosphorylation of JNK at Thr-183 and Tyr-185 was detected in BECN1 compared with Ctrl cells (Fig 3B), suggesting that the increased phosphorylation level of c-Jun in BECN1 cells is most likely related to an increased JNK activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption was further supported by our data showing that pharmacological (Fig 3C, Upper) and genetic (Fig 3D, Upper) inhibition of JNK completely suppressed, as expected, the phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser-63 and Ser-73 residues and, more interestingly, led to a significant down-regulation of CCL5 mRNA in BECN1 tumor cells (Fig 3 C and D, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has long been postulated that the regulation of protein phosphorylation is partially balanced by the activity of kinases and phosphatases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The serine/threonine phosphatase, PP2A, has been described to be involved in the regulation of JNK phosphorylation and subsequently in that of its downstream protein c-Jun (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with this, we assessed PP2A activity in Ctrl and BECN1 B16-F10 cells to determine whether the increased levels of phosphorylated JNK and phosphorylated c-Jun are related to a defect in PP2A activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results (Fig 3E) revealed that PP2A activity was significantly lower in BECN1 compared with Ctrl B16-F10 cells, suggesting that the increased levels of phosphorylated JNK and phosphorylated c-Jun resulted from a decrease in the phosphatase activity of PP2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was further supported by our data showing that targeting PP2A subunit A genetically by siRNA in control cells increased the phosphorylation of both JNK and c-Jun (Fig 3F, Left), and subsequently increased the expression of CCL5 (Fig 3F, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, treatment of control cells with PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid inhibited its catalytic activity by increasing the phosphorylation at Tyr-307 (Fig 3G, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such inhibition enhanced the phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser-63 and increased the expression of CCL5 (Fig 3G, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results provide a mechanistic clue on how targeting autophagy increases the expression of CCL5 by enhancing the phosphorylation of c-Jun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Targeting_CCL5_in_BECN1_Tumors_Significantly_Reduces_the_Infiltration_of_NK_Cells_into_the_Tumor_Bed_and_Prevents_Tumor_Regression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated the impact of silencing CCL5 on the tumor growth and on the infiltration of NK cells in BECN1 B16-F10 tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated B16-F10 cells defective for both BECN1 and CCL5 (BECN1/CCL5) and characterized them in terms of BECN1 expression and CCL5 secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results, shown in Fig 4A, demonstrate a significant inhibition of the secretion of CCL5 in BECN1/CCL5 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4B clearly shows that the reduction of tumor growth, seen in BECN1 tumors (Fig 4B, red curve) compared with controls (Fig 4B, black curve), was no longer observed when CCL5 was silenced (Fig 4B, gray curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, immunohistochemistry staining demonstrated that targeting CCL5 in BECN1 tumors dramatically prevented the infiltration of NK cells into the tumor bed (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantification of the percentage of NK cells infiltrating the tumors is shown in Fig 4D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data provide additional support that the recruitment of NK cells into BECN1 B16-F10 tumors is driven by CCL5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the JNK/c-Jun pathway has been identified in vitro as the major transcription factor involved in the up-regulation of CCL5 in BECN1 tumor cells, our results showed that genetic targeting of JNK/c-Jun pathway (Fig 4E) resulted in a dramatic decrease in CCL5 expression (Fig 4F) and an increase in BECN1 tumor volume (Fig 4G) and weight (Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, there was a significant decrease in both the expression of tumoral CCL5 (Fig 4I) and the infiltration of NK cells into the tumor bed (Fig 4J and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our data provide evidence that JNK/c-Jun/CCL5 pathway regulates the recruitment of NK cells into BECN1 tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Expression_of_CCL5_Positively_Correlates_with_Expression_of_the_NK_Cell_Marker_NKp46_and_Predicts_Improvement_of_Melanoma_Patients__Survival  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated whether a positive correlation could be found between the expression of CCL5 and the infiltration of NK cells in melanoma patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections of melanoma tumor biopsies were first stained with CCL5 and assigned, according to the expression level of CCL5, as no, low, moderate, high, and very-high CCL5 staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tumors were further stained with the NK cell marker NKp46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal a striking positive correlation between the expression levels of CCL5 and NKp46 (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data were further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR performed using mRNA isolated from a panel of 22 melanoma biopsies (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extend our study to an even larger cohort of melanoma patients, we used data from 471 skin cutaneous melanomas described in the TCGA database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, a strong positive correlation was also observed between the expression of CCL5 and the expression of the NKp46 encoding gene NCR1 (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results highly suggest that melanoma tumors expressing high levels of CCL5 are strongly infiltrated by NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next assessed the impact of CCL5 level on the survival of 458 melanoma patients using the recently described OncoLnc resource (www.oncolnc.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resource links RNAseq data of particular genes with patients survival using clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on RNAseq data, the median log expression level of CCL5 in melanoma patients was 588.44 (reported as a log).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the expression level of CCL5, the 458 melanoma samples were assigned into low and high CCL5-expressing groups, each of them containing 229 samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of CCL5 in the low and high groups ranged from 7.92 to 588 and from 588 to 32,675, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KaplanMeier survival plot reported in Fig 5D depicts that melanoma patients with an elevated expression level of CCL5 had a significant longer survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the improvement of the survival of melanoma patients displaying a high level of CCL5 is most likely due to an increase in the infiltration of NK cells into the tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The role of NK cells in the improvement of immune responses to cancer has been extensively investigated during the past few decades, and several NK cell-based immunotherapies have been proposed and are used in the clinic (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CCL5, also known as RANTES, is a small protein that belongs to a large family of cytokines and displays chemotaxis activity, as it is involved in inducing the migration of several leukocytes into inflammation sites (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCL5 is secreted by a wide variety of cells, including T cells (40), NKs (27), and some tumor cells (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCL5 interacts with different receptors including C-C chemokine receptor types 1, 3, and 5 (CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5) (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controversial data exist about the role of CCL5 in the tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some reports highlight the role of CCL5 in promoting breast cancer metastasis (43), others refer the importance of CCL5 in T cell recruitment into melanomas (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems that the pro- or the antioncogenic roles of CCL5 depends on the tumor type, the nature of the cells secreting CCL5, and the different interactions within the tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the role of CCL5 in the recruitment of NK cells in inflammation and allergic diseases has been widely studied, no data are available so far about its role in the recruitment of NK cells into the tumor microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with our previous work, which showed that targeting autophagy improves the NK-mediated antitumor immune response (17), we show here that inhibiting autophagy increases the expression and the release of CCL5 by murine B16-F10 tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, which subsequently led to a massive infiltration of NK cells into the tumor bed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the expression of CCL5 was also observed in ATG5-defective cells and after chloroquine treatment, we strongly believe that targeting the autophagy mechanism as a whole, rather than specifically targeting BECN1, results in the improvement of the NK-mediated antitumor immune responses by inducing NK cell-homing into tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been previously reported that CCL5 can increase the cytotoxicity of CD56+ human NK cells (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies also showed that CCL5 promotes the release of cytotoxic granules by human NK cells (4547).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore asked whether an elevated level of CCL5 could enhance the cytolytic activity of NK cell-infiltrating tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We strongly believe that CCL5 released by BECN1 tumor cells has no impact on the activation status of NK cells as, when reported to the total number of NK cells, no differences in the expression of NK cell-activation markers CD69 and GzmB were observed in NK cell-infiltrating control or BECN1 tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another important question is to determine whether CCL5 is the only factor involved in the recruitment of NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in addition to CCL5, our cytokine array revealed that CXCL10 was found to be up-regulated in BECN1 tumor cells, although at a lower extent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the fact that CXCL10 has also been described to induce the migration of NK cells (27), the involvement of CXCL10 in the homing of NK cells cannot be ruled out, and additional experiments need to be conducted to determine the relative contribution of CXCL10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our data showed that targeting CCL5 was sufficient to significantly suppress the infiltration of NK cells and subsequently enhance the tumor growth in BECN1 tumors, strongly suggesting that CCL5 is the major factor involved in the recruitment of NK cells to B16-F10 melanoma tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CCL5 elicits its chemo-attracting activity by acting via CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the increased migration of NK cells toward a CCL5 gradient could be related to the increased expression of CCL5 receptors on the surface of NK cells infiltrating BECN1 tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility can be ruled out since no difference in the expression of CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 was found on the surface of NK cells infiltrating both control and BECN1 tumors (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we even observed that BECN1 B16-F10 cells isolated from tumors exhibited significantly lower levels of CCR1, CCR3, and CCR5 compared with controls (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the autocrine CCL5 signaling, previously described to promote the invasion and migration of tumor cells (49), is attenuated in BECN1 tumor cells, and that CCL5 released by tumor cells primarily acts via paracrine signaling to attract NKs to the tumor bed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how the CCL5 receptors are regulated in BECN1 tumors remains, so far, an unresolved issue that needs to be further investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mechanistically, we provide strong evidence that targeting BECN1 induces a dramatic phosphorylation of c-Jun at both Ser-63 and Ser-73 residues through PP2A-dependent increase of JNK phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our results predict that c-Jun is constitutively present in control cells in an inactive form and that targeting autophagy induces the phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser-63 and Ser-73 residues located within its transactivation domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such phosphorylation serves to increase both its stability and transcriptional activity, as previously reported (50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The increase in the phosphorylation of JNK/c-Jun in BECN1 cells seems to be tightly linked to the decreased activity of PP2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the causal mechanisms underlying the decrease in PP2A activity in BECN1 cells remains largely unknown, our data provide an important mechanistic clue on how CCL5 is transcriptionally regulated in BECN1 tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A schematic representation of the mechanism underlying the expression of CCL5 in BECN1 cells is reported in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we strongly believe that the increased-phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser-63 residue is a consequence of targeting Beclin1 rather than the up-regulation of CCL5, as the level of phosphorylated c-Jun was not affected following CCL5 silencing in BECN1 tumor cells (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is now well established that tumor infiltration by NK cells represents a positive prognostic marker in different cancers, including colorectal (7), gastric (52), and lung carcinomas (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that low NK cell numbers in tumors are likely due to their inefficient homing into the tumor bed, which could be overcome by cytokine-mediated activation (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, convincing evidence for a beneficial role of NK cells in the control of tumor growth was provided from clinical studies of leukemia patients who received alloreactive NK cells in the course of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a small cohort of melanoma tumor biopsies, we show here a striking correlation between the expression of CCL5 and NK cell marker NKp46 at the protein and mRNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As tumoral CCL5 has been described to recruit T cells (54) and macrophages (55) into the tumor bed as well, we cannot exclude that melanoma tumors expressing a high level of CCL5 are not only highly infiltrated by NK cells but also by T cells and macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it should be noted that the CCL5 staining detected in melanoma biopsies may not be only produced by tumor cells, since other cells in the tumor microenvironmentsuch as T cellscan also secrete CCL5, as previously reported (56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the positive correlation between CCL5 and NK cells was further confirmed using more than 400 melanoma patients from the TCGA database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the fact that CCL5 induces the homing of NK cells into the tumor bed, it stands to reason that CCL5 overexpression impacts on the survival of melanoma patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we show that the long-term survival of melanoma patients overexpressing CCL5 was significantly improved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is now well accepted that NK cells are capable of driving potent antitumor responses (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, tumor cells often compromise the antitumor immunity by inducing an immunosuppressive microenvironment (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data reported here reveal the impact of targeting autophagy in tumor cells on the release of chemokine involved in the infiltration of NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although much remains to be learned mechanistically, this study provides a cutting-edge approach on how to switch the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to an immunosupportive one, allowing for the redirection of NK cells to the tumor bed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One issue of great interest that remains to be addressed is to investigate the impact of targeting autophagy on the immune landscape of tumors and on the infiltration of other populations of immune cells into the tumor bed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it is our belief that the knowledge generated from this study will pave the way to fully exploit NK cells antitumor properties in clinical settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
