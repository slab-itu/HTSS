Recognition of the 3 splice site RNA by the U2AF heterodimer involves a dynamic population shift  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The splicing of human pre-mRNAs is tightly controlled and regulated during the assembly of the spliceosome onto pre-mRNA introns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recognition of regulatory RNA sequence motifs by splicing factors is an essential early step during spliceosome assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combine single-pair FRET and NMR to show that the recognition of the 3 splice site in pre-mRNA introns by the essential heterodimeric splicing factor U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) involves conformational dynamics and population shifts of its RNA binding domains between open and closed conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, the small subunit U2AF35 facilitates the recognition of weak splice sites by a population shift of the RNA binding domains of U2AF65 toward the open conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, disease-linked mutations in U2AF65 do not affect RNA or U2AF35 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An essential early step in the assembly of human spliceosomes onto pre-mRNA involves the recognition of regulatory RNA cis elements in the 3 splice site by the U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large (U2AF65) and small (U2AF35) subunits of the U2AF heterodimer contact the polypyrimidine tract (Py-tract) and the AG-dinucleotide, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tandem RNA recognition motif domains (RRM1,2) of U2AF65 adopt closed/inactive and open/active conformations in the free form and when bound to bona fide Py-tract RNA ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the molecular mechanism and dynamics of 3 splice site recognition by U2AF65 and the role of U2AF35 in the U2AF heterodimer, we have combined single-pair FRET and NMR experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of RNA, the RRM1,2 domain arrangement is highly dynamic on a submillisecond time scale, switching between closed and open conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of Py-tract RNA ligands with increasing binding affinity (strength) gradually shifts the equilibrium toward an open conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the proteinRNA complex is rigid in the presence of a strong Py-tract but exhibits internal motion with weak Py-tracts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the presence of U2AF35, whose UHM domain interacts with U2AF65 RRM1, increases the population of the open arrangement of U2AF65 RRM1,2 in the absence and presence of a weak Py-tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that the U2AF heterodimer promotes spliceosome assembly by a dynamic population shift toward the open conformation of U2AF65 to facilitate the recognition of weak Py-tracts at the 3 splice site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure and RNA binding of the heterodimer was unaffected by cancer-linked myelodysplastic syndrome mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_RRM1_2_Domains_of_U2AF65_Are_Highly_Dynamic  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two RNA recognition motifs 1 and 2 (RRM1,2), connected by a flexible linker, represent the minimal RNA binding region for U2AF65 (Fig S1) (8, 28, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular details of the RNA recognition of the individual RRM1 and RRM2 domains have been described previously (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, it was shown that U2AF65 RRM1,2 exists in a closed conformation in its free form and an open conformation when RNA is bound (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An enhancement of the overall RNA binding affinity with increasing Py-tract strength correlates with a population shift toward the open conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR data demonstrate that this shift involves an increased contribution of RRM1 to RNA binding (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the role of conformational dynamics in this population shift, we used spFRET to study the intrinsic dynamics of RRM1,2 in the absence and presence of RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these experiments, one residue in each of the RNA recognition motifs RRM1 and RRM2 was mutated to a cysteine residue and labeled stochastically with a donor and acceptor dye pair (Fig 1A and Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cysteine positions were designed to be in close proximity when the RRM1,2 tandem domains adopt a closed conformation and to be at maximal distance when the domains adopt an open conformation (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that the measurements are not subject to artifacts from the labeling, we analyzed the FRET efficiency and conformational change of the protein using different fluorescent labels and tested different labeling positions (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The constructs were measured in solution using a confocal microscope with multiparameter fluorescence detection and pulsed interleaved excitation (MFD-PIE) (3134).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the spFRET efficiency histogram, the free form of RRM1,2 is found to populate a high FRET state with a mean FRET efficiency of 0.78 (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1B and 2A and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analyzing the lifetime information of the donor fluorophore, we could determine that this FRET efficiency is an average value obtained from a highly dynamic population of molecules (Fig 1B, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In burst analysis experiments, an average FRET efficiency and donor lifetime is determined for each molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When molecules undergo conformational dynamics during their transit time through the confocal volume (of a few milliseconds), an average single-molecule FRET efficiency is measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of dynamics on the submillisecond time scale can be visualized by plotting the intensity-determined FRET efficiency versus donor lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of dynamics, the intensity-determined FRET efficiency will be a species-averaged value (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6), whereas the donor lifetime is a lifetime-weighted average (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yields a deviation from the relationship observed for a static FRET species (static FRET line; Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5) (32, 35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1B, Left, all molecules clearly deviate from the static FRET line, demonstrating that the conformation of RRM1,2 is highly dynamic in the absence of RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining the lifetime information for all the single-molecule in the spFRET experiments, we observed two donor lifetimes of 0.14 and 2.15 ns for the free form of RRM1,2, corresponding to FRET efficiencies of 0.96 and 0.43, respectively (Table S1, Fig 1B, and Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that the protein undergoes conformational transitions between a closed conformation, an arrangement of the tandem domains where the donoracceptor separation is 3440 Å and an open conformation with a distance of 6469 Å. Estimations of the spFRET histograms for the open and closed conformation are shown in Fig 2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using accessible volume calculations (35), we estimated the average donoracceptor separation from the published structures of 42 Å for the closed conformation (PDB 2YH0) (28) and a distance of 61 Å for the open conformation (PDB 2YH1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured FRET distances and accessible volume calculations are in excellent agreement, especially when considering that the tandem RRMs represent an ensemble of closed and detached conformations with respect to each other as indicated from the NMR and SAXS data (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the mean FRET efficiency and the FRET values obtained for the open and closed states from the donor lifetime data, we could estimate the fraction of time each molecule spends in the open conformation (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free RRM1,2 molecules mainly populate the closed high FRET state (with a donoracceptor separation of 35 Å) spending an average of just 1/3 of their time in the open conformation with a distance of 65 Å between the fluorophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A linker truncation mutant RRM1,2-233252, which was previously proposed to increase the population of the open domain arrangement (28), was investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This construct adopts a closed conformation with the same FRET efficiency as observed for RRM1,2, whereas the open conformation exhibits a slightly higher FRET efficiency (SI Text and Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, truncation of the inner part of the linker region does not abolish the conformational dynamics of the unbound RRM1,2, whereas it promotes an open conformation that is not as extended as in the wild-type protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the mutant serves as an internal control to show that another different open conformation can be adopted and recognized by the lifetime analysis and supports that observation that the open conformation observed for all full-linker constructs in the absence and presence of RNA is the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

U2AF65_Adopts_an_Open_State_When_Binding_to_Strong_Py-Tracts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we analyzed the conformational states of the minimal RRM1,2 in the presence of RNA substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the strong Py-tract (U9), the apparent FRET efficiency shifts to an average value of around 0.5 (Fig 1B and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spFRET histogram represents a mixture of the same open and closed conformations as observed for the free protein (FRET efficiencies 0.97 and 0.44 for U9-bound RRM1,2) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the equilibrium between the open and closed conformation of RRM1,2 is shifted significantly, with the complex spending around 90% of the time in the open conformation (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1B, Middle, and 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The population clearly lies on the static FRET curve indicating a stabilization of the open conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a weaker Py-tract (U4A8U4), the apparent average FRET efficiency is 0.63 and the population deviates from the static FRET line (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1B, Right, and 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates an increase in dynamics compared with the U9-bound U2AF65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, the spFRET data and fluorescence lifetime data reveal dynamic transitions between two states with FRET efficiencies of 0.40 (D = 66 Å) and 0.97 (D = 35 Å), i.e., the same two populations observed previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecules populate the open conformation 59% of the time, whereas they were still found in the closed conformation quite frequently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the equilibrium between the open and the closed conformation of U2AF65 is influenced by the overall binding affinity for the Py-tract sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Py-tracts with higher affinity lead to a shift in the equilibrium by increasing the time the molecules spend in the open conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, purine-rich RNA ligands such as A9 and A13ACAGG that do not contain bona fide Py-tract sequences do not induce any shift in the FRET efficiency histogram or influence the conformational dynamics of RRM1,2 constructs with respect to the same protein in the absence of RNA (Fig S2 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated whether additional conformational changes are observable on a slower time scale with spFRETtotal internal reflection fluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Static RRM1,2-C187-C318-Atto532/Alexa647 molecules with FRET efficiencies corresponding to the conformations observed in solution-based measurements but no evidence for conformational transitions on time scales longer than 30 ms were found (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Role_of_U2AF35_for_Py-Tract_Recognition_by_the_U2AF_Heterodimer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ULM region of U2AF65 is necessary for binding to the U2AF35 subunit and thus formation of the U2AF heterodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, before studying the conformation of U2AF65 in the presence of U2AF35, we first characterized an extended U2AF65 RRM1,2 protein that includes the ULM region (URRM1,2) in the absence and presence of RNA (Fig 2B and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3C and S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a similar behavior as was observed for RRM1,2 without the additional ULM region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic transitions between the open and closed conformations were observed with the same FRET efficiencies of 0.44 and 0.95 as was observed for RRM1,2 alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed an overall shift of the equilibrium toward the open conformation with URRM1,2 spending 46% of the time in the open conformation in the absence of RNA (compared with 34% for RRM1,2) (Fig 2 A and B and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of the strong Py-tract U9 and the weak Py-tract U4A8U4 to URRM1,2 induced a shift of the equilibrium toward the open state with the molecules now spending 92% and 69% of their time in the open conformation, respectively (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isothermal titration experiments show that the addition of amino acids 88147, preceding the RRM1 domain, increases the affinity of URRM1,2 sixfold compared with RRM1,2 alone (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could show that this increased affinity is associated with faster binding rates (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increasingly open conformation is thus accompanied by an increase in the binding kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we investigated the role of U2AF35 in Py-tract recognition at the 3 splice site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The U2AF35 UHM domain mediates proteinprotein interactions (13, 14) and folds upon binding to a UHM Ligand Motif (ULM) peptide sequence in U2AF65 (11) but does not directly contribute to the specific recognition of the AG-dinucleotide by U2AF35 (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, two conserved zinc finger domains flanking the UHM are expected to mediate the specific recognition at the 3 splice site (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the contribution of the U2AF35 UHM domain to Py-tract recognition by U2AF65, we studied the RRM1,2 domain arrangements in the context of a minimal U2AF heterodimer, which has been used in previous studies (17, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimal U2AF heterodimer comprises the U2AF65 ULM and the RRM1,2 domains bound to the U2AF35 UHM domain (URRM1,2/U2AF35(UHM)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the conformation of the RRM1,2 domains within the minimal heterodimer in the absence and presence of RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As before, we observed dynamics between the same open and closed conformations with the heterodimer spending even more time in the open conformation (51%) with respect to RRM1,2 (34%) and URRM1,2 (46%) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, the affinity of the URRM1,2/U2AF35(UHM) heterodimer (KD = 150 nM) for the strong Py-tract U9 is higher than for RRM1,2 (KD = 1.34 µM) and URRM1,2 (KD = 220 nM) (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shift of the equilibrium in the presence of U2AF35(UHM) is more strongly pronounced in the presence of weak Py-tract RNA, 99% in the open conformation for the strong U9 Py-tract versus 90% without U2AF35 and 85% for the weaker ligand (U4A8U4) versus 59% when the small subunit is absent (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of U2AF35 has a large effect in shifting RRM1,2 to the open conformation when the weak Py track is bound (U4A8U4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  U2AF35 also shifts RRM1,2 more to the open state when a strong Py-tract is bound, but this effect is less dramatic because the complex already exists predominantly in the open conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In either case, the likelihood of the heterodimer to be found in the open state is significantly increased compared with RRM1,2 or URRM1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore potential contributions of additional RNA sequences present in the 3 splice site on the RRM1,2 conformational equilibrium, we studied the interaction with an RNA comprising a strong Py-tract followed by an AG splice site, U13ACAGG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  U2AF65 RRM1,2 shows the same open and closed conformations as in the presence of the shorter Py-tract U9 (Fig 2A), consistent with the expectation that RRM1,2 specifically recognizes the Py-tract region of the RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RRM1,2 proteins spend around 96% of the time in the open conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon binding to a weak Py-tract followed by the AG splice site, U4A8U4ACAGG, the equilibrium is shifted toward the open state (84%) compared with the binding of the weak Py-tract without the extended AG sequence, U4A8U4 (59%) (Fig 2A and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, additional, nonspecific contacts involving the additional nucleotides following the weak Py-tract can induce a population shift toward the open state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also observe an increased stabilization of the open conformation upon binding of a weak Py-tract to URRM1,2 (Fig 2B and Fig S3C and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of U4A8U4ACAGG, URRM1,2 proteins spend 91% of their time in the open conformation compared with 69% for U4A8U4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may correlate with the higher overall binding affinity of URRM1,2 for U4A8U4ACAGG than for U4A8U4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional contacts between U2AF65 and the additional nucleotides present downstream of the Py-tract thus lead to a higher probability of the RRM domains to be found in the open conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional chemical shift perturbations in the NMR data also revealed stabilizing RNA contacts for a few residues preceding the first 1-strand in RRM1 (Fig S6A), consistent with a recent crystal structure of an extended RRM1,2 protein bound to a strong Py-tract (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the NMR titration data also demonstrate that no additional contacts are observed for residues preceding this N-terminal region of RRM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

U2AF35_Enhances_Py-Tract_Recognition_by_a_Dynamic_Population_Shift  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surprisingly, in the minimal heterodimer, the population of the open conformation of RRM1,2 is substantially increased even in the absence of RNA, going from 34% for RRM1,2 and 46% for URRM1,2 to 51% in the U2AF heterodimer (Fig 2 and Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the presence of the U2AF35 UHM domain enhances the open conformation of U2AF65 RRM1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the increased fraction of open conformations in the unbound U2AF heterodimer, binding of a weak Py-tract U4A8U4ACAGG shows a dramatic population shift toward the open conformation similar to that measured in the presence of U9 (94% for U4A8U4ACAGG versus 99% for U9) (Fig 2C and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A control experiment of RRM1,2 without the ULM binding domain in the presence of U2AF35(UHM) and U4A8U4ACAGG could not induce this stabilization of the open conformation (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the presence of the U2AF35 UHM domain, when stably bound in the U2AF heterodimer, leads to a population shift of the RRM1,2 domains toward the open conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, the heterodimer promotes an open conformation that enables efficient binding even of weak Py-tract RNA ligands (Table S1 and Fig 2 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

An_Interface_in_the_U2AF_Heterodimer_Mediates_the_Population_Shift  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the structural mechanisms of how U2AF35 leads to a population shift toward the open conformation of RRM1,2, we studied the domain arrangements in the minimal U2AF heterodimer [URRM1,2/U2AF35(UHM)] using NMR spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined local tumbling correlation times from 15N NMR relaxation data for the free U2AF heterodimer and when bound to a strong Py-tract AG RNA (U13ACAGG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that, in the absence of RNA, the U2AF65 ULM, RRM1, and the U2AF35 UHM domains tumble together, whereas the U2AF65 RRM2 domain exhibits higher mobility (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the RRM2 may be partially detached from RRM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, upon formation of the U2AF/RNA complex, all domains in both subunits tumble together, indicating the formation of a compact and rigid protein/RNA complex (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relative arrangement of the domains in the U2AF heterodimer/RNA complex was determined by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) data with single nitroxyl spin labels attached to specific sites in U2AF65 RRM1, RRM2, and U2AF35 UHM (Fig 3 D and F and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, SL155 shows the same PRE effects for RRM1,2 in the context of the heterodimer bound to the extended strong Py-tract as observed for RRM1,2 alone bound to a strong Py-tract (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is fully consistent with the FRET data, which indicate that the same open conformation is adopted upon binding to strong Py-tracts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of spin labels attached to RRM1 or UHM show strong intermolecular PRE effects between these two domains (Fig 3 and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that the U2AF35 UHM domain shares a binding interface with the U2AF65 RRM1 domain in addition to the known recognition of the U2AF65 ULM peptide on the helical face of the UHM domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A structural model for the domain arrangements in the U2AF heterodimer when bound to a strong 3 splice site Py-tract AG RNA is shown in Fig 3F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the same interaction is already present in the absence of RNA (Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the RRM1/UHM domain interaction destabilizes the closed conformation of the U2AF65 RRM1,2 tandem domains and thereby promotes the population shift toward the open domain arrangement and thus contributes to an increased RNA affinity even for weak Py-tracts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Disease-Linked_Mutations_in_U2AF65_Do_Not_Affect_the_Structure_and_RNA_Binding_of_the_U2AF_Heterodimer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yoshida et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (39) described point mutations in several components of the splicing machinery leading to myelodysplastic syndromes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigated the effect of the confirmed somatic mutations L187V and M144I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze whether these mutations could affect the structure of U2AF65 or the conformation of the heterodimer [by modulating the interface with U2AF35(UHM)], we compared NMR spectra of 15N-labeled U2AF65 in the wild-type heterodimer with URRM1,2-M144I/U2AF35(UHM) and URRM1,2-L187V/U2AF35(UHM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the chemical shift differences shows mainly local effects in the vicinity of the mutation (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that the structure of U2AF65 RRM1,2 and the formation of the U2AF heterodimer is not affected by these disease mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested if the mutations could affect RNA binding by the U2AF heterodimer by using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (Fig S7 A and B) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (Fig S7 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the binding affinities of both mutants for the strong and weak Py-tract RNAs and compared them to the wild-type heterodimer (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three constructs showed similar RNA binding affinities with an approximately sevenfold higher RNA binding affinity in the presence of U2AF35(UHM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that U2AF35 still contributes to the overall RNA binding in the mutant heterodimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did, however, observe a more aggregation-prone behavior of the two point mutants compared with the wild type in FCS experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The point mutations in URRM1,2 leading to myelodysplastic syndromes, therefore, do not directly influence the binding affinity of the RNA or binding of the small subunit U2AF35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that these mutations potentially affect interactions with other factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA binding of U2AF65 is associated with an open domain configuration, whereas unbound U2AF65 represents an ensemble of closed conformations (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When analyzing its conformational dynamics, we found that U2AF65 can adopt different conformational states, dynamically switching between a closed conformation with a FRET efficiency of 0.96 and an open state with a FRET efficiency of 0.43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free form of U2AF65 is highly dynamic on the submillisecond time scale spending 1/3 of the time in the open conformation (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is fully consistent with the NMR spectra, which show a single set of signals, indicating conformational averaging that is fast on the NMR chemical shift time scale (i.e., less than milliseconds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not observe conformational dynamics on time scales longer than 30 ms. Agrawal et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (38) described conformational dynamics of U2AF65 on the time scale of 530 s. Although the different types of spFRET measurements reveal different dynamic time scales, they consistently show more dynamics in the absence of RNA, and the open conformation of U2AF65 is stabilized in the presence of a strong Py-tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-affinity Py-tracts strongly stabilize the open, active conformation of the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is reduced for weak Py-tract sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a correlation between the dynamic equilibrium between the open and closed conformation and the binding affinity of the complexes (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in the population of the open state corresponds to a higher probability for prespliceosomal complex formation (28) because the open conformation is the active form of U2AF65 required for spliceosome assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alternative splicing occurs in 90% of all human genes and is extremely important for the high level of phenotypic complexity in mammals (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Py-tracts of higher eukaryotes contain only 50% uridines, whereas 30% of the nucleotides are cytosines and 10% adenines and guanines, each (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although the binding site in U2AF65 and the consensus length of Py-tracts corresponds to eight pyrimidines (28), Py-tracts found in natural 3 splice site sequences can span 30 or more nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  U2AF65 therefore has to be able to recognize a variety of Py-tract sequences and lengths (6), while at the same time being able to specifically and unambiguously identify bona fide splice sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The splicing efficiency depends proportionally on the number of consecutive uridines in the sequence (7, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a similar trend when analyzing the dynamics of U2AF65 between its open and its closed conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equilibrium of U2AF65 shifts toward the open conformation with increasing Py-tract strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of additional residues flanking RRM1 in URRM1,2 and the binding of U2AF35 also shift the equilibrium of the complex toward the open conformation (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional amino acids present in URRM1,2 compared with RRM1,2 enhance the RNA binding affinity (Table S2), consistent with a recent study that indicates that N- and C-terminally flanked regions in U2AF65 RRM1,2 mediate additional RNA contacts (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An important finding of our study is that the open conformation is further stabilized by binding of the small subunit U2AF35 (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our NMR data show that this involves an interaction between the U2AF35 UHM domain and U2AF65 RRM1 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shift in equilibrium is already induced in the absence of RNA and thus greatly enhances the overall affinity for weak Py-tracts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the requirement of U2AF35 for splicing of introns with weak 3 splice sites and for viability in eukaryotes (18, 41, 42), whereas AG-independent introns exhibit strong Py-tract sequences, for which U2AF35 is not necessarily required (7, 23, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular details for the recognition of weak 3 splice sites remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports indicate that the zinc fingers flanking the U2AF35(UHM) domain mediate direct recognition of the 3 splice site AG dinucleotide (20), consistent with the fact that the U2AF35(UHM) does not contribute to RNA binding in the context of a minimal heterodimer [U2AF65(RRM1,2)/U2AF35(UHM)] lacking the zinc finger domains (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that the small subunit U2AF35(UHM) allosterically enhances the interaction of U2AF65 with weak Py-tract RNA sequences by inducing a population shift toward the open conformation already in the absence of RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unexpected finding also implies an indirect role for the UHM domain for 3 splice site recognition, which will enhance the recognition of weak Py-tracts by stabilization the open conformation of U2AF65 RRM1,2 (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to note that the population shifts involving the RNA binding domains of U2AF for 3 splice site recognition are not affected by the presence of SF1 and its binding to the BPS sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of NMR spectra of U2AF65, the U2AF heterodimer, and U2AF65-SF1 complexes demonstrates that the conformations and conformational arrangements coupled with RNA binding of U2AF are not affected by the presence of SF1 (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although 3 splice site recognition involves cooperative binding of SF1, U2AF65, and U2AF35, the fine-tuning and regulation of the assembly depends on the variability in the Py-tract and its recognition by population shifts involving the RNA binding domains of the U2AF heterodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to analyze how additional factors, such as hnRNP A1 (45) or phosphorylation of SF1 (44, 46, 47), influence 3 splice recognition by U2AF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we provide insight into the underlying molecular mechanism of U2AF binding to 3 splice sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An emerging paradigm resulting from the current and our previous study (28) is that the high splicing efficiency is introduced by a stabilization of the open conformation of U2AF65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the open conformation is significantly populated already in the absence of RNA, proteinRNA complex formation uses a conformational selection mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Py-tracts with varying strength correlate with splicing efficiencies and are reflected in the equilibrium between the two conformational states (this work and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, depending on the Py-tract strength, an initial RNA binding to RRM2 in the closed state with a subsequent conformational change may contribute to complex formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would allow fly-casting of the RRM1 domain to scan the RNA and identify Py-tracts in the context of introns with extended Py-tract regions (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, our data imply that the population shift induced by the U2AF35 UHM domain, combined with direct recognition of the AG-dinucleotide by the U2AF35 zinc fingers, contributes to the fidelity of 3 splice site recognition by U2AF as an essential early step in spliceosome assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasmids_and_Constructs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The human RRM1,2 (U2AF65-148-342) minimal RNA binding mutant, RRM1,2-233252, URRM1,2 (U2AF65-88-342), and U2AF35(UHM) [U2AF35(38-152)] were cloned by PCR amplification (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The constructs were inserted into a pETM11 (U2AF65) or pET9d (U2AF35) vector containing an N-terminal 6xHis-tag (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double cysteines were introduced into U2AF65 constructs by site-directed mutagenesis at positions C187/C318 or C187/C326.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Expression_and_Purification_of_Recombinant_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
U2AF65 mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified as described in Mackereth et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the U2AF heterodimer, URRM1,2 and U2AF35(38-152) were expressed and purified separately, incubated at equimolar ratios, and purified as a complex by size-exclusion chromatography as described in Kellenberger et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Single-Pair_FRET_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single-pair FRET measurements were performed on a custom-build confocal microscope using multiparameter fluorescence detection with pulsed interleaved excitation (SI Text) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were site-specifically labeled at cysteines and diluted to concentrations of 2050 pM in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 50 mM NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were performed with proteins in their free form or mixed with 5 µM of U9, U13ACAGG, A9, or A13ACAGG or 20 µM of U4A8U4, U4A8U4ACAGG, or U4A8U5ACAGG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NMR_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All NMR samples contained protein concentrations of 0.10.5 mM in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 510% (vol/vol) 2H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectra were recorded at 295 K and analyzed using Sparky 3 in combination with previously published assignments (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Truncation_of_the_Linker_Region_Between_RRM1_and_RRM2_Does_Not_Inhibit_the_Conformational_Changes_and_Dynamics_of_U2AF65  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the effect of the flexible linker between the two RNA binding motifs using a linker truncation mutant that was previously proposed to increase the population of the open domain arrangement (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amino acids 233252 in the linker connecting both domains (residues 227261) were deleted (RRM1,2-233252), leaving only 15 amino acids from the outer edges of the linker (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar linker truncation of residues 238257 has been used in a crystallographic study of the U2AF65 RNA interaction (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though a large fraction of the linker region was missing, the protein still switched dynamically between an open and a closed form (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, by combining the lifetime information for all of the individual molecules measured, we could accurately determine the donor lifetimes for the closed and open conformations, which lie at 0.1 and 1.4 ns, respectively (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to FRET efficiencies of 0.62 (D = 59 Å) and 0.97 (D = 36 Å) for the fully open and the fully closed states, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The open conformation of RRM1,2-233252 clearly deviates from the open conformation of the RRM1,2 with the full linker by 8 Å (i.e., 67 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the full-length linker is necessary for the protein to adopt the native open state that is found in the U9 bound form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, for the fully closed conformation, we observed the same FRET efficiency as for RRM1,2 (0.96), which may suggest that the same closed state can be adopted also with the shortened linker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the presence of U9 or U4A8U4 RNA, dynamics between the same open and closed conformations was also observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for RRM1,2 with the wild-type linker, we found a shift of the equilibrium towards the open state from the highly dynamic free form of RRM1,2-233252 (22% open) via the weak U4A8U4-bound form (57% open) to the U9-bound conformation (72% open) (Table S1 and Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of molecules remaining in the closed population in the presence of RNA might be attributable to proteins that have not bound an RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the native open domain arrangement cannot be adopted with the linker deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the shortened linker may restrict the mobility of RRM1, which has an intrinsically lower RNA binding affinity (28) to search for its RNA binding site, when RRM2 has already bound to the Py-tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein_Labeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Attachment of fluorophores to U2AF65(RRM1,2) constructs was performed using sulfhydrylmaleimide coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RRM1,2-C187-C318 and RRM1,2-C187-C326 were reduced in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 50 mM NaCl containing 1 mM DTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After removal of the reducing agent, the labeling reaction was performed by the addition of twofold to threefold molar excess of fluorophoremaleimide conjugates (Atto532-Maleimide, Atto647N-Maleimide, Alexa647-Maleimide, Cy5-Maleimide, and Atto565-Maleimide; AttoTec and Life Technologies) in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 50 mM NaCl, 50 µM TCEP, deprived of oxygen at room temperature for 2 h. The attachment of fluorophores to the protein was confirmed on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel using UV excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbound fluorophores were removed by a size-dependent filtration with 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 50 mM NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FCS measurements validated the labeling and removal of unbound fluorophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Solution-Based_Single-Pair_FRET_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
spFRET measurements were performed on a custom-build confocal microscope (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In solution-based spFRET measurements, the FRET efficiency of a single molecule is determined as it diffuses through the focus of the laser, which occurs on the time scale of a couple of milliseconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of labeled sample is in the range of 10s of pM to ensure that only one molecule is in the focus of the microscope at a time (one to five fluorescent bursts per second).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fluorophores were excited using pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE) (31) with a 532-nm (PicoTA 530; Picoquant) and a 640-nm subnanosecond pulsed laser (LDH-d-C640; Picoquant) synchronized at a repetition rate of 26.66 MHz with a delay of 18 ns and a laser power of 100 µW each (measured at the entrance point of the beam into the objective).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence from 20 to 50 pM fluorescently labeled U2AF in the absence and presence of 5 µM U9, U13ACAGG, A9, or A13ACAGG or 20 µM U4A8U4, U4A8U4ACAGG, or U4A8U5ACAGG in 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) and 50 mM NaCl was collected by a 60× water immersion objective (Plan Apo IR 60×/1.27 WI; Nikon) and focused onto a pinhole with diameter d = 75 µm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiparameter fluorescence detection (MFD) was used where the fluorescence is first separated according to polarization using a polarizing beam-splitter (PBS3; Thorlabs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The green fluorescence was then reflected and the red fluorescence was transmitted by a dichroic mirror (640DCXR; AHF Analysentechnik).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After passing the emission filters (Brightline HQ582/75 and HQ700/75 for green and red photons, respectively; AHF Analysentechnik) the signals were detected on four single-photon-counting avalanche photodiodes (PerkinElmer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were recorded using synchronized single-photon-counting cards (SPC-154; Becker and Hickl), and data analysis was performed with a custom-written MATLAB program (The MathWorks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the fluorophore combinations Atto565/Atto647N and Atto565/Alexa647, a similar confocal microscope was used with the laser excitation lines 480 nm (LDH-D-C-485), 565 nm (LDH-D-TA-560), and 641 nm (LDH-D-C-640) (Picoquant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence was separated by a polychroic mirror (zt405/488/561/633) and filtered by the emission filters for red (ET670/30) and green (ET607/36) (AHF Analysentechnik) detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Fluorescence_Parameters_from_Solution-Based_spFRET_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using MFD-PIE, multiple parameters of each molecule, such as its FRET efficiency, stoichiometry, fluorescence lifetime, and fluorescence anisotropy, can be obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photons arising from individual molecules were selected by an all-photon or a dual-channel burst search algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the photons originating from a single molecule, each of the above parameters was calculated (48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Photons were considered to belong to a burst when the local count rate obtained by a sliding time window exceeded a certain threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bursts with a minimum number of 100 photons and a count rate of at least 10 photons in a time window of 500 µs after green and red excitation were considered for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One advantage of using PIE is that dual-labeled molecules can be directly selected by the burst search algorithm (dual-channel burst search).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we used the stoichiometry information to further refine the selection of dual-labeled molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stoichiometry is defined as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34:S=FDD+FDAFDD+FDA+FAA,[S1]where FDD and FDA are the fluorescence intensity of the donor and acceptor channels after donor excitation, respectively, and FAA is the background corrected fluorescence intensity of the acceptor channel after acceptor excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Via this ratio, the stoichiometry provides information regarding the labeling of the molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stoichiometry value can also be normalized to allow better comparison between experiments:S=FDAFAAFDD+FDDFDAFAAFDD+FDD+FAA,[S2]where the additional factors correct for direct excitation (), cross-talk (), and differences in detection efficiency and quantum yield ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dual-labeled molecules were selected for analysis using a normalized stoichiometry value between 0.3 and 0.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove molecules that underwent photobleaching during a burst, we compared the mean time of burst detection using green excitation with that for red excitation (0.1 ms less_than TDD + DA  TAA less_than 0.1 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FRET efficiencies were calculated following Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and corrected for background (BGDD = 1.1 kHz, BGDA = 0.4 kHz, and BGAA = 0.5 kHz), cross-talk (0.03), direct excitation (0.1), and differences in detection efficiency ( = 0.85 for Atto647N and  = 0.45 for Alexa647 as acceptor fluorophore):E=FDAFDD+FDA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S3]The exact correction factors were determined for each measurement individually by analysis of the donor- and acceptor-only populations and background measurements with water and buffer (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Around 30% of all molecules fulfilled all of the above mentioned selection criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy were calculated as discussed in Schaffer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two parameters were used to obtain information about the behavior of the fluorophores attached to the protein of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can thus correct for fluorophore quenching of the acceptor molecule using the correction factor .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the assumption that the orientation factor 2 can be estimated as 2/3 for the donor and acceptor fluorophores bound to the protein, we used the rotational correlation time of the fluorophores obtained from the anisotropy information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relation of the intensity-weighted donor fluorescence lifetime and the species-weighted FRET efficiency contains information about the conformational dynamics of individual molecules on the time scale of the diffusion through the focal volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of dynamics, the FRET efficiency is related to the donor lifetime byEstatic=1DD(0)[S4]and should yield the same value as the intensity-determined FRET efficiency (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The static FRET relationship can be improved to account for dynamics of the linkers attaching the fluorophores to the molecule of interest using an empirically determined third-order polynomial (following ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32):E=1a+bDA+cDA2dDA3D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S5]For the data presented here, the static FRET curve is given by D = 3.8 ns and a = 0.0421, b = 0.508, c = 0.2691, and d = 0.03589 for the donoracceptor pair Atto532Atto647N and a = 0.0178, b = 0.6226, c = 0.2188, and d = 0.0312 for Atto532Alexa647 (32, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whenever molecules showed dynamic conversions during their transit time in the confocal volume, the intensity-determined FRET efficiency will be a species-weighted value:E=x1E1+x2E2,[S6]where xi describes the fraction of time during the burst that the molecule was in the ith state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because only a single lifetime can be calculated from a burst, the determined donor lifetime will be an intensity-weighted lifetime, and the calculated FRET efficiency is given by the dynamic FRET curve:Edynamic=112D(0)(1+2f),[S7]where 1 and 2 are the respective donor lifetimes of both FRET states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the FRET efficiencies of the closed and open conformations, we used the cumulative fluorescence lifetime information for all bursts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lifetime histogram was then fit to a biexponential decay function (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the fluorescence lifetimes, the FRET efficiencies and thus distances could be calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize the closed and open conformation, we used MFD-PIE experiments of two constructs filtered by the donor lifetime to exclude any potential fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the closed conformation, we used an MFD-PIE experiment of RRM1,2 molecules with donor lifetimes D less_than 0.1 ns, and to display the open state, the spFRET histogram of URRM1,2/U2AF35(UHM) complexes in the presence of U13ACAGG with D  0.1 ns was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Single-Pair_FRET_Measurements_of_Immobilized_Molecules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surface-based single-pair FRET measurements were performed on a custom-build prism-type total internal reflection microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preparation of the prism was performed as described in Schluesche et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface passivation was achieved by incubating the silanized (3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane; Sigma-Aldrich) prisms with a solution of 45% polyethylene glycol (mPEG-SVA, MW 5000) and 3% biotin-PEG (biotin-PEG-SVA, MW 5000) (Laysan Bio Inc.) in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quartz prism was used to serve as part of the sample chamber as well as to create an angle of total internal reflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitation of the fluorophores was achieved by illumination of the prism by a diode-pumped solid state laser (Cobolt Samba 100, 532 nm) and a heliumneon laser (Polytec Laser 633 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTFnC.400650-PV-TN; Pegasus Optik) combined with a single-mode polarization maintaining fiber was used for switching and intensity regulation of the lasers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence of the sample was collected by a water immersion objective (CFI Plan Apochromat 60xWI, NA 1.2; Nikon) and separated by a dichroic mirror (630DCXR; AHF Analysentechnik).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After passing the emission filters HQ550/88 or HQ715/150 (AHF Analysentechnik) for green and red detection, respectively, the fluorescence of the donor and acceptor fluorophores was detected on two different regions of an EMCCD camera (Andor iXON; Andor Technology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were performed either by directly immobilizing RNA or by encapsulation of the protein complex in lipid vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_Dissociation_Rates_of_U2AF65_from_Immobilized_RNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used spFRET TIRF experiments with immobilized biotinylated RNA to determine the lifetime of the RNAU2AF65 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid surface effects on the protein, we used a biotinylated RNA, which was extended by a double-stranded RNA to introduce a separation of the protein from the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The U2AF65-binding RNA strand (biotin-5-UGACCCAAGGGCAGUUUUUUUUU-3) was annealed to the partly complementary strand (5-CUGCCCUUGGGUCA-3) at a concentration of 100 µM in annealing buffer (10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) by denaturation at 62 °C and cooling at 0.6 °C/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before immobilization, the biotinylated RNA was incubated with the U2AF65 mutant in a 1:1 ratio at a concentration of 4 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was then diluted to a final measurement concentration of 50 pM and flown through the sample chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser power was chosen such that the bleaching rate of the fluorophores was significantly lower than the time for dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The half-life of the complexes was determined by detecting the residence time of dual-labeled U2AF65 on the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residence time was described by a single-exponential fit, which returned the dissociation rate of U2AF65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this value, the association rate was determined for mutants with known affinity constants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conformational_Dynamics_of_Immobilized_Molecules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze conformational dynamics on the time scale of seconds, U2AF65 was encapsulated into lipid vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipid vesicles made from DOPC and 3% biotinylated PE were prepared as described in Sikor et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipids were hydrated with 20 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 50 mM NaCl containing 400 nM of the respective U2AF65 mutant and 5 µM U9 or 20 µM U4A8U4 RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liposomes with a diameter of 200 nm were prepared by extrusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biotinylated vesicles or RNA complexes were immobilized via biotinstreptavidinbiotin linkage on the surface of the quartz prisms (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Signal from single molecules was only analyzed when single bleaching steps were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual proteins were manually selected and evaluated for dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant population of dynamic molecules were observed on the time scale of 30 ms or longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Accessible_Volume_Calculations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The accessible volumes of the fluorophores were calculated on the structures of RRM1,2 (PDB: 2YH0) and U8-bound RRM1,2 (PDB: 2YH1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the FRET positioning software described by Kalinin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35) to determine the accessible volumes of the fluorophores with linker length (20 Å), linker width (4.5 Å), and radius of the fluorophore (3.5 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NMR_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of the final NMR samples contained protein concentrations of 0.10.5 mM in 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 510% (vol/vol) 2H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectra were recorded at 295 K using AV III 600 MHz, AV III 750 MHz, or AV III 800 MHz Bruker spectrometers, equipped with cryogenic triple resonance gradient probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the backbone assignments were obtained using typical triple resonance experiments (HNCA, HNCACB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectra were analyzed using Sparky 3 (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California), in combination with the previously published assignments (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 15N-relaxation T1/T2 curves were analyzed and fitted using NMRview v.4 (54) and subsequently converted to the rotational correlation time byc=4r33T14N6T1T27,[S8]with  for solvent viscosity, r for effective radius of protein,  for Boltzmann constant, T for temperature, and N and 15N resonance frequency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PRE measurements were performed on the U2AF heterodimer with and without RNA (U13ACAGG) by incorporating free radical 3-(2-Iodoacetamido)-PROXYL spin labels to the individually engineered cysteines (C155, C196, C187, and C271 in U2AF65 and C87, C102, C131, and C145 in U2AF35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain the ratio of the peak intensities, IparamagneticIdiamagnetic, 1H,15N-HSQCs were recorded before (paramagnetic) and after (diamagnetic) adding ascorbic acid, following the protocols described previously (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
