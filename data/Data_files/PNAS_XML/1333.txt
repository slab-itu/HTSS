Atomistic simulations indicate the functional loop-to-coiled-coil transition in influenza hemagglutinin is not downhill  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is the viral membrane protein that guides entry of flu viruses into host cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A global refolding of the stem domain of HA, HA2, is crucial to successful viral membrane fusion, but the molecular mechanism relating this conformational change of HA2 to its fusogenic properties remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the thermodynamic importance of the B loop domain for driving the overall HA2 rearrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the B loops loop-to-coiled-coil refolding is not strongly downhill and thus is a possible target for therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A buried hydrophilic amino acid is implicated in destabilizing the coiled coil, and the sequence divergence at this position may indicate functional differences between group 1 and 2 HAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) mediates viral entry into host cells through a large-scale conformational rearrangement at low pH that leads to fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallographic and biochemical data suggest that a loop-to-coiled-coil transition of the B-loop region of HA is important for driving this structural rearrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the microscopic picture for this proposed spring-loaded movement is missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we focus on understanding the transition of the B loop and perform a set of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the full B-loop trimeric structure with the CHARMM36 force field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free-energy profile constructed from our simulations describes a B loop that stably folds half of the postfusion coiled coil in tens of microseconds, but the full coiled coil is unfavorable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A buried hydrophilic residue, Thr59, is implicated in destabilizing the coiled coil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this conserved threonine is the only residue in the B loop that strictly differentiates between the group 1 and 2 HA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microsecond-scale constant temperature simulations revealed that kinetic traps in the structural switch of the B loop can be caused by nonnative, intramonomer, or intermonomer -sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of the A helix stabilized the postfusion state of the B loop, but introduced the possibility for further -sheet structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our results do not support a description of the B loop in group 2 HAs as a stiff spring, but, rather, it allows for more structural heterogeneity in the placement of the fusion peptides during the fusion process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The pH-induced HA transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) The prefusion configuration of HA [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 2HMG (2)] including the head domain HA1 (white surface representation) and stem domain HA2 (colored cartoon representation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) The reduction of pH triggers the dissociation of HA1 from HA2, which starts an extensive structural rearrangement ending in the postfusion configuration [PDB ID code 1QU1 (4)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful membrane fusion presumably places the FPs and transmembrane helices in the same membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that HA1 remains localized near HA2 because of a disulfide bond between regions S5 and TBS (two -strands).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B-loop domain (blue) changes from a random loop to a coiled-coil structure (highlighted by boxes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central stalk, S3, maintains its coiled-coil structure during the HA2 transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A-helix domain (yellow) shifts 100 Å from the preconfiguration to postconfiguration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known about intermediate configurations during this transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) The simulation constructs: the entire B loop and S3 (Left); and A helix, B loop, and S3 (Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) The long coiled coil in the postfusion structure is wrapped by S5 (orange domain), which may provide additional stabilization to the coiled-coil configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the crystal structure, Tyr162 is the only residue in S5 that buries deeply into the B loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A buried water is coordinated between Thr59 and Tyr162.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The B-loop domain of influenza HA subtype H3 folds into a trimeric coiled coil in the absence of the HA1 head domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B-loop sequence features a heptad repeat pattern creating amphipathic helices able to form a continuous hydrophobic core buried among the three helices (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the A helix (S1), the B loop (S2), and the stable central coiled coil (S3), there is a 45-residue stretch where the residues at positions a and d are hydrophobic, interrupted only by Thr59 in the B loop, and flanked by Thr87 and Thr41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, coiled coils can be stabilized by salt-bridge interactions at positions e and g, of which the B loop has one, Lys62 and Glu67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B loop has several charged residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including the flanking Arg54 and Arg76, there are 12 charged residues per monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coiled-coil structure is known to be sensitive to pH, with little helicity and probable loss of the trimer at pH 7 and strong helicity and trimer formation at pH 4 (5), where the charge is between +4 and +5 per monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary structure prediction algorithms predict the B loop to be helical (29), although recent experiments on B-loop monomers have suggested that the B loop is only 12% helical at pH 4.8 (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The formation of the B-loop coiled coil is inconsistent with the prefusion HA structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a highly stable and downhill refolding B loop has been suggested as the force that drives the initial stages of the HA conformational change (5, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we characterized the folding and free-energy landscape of an S2S3 trimer, where the B-loop trimer is folding from a prenucleated S3 coiled coil, as it does in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As simulating the full HA molecule is prohibitively expensive, our choice of this subset of HA2 deserves a brief discussion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prefusion loop structure was stabilized by interaction with HA1 (Fig 1A), which is believed to be destabilized and dissociated from the B loop through electrostatic repulsion caused by the lowered pH in the endosome (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we assumed that any remaining interaction between HA1 and the B loop was weak and nonspecific, and, thus, we were able to remove it from the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 (the A helix) is a second structural feature that is missing from the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 makes extensive contacts with the anchored portion of HA1 and, additionally, is attached to the FPs buried within S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the initial stages of the HA conformational rearrangement, if B-loop refolding is to be a dominant force for driving the dissociation of S1 and the FPs, the B loop will be refolding without interaction with S1 apart from its N-terminal attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to focus on the B loops early role in driving subsequent refolding, we removed S1 from the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explore the consequences of including S1 later (Microsecond-Scale Kinetic Simulations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coiled-Coil_Formation_Is_Not_Downhill_for_the_B_Loop  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We characterized the folding of the B-loop trimer with fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, in which the protein was protonated as if at pH 4 (see Materials and Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The folding was monitored with two reaction coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nhb counted the number of -helical hydrogen bonds formed in the B-loop trimer and indicated the degree of helicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qpost counted the number of postfusion contacts that were formed and was a good monitor of the formation of tertiary interactions existing in the crystallographic coiled-coil structure of the B loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 shows the free energy as a function of these two reaction coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also shown are the centroid structures from eight different Nhb ensembles, a long-lived trapped structure (ET) and structures with roughly zero to six formed -helical turns per B-loop monomer (EAEG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall folding was seen to be a zipping-like mechanism, where progressive helical structure was formed from C- to N-terminal and in lock-step with tertiary interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most striking result was that the B loop was thermodynamically most stable near ED, where only half of the coiled-coil structure is formed, as opposed to the post-fusion-like EG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbiased simulations only sampled between EAED (SI Appendix, Fig S3A) and, thus, umbrella simulations were necessary to connect the unbiased sampling to the postfusion ensemble (EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple lack of conformational sampling was not a good explanation for the absence of EG in the unbiased simulations because the conformational entropy of EEEG is more restricted than ED due to the forming coiled coil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the absence of EG in the unbiased simulations suggested a free-energy penalty preventing sampling of EG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis was confirmed by performing two umbrella simulations of increasing helical bias, which connected ED with EE (SI Appendix, Fig S3B) and EE with EG (SI Appendix, Fig S3C), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The resulting free-energy profile was computed by using the combined data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The folding progressed from a disordered B-loop ensemble 12 kBT above ED over a 2 kBT barrier to EC and then over a 2 kBT barrier to ED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EG was seen to be 8 kBT above ED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of an intermediate at ED was corroborated by an additional set of melting simulations starting from the full postfusion coiled-coil structure of S1S3 (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The free-energy profiles shown in Fig 2 describe a B loop that spends most of its time in ED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant time was also spent in a particular configuration ET where each monomer of the B loop made extensive and unique contacts with S3 (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ET, the N termini of the B loop are interacting with the C termini of S3, which is likely an artifact of introducing the artificial termini for the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, this trap along with EA highlights that there is residual tendency for the B loop to interact with S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the high -helical secondary structure propensity, the B loop spent 20% of the time as a monomer in -strand structures (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen in the centroid structures of ET and EA, these -strand structures can associate with S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior was consistent with the frustrated and slow folding B loop observed with dual-basin structure-based models (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thr59_Interrupts_the_Coiled-Coil_Hydrophobic_Core  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stability of coiled-coil structures stems from a heptad repeat pattern of buried hydrophobic residues (positions a and d) flanked by highly polar residues locking the coiled-coil configuration (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most stable ensemble, ED, buried the C-terminal heptad repeat pattern of Ile77Val73Phe70Ile66Phe63 until its interruption at the small polar Thr59, which was surrounded by the polar Asn60 and the charged Lys58 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A heptad repeat stutter (19, 32) had a 34434 hydrophobic pattern instead of the canonical 3434.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a heptad stutter at positions 6259, and the heptad pattern then continued from Lys58 into S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conspicuously, the configurations zipping up past Phe63 (Nhb40) were destabilized relative to ED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The formation of the hydrophobic core was quantified by the radial distribution function (RDF) of water molecules around residues forming the hydrophobic core of the coiled coil (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The burial of the C-terminal hydrophobic core was quantified by the RDF of Ile66 (the rest of the RDFs can be found in SI Appendix, Fig S6), which was solvated in EA, but dry in ED and EG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, even in EG, Thr59 had a peak at the radius of a water, showing that it was hydrated even when folded into the core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the neighbors of Thr59, Asn60 or Lys58, were not observed to fold into the core in EG and displaced Thr59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seemingly, Thr59 reduced the free-energy gain of the next zipping step after ED by maintaining water in contact with the hydrophobic residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Put another way, there is a likely free-energy penalty in confining waters to the empty space left by Thr59 and surrounded above and below by hydrophobic residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a polar residue inside the coiled-coil hydrophobic core is not a unique trait of the B loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar cavity is seen in the GCN4 coiled coil, where two ordered water molecules cling to a buried asparagine (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thr59_Is_the_Hallmark_of_Group_2_HA_Molecules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bioinformatic studies of influenza HA sequence evolution (34, 35) classify HA into two groups (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two groups are believed to have separated 1,500 y ago (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thr59 is the only residue of the B loop strictly conserved within group 2 HA sequences, despite its disruption of the heptad repeat pattern and its apparent disruption of the hydrophobic core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Group 1 HAs have instead a conserved hydrophobic Met59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Position 59 is the strongest differentiator between the two groups (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although a full thermodynamic characterization of a Thr59Met mutant or a group 1 B loop is beyond the scope of the current study, we performed a 130-ns constant temperature simulation on Thr59Met mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutation was introduced into the centroid structure of EG and led to a dry core (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, to show that the time scale of the simulation was long enough to calculate the water dynamics, a simulation of the same duration showed water penetrating into the core at position 59 for wild type started from the postfusion crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, thermal unfolding simulations indicated that hydrophobic mutations at position 59 were stabilizing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When started from the postfusion structure and subjected to a temperature ramp, wild-type B loop unfolded at 450 K, whereas Thr59Met and Thr59Val were shifted up by 25 K (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As evidenced by the postfusion crystal structure, any residual disruption of the B-loop coiled coil was eventually overcome by the refolding of the S1 coiled coil and/or S5 wrapping around the B loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyr162 may be important: It is positioned to coordinate a buried water in the hydrophilic pocket created by Thr59 (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioinformatic analysis does not indicate any significant sequence deviations between group 1 and 2 in the S5 region interacting with the B loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of position 162, tyrosine was completely conserved for group 2, but in group 1 it was phenylalanine in 9% of sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, a group 1 postfusion crystal structure would provide insight on any side-chain packing differences in the B-loop region between group 1 and 2 HAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimating_the_Kinetics_of_the_B-Loop_Transition_from_Free-Energy_Profiles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To calculate rates from free-energy profiles, we describe the folding of the B loop in terms of diffusive motion on a free-energy landscape (see Materials and Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While one-dimensional reaction coordinates can provide intuitive descriptions of the dynamics, the full dynamics are multidimensional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of protein folding, collective coordinates based on the degree of nativeness (e.g., Qpost) have been shown to behave diffusively and capture transition-state ensembles (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, for the case of B-loop folding, the high degree of similarity between free-energy profiles and diffusion coefficients calculated for two different collective coordinates gives additional evidence that they are appropriate for estimating rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rates calculated here for B-loop folding are likely an upper bound since the additional energetic roughness from nonspecific interactions with HA1 or the drag of S1 should further slow the folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mean first passage times obtained from our free-energy profiles are indicated in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It took over a millisecond for the B loop to reach a post-fusion-like coiled coil (EG) from the prefusion ensemble (EA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the folding time for a fast-folding helical bundle protein is 10s (40, 41) and for a tethered leucine zipper is 30s (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimeric, pH-sensitive leucine zipper was thermodynamically two-state, but showed multiphase folding kinetics on a microsecond time scale similar to our current B-loop folding landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the B loop, the large free-energy penalty to fully fold was the main factor in slowing down the folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaching the most stable intermediate ED took 60s, a bit slower than a tethered leucine zipper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microsecond-Scale_Kinetic_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To connect the thermodynamic sampling data more directly to the kinetic behavior of the B-loop transition, we further performed unbiased, microsecond-scale, constant-temperature simulations (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three runs with S2 + S3 were performed for 1, 3, and 7.2 s. The shorter runs formed long-lived -structures and were terminated for this reason.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final snapshots from the 1- and 3-s runs are shown in Fig 5B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the 7-s trajectory, the B loop quickly reached ED (3 s) but did not form the full coiled coil during the remaining 4 s (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal half of the B loop folded into a helical bundle, followed by the complete folding of two helical monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, progress stopped at this stage, as the third monomer had difficulty zipping up or docking to create the hydrophobic core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with the thermodynamic sampling, this kinetic run suggests that a barrier exists to forming the hydrophobic core and that the core is not seen to form around Thr59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also consistent with the thermodynamics, the kinetic run relaxed back into ED at 7.0 s rather than remaining stably in EE before continuing toward the full coiled coil as downhill folding would suggest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the full HA2 molecule, the N termini of the B loop were attached to a 16-residue A helix (S1, residues 3853; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally, the B loop was found to be more stable in a coiled-coil structure when the A helix was present (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate how the A helix may affect the kinetics of the B-loop transition, similarly to the S2 + S3 simulations, two runs were performed for 6 and 7 s for S1 + S2 + S3 (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations showed some structural similarity to the S2 + S3 simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we found several intermediate structures of the B loop, where one or two monomers went almost completely helical, while the third stayed as a random loop, unable to form the hydrophobic core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there was no indication that a free A-helix helps speed the folding of the B loop, the short time scale of the kinetic simulations makes such a determination difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most interesting feature of the kinetic simulations was the prevalence of  secondary structure in both the B loop and A helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both segments showed almost no helical secondary structure when surrounded by solvent and showed affinity for forming -strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an isolated monomer, the B loop had on average 20%  secondary structure (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existence of the other two monomers and the A helices can stabilize these  secondary structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intramonomer -hairpins were seen both between A helix and B loop (Fig 6A, I1) and within the B loop alone (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intermonomer -strands were also seen both between the A helix and B loop (Fig 6A, I2) and within the B loop (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  structures were also observed in the thermodynamic simulations, including the centroids of ET, EA, and ED (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This  propensity was not observed in the bioinformatic prediction by Psipred (SI Appendix, Fig S5) (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be because Psipred is based on crystal structures, and the A helix and B loop have clear coiled-coil-like sequences that indeed form coiled coils in their folded end states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations suggest that even these highly predicted helical sequences can form a multitude of secondary structures and nonnative trapped  structures en route to their stable folded structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Helix_Stabilizes_the_Postfusion_Structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Melting simulations starting from the postfusion structure corroborated the experimental finding that addition of the A helix stabilizes the coiled-coil structure (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two melting simulations were started from the postfusion structure, one with S2 + S3 and the other S1 + S2 + S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of the A helix shifted the melting temperature up by 50 K (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the melting curves showed an intermediate that had the C-terminal half of the B loop in a coiled-coil structure that resembled the ED structural ensemble from the thermodynamic simulations (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides additional evidence that the C-terminal core of the B loop is more stable than the N-terminal core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion_and_Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transition of the B loop is of particular interest in the study of HA because the full coiled-coil transition of the B loop and A helix would extend the FPs of HA2 toward the endosomal membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spring-loaded process is attractive because it provides a simple explanation for one of the necessary functions of HA: facilitating the burial of FPs in the host membrane (5, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct experimental observation of the dynamical features of the B-loop transition and HA intermediates in general are difficult due to the complicated bimembrane system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, molecular simulations offer another avenue to understanding the conformational transitions of HA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the free-energy profile generated for the B loop calls into question the description of the B loop as a simple loaded spring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result that the post-fusion-like ensemble EG is significantly less stable than a half-formed coiled coil may be surprising, but it is not at odds with the full HA2 postfusion structure being the lowest free-energy configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of the postfusion structure, the S1 coiled coil and the contacts with S5 can provide additional stability to the B-loop coiled coil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The simulation results we have presented are compatible with previous in vitro experiments (5, 30) that focused on a 36-residue B-loop construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An early experiment concluded from circular dichroism (CD) that below pH 5, the B loop formed a stable trimeric coiled coil that showed 90% helicity (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recent experiments indicated that the helicity of the Loop36 monomer was very low and insensitive to pH (30), and, thus, suggest that forming the trimer is important for the observation of a highly helical Loop36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with our simulations of a B-loop monomer that showed 3% helicity and 20% -character (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations of the B-loop trimer show that an ensemble ED, with roughly half of the B-loop coiled coil formed, is most thermodynamically stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyzing the helicity for the same residues as in Loop36 (Arg54  Ile89), which additionally contains 16 residues of S3, show ED contains 80% helicity and EE contains 90% helicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the simulated ensemble ED appears to be slightly less helical than the Loop36 trimer, absolute quantification of secondary structure with CD is difficult and typically involves uncertainties of 10% (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the behavior of our simulated B loop is a viable interpretation of the available experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sequence patterns of coiled coils are able to encode a wide range of stabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, hydrophilic residues at buried positions a and d occur with low frequency [1520% (4547)], and mutational studies have indicated that the positions and identities of these residues can alter properties such as parallel vs. antiparallel arrangement and the degree of multimerization (4850).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Buried hydrophilic residues destabilize coiled coils relative to an ideal hydrophobic heptad pattern (47), but by doing so can promote structural specificity through encouraging the hydrophilic residues to localize together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, their placement can be important for protein regions undergoing functional rearrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The group 2 H3 HA studied here contains one buried hydrophilic residue in its B loop, Thr59 at heptad position d. There is a stutter in the B loop of HA, and its position is conserved in most class I (-helical) and class III (mixed /) viral fusion proteins (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional significance of heptad repeat stutters remains unclear, but it has been shown that removal of the stutter in the B loop leads to supercoiling by one third turn in the B loop (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence Thr59Asn60Glu61Lys62 in the B loop contains the two abnormalities, the buried hydrophilic Thr59 and the heptad stutter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to consider that our results are for H3, a group 2 HA, and that the sequence differences in other HA subtypes may lead to different B-loop behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conservation of position 59, which strictly contains Thr59 in group 2 HA and Met59 in group 1 HA, suggests functional importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that Thr59 disrupts the hydrophobic core of the H3 B loop and that mutation to hydrophobic residues, Thr59Met or Thr59Val, created a dry hydrophobic core (Fig 3B) and stabilized the B loop to thermal unfolding (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be investigated, with a methionine at position 59, whether group 1 HAs have a more stable B-loop postfusion coiled coil and behave more closely to spring-loaded refolding or a B loop with a comparable stability due to destabilization at other positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, free-energy profiles of the loop-to-coiled-coil transition describe a B loop that stably folds half of the postfusion coiled coil in tens of microseconds, but the full coiled coil is unstable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are compatible with previous experiments on the B loop, and the time scale is consistent with folding of a tethered leucine zipper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal unfolding simulations provide indirect evidence that adding the A helix stabilizes the full B loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it may be that the B loop is only fully stabilized by the eventual docking of the A-helix trimer or the final packing of S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The burial of an N-terminal threonine triplet is shown to be the likely cause of the unstable full B-loop coiled-coil structure, and, thus, the sequence divergence at this position may signal a difference in the behavior of group 1 and 2 HAs, at least in the B-loop transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the B-loop behavior can be influenced by the whole B-loop sequence, B-loop studies of several HA2 subtypes will be enlightening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-resolved pH-jump experiments on membrane-bound proteins show great promise for capturing these conformational changes in HA (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slower transition of the B loop and a long-lived intermediate may provide functional benefits by providing additional free-energy drive for membrane fusion and contributing extra time to the association among multiple HAs (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can speculate that this intermediate state is followed by the final rearrangement of S4 and S5, providing sufficient free energy to stabilize the final structure and possibly bringing the viral and cell membranes together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The behavior of the B loop is the focus of this work, and the simulations were performed with truncated subdomains of HA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were specifically exploring to what extent the structural switch of the B loop can drive the overall conformational rearrangement of HA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four sets of simulations were performed (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first set of simulations used an S2 + S3 construct with a combination of unbiased and umbrella-biased simulations that used continuous simulated tempering [CST (55, 56)] for an increased rate of thermodynamic convergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This first set was used to generate the free-energy profile (Fig 2) and consumed the majority of the computing cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second set of simulations was unbiased constant temperature kinetic simulations on the same S2 + S3 system started from a prefusion-like configurating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third set of simulations was the same as the second set, except that the A helix was included (S1 + S2 + S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth set of simulations was melting simulations used to roughly determine relative stability between different B-loop constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first discuss parameters common to all of the simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of group 2 H3 HA was used for simulation because it is the only sequence for which both prefusion (2) and postfusion (4) B-loop structures exist (sequence: LKSTQAAIDQINGKLNRVIEKTNEKFHQIEKEFSEVEGRIQDLEKYVEDTKIDLWSYNAELLVALENQ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All simulations were performed with the CHARMM36 force field (57) and TIP3P water, which gives a balanced treatment of protein secondary structures (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N termini were capped by ACE (acetyl group) and C termini by NME (methylamine).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations used a time step of 2.0 fs, were neutralized by 24 Cl ions and contained an ionic concentration of NaCl similar to endosomes of 0.15 M. The simulations were performed in the NVT ensemble because of the CST enhanced sampling protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An important consideration for the HA2 rearrangement is its pH sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several regions of HA are suggested to respond to lowered pH, including dissociation of HA1 (59), destabilization of the fusion peptide burial pocket (54, 60), and stability of the B-loop trimeric coiled coil (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, isolated HA2 folds into the postfusion structure at both neutral and low pH (61), suggesting a limited role for pH in HA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, since there is experimental evidence for pH sensitivity of the isolated B-loop fragment considered here [most stable below pH 5 (5)], we modeled the effect of pH in the simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To create the most stable environment for the B-loop coiled coil, we protonated the titratable residues of the B loop as though at pH 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This had the beneficial side-effect of simplifying the computation because this pH is low enough that all titratable residues will be protonated with high probability for the entire simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although methods for simulating a system in a constant-pH environment have been developed, both for coarse-grained systems (62, 63) and explicit solvent simulations (64), these methods for explicit solvent simulations still prove to be too computationally expensive for the size and time scales of interest for the B-loop transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were a total of three Asp residues (zero in the B loop), 10 Glu residues (six in the B loop), and one His residue (one in the B loop) in each monomer of the simulation system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculation of the pKa values for titratable residues was done with PROPKA (65) for the prefusion and postfusion structures of the isolated S2 + S3 construct (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that any residues with a pKa less_than 4.0 were located between the C-terminal and Glu74, while in the B loop, residues should be protonated at pH 4.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We additionally protonated even the few residues with pKa less_than 4.0 in S3, because we reasoned that these negative charges would lead to trapping of the now positively charged B loop near prefusion-like configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this change to the system should only stabilize the postfusion structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pKa values of titratable residues in the postfusion B-loop structure shared the same pattern as the prefusion structure, except for one residue, Glu67, which had a pKa less_than 4.0 in the final state due to the formation of a salt-bridge interaction with Lys62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glu67 is located in the middle of the B loop, so the recovery of its charge state could either stabilize the basin D or G in our free-energy plot (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because it is intractable to change the protonation state of this residue during the simulation, we performed a free-energy perturbation (FEP) calculation (66) after the simulation was completed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our FEP analysis (SI Appendix, Fig S4) suggested that adding a negative charge to Glu67 did not change the free energy of basin D relative to basin G, but instead would likely stabilize the prefusion state even further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the protonation of this residue does not affect the main conclusion from our thermodynamic sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, our protonation scheme, while below the range of pHs probed by experiments, is set up in favor of stabilizing the postfusion B-loop structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 demonstrates that even in this situation, the B loop is unstable by itself in the postfusion state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CST_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulation set 1 used CST (55, 56) as a method to accelerate the sampling of protein conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CST continuously changes the temperature of a single simulation copy while maintaining a generalized canonical ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method has been used to study the folding of proteins (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A brief description of the method can be found in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated construct is very similar to the Loop36 protein studied experimentally (5), but was extended to include the entire S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated system (truncated system of S2 + S3; Fig 1C) was placed in a dodecahedral box of length 102 Å with 74,587 atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fix the orientation of the molecule in the box, the C atoms of S3 were restrained to their crystallographic positions by using isotropic harmonic position restraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, we were only investigating the conditional thermodynamic landscape of the B loop in the presence of S3 near its crystallographic position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the S3 coiled coil is conserved during the overall rearrangement of HA2 (the preconfigurations and postconfigurations have a C rmsd less_than1.3 Å), restraining S3 should not affect the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce the possibility for the N termini of S2 to interact with the C termini of S3, an unphysical configuration in a complete HA, a 1-nm radius excluded volume interaction was applied between the atoms of the terminal residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations were performed with an in-house version of Gromacs (Version 4.6.3) (67, 68) edited to include CST and PLUMED (69) for umbrella sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During 23 s of unbiased CST sampling, the postfusion ensemble was not reached, so additional umbrella sampling based on the number of -helical hydrogen bonds in the B loop, Nhb, was used to ensure that configurations resembling the postfusion state were sampled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The umbrella potential wasVumbrella=12k(NhbNhb0)2,(1)where Nhb0 was either 55 or 60 and k=0.09 kJ/mol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nhb is defined in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The umbrella simulations were started from a basin D structure, and only the portion of the trajectory after the protein left basin D for the first time was used in the free-energy calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This should have eliminated any bias on the starting structure (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unbiased sampling (i.e., k=0) and the umbrella sampling were combined with the weighted histogram analysis method (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reweighted free-energy profiles were consistent and explained why umbrella sampling was necessary, because the postfusion ensemble was less stable by 8 kBT, and thus unlikely to be sampled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Kinetic_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In simulation set 2, we performed conventional NPT simulations for the same system (system S2 + S3) as set 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations were initialized from the prefusion configuration of HA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations were performed on the Anton1 supercomputer (42) with a rectangular box of 114 × 99 × 99 Å containing 110,141 atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we found in the CST simulations that the free-energy landscape of the B-loop transition at 350 K was similar to that at 310 K (SI Appendix, Fig S2A), we ran the kinetic simulations at 350 K for the enhanced diffusion rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harmonic position restraints were applied to the C atom of residue 80 in S3 to maintain the orientation of the simulated system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In simulation set 3, the A helix was added (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations were designed to explore possible interactions between the A helix and the B loop during the conformational rearrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 6-s simulation started from the prefusion configuration, and the 7-s simulation started with the A helix slightly extended and making no contacts with S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As above, these simulations were performed on the Anton1 supercomputer (42) with a rectangular box of 119 × 119 × 138 Å (a total of 191,717 atoms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, residue 80 of S3 was restrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Melting_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In simulation set 4, we used thermal unfolding trajectories to estimate the relative stability of various B-loop configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each simulation was run for 500 ns and repeated three times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The setup of the simulation system was the same as in set 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Order_Parameters_for_Free-Energy_Calculation_and_Umbrella_Sampling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two order parameters were used throughout our analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nhb counts the number of hydrogen bonds formed in the B-loop helices, and Qpost measures the similarity of the B loop to the postfusion state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we wanted to avoid any precise structural bias from the existing postfusion crystal structure in our thermodynamic simulations, we used Nhb for umbrella sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the postsimulation analyses, we used both Nhb and Qpost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equation for Nhb was taken from PLUMED (69): Nhb=bi,i+4, wherebij(t)=1rijr0n1rijr0m,(2)and n = 8, m = 12, and r0 = 2.5 Å (72, 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  i and i+4 enumerated the hydrogen and oxygen atoms forming the backbone hydrogen bonds of an -helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  r0 defined the length of a well-formed hydrogen bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This choice for n and m made bij close to a step function and differentiable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qpost quantified the similarity of the B loop to the postfusion crystal structure by counting the number of native atomic contacts formed in a protein configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The native contacts were defined as those atom pairs that were close together in the postfusion structure of the B loop, as calculated by the Shadow contact map (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small asymmetries in the homotrimeric contact map created by small asymmetries in the crystal structure were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 441 native atomic contacts were obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

First_Passage_Times_and_Diffusion_Coefficients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The kinetics of the B-loop transition can be estimated from a free-energy profile along a collective coordinate by using the following formula (38):1k==NhbpreNhbpostdNhb0NhbdNhbexp[(F(Nhb)F(Nhb))/kBT]D(Nhb),(3)where Nhbpre and Nhbpost refer to the number of -helical hydrogen bonds at the starting and ending states of the B-loop transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F(Nhb) is the free energy and D(Nhb) is the diffusion coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With CST, the kinetic information of the protein dynamics at a specific temperature is lost, due to the changing simulation temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to estimate D(Nhb), we performed additional constant temperature simulations at each basin identified from the free-energy profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three trajectories of 300 ns each were computed for each basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three initial structures for each basins simulations were determined by clustering the CST trajectories in each basin and taking the central structure from the top three clusters in each basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean square deviation of the Nhb value scaled approximately linearly with time when  is large, which is one indicator of diffusive behavior (Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following formula relates the mean squared deviation with the diffusion coefficient,D(Nhb)=lim12Nhb()2,(4)and in practice means determining the slope of a linear fit to Nhb()2 vs.  at sufficiently large .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated diffusion coefficients are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a large variation in the three computed diffusion coefficients for each basin, and, thus, it did not seem meaningful to use these coefficients in a basin-dependent manner in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a constant diffusion coefficient for the whole profile was estimated by averaging Nhb() at each  over all of the 300-ns simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A constant value of 16.5 Nhb2/s was used in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 to determine the first passage times in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Folding rates are dependent on temperature through changes in either the free-energy profile or the diffusion coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also calculated the free-energy and diffusion coefficients at 350 K. The free-energy profile at higher temperature was very similar (SI Appendix, Fig S2, Left), while the diffusion coefficients were larger (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_HA_Sequences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HA sequences were retrieved from the Influenza Research Database (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used all HA sequences up to now (a total of 103,091 sequences including partial sequences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple sequence alignment was conducted by using the program MAFFT (76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To classify HA into two groups according to their subtypes, we used results from previous studies (77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hellinger distance was used to capture the difference in sequence position probability distributions between group 1 and 2 HAs:Hj(P,Q)=12i=120(piqi)2,(5)where P(p1,p2,p20) and Q(q1,q2,q20) are the probability of each of the 20 amino acids in group 1 and 2 HAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the distribution of residues of the B loop in these two groups, only positions j with 1-Hj2(P,Q)less_than0.5 were selected for visualization (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
