Physical and situational inequality on airplanes predicts air rage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We suggest that physical and situational inequality are built into peoples everyday environmentssuch as the modern airplaneand that exposure to these forms of inequality can trigger antisocial behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses reveal that air rage is more common in economy class on airplanes, where inequality is physically present, and in both economy and first class when inequality is situationally salient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extend research demonstrating that the salience of inequality decreases prosocial behavior by higher class individuals, showing that temporary exposure to physical and situational inequality predicts antisocial behavior among individuals in both higher and lower classes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we explore a novel predictor of inequality-induced antisocial behaviorthe design of physical environmentsaugmenting research on macrostructural forms of inequality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We posit that the modern airplane is a social microcosm of class-based society, and that the increasing incidence of air rage can be understood through the lens of inequality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research on inequality typically examines the effects of relatively fixed, macrostructural forms of inequality, such as socioeconomic status; we examine how temporary exposure to both physical and situational inequality, induced by the design of environments, can foster antisocial behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a complete set of all onboard air rage incidents over several years from a large, international airline to test our predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physical inequality on airplanesthat is, the presence of a first class cabinis associated with more frequent air rage incidents in economy class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Situational inequalityboarding from the front (requiring walking through the first class cabin) versus the middle of the planealso significantly increases the odds of air rage in both economy and first class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that physical design that highlights inequality can trigger antisocial behavior on airplanes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More broadly, these results point to the importance of considering the design of environmentsfrom airplanes to office layouts to stadium seatingin understanding both the form and emergence of antisocial behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Descriptive and comparative information on the onboard incidents that were matched to a flight is in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first examined the base rate of air rage (i.e., the number of incidents per 1,000 flights).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting our account, air rage is relatively more common in economy class on flights with first class (incidence rate of 1.58) than flights without first class (0.14; t = 37.17, P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incidence of air rage in first class (0.31) is intermediate and significantly different from the incidence of air rage in economy with (t = 29.37, P less_than 0.0001) and without (t = 8.02, P less_than 0.0001) first class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used binary logistic regression with robust SEs, and clustering on flight route, predicting whether or not a flight contained an incident of air rage in the relevant cabin and including controls for commonly invoked explanations for air rage, such as seat pitch (leg room) and seat width, delay amount, and cabin space, as well as additional controls for flight distance, number of seats, and whether or not the flight was international.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first examined how our control variables related to air rage (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In economy class (models 1 and 2), planes with larger cabin area, longer flights, flights with longer delays, and domestic (compared with international) flights had comparatively greater odds of air rage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find evidence that seat pitch significantly related to air rage, and seat width marginally predicted lower odds of air rage in model 1 (P = 0.05), but significantly related to greater odds of air rage in model 2 (P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In first class (model 3), planes with more first class seats, planes with larger cabin areas, and longer flights significantly related to air rage; seat width, delay length, and international/domestic did not significantly relate to air rage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of additional control variables are in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that physical inequalitythe presence of first class on an airplanewould predict greater incidence of air rage in economy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 2 (model 1) shows that the chances of an onboard economy incident are 3.84-times higher when first class is present versus absent (P less_than 0.001); dividing the coefficients from the regression (1.3463 first class present/0.1419 delay hours), presence of first class is associated with greater odds of air rage equivalent to the effect of an additional 9-h and 29-min flight delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also hypothesized that situational inequalityboarding from the front of the planewould predict greater incidence of air rage in economy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted, front boarding of planes predicted 2.18-times greater odds of an economy cabin incident than middle boarding (P = 0.005; model 2), an effect equivalent to an additional 5-h and 58-min flight delay (0.7772 front boarding/0.1305 delay hours).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our hypothesis that situational inequalityboarding from the front of the planewould predict greater incidence of air rage in first class was supported: front boarding of planes predicted 11.86 greater odds of a first class air rage incident than boarding from the middle (P = 0.013; model 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (For models predicting first class incidents, the coefficient for delay hours was not significantly different from zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we are unable to provide an estimate of this effect in delay hours.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed differences in the types of air rage in economy versus first class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, incidents in first class were more likely to be a result of belligerent behavior, involving a passengers expression of strong anger (36.3% of the incidents in first class vs. 27.8% in economy class), whereas incidents in economy were more likely to result from emotional outbursts (6.2% of the incidents in economy class vs. 2.2% in first class; proportion comparison z-tests all P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These preliminary results are consistent with research linking high status to displays of anger and low status to reduced self-control (30, 31), and suggest that the visibility of inequality may induce different types of antisocial behavior among the relatively advantaged and disadvantaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We obtained the data on air rage incidents and boarding patterns for flights directly from the airline after entering into a confidentiality agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We matched these data to a population of flights from a proprietary dataset purchased from OAG Worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We spoke with the airlines Director of Corporate Security to connect 34 onboard incidents that we could not initially match to the population of flights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results not including these 34 corrected incidents are consistent with those reported in the paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were unable to match 197 incidents in the airlines database to a flight in the population of flight data, because of some combination of incomplete data from the purchased dataset, human error in the recording of incidents, and the fact that data were not collected by OAG Worldwide for flights from very small, regional airports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also deleted 59,000 flights over the sample time period from the purchased flight data because of missing departure dates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The airline defines a disruptive passenger as causing one or more crew members to become less able to maintain order in the cabin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The airline uses many categories for incident type (Table 1); the airline designates each incident as only one type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In 7.8% of incidents, there was more than one incident tied to a specific flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We coded flights with multiple onboard incidents as a flight with an incident, rather than including multiple rows in the dataset for the same flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also conducted our analyses excluding these flights with multiple incidents and the effects are consistent with those reported in the paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that of all flights with onboard incidents, only four flights also had incidents that occurred at the departure airport (before boarding), suggesting that the incidents we observe onboard are not simply the result of a generally belligerent set of passengers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The airline provided the gender of the disruptive passenger for 41.8% of cases, and also provided (only) the first name to researchers to maintain customer confidentiality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A research assistant coded the remaining disruptive passengers gender, and was unable to do so in a small percentage of onboard incidents with gender-neutral first names (3.02%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our dataset included some plane details, such as the plane make and model; where possible, we supplemented this information with plane details from the airlines website and other sites, such as www.seatguru.com.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this airline, flights recorded by OAG Worldwide as having a three-cabin plane (e.g., first class, business class, and economy class) were very rare, less than 0.03% of flights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, one plane model for this airline, representing 3.6% of all flights, was configured in both a two- and three-cabin layout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OAG Worldwide dataset did not indicate which layout was used for each flight, but the airline website indicated that only a third of the actual planes of this model number in their fleet had a three-cabin layout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no incidents of air rage were reported by passengers in business class on these three-cabin or potential three-cabin planes, precluding further analysis of the predictors of air rage in such three-class planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the analyses reported in the paper, we recoded these flightsthose with a three-cabin or potential three-cabin layoutsuch that the first and business classes were both coded as first class seats, and the physical dimensions of first and business class were averaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We did not have access to individual passenger data or how fully flights were sold; however, examining annual reports for the organization demonstrated that customer yield (the percentage of seats that are unsold on flights) was similar and low (35%) during the years we examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tables S1 and S2 contain correlation matrices and descriptive statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S3 contains robustness checks with additional controls (month of the year, day of week, time of day, and flight frequency), as well as reports odds ratios for all of the global flight regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are consistent with those reported in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also sought to identify other possible markers of inequality and status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we attempted to explore how the availability of economy plus seating, which allows economy passengers to upgrade to slightly roomier seats, could alter perceptions of inequality among economy class passengers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, this feature was implemented by the airline in specific planesnot in entire plane modelsover a period of years, making it impossible for us to examine this question because our dataset indicates only which plane model, but not which specific plane, is used for each flight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we attempted to identify employee behaviors that might accentuate perceptions of inequality among economy class passengers, such as gate agents reminders not to use the first class boarding lane, and flight attendants use of curtains to separate first class and economy cabins or reminders not to use first class washrooms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, however, these employee-level data were not tracked by the airline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Class-based seating is both more prevalent and more unequal in recent years, with first class cabins claiming an increasingly large share of total space (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As both inequality and class-based airplane seating continue to rise, incidents of air rage may similarly climb in frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Building on previous interdisciplinary research on inequality, we demonstrate that both physical and situational factors present in everyday environments are associated with dangerous, class-specific antisocial behaviors among both the haves and the have nots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study was approved by the University of Toronto Ethics Review Board (Protocol 32624) and did not require informed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined a population of flights from a large international airline over several years (circa 2010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a private database that contained all documented disruptive passenger incidents during this time period (n = 1,500 to 4,000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, we selected only those incidents that occurred on board and could be matched to a flight record; we used these data in our analyses (see SI Methods for additional details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The airline classified each incident by flight number and date, and recorded disruptive passengers seating class, gender, and incident type (e.g., belligerent behavior or emotional outburst).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We combined the air rage incident data with a proprietary database of the population of flights from this airline in the time period (n = 15 million flights).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flight database included flight characteristics (e.g., plane model details and flight details, such as departure and arrival locations, delays, and distance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the plane models indicated in the dataset, we coded the physical layout of each airplane with readily available online information from the airline, including seat and cabin dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We operationalized physical inequality on the plane by the presence or absence of first class on all flights; we operationalized situational inequality by boarding typefront boarding or middle boarding planeswithin flights that contained a first class cabin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
