title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extracellular vesicles from human pancreatic islets suppress human islet amyloid polypeptide amyloid formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein assembly into amyloid fibers underlies such neurodegenerative disorders as Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type 2 diabetes (T2D) also involves amyloid formation, although in the pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there are no cures for amyloid diseases and T2D is on the rise due to an increasing prevalence of obesity, identifying involved mechanisms and control processes is of utmost importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can mediate physiological and pathological communication both locally and at a distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that EVs secreted from healthy, but not from T2D, pancreatic cells slow amyloid formation of the major peptide found in amyloid deposits in T2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose an EV-mediated process that tempers amyloid formation in the pancreas at normal conditions, which breaks down in T2D due to altered EV proteinlipid composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small vesicles released by cells to aid cellcell communication and tissue homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) is the major component of amyloid deposits found in pancreatic islets of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IAPP is secreted in conjunction with insulin from pancreatic  cells to regulate glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using a combination of analytical and biophysical methods in vitro, we tested whether EVs isolated from pancreatic islets of healthy patients and patients with T2D modulate IAPP amyloid formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that pancreatic EVs from healthy patients reduce IAPP amyloid formation by peptide scavenging, but T2D pancreatic and human serum EVs have no effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with these differential effects, the insulin:C-peptide ratio and lipid composition differ between EVs from healthy pancreas and EVs from T2D pancreas and serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It appears that healthy pancreatic EVs limit IAPP amyloid formation via direct binding as a tissue-specific control mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Characterization_of_Human_Islet_EVs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EVs were collected from cultures of human pancreatic islets from healthy patients and patients with T2D, which contained a mean of 1,500 ± 433 and 1,900 ± 630 islets/mL, respectively (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to EVs from healthy and diabetic pancreatic islets, we also included EVs isolated from human serum as control EVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of total protein content (Fig 1A) and total particle content (Fig 1B) revealed similar concentrations in all three EV samples (i.e., 5 mg/mL protein; 510 nM EVs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size distribution of the EVs was characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) (Fig 1C), which showed the control serum EVs to be the largest (105 nm) and the healthy pancreas EVs to be the smallest (95 nm), but overall all EVs showed a size distribution of 100 nm in diameter, a value typically associated with exosomes (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured  potentials for the EVs were all negative and did not vary among the three types (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values obtained were in the same range as those for small unilamellar vesicles made with anionic lipids (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of  potentials between pancreatic EVs and exosomes from neuronal cells (26) showed that pancreatic EVs are less negatively charged (7 mV vs. 16 mV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To get an idea about the cargo of the EVs, we analyzed protein content by ELISA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In related work, we have established that the pancreatic EVs contain many typical markers of exosomes, probed at both mRNA and protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we quantified the content of INS, C-peptide (C-PEP; the C-terminal part of the pro-INS peptide, cleaved off when mature INS is produced; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12), and IAPP in the three types of EVs studied (Fig 1 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found the EVs from healthy islets to have approximately fivefold less INS than C-PEP, whereas for T2D EVs and serum EVs, the amounts of INS and C-PEP were roughly equal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the absolute amount of C-PEP was lower in T2D and serum-derived EVs than in EVs from healthy islets, but IAPP amounts were similar in all three EV types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Less INS than C-PEP matches with the lower stability of INS (vs. C-PEP) in vivo, resulting in fivefold less INS compared with C-PEP in systemic circulation under normal conditions (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because C-PEP appears to be the best indicator of INS production, the lower levels of C-PEP in T2D EVs may reflect lower INS production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, how the peptide levels inside EVs relate to the amounts circulating in the body is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the lack of a molecular explanation, these results demonstrate divergent C-PEP content between healthy and T2D pancreatic EVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EV_Effects_on_IAPP_Amyloid_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next assessed IAPP amyloid formation as a function of EV additions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we used thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence to monitor amyloid formation, as is commonly used in in vitro amyloid experiments (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IAPP alone is aggregation-prone and forms amyloids within 510 min under the conditions used here (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When EVs from healthy islets were added, a concentration-dependent (using EV protein content as the measure, which is proportional to the number of EVs) decrease in ThT fluorescence was detected (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of fluorescence at 10 min as a measure of reaction extent demonstrated significantly reduced amyloid formation at the highest EV concentration used, 25 g/mL of EV protein (corresponding to 0.05 nM EVs) (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess whether the EVs themselves were responsible for the retarding effects on IAPP amyloid formation, we filtered the EVs and tested the EV-free solution in IAPP aggregation reactions (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No effect of the EV-free solution on IAPP amyloid formation was detected, implying that it is indeed the EVs (specific lipids or membrane-protruding proteins) that mediate the effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, we added BSA in the same amount as the EV protein content (25 g/mL), and found no effect on IAPP amyloid formation (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that EVs alone had no effect on ThT fluorescence (SI Appendix, Fig S1B), and when EVs were added to preaggregated IAPP (i.e., after a 20-min incubation), no reduction of the ThT intensity was detected (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the EVs do not dissolve preformed IAPP amyloid fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To directly compare EVs from healthy and T2D islets as well as human serum EVs, we added all three types to IAPP aggregation experiments at a concentration of 25 µg/mL (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ThT assay showed a significant retardation of amyloid formation in the healthy EVs, as confirmed in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEM analysis of the resulting products revealed that in contrast to IAPP alone, in which typical amyloid fibers were readily observed, no amyloid fibers were detected in IAPP mixed with healthy pancreatic EVs (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, some amorphous aggregates were visible in the images that may be EVs alone or EVs with IAPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When T2D and serum EVs were added to IAPP aggregation reactions, no significant effects on IAPP amyloid formation were detected (Fig 3B) and amyloid fibers were clearly detected by TEM (Fig 3C), although they appeared fuzzy, implying that EV fragments may attach to the IAPP amyloids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the amyloid-reducing effect of the EVs from pancreatic islets on another aggregation-prone polypeptide, we turned to -synuclein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 140-residue -synuclein is the amyloidogenic protein in Parkinsons disease and the major component of Lewy bodies found in brains of patients with Parkinsons disease (3638), but also can be found in the pancreas (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently showed that IAPP monomers and IAPP amyloid fibers can exaggerate -synuclein amyloid formation in vitro, suggesting a possible explanation for why individuals with T2D are prone to Parkinsons disease (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, as probed by ThT fluorescence and atomic force microscopy (AFM), EVs from both healthy and T2D islets reduced -synuclein amyloid formation when added at the same EV:protein ratio as in the IAPP experiments (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a reasonable result, given that several types of negatively charged synthetic lipid vesicles can bind -synuclein and modulate amyloid formation (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanistic_Insights_into_EV-Mediated_IAPP_Amyloid_Inhibition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address how healthy pancreatic EVs inhibit IAPP amyloid formation, we probed the mixtures using size exclusion chromatography (SEC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Freshly dissolved IAPP elutes as a monomer (Fig 4A), whereas EVs are large enough to elute in the void of the SEC column but are not filtered away in the 0.2-µm precolumn filter (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AFM of the EV fraction showed the presence of nanosized vesicles (Fig 4B), in accordance with the NTA data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When IAPP and EVs were freshly mixed together and immediately eluted, no reaction was apparent, with the elution profile matching the sum of the individual samples described above (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of IAPP resulted in amyloid fibers, which were filtered away before injection into the column, with no absorption at 280 nm detected on SEC (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for an incubated mixture of IAPP and healthy islet EVs that showed no increase in ThT fluorescence or amyloid fibers by TEM, no monomeric IAPP was detected by SEC, and absorption of the EVs in the void was reduced (Fig 4D, arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that IAPP binds to the EVs, resulting in larger particles, some of which are filtered away before SEC analysis, as well as the absence of monomeric IAPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is not direct proof of an IAPPEV interaction, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, in agreement with the conclusion based on the SEC analysis, AFM showed that the EVs appeared larger in the presence of IAPP (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger EVs can be explained either by IAPP-induced fusion of several EVs or by surface binding of many IAPP peptides per EV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also analyzed the lipid composition of the EVs using the HPLC-charged aerosol detection (CAD) technique (Fig 5 and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six classes of lipids were detected and could be quantified: steryl ester (SE), triacylglycerol (TAG), cholesterol (CH), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingomyelin (SM), and phosphatidylcholine (PC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also searched for free fatty acids, cardiolipin, phosphatic acid, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol, but did not detect these molecules in our samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the lipid contents in the three different EV samples showed different lipid profiles in serum EVs and pancreatic EVs (Fig 5A), as could be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although no significant differences between healthy and T2D pancreatic EVs were found on two-way ANOVA (SI Appendix, Fig S3), this analysis suggested that healthy EVs have slightly higher CH, PC, and SM levels (at the expense of TAG and PE) compared with T2D EVs (Fig 5 and SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CH and SM are important membrane components affecting membrane fluidity and lipid raft formation (42), and it has been reported that the presence of SM in PC-based liposomes slows (43), and the addition of CH to synthetic lipid membranes inhibits, IAPP amyloid formation (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the idea that SM and/or CH in healthy pancreatic EVs may help mediate the inhibitory effect on IAPP amyloid formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found a higher lipid:protein ratio in healthy pancreatic EVs compared with T2D EVs, implying more exposed lipid surfaces in the former (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To pinpoint how healthy EVs bind IAPP on a molecular level, further studies using lipid vesicles of strategic compositions, along with identification of proteins exposed on the EV membrane surfaces, are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several studies have reported accelerated IAPP amyloid formation in the presence of synthetic vesicles rich in negatively charged lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our finding of healthy pancreatic EVs limiting IAPP amyloid formation is surprising at first glance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent work has shown that IAPP amyloid formation is strongly reduced by the extracellular environment and by plasma membranes of pancreatic  cells (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors speculated about the presence of particular lipids or proteins in the plasma membranes and/or secreted molecules that mediated this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our present results, we propose that secreted EVs from the pancreatic islets used in that study might have mediated the observed inhibitory effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, we found that the amyloid-reducing effect originated from the EVs themselves, not from any EV-secreted molecule or soluble component in the media, and involved IAPP surface binding and/or internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next step is to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying IAPP amyloid retardation by healthy pancreatic EVs, including the EV lipids and/or proteins that are the key players.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human_Pancreatic_Islets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human primary islets isolated from donor pancreases obtained from deceased individuals, with research consent from organ procurement organizations, were purchased from Prodo Laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use and storage of human islets were conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and was approved by an independent Regional Ethics Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Islets were transported in PIM(S) medium (Prodo Laboratories) and then transferred to fresh PIM(S) medium for overnight recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EV_Isolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human pancreatic islet-derived EVs were isolated from fresh pancreatic islet-conditioned media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Donor information is provided in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male and female donors were used for the isolation of healthy EVs; only female donors were available for the isolation of T2D-derived EVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditioned medium isolated after 24 h of culture was used for EV isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conditioned medium was freshly centrifuged at 200 × g for 10 min, then at 2,000 × g for 10 min, and finally at 4,000 × g for 60 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-µm filter and incubated with ExoQuick-TC reagent (System Biosciences) following the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EVs were then resuspended in PBS and stored at 80 °C in small aliquots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIM(S) medium was used to extract EVs corresponding to the human serum fraction for use as control EVs (h-Ctr-EV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Islets derived from T2D donors were used to isolate h-T2D-EVs, and islets derived from healthy, nondiabetic donors were used to isolate h-islet-EVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EV_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EVs were quantified in terms of total protein and particle concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total protein content was measured using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (23225; Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particle concentration and size distribution were measured by NTA using a Nanosight LM10 instrument (Malvern Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EVs were diluted in PBS to fit into the resolution window of measurement suggested by the instrument manufacturer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanosight NTA 3.1 software was used to capture and analyze the particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The  potential was measured by dynamic light scattering at 25 °C in TBS (Zetasizer Nano ZS; Malvern Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pancreatic hormones INS (10-1131-01; Mercodia), C-PEP (10-1141-01; Mercodia), and IAPP (LS-F9686; LifeSpan BioSciences) were quantified by ultrasensitive ELISA following the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proteins_Peptides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IAPP, obtained from Calbiochem (05-23-2540), was treated with hexafluoroisopropanol (105228; Sigma-Aldrich) before use to dissolve any preexisting aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purification of -synuclein was done as described previously (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before use, the protein was freeze-dried and dissolved in the appropriate buffer, followed by filtration through a 0.2-µm filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Amyloid_Formation_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IAPP amyloid formation was monitored in a 1-cm cuvette using a Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer (with a magnetic stirrer bar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IAPP aggregation was initiated by pipetting IAPP (2.5 mM stock in hexafluoroisopropanol) into a reaction buffer composed of 10 µM ThT (T3516; Sigma-Aldrich) in TBS (0.05 M TrisHCl buffer pH 7.6 with 0.15 M NaCl; 93318, Sigma-Aldrich) for a final concentration of 4 M. The fluorescence signal was recorded every 30 s at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -synuclein amyloid formation reactions were conducted in a plate reader (FLUOstar Optima; BMG Labtech) in TBS buffer in the presence of 20 µM ThT at 37 °C with agitation and a 2-mm glass bead in each well for a final concentration of 70 M. Samples were typically incubated for 80 h, and fluorescence was measured every 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both protein plate reader and cuvette experiments, ThT was excited at 440 nm, and emission was recorded at 480 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EV supplementation was dosed in µg/mL of total protein and freshly incubated with the peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EV-free solution was used as control, using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with a membrane of nominal molecular weight limit of 100 kDa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) served as a protein control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TEM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For TEM analysis, 10-L samples from the fibrillation studies were applied to Formvar-coated 200-mesh size copper grids, incubated for 5 min, washed with Milli-Q water, and stained with 1% uranyl acetate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grids were examined with a Zeiss LEO 912 Omega transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kV, and images were captured by an Olympus Veleta CCD camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SEC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Freshly mixed and incubated samples of 10 µM IAPP with or without 62.5 g/mL EVs (same ratio as used for the aggregations) were loaded on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column connected to a Äkta Purifier chromatography system (GE Healthcare) using TBS buffer as eluent and operated at 10 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elution was followed by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm, and 1-mL fractions were collected for AFM analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AFM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aggregated samples were diluted in Milli-Q water (1020 times) and deposited on freshly cleaved mica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 min, the mica was rinsed with filtered Milli-Q water and dried under a gentle nitrogen stream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were recorded on an NTEGRA Prima setup (NT-MDT) using a gold-coated single-crystal silicon cantilever (NSG01, spring constant of 5.1 N/m; NT-MDT) and a resonance frequency of 180 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 512-pixel images were acquired at a 0.5-Hz scan rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were analyzed using WSxM 5.0 software (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lipid_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each sample was extracted with a chloroform methanol mixture (2:1, vol/vol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were shaken vigorously and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation, water was added, followed by shaking and incubation for 10 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase separation was achieved by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The organic layer was recovered, and the aqueous layer was re-extracted with a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1, vol/vol), shaken vigorously, and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The organic layers were combined, evaporated to dryness under a steam of nitrogen, and reconstituted into a chloroform methanol mix (1:1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were analyzed using a HPLC-CAD system as described previously (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A minimum of three independent islet donors were used for the different experiments, with a minimum of two technical replicates per condition and assay, with the exception of the mass spectrometry analysis, for which samples from one donor per condition was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 6.01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results were analyzed for normal distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parametric or nonparametric methods were used to assess variances in the data depending on the data normality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Automatic correction for outliers was performed using the ROUT method (Q = 1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical significance of calculated P values is defined in SI Appendix, Table S2; P values of 0.05 were considered statistically significant in the analysis of the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Box-and-whisker plot graphs were used to show the distribution of the observed data variation (displayed as minimum to maximum value together with distribution around the median, i.e., upper and lower quartiles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
