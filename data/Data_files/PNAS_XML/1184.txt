Plasmodium-associated changes in human odor attract mosquitoes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vector-borne disease systems, there is mounting evidence that vertebrate hosts become more attractive to disease vectors during infection, yet in human malaria, the underlying mechanism has not been studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified compounds, including aldehydes, that are produced in relatively greater amounts in the skin odor of individuals with malaria, thus demonstrating a basis for this phenomenon in the cues used during mosquito host location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By establishing the attractiveness of these compounds to malaria mosquito vectors in laboratory bioassays, we characterize a process by which Plasmodium infection of humans could lead to increased mosquito biting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These compounds may serve as biomarkers of malaria or be used to enhance the efficacy of chemical lures used to trap mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Malaria parasites (Plasmodium) can change the attractiveness of their vertebrate hosts to Anopheles vectors, leading to a greater number of vectorhost contacts and increased transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, naturally Plasmodium-infected children have been shown to attract more mosquitoes than parasite-free children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate Plasmodium-induced increases in the attractiveness of skin odor in Kenyan children and reveal quantitative differences in the production of specific odor components in infected vs. parasite-free individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found the aldehydes heptanal, octanal, and nonanal to be produced in greater amounts by infected individuals and detected by mosquito antennae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In behavioral experiments, we demonstrated that these, and other, Plasmodium-induced aldehydes enhanced the attractiveness of a synthetic odor blend mimicking healthy human odor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heptanal alone increased the attractiveness of parasite-free natural human odor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Should the increased production of these aldehydes by Plasmodium-infected humans lead to increased mosquito biting in a natural setting, this would likely affect the transmission of malaria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Attractiveness_and_Plasmodium_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measured the behavioral response of Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) to the foot odor of 5- to 12-y-old schoolchildren at two sampling time points, to assess whether Plasmodium infection changes the attractiveness of human hosts to mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At time point one (T1; Fig 1), foot odor of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum-infected and uninfected children was collected on socks for 20 h. For infected individuals, this occurred immediately after administration of the first dose of treatment with the antimalarial artemether-lumefantrine (AL), which is known to allow residual parasitemia during this time period (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Odor samples were collected in the same manner from the same children 21 d later, following confirmed parasite clearance (T2; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Odor samples from participants with malaria parasites were categorized by those who harbored transmissible gametocyte stages [microscopy positive and/or  greater than 50 gametocytes per microliter by the molecular diagnostic quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA), which detects female gametocyte Pfs25 mRNA, n = 23] or those with asexual stage parasites (microscopy negative for gametocytes and/or QT-NASBA gametocytes less_than50 per microliter, n = 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were considered parasite-free (n = 12) when no parasites were detected by microscopy and 18S quantitative PCR (qPCR) (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae s.s. mosquitoes were offered the choice of either T1 or T2 odor samples from the same child, in a dual-choice cage assay (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of mosquitoes choosing the odors collected from children at T1 was significantly affected by parasitological status [generalized linear model (GLM), F test, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mosquitoes were more attracted to odors collected at T1 from children harboring asexual or gametocyte-stage parasites relative to T2 odor samples [GLM, 95% confidence intervals (95 CI) 0.550.62 and 0.590.63, respectively; Fig 1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across both groups, the ratio of attraction to infected (asexual or gametocyte carriers) vs. parasite-free odor was 0.6 to 0.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mosquitoes did not differentiate between T1 and T2 odor samples from parasite-free children, indicating that the difference observed between T1 and T2 odor was not an effect of sampling time point (GLM, 95 CI: 0.480.54; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was independent of age, sex, tympanic (in-ear) temperature, or hemoglobin level at T1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that infection with microscopically observable densities of either asexual-stage parasites [median, 1,340 (interquartile range; IQR: 4802,720) parasites per microliter (p/µL)] or gametocytes [median, 80 (IQR: 40680) p/µL] is associated with changes in odor profile that increase attraction to mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding supports previous studies that demonstrate the heightened attractiveness of infected hosts, although here, by offering foot odor alone, we preclude the influence of other factors including breath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe the gametocyte-specific effect that was described (79), although we cannot rule out the possibility that low densities of gametocytes in some asexual participants contributed to their increased attractiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which chemicals in body odor are responsible for the observed differences in attractiveness, we repeat-sampled 56 Plasmodium-infected and parasite-free children from the same locality, using air entrainment to collect foot odor samples onto polymeric filters for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Antennal_Response_to_Malaria_Odor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed air entrainment odor extracts using coupled gas chromatography-electroantennography (GC-EAG) (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A change in the electric potential across the antenna resulting from stimulated neuropsychological activity (i.e., the EAG response) is caused during olfactory nerve cell response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows detection of compounds to which the mosquitoes are potentially behaviorally active (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Point-of-care malaria diagnostics [rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and microscopy], used to inform odor sampling from asymptomatic individuals, were retrospectively confirmed by using molecular diagnostics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infected children were treated after odor sampling, and repeat sampling of all individuals was attempted 1 and 3 wk later alongside repeat parasitological diagnoses (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Odor samples from individuals harboring similar Plasmodium parasite stages or densities were extracted into solvent and mixed to create blends of average odor with the following infection profiles: (i) Plasmodium infection, no gametocytes; (ii) Plasmodium infection, high-density gametocytes; and (iii) parasite-free individuals (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further group, (iv) Plasmodium infection, submicroscopic gametocytes, was included due to the frequency of submicroscopic gametocytemia in endemic infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. falciparum gametocyte densities were determined by Pfs25 mRNA QT-NASBA, while 18S qPCR and duplex qPCR were used to determine P. falciparum and Plasmodium densities, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-two analytes (Table S2) were found to elicit antennal response in Anopheles coluzzii (formerly the M-form of An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae s.s. Giles), including the aldehydes heptanal, octanal, and nonanal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No EAG-active analytes were specific to any of the infection profiles (iiv), indicating that any Plasmodium-induced change in the compounds used by host-seeking Anopheles must occur by variation in the relative amounts of compounds that are present in parasite-free individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plasmodium_IACs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether Plasmodium infection indeed results in quantitative changes in the production of volatile compounds, we compared the profiles of 117 foot and 59 control (empty entrainment bag) odor samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 56 individuals participated in air entrainment odor sampling (Fig 2); however, not all individuals were available at follow-up time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foot odor samples from Plasmodium-infected individuals were categorized by infection status: those from individuals with higher ( greater than 50 p/µL, which approximates the microscopy limit of detection) and lower (less_than50 p/µL) density infections and those from individuals harboring microscopic gametocytes (total density categorization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the prevalence of non-P. falciparum infections was low [5.05% (n = 5) and 3.96% (n = 4) for P. malariae and P. ovale spp., respectively, at day 0, and eight of nine had concurrent P. falciparum parasites], we did not separate samples from individuals with non-falciparum infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis revealed increases in the production of the aldehydes heptanal, octanal, nonanal, (E)-2-octenal, and (E)-2-decenal by infected individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increases were broadly associated with infections of high parasite density, relative to either low density or production by parasite-free individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-density infections were also correlated with the presence of gametocytes in this dataset (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heptanal was produced in significantly greater amounts by individuals with higher parasite densities ( greater than 50 p/µL) relative to parasite-free individuals [residual maximum likelihood (REML), least significant difference (LSD), 5%; Fig 3 A and C].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Octanal and nonanal were produced in significantly greater amounts by individuals with higher-density, relative to those with lower-density (less_than50 p/µL), infections (REML, LSD, 5%; Fig 3 D, F, G, and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate further this seemingly density-dependent effect, we divided the higher- and lower-density individuals into quartiles, representing low, medium-low, medium-high, and high density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a clear correlation between increased production of heptanal, octanal, and nonanal and increased parasite density (Fig 3 B, E, and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in production of nonanal between low, or negative, and high individuals was significant (REML, LSD, 5%; Fig 3H and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to parasite-free individuals, there was a trend for all Plasmodium parasite-positive individuals to produce more of the unsaturated aldehydes (E)-2-octenal and (E)-2-decenal (Fig 3 J and K), and for the latter, this difference was significant if individuals were categorized simply as Plasmodium-positive or parasite-free (REML, positive vs. negative categories, LSD 5%; Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well-established that aldehydes are among the many volatiles that constitute human skin odor (2426), where they are frequently cited as being predominant (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the ketone 2-octanone was found to be associated with the presence of microscopic gametocytes (REML, LSD, 5%; Fig 3L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, ketones are known volatiles of human skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all IACs, we found a quantitative relationship: The majority of individuals produced these compounds, but the quantity produced increased with Plasmodium infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An average of 177 (SE 5.23) analytes were captured per sample, and the IACs were disproportionately abundantly produced (Fig 4), comprising on average 22.92% of the total odor profile across all 117 samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When production was ranked relative to all other compounds sampled, nonanal had a median rank of one, octanal two, and heptanal five.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While specific IACs were produced in greater amounts by individuals harboring parasites, an overall increase in volatile emissions from infected persons was not observed (REML, LSD, 5%; Fig S3), contrary to findings in the mouse or CHMI system (6, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the IACs, the antennal response, observed by GC-EAG to heptanal, octanal, and nonanal, suggests that changes in the production of these compounds could affect mosquito behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mosquito_Response_to_IAC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the IACs were attractive to mosquitoes, and therefore likely to be responsible for the increased attractiveness observed in infected individuals, we tested all six IACs [heptanal, octanal, nonanal, (E)-2-decenal, (E)-2-octenal, and 2-octanone] in behavioral bioassays with An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coluzzii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested for a behavioral response toward the latter three compounds because of their positive association with the presence of parasites in the bloodstream (Fig 3), despite a lack of antennal response in An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coluzzii (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the odor of parasite-free children (worn socks) was supplemented with the IAC individually and tested at a minimum of two concentrations each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, adding 10 L of heptanal at a concentration of 108 g/mL to parasite-free odor significantly increased attractiveness, relative to parasite-free odor alone (GLM, 95 CI: 0.600.84; Fig 5), while heptanal at a concentration of 107 g/mL had no effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The attractive concentration is 1/10th of the additional heptanal isolated in odor samples from individuals with higher-density Plasmodium infections, relative to negative individuals, over the corresponding time period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that elevated emission of heptanal, at specific concentrations, by parasitemic children could contribute to their increased attractiveness to mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementing with octanal, nonanal, (E)-2-decenal, (E)-2-octenal, or 2-octanone alone did not induce altered behavioral responses, despite the EAG activity observed in response to octanal and nonanal (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested whether the addition of heptanal to a current best-practice synthetic mosquito lure, MB5 [comprising ammonia, l-(+)-lactic acid, tetradecanoic acid, 3-methyl-1-butanol, and butan-1-amine (28)], might further increase attractiveness to mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, MB5 supplemented with heptanal was equally attractive as control MB5, at three concentrations (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the attractiveness of heptanal observed with parasite-free odor was dependent on synergism with other volatile compounds naturally present, but absent from the synthetic MB5 blend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because odor detection and response are highly contextual, this was not an unexpected outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate further the behavioral role of IACs, but allowing for such synergistic effects between these compounds, we tested two blends with MB5: Plas 5 contained the aldehydes found to be associated with increased total parasite density [heptanal, octanal, nonanal, (E)-2-octenal, and (E)-2-decenal], and Plas 6 additionally contained the ketone 2-octanone that was associated specifically with gametocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each was tested at four concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Plas 5 blend enhanced attractiveness of MB5 (1% concentration, GLM, 95 CI: 0.510.77; Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the Plas 6 blend was not found to increase attractiveness of MB5 at any concentration (Fig S4), which suggests that the gametocyte-associated 2-octanone moderated the attractiveness of the Plas 5 aldehydes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the presence of small amounts of 2-octanone in parasite-free odor, however (Fig 3I), which increases in attractiveness on addition of heptanal (Fig 5), it appeared that this repellency of 2-octanone is not observed in the context of natural human odor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In previous studies describing the increased attraction of gametocyte carriers, the odor tested included both body and breath (7, 9), leaving open the possibility that the gametocyte-specific attraction may have originated in the breath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, malaria-associated volatile compounds have been identified in the breath, whose production varied cyclically according to P. falciparum parasitemia, although no investigation of the mosquito response to those compounds was undertaken (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our behavioral tests showed that supplementing parasite-free odor with heptanal increased attractiveness to mosquitoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, heptanal alone did not increase the attractiveness of a basic synthetic lure, while a blend of infection-associated aldehydes including heptanal (Plas 5) was attractive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in both instances, the increased attraction was dependent on additive effects among the infection-associated aldehydes, which are naturally present in parasite-free odor at lower concentrations (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aldehydes are found in the skin odor of various mammalian species (30) and have been determined to be among the chemicals used by hematophagous insects for host location (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These oxygenated compounds can be synthesized when reactive oxygen species attack lipid-dense membrane structures (32), i.e., lipid peroxidation, caused by oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidative stress is known to characterize malaria infection (33), occurring in the erythrocytes and liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, or additionally, the aldehydes found here may have been produced directly by Plasmodium parasites: A recent publication found the aldehydes octanal, nonanal, and decanal to be among volatile compounds emitted by red blood cell (RBC) cultures that had been supplemented by (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP) (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HMBPP is a precursor in the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, apparently used by Plasmodium for isoprenoid production, and it was suggested that HMBPP triggered enhanced release of these compounds from infected RBCs, with a subsequent impact on mosquito attraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, terpenes were isolated from HMBPP RBCs, and another study also isolated terpenes above Plasmodium-infected RBC cultures (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the MEP pathway is a possible source of terpenes via isoprenoid production in infected RBCs (iRBCs) (35), the source of terpenes in HMBPP RBCs remains unknown (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find an association between Plasmodium infection and the emission of terpenes from the skin, corroborating earlier findings in Plasmodium-infected mice (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be emphasized that laboratory-based studies of the volatile compounds isolated above iRBC cultures do not characterize the human body odor used by mosquitoes during host location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, they do not fully capture the complex biological and biochemical hostparasite interactions that occur in natural Plasmodium infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, the production of aldehydes was increased in individuals with Plasmodium infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent to which parasite-specific release of aldehydes from iRBCs would contribute to a profound and systemic increase in aldehyde production, caused by malaria-induced oxidative stress, remains unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, it is important to note that while the lipid peroxidation pathway for aldehyde production is well-established, the skin microbiota is also known to produce aldehydes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly relevant to our study, as odor samples were taken from the feet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feet harbor skin microflora that produce volatiles that are attractive to mosquitoes (36), and differences in microflora have been associated with differences in attractiveness (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrated that elevated production of specific aldehydes in skin odor is associated with increased attractiveness to mosquitoes in Plasmodium-infected people.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are in accordance with the deceptive signaling hypothesis, whereby host cues already used by host-seeking insects are exaggerated, increasing the attractiveness of that vertebrate to biting insects, but when the blood-meal is in fact unfavorable to the insect (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the disadvantages [e.g., reductions in fecundity (3840) or shortened lifespan (4143)] of taking an infected blood-meal outweigh any advantages [e.g., reduced host defenses (2) or faster engorgement (44)], the evolution of an infected-host avoidance phenotype might be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anopheles may less easily select against an infected-host phenotype comprising normal stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the observed changes to skin odor are specific to P. falciparum, which constituted the majority of infections in the cohorts that we studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In similar studies of mosquito attraction, increases are often associated with the chronic phase of malaria and/or increased density of bloodstream gametocytes (2, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that odor from all P. falciparum-infected individuals was more attractive than that of parasite-free individuals, and the increased production of IACs was correlated with total parasite density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is possible that gametocytes at densities below the detection limit of our assay (45) contributed to the attractiveness of individuals with asexual malaria parasites, the greatest production of IACs did not correlate with gametocyte density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between P. falciparum asexual parasite biomass and gametocyte density is generally positive (4648), and we also observed this in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our findings are in broad agreement with studies that observed an increase in attractiveness related to the presence of gametocytes (2, 59) or general malaria infection (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The compounds we observed to be associated with infection could be derived from malaria-induced oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is in vitro evidence that suggests both octanal and nonanal could be produced by RBCs via interactions with components of the isoprenoid production pathway (34), found in Plasmodium parasites, both this and the oxidative stress mechanism would result in the observed correlation between increased parasite density and increased compound production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, this correlation would be observed if IACs were the by-product of any sequelae of Plasmodium infection, with the resulting influence on mosquito behavior a coincidental benefit to the parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the question of whether the IACs found in our study are specific to Plasmodium infection or could be a general scent of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, increased aldehydes have been found to signify the presence of other diseases (32, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data do indicate that the observed increase in these IACs is specific to Plasmodium infection, because a general scent of infection might have been expected in malaria parasite-free children who harbored other infectious organisms, and as such there would have been no observed difference in IAC production between the uninfected and infected children in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Schistosoma mansoni was recently found in 51% of 9- to 12-y-old children in the neighboring Asembo District (51) and was likely present in individuals in our malaria parasite-free cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, only one study on the effects of Plasmodium infection on volatile emission in humans included a control group of bacteria-infected participants, and they found that increased levels of thioethers in human breath were indeed malaria-specific (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, an important follow-up to our study would be to examine skin odor profiles, and behavioral responses of mosquitoes toward these, of individuals affected by other diseases thought to be characterized by similar emissions but not vectored by an insect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although it is not possible to infer from this study whether the increased production of IACs is under the control of malaria parasites, it could be argued that if the parasites indirectly stimulated compound production (e.g., via triggering oxidative stress), the parasite genes underlying this stimulation would be selected for via enhanced transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a mutation benefitting transmission may be costly to the parasite and would therefore only be selected if the trade-off resulted in a net increase in transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies that explore the relative costs and benefits of manipulation to the parasite, for example, through modeling (52), are merited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implications of identifying IACs, with their demonstrated impact on mosquito behavior, are far-reaching: We better understand parasitevectorhost transmission events and their overdispersed nature in human populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These compounds may permit further improvement of already highly functional lures for trapping malaria mosquitoes or even serve as biomarkers for malaria, providing a basis for novel and noninvasive diagnostic tools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ethics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study participants were 5- to 12-y-old children local to the Thomas Odhiambo Campus of icipe in Western Kenya (0°2548.1S, 34°1224.5E), including Rusinga Island, in Suba District, Homa Bay County.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were recruited after obtaining signed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study protocol (NON SSC 389) was approved by the Scientific and Ethical Review Committee of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI/RES/7/3/1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent analyses were conducted at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) (ethics reference 8510).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Attractiveness_of_Infected_Odor_(Socks)_by_Cage_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A cohort of Plasmodium-infected, asymptomatic (tympanic temperature less_than37.5 °C) individuals that participated in an olfactometer study (9) was studied for the attractiveness of their skin odor to An.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  gambiae s.s. Forty-five children were included, of which there were 23 with microscopic gametocytes or an estimated gametocyte density of  greater than 50 gametocytes per microliter of blood by QT-NASBA, 10 positive for asexual parasites but not gametocytes by microscopy, and 12 that tested Plasmodium-parasite free by 18S-qPCR (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were collected at two time points: within 24 h of antimalarial treatment but while children still harbored parasites (22) (T1 samples) and 21 d later (T2 samples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antimalarial treatment with AL was administered to Plasmodium-positive individuals according to manufacturers instructions (20 mg of artemether/120 mg of lumefantrine per tablet; Coartem; Novartis), and socks were put on within 1 h of treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age, hemoglobin (Hb), weight, and temperature were measured as covariates (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 21 (after), both parasitological testing and participant covariate measurements were repeated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Analysis_of_Odor_Profiles_by_GC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Instruments used for GC analysis were 7890A, 6890N, and HP6890 (Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each was fitted with a cool-on-column injector, FID, and used hydrogen carrier gas, and 1-L injections were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All were fitted with an HP1 column, 50 m × 0.32 mm, film thickness 0.52 m, and the following program was used: oven temperature maintained at 40 °C for 0.5 min, increased by 5 °C per min to 150 °C, held for 0.1 min, raised by 10 °C per min to 230 °C, and held for 40 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traces were analyzed by using the R package MALDIquant (62) (R Version 3.3.0, 2016, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, raw x, y coordinates for GC traces were exported from Agilent ChemStation (C.01.04), and the y value (height, for 1 µL) was multiplied by total extract to represent actual amount per sample (nanograms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following baseline removal, traces were visually inspected for consistent differences between parasitological groupings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds of interest (COIs) were then compared quantitatively, by integrating peaks in ChemStation, and calculating retention index and amount relative to a standard series of n-alkanes (C7-C25), using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Retention index (RI) calculationRI=100((log10RtXlog10Rtn)/(log10Rtn+1log10Rtn))+100n,[1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where RtX is the retention time for the COI, Rtn is the retention time for alkane before the COI, Rtn + 1 is retention time for alkane after the COI, and n is the number of carbons in alkane before the COI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
