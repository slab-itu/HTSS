title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fisheries bycatch risk to marine megafauna is intensified in Lagrangian coherent structures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Marine capture fisheries provide a valuable source of protein and are economically important in coastal communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, fisheries sustainability is impacted by incidental capture of nontarget species (bycatch), which remains a major global threat to marine megafauna such as sharks, sea turtles, seals, cetaceans, and seabirds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding where and when bycatch events take place can guide fisheries sustainability solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we model how dynamic structures in the ocean such as fronts and eddies influence fisheries effort, catch, and bycatch likelihood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that bycatch of a diverse range of species is more likely in attracting Lagrangian coherent structures, in which water masses meet and aggregate prey, predators, and fishers into hotspots of risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Incidental catch of nontarget species (bycatch) is a major barrier to ecological and economic sustainability in marine capture fisheries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key to mitigating bycatch is an understanding of the habitat requirements of target and nontarget species and the influence of heterogeneity and variability in the dynamic marine environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While patterns of overlap among marine capture fisheries and habitats of a taxonomically diverse range of marine vertebrates have been reported, a mechanistic understanding of the real-time physical drivers of bycatch events is lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moving from describing patterns toward understanding processes, we apply a Lagrangian analysis to a high-resolution ocean model output to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that drive fisheries interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the likelihood of marine megafauna bycatch is intensified in attracting Lagrangian coherent structures associated with submesoscale and mesoscale filaments, fronts, and eddies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results highlight how the real-time tracking of dynamic structures in the oceans can support fisheries sustainability and advance ecosystem-based management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Attracting LCS, and the spatiotemporal evolution of these convoluted and dynamic features, were mapped daily over the CCS domain for the period 19902010 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings demonstrate that over the 21-y period examined, fisheries effort in the California drift gillnet fishery was significantly more likely to be associated with increased magnitude of FTLE, establishing that this fishery targets attracting LCS associated with (sub)mesoscale surface structures such as upwelling filaments, fronts, and eddies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The locations of gillnet sets on haul-out were more likely than unfished locations to be associated with attracting LCS (as indicated by the median FTLE magnitude; see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slope of the relationship between the probability of fishing vessel presence and the strength of the attracting LCS field was highly significant in all model iterations (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The primary target species of this drift gillnet fishery is broadbill swordfish Xiphias gladius.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several secondary target species are incidentally caught yet retained for sale (e.g., Pacific bluefin tuna Thunnus orientalis, pelagic thresher shark Alopias pelagicus, common thresher shark Alopias vulpinus, shortfin mako shark Isurus oxyrinchus, smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena, opah Lampris guttatus), and a range of nontarget species are caught as bycatch (e.g., blue shark Prionace glauca, ocean sunfish Mola mola, leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea, loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta, California sea lion Zalophus californianus, northern elephant seal Mirounga angustirostris).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found a highly significant influence of FTLE magnitude on swordfish catch probability (Fig 2 A and B and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Swordfish were more likely to be caught in drift gillnets, and in higher numbers, when sets were associated with attracting LCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other predatory fishes including economically valuable, and vulnerable, Pacific bluefin tuna, several species of shark (common thresher, pelagic thresher, shortfin mako, smooth hammerhead, blue shark), opah, and ocean sunfish were landed as secondary targets or bycatch significantly more frequently, and in higher numbers, in attracting LCS (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3 and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, attracting LCS strongly influenced rates of blue shark bycatch (Fig 3 E and F and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, our analyses revealed a pattern of increased risk of entanglement of protected species including cetaceans, sea turtles, and pinnipeds in association with attracting LCS (Fig 4 and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While rates of marine megafauna bycatch in the fishery have decreased substantially since the introduction in 2001 of a large-scale seasonal closure designed to reduce sea turtle bycatch (the Pacific Leatherback Conservation Area), the observed pattern of increased bycatch likelihood of attracting LCS held true for the protected marine vertebrate group including sea turtles, such as the endangered loggerhead and critically endangered leatherback turtles, cetaceans listed under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA 1972) such as sperm whales Physeter macrochephalus, humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae, beaked whales and delphinids, and MMPA-listed northern elephant seals M. angustirostris.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparing probabilities of capture and predictions of total catch across the range of species with which the fishery interacted over the 21-y study period (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 and SI Appendix) yields valuable information regarding which species are more at risk in association with the bycatch hotspots in LCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, our models predict catch rates of 40 swordfish, 60 blue shark, 75 mola, and 10 bluefin tuna per fishing trip, associated with intense LCS fields (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bluefin tuna are less likely to be caught than swordfish, blue shark, or mola, but have considerably higher economic value and conservation interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the pressing need to reduce bycatch while maintaining fisheries profitability, understanding the role of the dynamic physical environment in structuring the distributions of marine megafauna is essential in designing sustainable fisheries solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide an objective demonstration of the effect of (sub)mesoscale LCS in the spatial structuring of marine ecosystems and, hence, fisheries bycatch interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The established mechanistic function of (sub)mesoscale structures in aggregating low trophic level organisms (3335, 55) suggests that the observed intensification of bycatch risk in LCS is mediated through regulation of forage resource availability for marine predators of both exploited and protected status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast with previous work documenting long-term, broad-scale patterns of overlap between fisheries and core habitats of marine vertebrates (23, 24, 29, 41), this study uses high-resolution Lagrangian products time-matched with spatially explicit fisheries data to quantify the influence of (sub)mesoscale structures on fisheries effort, catch rates, and the likelihood of marine vertebrate bycatch events across multiple taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach focuses on the biophysical processes that underlie fisheries interactions, yielding important insights into the influence of the contemporaneous physical environment at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant to the design of conservation and management initiatives, particularly in developing tools for spatially dynamic ocean management (5660).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, we find evidence of intensified likelihood of fisheries interactions in attracting LCS that holds true for target species, secondary targets, and bycatch-sensitive species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catch rates of a diverse array of species, including elasmobranchs of management concern (e.g., blue shark, shortfin mako, common thresher, pelagic thresher), large teleost fish such as bluefin tuna, opah, and M. mola, and of protected species including cetaceans, sea turtles, and pinnipeds, are higher in association with LCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses indicate that these are not coincidental interactions, as gillnet set locations are strongly associated with attracting LCS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Communication with the fisher community supports the hypothesis that the fishery actively targets (sub)mesoscale surface structures, which can be indicated by lines of advected drifting foam and debris at the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some LCS are also coincident with SST discontinuities that are visible in satellite imagery, although many features do not have a signature in SST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strategy of targeting attracting LCS appears to be profitable in that it increases the probability of catching greater numbers of the target species (see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38), but may in fact be counterproductive in also increasing the likelihood of interactions with protected species, which the fishery seeks to avoid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings suggest that including derived ocean features such as LCS in the design of dynamic ocean management solutions could facilitate bycatch reduction in marine fisheries (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, dynamic time-area closures could track regions of intense submesoscale variability, such as persistent frontal zones (32), or areas in which attracting LCS manifest frequently, such as the peripheries of eddies and upwelling filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, developing effective spatial tools for fisheries sustainability relies upon a knowledge of the factors that delineate and separate the distributions of target and nontarget species (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In data-rich systems such as the CCS, using species distribution models (SDMs) that can resolve the relative distributions of target and nontarget species can inform fisheries of resource distributions and facilitate separation of catch and bycatch hotspots (40, 58, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including LCS as predictors in these SDMs has potential to enhance predictive capabilities for separating fine-scale habitat preferences of target and bycatch-sensitive species, particularly where species-specific mechanistic responses to the contemporaneous physical environment are considered explicitly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our multispecies quantification of catch and bycatch probabilities enables the development of preferential catchbycatch strategies based on near real-time environmental conditions (see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alongside dynamic time-area closures, fine-scale set positioning with respect to LCS, as well as gear modifications for depth selectivity, could allow for continued exploitation of aggregations of target species while reducing bycatch risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the observed functional responses of tunas to submesoscale thermal fronts establishes that teleost fish are likely to be closer to the surface when exploiting thermal resources on the warm side of a front, and deeper in the water column when targeting forage resources on the cold side (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that a strategy targeting surface aggregations on the warm side of a convergent front could avoid interactions with other nontarget endothermic predators exploiting the same bait fish aggregation near the thermocline beneath the cooler side of the front.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vertical niche separation also confers opportunity for fine-scale selectivity through the targeting of particular depth ranges, as pelagic habitats are structured over three dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissimilar foraging ecology, physiological constraints, and diel vertical migratory behavior influence the use of the water column by different species and age classes of large pelagic fish (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, whole-body endothermy in opah allows the fish to remain in deeper, colder water for extended periods (62), whereas poikilotherms with organ-specific countercurrent heat exchange such as tuna and swordfish are more sensitive to thermal constraints and appear to use thermal fronts to maximize energetic efficiency in foraging (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, air-breathing endotherms such as marine mammals and seabirds exhibit divergent depth utilization strategies to those of true pelagics such as sharks and large teleost fishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depth utilization by air-breathing predators is limited by physiological constraints, which necessitate regular dives interspersed by forays to the surface to breathe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect species-specific patterns of depth utilization around (sub)mesoscale structures, which could be exploited to target certain species while avoiding others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, vertical niche separation has informed the imposition of regulation in the California drift gillnet fishery that requires fishermen to set nets at least 10 m below the surface, in an effort to avoid interactions with air-breathing species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further gear modifications to improve selectivity through the targeting of different depth ranges could facilitate progress toward the goal of reducing bycatch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-resolution, data-assimilative ocean models have vast potential to generate tools for spatial fisheries management through improved understanding of species dynamic distributions over broad scales and in three dimensions (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By calculating FTLE from velocity fields of a data-assimilative ocean model, we better quantify physical drivers of fishery interactions than the coarse-scale overlap analyses that precede this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using FTLE fields derived from regional ocean models (e.g., ROMS) has several distinct advantages over satellite-based products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data-assimilative ocean models validate and adjust hindcasts and nowcasts using real-time satellite and in situ observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physical data are of higher spatial resolution (here, ROMS outputs are 0.1° compared with 0.25°) and temporal frequency (daily fields as opposed to 3-d composites) than those available from satellite altimetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ocean models provide full velocity fields, while only geostrophic flow can be calculated from satellite altimetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ocean model output includes gap-free atmospheric forcing (e.g., wind stress) and physical ocean fields (e.g., temperature, salinity, zonal, and meridional velocities) at the same resolution, enabling the construction of SDMs at management-relevant scales (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, ocean models also resolve the full 3D ocean, allowing exploration of subsurface features and conferring opportunity to improve understanding of vertical niche separation and species-specific mechanistic responses to physical conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further studies that use ocean models to address the influence of (sub)mesoscale biophysical processes on dynamic species distributions would be highly informative in developing ecosystem-based fisheries management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, improving understanding of the mechanistic function of repelling LCS, and of different types of frontal systems (i.e., thermal vs. chlorophyll-a; convergent vs. divergent), could elucidate further the spatial structuring of plankton communities, dynamics of prey aggregations, and niche separation of higher trophic levels (55, 64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, this would enhance our operational capacity to predict fine-scale habitat utilization by both exploited and protected marine vertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the complexity of the bycatch problem, a suite of complementary solutions will be necessary to support a sustainable seafood supply sufficient to meet future demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the conservation and management value of understanding the mechanisms through which the physical environment structures marine species distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including high-resolution Lagrangian metrics in future investigations of the spatiotemporal dynamics of marine capture fisheries, and in the development of tools for dynamic ocean management, has considerable potential for enhancing fisheries sustainability and blue growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spatial distribution of attracting LCS (convergent structures) for the CCS is estimated using modeled surface ocean currents produced from an implementation of ROMS with four-dimensional variational (4D-Var) data assimilation (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data assimilation is used to combine the observations and the numerical model to obtain the best linear unbiased estimate of the circulation (66, 67) and accurately capture the complex ocean circulation of the CCS, which is characterized by energetic mesoscale variability and pronounced seasonal upwelling driven by alongshore wind stress and wind stress curl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the ROMS 4D-Var daily posterior circulation estimate at 1/10° (roughly 10 km) horizontal resolution to estimate attracting LCS as ridges of the backward-in-time FTLE (FTLEb) field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge that 10 km may appear relatively coarse compared with the spatial scales of fishing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, FLTE has been shown to be surprisingly robust to noise and low spatial resolution velocity fields (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FTLE measures the maximum separation of close-by particles of a time-dependent flow field after a fixed, finite particle advection time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large FTLE values identify regions where the stretching induced by mesoscale and submesoscale activity is strong and are typically organized in convoluted lines encircling submesoscale filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A ridge (line of local maxima) in the FTLE field can be used to predict passive tracer fronts induced by horizontal advection and stirring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those lines have been shown to contribute to the structuring of marine ecosystems (36, 37, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we compute FTLE on a regular grid with 0.0125° horizontal resolution (1 km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final separation is computed as the maximum separation after a particle advection time of 10 d, which is the typical mesoscale eddy-turnover time in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fisheries effort was determined using data from the NOAA Fisheries Onboard Observer Program for the drift gillnet fishery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fisheries observers recorded the location and time of haul-out of 7,996 gillnet sets deployed over a total of 1,357 fishing trips during the drift gillnet operating seasons (MayJanuary) of 19902010 and coincident catch and nontarget catch data for each set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observer coverage rates over this period are estimated at 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fishing trips started from 28 ports along the US West Coast, with the majority of vessels docking in Southern California (San Diego: 51%, Morro Bay: 12%, Los Angeles: 8%; see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We explored the distribution of fisheries effort in relation to LCS by comparing the locations of gillnet sets with unfished locations sampled using random walkers parameterized to vessel movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the strength of the LCS field in the proximity (median over a 3- × 3-pixel radius; grid resolution 0.0125°) of each set location (presence) with that surrounding a location that was available to, but not actively targeted by, that fishing vessel on the same day (absence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These absence locations were generated using a randomization procedure based on random walkers parameterized using the distributions of departure angles, distances from port to the first set, turning angles, and distances between successive sets from all vessels that used that matching port.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated five sets of simulated absences and iteratively resampled from this full presenceabsence dataset to fit a binomial generalized linear model with a presenceabsence response 1,000 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All analyses were conducted using R v.3.3.1 (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We interrogated fisheries observer data to generate one master target catch dataset containing the locations, dates, and times of gillnet sets with and without swordfish catch and total catch for each successful set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the influence of attracting LCS on target catch, measured as (i) presenceabsence of swordfish per set and (ii) the total number of swordfish caught per set, we calculated the median FTLEb over a 3- × 3-pixel window centered on each set location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the cumulative sum over each fishing trip to generate a single per-trip FTLEb metric, avoiding pseudoreplication at the trip level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to model the influence of LCS on (i) the probability of the presence of swordfish and (ii) cumulative total catch, as separate responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a binomial error family and logistic link function for presenceabsence responses, and a negative binomial error family with a logarithmic link function for count responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For count models, we used inbuilt theta estimation (mgcv package for R), checked models for overdispersion, and retained only models where the overdispersion metric was less_than1.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models were selected on the basis of parameter significance, percentage deviance explained, adjusted-R2, and comparison of Aikaikes Information Criterion score against a null model of intercept-only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model assumptions pertaining to GAMs, including normality and homogeneity of variance, were explicitly considered in model construction and checked using plots of residuals against fitted values and predictors where appropriate (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same protocol was applied to secondary targets of the fishery, including opah, bluefin tuna, thresher sharks, and shortfin mako sharks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We modeled the correlation between total bycatch over each fishing trip and the sum of the strength of the attracting LCS field associated with each gillnet set in the same trip, using the same modeling protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We matched location and date information with the concomitant protected species catch dataset to obtain metrics of the incidence (0/1) and total catch of each nontarget species per gillnet set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bycatch events were less frequent, and involved lower numbers, than catch rates of target species, and so we summarized the data in taxon-specific groupings for modeling (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some species, such as blue shark Prionace glauca (caught in 54% of all sets, with a total catch of 21,146 in 21 y), sample sizes were sufficient to model a species-specific response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rare nature of bycatch events involving protected marine vertebrates resulted in low taxon-specific sample sizes, so we combined all protected cetaceans, sea turtles, and pinnipeds into a single group for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
