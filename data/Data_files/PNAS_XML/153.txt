Sex-specific silencing of X-linked genes by Xist RNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In mammals, the inequality posed by the difference in the number of X chromosomes between XX females and XY males is remedied by silencing genes along one of the two X chromosomes in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process, termed X-chromosome inactivation, is believed to be triggered by X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we find that Xist RNA can silence X-linked genes efficiently in females but not in males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Xist RNA is insufficient to inactivate the X chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results further suggest that both Xist induction and X-linked gene silencing are orchestrated by the handful of genes that do not undergo X inactivation in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased dosage of one or more such factors in females vs. males may explain why females undergo X inactivation and males do not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
X-inactive specific transcript (Xist) long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) is thought to catalyze silencing of X-linked genes in cis during X-chromosome inactivation, which equalizes X-linked gene dosage between male and female mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the impact of Xist RNA on X-linked gene silencing, we ectopically induced endogenous Xist by ablating the antisense repressor Tsix in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that ectopic Xist RNA induction and subsequent X-linked gene silencing is sex specific in embryos and in differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A higher frequency of XTsixY male cells displayed ectopic Xist RNA coating compared with XTsixX female cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase reflected the inability of XTsixY cells to efficiently silence X-linked genes compared with XTsixX cells, despite equivalent Xist RNA induction and coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of genes on both Xs resulted in significantly reduced proliferation and increased cell death in XTsixX female cells relative to XTsixY male cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whereas Xist RNA can inactivate the X chromosome in females it may not do so in males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further found comparable silencing in differentiating XTsixY and 39,XTsix (XTsixO) ESCs, excluding the Y chromosome and instead implicating the X-chromosome dose as the source of the sex-specific differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because XTsixX female embryonic epiblast cells and EpiSCs harbor an inactivated X chromosome prior to ectopic inactivation of the active XTsix X chromosome, we propose that the increased expression of one or more X-inactivation escapees activates Xist and, separately, helps trigger X-linked gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To ectopically induce Xist, we differentiated multiple control wild-type (WT) XY and XX and mutant XTsixY and XTsixX ESC lines (see SI Appendix, Fig S1 for map of the Tsix mutant allele) (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed ectopic Xist RNA coating every 2 d over a period of 10 d by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT male XY ESC lines did not display Xist RNA-coated nuclei during differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mutant male XTsixY lines exhibited three classes of nuclei: some had strong Xist RNA coating, resembling Xist RNA coating in female cells, some had weak Xist RNA coating, and some lacked Xist RNA coating altogether.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong Xist RNA-decorated XTsixY nuclei reached a maximum of between 40% and 58% of all nuclei at day 6 (d6) of differentiation, before decreasing to 30% at d10 (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weak Xist RNA-coated XTsixY nuclei peaked at 1822% at d4 and decreased to 8% at d10 of differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Undifferentiated female WT XX and mutant XTsixX ESCs harbor two active X chromosomes, which are randomly inactivated upon differentiation (6, 30, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the 10-d course of differentiation, XX cells either lacked Xist RNA coating, signifying that X inactivation had not yet initiated, or had one Xist RNA coat, characteristic of the inactive X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe WT XX nuclei with two Xist RNA coats throughout the time course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, differentiating mutant XTsixX ESCs displayed two strong Xist-coated Xs in a significant percentage of XTsixX nuclei, peaking at between 14% and 19% at d6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small percentage of differentiating XTsixX nuclei exhibited one strong and one weak Xist RNA-coated X chromosome, with a maximum of 4%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By d10, double Xist RNA-coated XTsixX nuclei had rapidly declined and disappeared altogether (Fig 1B), in marked contrast to the male XTsixY ESCs, which showed persistence of ectopic Xist RNA-coated nuclei (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously showed that the second Xist-decorated X chromosome in differentiating XTsixX ESCs is the XTsix mutant X chromosome (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xist is therefore ectopically induced from the XTsix in females, as it is in males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with XTsixY ESCs, however, differentiating XTsixX ESCs appeared to harbor fewer ectopic Xist RNA-decorated nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sex-Specific_X-Linked_Gene_Silencing_upon_Ectopic_Xist_RNA_Coating_in_ESCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We surmised that the difference in the frequency and the kinetics of ectopic Xist RNA-coated nuclei between male XTsixY and female XTsixX ESC lines may reflect variable silencing of X-linked genes between the sexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional nullizygosity of X-linked genes is expected to be deleterious, leading to selection against these cells (30, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the higher steady-state percentage of XTsixY nuclei with Xist RNA coating may reflect inefficient silencing of X-linked genes upon ectopic Xist RNA coating in mutant males compared with females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the efficiency of X-linked gene silencing in XTsixY and XTsixX cells, we profiled the expression of Xist RNA together with a panel of genes distributed across the X chromosome in differentiating WT and mutant ESCs by RNA FISH (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA FISH permits detection of nascent transcripts in single cells and is refractory to potentially confounding variables of RNA perdurance and expression heterogeneity in and between cells to which techniques such as RT-PCR or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) are subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assayed nine genes that are subject to X inactivation, Lamp2, Mecp2, G6pdx, Chic1, Rnf12, Atrx, Pgk1, Gla, and Pdha1 (16, 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In differentiating WT male XY ESCs, all of the genes were expressed in most of the nuclei (6194%) (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In differentiating WT female XX ESCs, the nine genes were similarly monoallelically expressed (6292%) (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining cells failed to display expression from the single allele in males or both alleles in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, we additionally assayed a gene that escapes X inactivation, Smcx, which is expected to be expressed from both the active and the inactive X in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In XY cells, Smcx was expressed from the single X chromosome in 90% of cells; in XX females, Smcx was biallelically expressed in 60% of the cells (SI Appendix, Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In differentiating XTsixY male ESCs, we noticed that all genes were expressed in a significant percentage of nuclei despite strong Xist RNA coating (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In nuclei with weak Xist RNA coating, all of the genes were expressed more often from the XTsix compared with nuclei with strong Xist RNA coating (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2B and S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in differentiating XTsixX female ESCs with two strong Xist RNA coats, all X-linked genes were silenced on both Xs in significantly more nuclei than in strong Xist RNA-decorated XTsixY male nuclei (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2B, S3A, and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In XTsixX female nuclei with one strong and one weak Xist RNA coat, all X-linked genes were coincidently expressed with Xist RNA in a greater percentage than in XTsixX nuclei with two strong Xist RNA coats (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2B and S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, X-linked genes were silenced more often in female XTsixX nuclei with one strong and one weak Xist RNA coat than in male XTsixY nuclei with a weak Xist RNA coat (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2B and S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, compared with XTsixY male cells, differentiating XTsixX female ESCs silenced all nine genes in significantly more nuclei upon ectopic Xist RNA coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weaker silencing in XTsixY males compared with XTsixX females may underlie the increased prevalence of Xist RNA-decorated male cells relative to double Xist RNA-coated female cells later in differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon ectopic Xist RNA coating, stringent silencing of genes on the second X chromosome potently selects against XTsixX cells (see below and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30); by contrast, weaker silencing of X-linked genes in XTsixY cells may permit Xist RNA-coated cells to persist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Xist RNA is thought to potentiate silencing by directly or indirectly recruiting proteins such as the Polycomb group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, as an added indicator of the potency of Xist RNA coating, we tested enrichment of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3-K27me3) on both the strong and weak Xist RNA-coated X chromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H3-K27me3 is catalyzed by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and is associated with silenced gene expression (36), including on the inactive X chromosome (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas strong Xist RNA coats displayed robust coincident H3-K27me3 enrichment in both sexes (90% of cells), a significant percentage of weak Xist RNA coats also showed overlapping H3-K27me3 enrichment (75% of cells), albeit with correspondingly weaker signals in both sexes (SI Appendix, Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced frequency of H3-K27me3 enrichment on the weak Xist RNA-coated Xs correlates with the weaker silencing of genes on that X chromosome in both sexes (SI Appendix, Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, the reduced levels of X-linked gene silencing in XTsixY cells is not due to lower frequencies of H3-K27me3 enrichment on the Xist RNA-decorated Xs in comparison with XTsixX cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Y_Chromosome_Does_Not_Protect_Against_X-Linked_Gene_Silencing_in_XTsixY_ESCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explain the differential X-linked gene silencing in XTsixY vs. XTsixX cells, we investigated whether the presence of the Y chromosome protected X-linked genes from being silenced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have demonstrated that Xist RNA coating can occur in male ESCs with supernumerary X chromosomes (33), but, to our knowledge, whether silencing of individual genes can occur to the same extent in male cells as in corresponding cells without a Y chromosome is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore subcloned two 39,XTsix (XTsixO) ESC lines from XTsixX ESCs (ESC line 2 in Fig 1B) that have lost the WT X chromosome and assessed Xist RNA coating and expression of the 10 X-linked genes by RNA FISH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During differentiation, the frequency of strong and weak Xist RNA-coated nuclei in both of the XTsixO ESC lines mimicked XTsixY ESCs and not XTsixX ESCs, including the parental XTsixX ESC line 2 (SI Appendix, Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in both strong and weak Xist RNA-coated XTsixO nuclei, the expression pattern of all 10 genes matched that of the XTsixY cells instead of the parental XTsixX cells (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2B, S3D, and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the absence of the Y chromosome does not explain the greater frequency of X-linked gene silencing in XTsixX compared with XTsixY cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differential silencing between the sexes must therefore be dependent on the X-chromosomal content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sex-Specific_Difference_in_Ectopic_Xist_RNA_Coat_Frequencies_in_EpiSCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Female ESCs have two active X chromosomes; thus, the higher X-chromosomal dose necessary for efficient X-linked gene silencing could require both Xs to be transcriptionally active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, higher X-chromosome dosage may have an effect even if one of the two Xs was inactivated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish among these two distinct possibilities, we took advantage of Tsix-mutant EpiSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like ESCs, EpiSCs are pluripotent cells of the epiblast lineage (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as opposed to ESCs, undifferentiated female EpiSCs, XX as well as XTsixX, harbor a stochastically inactivated X chromosome (30, 41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first profiled Xist RNA coating in WT and mutant EpiSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male WT XY as well as mutant XTsixY EpiSCs did not display Xist RNA coating in the undifferentiated state (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT XY male cells remained devoid of Xist RNA coating throughout differentiation; differentiating mutant XTsixY male cells, however, exhibited a significant percentage with Xist RNA coats (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Undifferentiated XX and XTsixX female EpiSCs were also indistinguishable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both genotypes displayed a single Xist RNA-coated X chromosome (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S4B) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon differentiation, however, a proportion of XTsixX female EpiSCs ectopically induced Xist and coated the second X chromosome (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S4B); XX female EpiSCs continued to exhibit only one Xist RNA coat during the course of differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xist decoration of the second X chromosome in XTsixX female cells is due to ectopic Xist induction from the XTsix, as in XTsixY male cells (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Like ESCs, the mutant EpiSCs displayed a sex-specific pattern of Xist RNA coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In differentiating XTsixY male EpiSCs, the percentage of strong Xist RNA-coated nuclei steadily increased up to d20 of differentiation, ranging between 42% and 59% of nuclei, then decreased to between 22% and 26% at d30 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weak Xist RNA-coated XTsixY male nuclei peaked between 22% and 28%, at d10, and decreased to 811% at d30 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the percentage of XTsixX female nuclei with strong ectopic Xist RNA coating, resulting in two robust Xist RNA-decorated domains, reached a maximum of 24% at d10 and then quickly disappeared by d20 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XTsixX nuclei with one strong and one weak Xist RNA coats peaked at 4% at d5d10 and were gone by d20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The variability in ectopic Xist induction between the female EpiSC lines roughly correlates with the number of cells that are eligible to ectopically induce Xist in a given line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to random X inactivation, XTsixX EpiSCs can inactivate either the mutant XTsix or the WT X (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greater the percentage of cells in a female EpiSC line in which the XTsix is the active X, the higher the percentage of cells that can ectopically express Xist (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in XTsixX EpiSC line 2 the XTsix is the inactive X in all cells; this cell line, therefore, entirely lacks cells that can ectopically induce Xist, in agreement with the absolute absence of nuclei with two Xist RNA coats in this cell line during differentiation (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, XTsixX EpiSC line 14 harbors many cells that have chosen the XTsix as the active X chromosome (75%), resulting in a relatively high percentage of cells that ectopically induce Xist during differentiation (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, even in this cell line substantially fewer nuclei displayed ectopic Xist RNA coating (24%) compared with the XTsixY EpiSC line with the lowest frequency of ectopic Xist RNA-coated nuclei (cell line 4; 41%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference once again suggested diminished silencing of X-linked genes in mutant males compared with females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sex-Specific_X-Linked_Gene_Silencing_upon_Ectopic_Xist_RNA_Coating_in_EpiSCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We therefore assayed expression of the 10 X-linked genes over the course of EpiSC differentiation by RNA FISH (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly to ESCs, significantly more differentiating mutant XTsixX female compared with mutant XTsixY male EpiSCs exhibited silencing of the 9 genes subject to X inactivation upon ectopic Xist RNA coating (P less_than 106; Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S5 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also simultaneously probed pairs of X-linked genes to determine if in the same nucleus the expression of the two genes would concord, or, as implied by the data in SI Appendix, Fig S5, differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested four different pairs, with 1 gene of each pair exhibiting a greater frequency of silencing than the other when tested individually in XTsixY cells (Pgk1/Atrx; Rnf12/Lamp2; Gla/Mecp2; G6pdx/Chic1) (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When tested together, the genes in each pair recapitulated the pattern of silencing when assayed individually in both XTsixY and XTsixX cells (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One gene was silenced more frequently compared with the other, especially in XTsixY cells; thus, the two genes behaved independently in the same nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, 7 of 8 genes were silenced in significantly more XTsixX compared with XTsixY nuclei (P less_than 0.03; Pgk1, P less_than 0.12) (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ectopic Xist RNA coating is sufficient to silence X-linked genes in XTsixY cells; but, it does not do so as uniformly or as robustly as in XTsixX cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also measured the ability of ectopic Xist RNA coating to recruit the Polycomb PRC2 complex and enrich H3-K27me3 on the X chromosome in differentiating EpiSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in ESCs, both strong and weak Xist coats displayed accumulation of H3-K27me3 in a significant percentage of XTsixY and XTsixX nuclei in both sexes (90%, strong Xist-coated nuclei; 75%, weak Xist-coated nuclei) (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concurrent detection of H3-K27me3, Xist, and X-linked genes directly showed that despite the robust enrichment of H3-K27me3 on the ectopically Xist-coated XTsix, X-linked genes were nevertheless expressed in a significant percentage of differentiating male XTsixY EpiSCs (P less_than 0.001; SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, consistent with the relatively stringent silencing upon ectopic Xist RNA coating in differentiating XTsixX compared with XTsixY cells, mutant female cells displayed a significant reduction in both cell proliferation and viability compared with mutant male cells during differentiation (P less_than 104) (SI Appendix, Fig S9; see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced proliferation and increased cell death, therefore, potently select against female mutants that have ectopically activated Xist from and silenced genes on the second, i.e., XTsix, X chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, the sex-specific pattern of ectopic Xist induction and X-linked gene silencing occurs in differentiating EpiSCs, as it does in ESCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, robust silencing of X-linked genes does not require two transcriptionally active Xs and can occur even when one of the two Xs in females is inactivated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Equivalent_Levels_of_Ectopic_Xist_Expression_in_Individual_XTsixY_vs_XTsixX_EpiSCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In principle, the sex-specific X-linked gene silencing may be due to lower levels of ectopic Xist RNA expression in XTsixY compared with XTsixX cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore sought to quantify Xist expression in male and female mutant EpiSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took advantage of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that distinguishes Xist transcripts originating from the XTsix vs. the WT X chromosome via pyrosequencing of cDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the XTsix is derived from a M. musculus strain, the WT X is derived from the divergent M. molossinus JF1 strain (XJF1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first measured Xist expression in XTsixY males relative to a reference F1 hybrid female EpiSC line, XTsixXJF1 line 15, in which Xist is predominantly expressed from the XJF1 (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the variability in Xist induction between cells, we profiled Xist expression in individual cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the XTsixXJF1 EpiSC line 15, Xist was almost exclusively expressed from the WT XJF1 allele (90% of total Xist expression) in all cells examined (SI Appendix, Fig S10A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in single WT F1 hybrid XJF1XLab EpiSCs, in which the XLab is M. musculus derived, Xist was nearly mutually exclusively expressed from either the XJF1 or the XLab (SI Appendix, Fig S10B), consistent with stochastic inactivation of either X chromosome in individual cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify Xist expression in XTsixY male EpiSCs, we combined single XTsixY cells (line 3 in Fig 3A) with single XTsixXJF1 line 15 female EpiSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the lack of Xist RNA coating in undifferentiated XTsixY EpiSCs by RNA FISH (Fig 3A), when single undifferentiated XTsixY EpiSCs were combined with single undifferentiated XTsixXJF1 line 15 EpiSCs, Xist expression from the XTsix did not increase compared with undifferentiated XTsixXJF1 line 15 EpiSCs alone (SI Appendix, Fig S10C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon differentiation, based on the RNA FISH data we expected to observe three classes of XTsixY cells by RT-PCR (SI Appendix, Fig S10D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first, the cells would be devoid of Xist induction or induced Xist minimally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second, Xist would be moderately expressed, thus corresponding to the weak Xist RNA-coated cells by RNA FISH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the third, Xist would be strongly induced, representing robust Xist RNA-decorated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When single d10 differentiated XTsixY EpiSCs were combined with single undifferentiated line 15 female EpiSCs, Xist expression from the XTsix increased in a substantial percentage of the samples (SI Appendix, Fig S10E), in agreement with Xist induction in some but not all XTsixY cells by RNA FISH (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the three categories, class I cells, which did not induce Xist or induced Xist minimally (10% of total Xist expression from the XTsix), accounted for 31% of all cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Class II cells, which induced Xist moderately (3039% of total Xist expression from the XTsix), represented 28% of the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose 40% as the threshold of expression from the XTsix between class II and class III (robust Xist induction from the XTsix) because in individual differentiating XTsixX female cells, robust ectopic Xist induction from the XTsix X chromosome yields values of 40% (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong Xist-expressing class III cells (4068% of total Xist expression from the XTsix) were 41% of the total cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In class III XTsixY cells, the average Xist expression from the XTsix was 57% of total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This level of Xist induction in XTsixY male cells matched Xist expression from the XTsix in females, measured by combining single cells from female EpiSC lines that express Xist almost exclusively from either the XTsix (XTsixXJF1 EpiSC line 2) or the XJF1 (XTsixXJF1 EpiSC line 15) (30), with an average of 58% of total Xist expression from the XTsix (SI Appendix, Fig S10F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher Xist expression from the XTsix relative to XJF1 reflects strain-specific differences in Xist levels due to polymorphisms in the X-controlling element (Xce) (4345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gauge ectopic Xist induction later in differentiation, we also similarly profiled d20 differentiated XTsixY EpiSCs, when the percentage of Xist-coated cells is at its highest (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By d20, class I accounted for 19% of all cells, class II 12%, and class III 69% (SI Appendix, Fig S10G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with robust Xist-expressing class III cells at d10, on average the d20 class III cells expressed Xist from the XTsix at nearly the levels found in females in SI Appendix, Fig S10F (59% vs. 58%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, at both d10 and d20, a greater percentage of XTsixY cells strongly induced Xist (class III) relative to those with robust Xist RNA coats (41% vs. 25% at d10; 69% vs. 52% at d20) (SI Appendix, Fig S10 EG and Fig 3A), suggesting that not all strong Xist expressers display robust Xist RNA coats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of class II cells with moderate Xist induction more closely approximated the percentage of nuclei displaying weak Xist RNA coats at d10 and at d20 (28% vs. 23% at d10; 19% vs. 12% at d20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify ectopic Xist expression in mutant females, we used an F1 hybrid XTsixXJF1 female EpiSC line that exhibits ectopic Xist RNA coating of the XTsix in a significant percentage of cells at d10 of differentiation (22%; XTsixX EpiSC line 14 in Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Undifferentiated line 14 XTsixXJF1 EpiSCs displayed a slightly biased pattern of X inactivation; two-thirds of the individual undifferentiated cells surveyed displayed Xist induction from the XJF1 X chromosome and one-third from the XTsix X chromosome (SI Appendix, Fig S10H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distribution was expected to change during differentiation based on the RNA FISH data (Fig 3B; see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30), with the cells once again expected to be stratified into three classes (SI Appendix, Fig S10I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Class I would express Xist exclusively or almost exclusively from the XJF1 and lack much ectopic Xist induction from the XTsix due to the lack of differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Class II would correspond to cells that originally inactivated the WT XJF1 and robustly ectopically induced Xist from the XTsix during differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Class III represents cells that initially inactivated the XTsix and therefore are not eligible to ectopically induce Xist from the second X (i.e., the WT XJF1); these cells would therefore only express Xist from the XTsix throughout differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At d10 of differentiation, class I (10% of total Xist expression from the XTsix) accounted for 18% of the cells; class II (4866% of total Xist expression from the XTsix) represented 23% of all cells; and class III (90% of total Xist expression from the XTsix), 59% of the cells (SI Appendix, Fig S10J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Class II female cells, therefore, are most informative with respect to ectopic Xist induction, because only this group of cells expresses both Xist alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, ectopic Xist expression in XTsixXJF1 females is almost always robust, consistent with RNA FISH detecting very few mutant female nuclei with weak ectopic Xist coats (less_than4%) during EpiSC differentiation (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average expression of the two Xist alleles in individual class II cells was 57% from the XTsix and 43% from the XJF1 X chromosome (SI Appendix, Fig S10J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distribution matched allelic Xist expression in single-cell mixtures of female EpiSCs that display preferential inactivation of either the XTsix or the XJF1 (58% from the XTsix; 42% from the XJF1) (SI Appendix, Fig S10F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, class II percentage (23%) agrees well with the percentage of cells displaying two Xist RNA coats in this EpiSC line at d10 of differentiation by RNA FISH (22%) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in both XTsixY and XTsixX EpiSCs, the XTsix is able to ectopically induce Xist at levels matching Xist normally expressed from the WT inactive X in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By d20 of differentiation, XTsixXJF1 cells only exhibited Xist RNA originating from the XTsix (SI Appendix, Fig S10K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uniform expression of Xist from the XTsix is consistent with selection against cells that had originally inactivated the XJF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During differentiation, all of these cells ectopically induced Xist robustly from the previously active XTsix and became deficient in X-linked gene expression (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3B and 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S5), leading to reduced proliferation and induced cell death (SI Appendix, Fig S9) (see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, a significant fraction of male XTsixY d20 differentiated cells either failed to induce Xist (19%) or induced Xist only moderately (12%) (SI Appendix, Fig S10G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And, at d10, when some differentiating female XTsixXJF1 cells had not yet ectopically induced Xist, a greater percentage of XTsixY compared with XTsixX cells either lacked ectopic Xist induction (31% vs. 18%) or induced Xist moderately (28% vs. 0%) (SI Appendix, Fig S10 E and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Equivalent_Ectopic_Xist_RNA_Coating_in_XTsixY_vs_XTsixX_EpiSCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although Xist RNA can be equivalently robustly expressed between the sexes, reduced Xist RNA coating could explain the diminished frequency of X-linked gene silencing in differentiated XTsixY compared with XTsixX cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore quantified the volume as well as the intensity of the Xist RNA coats in XTsixY, XTsixX, and XX EpiSCs, using an automated voxel-based analysis (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused these measurements on nuclei with strong Xist RNA coats quantified in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither the volume nor the intensity of the Xist RNA coats was significantly different between male and female mutants (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, neither measurement correlated with silencing of the five X-linked genes tested (Lamp2, Mecp2, Atrx, Gla, and Pdha1) (SI Appendix, Fig S11); cells that expressed the X-linked genes did not have smaller or less intense coats compared with cells in which the genes were silenced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data demonstrate that, in EpiSC nuclei with robust ectopic Xist RNA coating, the strength of the Xist RNA coats in differentiating XTsixY is equivalent to that of XTsixX EpiSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in X-linked gene silencing between the sexes, therefore, is not due to weaker Xist RNA coating in XTsixY compared with XTsixX cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We next interrogated Tsix-mutant embryonic epiblasts to test whether the sex-specific pattern of Xist induction and X-linked silencing observed in differentiating ESCs and EpiSCs is also observed in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first assayed the percentage of ectopic Xist RNA-coated epiblast cells from embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5), E6.5, E7.5, E8.5, and E9.5 XTsixY male and XTsixX female embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In XTsixY male embryos, a significant percentage of epiblast nuclei of E5.5 embryos, a stage shortly after random X-inactivation initiates (30, 46), exhibited ectopic Xist RNA coating (39%), which decreased at E6.5 (30%) and continued declining thereafter but were still found at E9.5 (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In XTsixX embryos, ectopic Xist RNA-coated epiblast nuclei with two Xist RNA coats were almost exclusively observed at E5.5 (22%), with very few at E6.5 (3%), and none at the later stages (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, XTsixY and XTsixX embryos also display the sex-specific pattern of ectopic Xist induction observed in ESCs and EpiSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the kinetics of ectopic Xist induction in embryos compared with ESCs and EpiSCs reflects the relatively rapid rate of differentiation of embryonic epiblasts (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next probed pairs of X-linked genes to test whether they were concordantly or discordantly silenced in individual embryonic nuclei upon ectopic Xist RNA coating in Tsix-mutant E5.5 and E6.5 epiblast cells of both sexes, as in the EpiSCs (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-linked genes were variably silenced within and between the sexes, with a greater average frequency of silencing in XTsixX females compared with XTsixY males (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For three pairs of genes exhibiting differential levels of silencing (Atrx/Pgk1; Lamp2/Rnf12; Mecp2/Gla), one gene of each pair was silenced significantly less often than the other gene in the pair in XTsixY nuclei (P less_than 0.05), as compared to the XTsixX nuclei (SI Appendix, Fig S12), consistent with the EpiSC results (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth gene pair, G6pdx/Chic1, was rarely discordantly silenced in either sex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At E5.5, for six of the eight genes tested significantly fewer XTsixY male nuclei displayed silencing of the X-linked genes compared with XTsixX female nuclei upon ectopic Xist coating (P less_than 0.01); only silencing of Pgk1 and Rnf12 did not differ significantly between the sexes (P  0.05) (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, at E6.5, upon ectopic Xist RNA coating all X-linked genes except Pgk1 and Rnf12 were silenced in significantly fewer XTsixY compared with XTsixX nuclei (P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Xist RNA is believed to be both necessary and sufficient to initiate X inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test Xist function, in this study we analyzed differentiating ESCs, EpiSCs, and embryonic epiblast cells harboring a mutation in the Xist antisense repressor Tsix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The XTsix X chromosome offered a sensitized background in which to assess the impact of Xist RNA on X-linked gene silencing, because Xist is ectopically induced from the active XTsix in the epiblast lineage of both males and females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a higher frequency of XTsixY and XTsixO cells displayed ectopic Xist RNA coating compared with XTsixX cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase reflected the inability of XTsixY and XTsixO cells to efficiently silence X-linked genes upon ectopic Xist induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of genes on both Xs due to ectopic Xist induction from the XTsix resulted in significantly reduced proliferation and increased cell death in XTsixX female cells relative to XTsixY male cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapid loss of this population of XTsixX female cells leaves behind only cells or descendants of cells that had originally inactivated the XTsix and which could not induce Xist from the second, i.e., WT, X chromosome during differentiation (see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, despite a lower steady-state frequency of ectopic Xist RNA coating, all XTsixX female mutant cells in which the XTsix was the active X ultimately ectopically induce Xist from the XTsix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, a significant percentage of differentiating XTsixY male mutant epiblast cells do not induce Xist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, XTsixY mutants not only display lower frequencies of X-linked gene silencing upon ectopic Xist induction, but also exhibit a reduced number of cells with ectopic Xist induction compared with XTsixX female cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The X-chromosome:autosome ratio determines whether X inactivation occurs and how many X chromosomes undergo inactivation, ensuring that only one X remains active per diploid genome (4751).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Tsix mutants, the differences in Xist induction and X-linked gene silencing must be genetically attributed to the sex chromosomes, as both XTsixX and XTsixY cells have identical complements of autosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because differentiating XTsixO ESCs behave similarly to XTsixY ESCs, we exclude the Y chromosome as the source of the sex-specific differences by, for example, Y-linked genes functioning to prevent X-linked gene silencing in males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the data implicate the presence of the second X chromosomei.e., the WT Xas the cause of the increased frequencies of ectopic Xist induction and X-linked gene silencing in females compared with males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to truncating Tsix transcription, the Tsix mutation deletes the critical DXPas34 repeat sequence close to the XistTsix topological associated domain (TAD) boundary (30, 31, 5256).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the broadly coordinated regulation of genes within each of the two adjacent TADs, a 58-kb deletion encompassing the TAD boundary changes the transcription of multiple genes within the X-inactivation center (Xic) (33, 57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tsix mutation may result in a similar long-range dysregulation of X-linked genes in cis by perturbing the XistTsix TAD boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the requirement for the second X chromosome implies that the observed sex-specific differences are a trans-effect, rather than due to a cis-limited sex-specific transcriptional defect on the XTsix imparted by the Tsix mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another potential explanation for the sex-specific effects is differential epigenetic marking of the XTsix in the two sexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In females, the second X chromosome may alter the XTsix chromatin in a manner that later facilitates ectopic Xist induction from and X-linked gene silencing on the XTsix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation that XTsixO ESCs, which were derived from XTsixX female ESCs and thus previously harbored two Xs, ectopically induce Xist and undergo X-linked gene silencing at frequencies similar to XTsixY male ESCs suggests that the presence of two active X chromosomes does not mark the XTsix differently in females compared with males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further arguing against such epigenetic differences is the propensity of XTsixX ESCs to undergo random X inactivation, a pattern similar to that of WT XX cells (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the XTsix was especially prone to inducing Xist and undergoing inactivation in females, the expectation is that it would preferentially be chosen for inactivation in XTsixX heterozygotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Developmental differences between male and female embryos may also explain the sex-specific differences in Xist induction and X-linked gene silencing in the Tsix mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XY male embryos develop slightly faster compared with their XX siblings, owing both to the absence of the Y chromosome and the presence of the second X chromosome (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, previous observations have suggested that Xist RNA is competent to silence X-linked genes in a defined developmental window (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If cells in male embryos exceed this developmental window due to their faster development, then they may become refractory to X inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several observations, however, argue against the faster development of male embryos underlying the lower frequencies of X-linked gene silencing in XTsixY compared with XTsixX embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, any difference in the rate of development of embryonic epiblasts between the sexes at E5.25 is not expected to be as large as the difference between E5.25 and E6.5 epiblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E6.5 epiblasts harbor more than five times the number of cells as in E5.25 epiblasts (60, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon ectopic Xist RNA coating, epiblasts in E6.5 XTsixX females silenced each of the eight genes surveyed significantly more frequently than did E5.25 XTsixY males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, female embryos older by 1 d are nevertheless more competent to silence X-linked genes than their younger male counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cultured XTsixY and XTsixX ESCs and EpiSCs recapitulate the sex-specific patterns observed in embryos, also arguing against developmental timing differences as the underlying cause of the sex-specific differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any developmental timing differences would be normalized by capturing cells of both sexes at equivalent stages of differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ectopic Xist induction and X-linked gene silencing occur at the same stage of ESC differentiation in both sexes (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xist is ectopically induced just after the ESCs differentiate beyond the epiblast-like cell (EpiLC) stage in both sexes (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EpiLCs molecularly and morphologically mimic EpiSCs (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, Xist and X-linked gene silencing are ectopically induced only when XTsixY male and XTsixX female EpiSCs differentiate (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, XTsixY and XTsixX embryonic epiblasts, ESCs, and EpiSCs all display ectopic Xist induction and X-linked gene silencing as a function of differentiation, rather than developmental timing (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The X-chromosome dosage effect in the Tsix mutants may be intimately linked to the mechanism that senses, or counts, the cellular X-chromosomal complement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The counting mechanism ensures that only if the X-chromosomal ploidy is sufficiently high does an X become targeted for inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One prominent X-counting model invokes physical pairing of the two X chromosomes in females (62), via sequences within the Xic, including the Tsix locus, at the onset of X inactivation (6365).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of this coupling, Xist is believed to be selectively upregulated from one of the two Xs (6365), presumably through a transvection-like mechanism (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, deletions of all Xic elements thought to take part in X homolog pairing nevertheless result in Xist induction and inactivation of one of the two Xs in female cells (30, 33, 6668).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another mode of X-chromosomal dose sensing is the higher expression in XX cells of specific X-linked genes that lie within the Xic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Xic-encoded Ftx and Jpx/Enox lncRNAs, both of which are expressed from the active and the inactive X chromosomes, are believed to facilitate X inactivation by activating Xist (19, 69, 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the Rnf12 protein-coding gene, also encoded within the Xic but subject to X inactivation, is also posited to induce Xist through its higher expression in females before inactivation (67, 71, 72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a deletion of the Xic segment encompassing all three of these factors does not prevent Xist induction or gene silencing, since the mutant X chromosome is able to undergo Xist RNA coating and inactivation in differentiating ESCs (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These observations open the possibility of an alternate X-linked dosage-sensing mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most X-linked genes in females with an inactive X chromosome are expressed at levels equal to that in males (7375).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of X-linked genes, however, escape X inactivation in female cells and are capable of being expressed from both X chromosomes despite inactivation of one of the two Xs (76, 77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to expression from both alleles, these X-inactivation escapees are expressed at higher levels in females compared with males (78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore suggest that the relatively higher expression of one or more X-inactivation escapees in females ectopically activates Xist expression as well as induces X-linked gene silencing in XTsixX cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower dosage of such factors in males may explain the reduced frequency of Xist induction and X-linked gene silencing in XTsixY cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, female XTsixO cells lack a second X chromosome, and, like males, would have a lower dosage of X-inactivation escapees compared with XTsixX females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dose-dependent effect of the X-inactivation escapees implies that they function as diffusible/trans-acting factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The escapees in XTsixX mutants are also expected to escape X inactivation in WT XX cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Tsix mutants, we propose that Xist is induced in both males and females by the escapees due to the lower threshold conferred by Tsix absence (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT cells, the same dose of the escapees activates Xist only in females and not in males due to an intact Tsix locus (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we postulate that one or more X-inactivation escapees normally induces Xist from the future inactive X in WT XX females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Once Xist is induced, the same, or a different, escape gene product may silence X-chromosomal genes cooperatively with Xist, either by interacting with Xist RNA or through a parallel pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports of proteins bound to Xist found two X-encoded proteins, NONO and RBM3, as direct Xist RNA partners (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither gene, however, escapes random X inactivation (77, 78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical escapee proteins may therefore only indirectly or transiently interact with Xist, or may indirectly induce Xist and X-linked gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the catalog of Xist-binding proteins may be incomplete (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the dose-dependent function of the escapee(s) in triggering X inactivation, ESCs with supernumerary X chromosomes display faster kinetics of Xist induction and X inactivation, commensurate with the number of extra X chromosomes (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By inducing Xist and X-linked gene silencing in a dose-dependent manner, the escapee(s) thus also serve as X-chromosomal counting factor(s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The increased dose of one or more X-chromosomal genes is believed to underlie DNA methylation differences between male and female ESCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bulk DNA in XX ESCs is hypomethylated relative to XY ESCs (79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same X-linked factor(s) may contribute to sex-specific differences in Xist induction and X-linked gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, XX female somatic cells with an inactive X chromosome do not display reduced DNA methylation levels compared with XY male cells (79), suggesting that the effect is not modulated by X-inactivation escapees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, early X-inactivated cells such as female EpiSCs may be hypomethylated compared with male EpiSCs, potentially implicating the same X-inactivation escapee(s) in regulating both DNA hypomethylation and X inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Xic is an obvious X-chromosomal segment where the candidate escapee genes may reside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Classical mouse and human studies of X-chromosome truncations, translocations, and deletions, pinpointed the Xic as necessary for initiating random X inactivation (19, 32, 8083).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expectedly, the Xist locus maps to the Xic (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Xic, however, may not be sufficient to recapitulate the various steps underlying random X inactivation, including the sensing of the X-chromosomal dose, as suggested by the inability of large single-copy YAC Xic transgenes to induce Xist (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report delineating X-inactivation escapees in ESCs via allele-specific RNA-seq may yield candidate X-inactivation regulators (77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also plausible that the escapees indirectly control Xist induction and gene silencing by up-regulating the active allele of a gene(s) that is subject to X inactivation, inducing other escapees, or triggering the sex-specific expression of autosomal factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are currently defining the repertoire of X-inactivation escapees in EpiSCs, to investigate which escape genes function as dosage-sensitive factors that induce Xist and trigger X-linked gene silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
