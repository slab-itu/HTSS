Structure of aryl O-demethylase offers molecular insight into a catalytic tyrosine-dependent mechanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modern industrial and agricultural practices generate large quantities of aromatic pollutants; however, these waste products can be converted into fine chemicals, fuels, and plastics through biocatalytic pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacterial world can inform such utilization strategies as certain strains of soil and marine bacteria metabolize environmentally derived aromatics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these metabolic pathways involve aryl intermediates that require demethylation to facilitate modification and ring opening for assimilation into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aryl demethylases, which catalyze this reaction, are poorly understood, making their utilization in biotechnology difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide the structural and mechanistic characterization of a single-domain aryl demethylase, LigM, which employs a tyrosine-dependent mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insights from this work will inform synthetic biology approaches to convert underutilized aromatics into higher value compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some strains of soil and marine bacteria have evolved intricate metabolic pathways for using environmentally derived aromatics as a carbon source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these metabolic pathways go through intermediates such as vanillate, 3-O-methylgallate, and syringate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Demethylation of these compounds is essential for downstream aryl modification, ring opening, and subsequent assimilation of these compounds into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and, correspondingly, there are a variety of associated aryl demethylase systems that vary in complexity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, only a basic understanding of the least complex system, the tetrahydrofolate-dependent aryl demethylase LigM from Sphingomonas paucimobilis, a bacterial strain that metabolizes lignin-derived aromatics, was previously available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LigM-catalyzed demethylation enables further modification and ring opening of the single-ring aromatics vanillate and 3-O-methylgallate, which are common byproducts of biofuel production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we characterize aryl O-demethylation by LigM and report its 1.81-Å crystal structure, revealing a unique demethylase fold and a canonical folate-binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural homology and geometry optimization calculations enabled the identification of LigMs tetrahydrofolate-binding site and proteinfolate interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computationally guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses allowed the identification of the enzymes aryl-binding site location and determination of its unique, catalytic tyrosine-dependent reaction mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work defines LigM as a distinct demethylase, both structurally and functionally, and provides insight into demethylation and its reaction requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results afford the mechanistic details required for efficient utilization of LigM as a tool for aryl O-demethylation and as a component of synthetic biology efforts to valorize previously underused aromatic compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

LigM_Is_More_Sensitive_to_pH_than_to_Temperature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sphingomonas paucimobilis LigM is 471 residues in length, functioning intracellularly, presumably in the cytosol, to catalyze the transfer of a methyl moiety from the methoxy functional group of vanillate or 3-O-methylgallate to nitrogen 5 (N5) of H4folate, forming protocatechuate (PCA), or gallate, respectively, and 5-methyl-H4folate (Fig 1A) (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an HPLC-based method to quantify PCA production at varying pH and temperatures, LigM-catalyzed vanillate O-demethylation was found, in agreement with and expanding upon previous work by Rosini, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (12), to occur most readily at pH 68 and temperatures ranging from 1040 °C (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LigM was most active at pH 8, achieving a maximal reaction velocity (115 nM/s) at 30 °C, and was least active under strong acidic (pH 4) and basic (pH 10) conditions (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although at pH 8 LigM was rendered essentially inactive at temperatures above 50 °C, the enzyme exhibited sustained, although reduced, activity at pH 6, displaying measurable activity over the entire range of assayed temperatures with peak activity at 2030 °C (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LigM_Uses_an_Ordered__Sequential_Kinetic_Mechanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With only a basic understanding of the LigM-catalyzed vanillate O-demethylation reaction available in the existing literature, we sought to characterize the kinetic mechanism of LigM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because LigM-catalyzed vanillate O-demethylation involves two substrates and leads to the production of two products (Fig 1A), it can be deduced that LigM uses a bisubstrate, biproduct (Bi Bi) kinetic mechanism, which can be classified as either sequential or ping-pong (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify LigMs kinetic parameters and determine which of these two Bi Bi mechanisms was at play, a bisubstrate steady-state kinetic analysis was performed on LigM, and velocity data were plotted against substrate concentration (SI Appendix, Fig S1 A and B) (1416).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LineweaverBurk reciprocal plots of the kinetic data were generated for data visualization and to aid in discernment between sequential and ping-pong mechanisms (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the concentration of vanillate was varied with different fixed concentrations of H4folate, the intersection of the corresponding LineweaverBurk plots occurred in the upper right quadrant (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the reciprocal plots when the concentration of H4folate was varied with different fixed concentrations of vanillate also displayed an intersecting pattern with the intersection point located in the lower left quadrant (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intersecting pattern depicted in both reciprocal plots provides strong evidence that LigM uses a sequential mechanism, requiring binding of vanillate and H4folate, forming a ternary complex, before product formation and release (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine kcat, Km, and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for each substrate, the raw kinetic data were globally fit with a nonlinear least-squares sequential rate equation (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the assay conditions, LigM displayed relatively equal (within the error of the measurement) Km values for vanillate and H4folate, and subsequently LigMs catalytic efficiency for vanillate and H4folate was roughly equivalent (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that transfer of the methoxy methyl moiety from vanillate to H4folate and protonation of demethylated vanillate to form PCA occur essentially simultaneously, without the formation of additional reaction intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To define LigMs sequential mechanism further, product inhibition studies using 5-methyl-H4folate were used to distinguish between ordered versus random binding and release of the reaction species (SI Appendix, Fig S1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The families of curves produced in these experiments were used to generate LineweaverBurk plots, and the intersection of these plots enabled identification of the type of inhibition elicited by 5-methyl-H4folate with regard to each substrate (Fig 2 C and D) (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When H4folate was held at a saturating concentration, and vanillate was varied at different fixed concentrations of 5-methyl-H4folate, the lines on the reciprocal plot intersected in the upper left quadrant (Fig 2C), corresponding to noncompetitive inhibition (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when vanillate was held at a saturating concentration, and H4folate was varied at different fixed concentrations of 5-methyl-H4folate, intersection occurred on the positive y axis (Fig 2D), indicating competitive inhibition (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibition strength of 5-methyl-H4folate differed slightly between substrates: 5-methyl-H4folate had a stronger inhibition effect on vanillate with a Ki, app of 0.10 mM versus a Ki, app of 0.17 mM with respect to H4folate (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5-Methyl-H4folates competitive mode of inhibition toward H4folate and noncompetitive inhibition toward vanillate was consistent with an ordered, sequential kinetic mechanism for LigM in which H4folate and 5-methyl-H4folate compete for the same enzyme form of LigM (i.e., free enzyme or aryl-bound enzyme) (13, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Crystal_Structure_of_LigM_Reveals_a_Unique_Demethylase_Fold  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The kinetic characterization of LigM described above provided insight into how LigM functions at a mechanistic level; however, such work is unable to describe the underlying structural basis for LigMs catalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With only distant sequence similarity to proteins of known fold, determination of LigMs X-ray crystal structure was essential for understanding the catalytic mechanism of this demethylase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final structure model of LigM, solved to 1.81 Å, spans 97.8% of the protein sequence (Thr3Ala467) and is 25% -helical and 24% -strand in nature with the remaining 51% of the structure comprised of ordered, connecting loop regions (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Table S1 ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, LigM is globular in shape, measuring roughly 60 × 50 × 40 Å in size, and contains 12 -helices (H112) and 21 -strands, which are organized into five -sheets (designated by the letters AE in Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure reveals canonical folate-binding architecture as well as structural elements that are unique to LigM, as identified by a structural homology search using DaliLite v. 3 (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top 50 scoring structural homolog hits were methyltransferases that use a conserved tripartite folate-binding domain to interact with and transfer a methyl to a folate substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LigMs closest structural homolog is an aminomethyltransferase T-protein of the glycine cleavage system from Thermotoga maritima (Tm_T) [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code: 1WOS] (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tm_T shares 23% sequence identity with LigM, aligning with an rmsd of 2.4 Å over its 324-residue H4folate-binding fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the top 50 structural homologs align to LigM strictly through their respective folate-binding domains with rmsds ranging from 2.4 to 3.2 Å. Interestingly, LigMs aminomethyltransferase homologs catalyze a different reaction involving the production of 5,10-methylene-H4folate (20, 21), and this difference in end products may explain why LigM shares such low overall sequence identity with its homologs (2027%) despite sharing significant structural similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
LigMs highly conserved tripartite H4folate-binding fold comprises 70% of its structure, and consists of three domains arranged in a cloverleaf-like formation, creating a central H4folate-binding cavity (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4A) (11, 22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Domain 1 spans residues Ala52Asp56 and Ser161Phe237 and is comprised of the six-stranded, mixed-type -sheet A (A1A6) flanked on either face by two -helices (H3, H8; H6, H7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Domain 2 (Val62Asp145) is architecturally similar to domain 1 and is composed of the five-stranded, antiparallel -sheet B (B1B5) and two -helices (H4, H5), which pack against the outer face of -sheet B (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A unique, 13-residue-long extension is present in LigM between -strands B2 and B3 that contains the two-stranded -hairpin -sheet C (C1, C2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Domain 3 (Lys335Ser448) is structurally distinct from domains 1 and 2, because it consists of a -barrel motif formed by the six-stranded antiparallel -sheet D (D1D6) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike its structural homologs, domain 3 of LigM contains an additional two-stranded parallel -sheet, -sheet E (E1, E2), which is the only parallel -sheet present in LigM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, -strands E1 and E2 are separated by roughly 80 residues, many of which are structural elements that are unique to LigM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Strand E2 sits immediately N-terminal to D2, seemingly forming one long -strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This D2 extension is specific to LigM and is not present in the structural homologs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Perhaps indicative of its distinct mechanism and specificity toward vanillate, 30% of LigM's structure does not exhibit significant structural homology to any other protein of known structure (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4A, these unique structural elements are depicted in red, and the H4folate-binding architecture, identified through structural homology, is displayed in gray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, LigMs unique structure is located predominantly on one side of the enzyme and largely stems from sequence insertions found between main structural elements of its H4folate-binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N terminus of LigM, which spans the first 40 residues of structure and precedes domain 1, contains two -helices (H1, H2), which, together with H9 and H10, sit above domain 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This -helix bundle borders one side of -sheet C, and another unique element of LigM, -helix H11, is located on the opposing face of -sheet C. A significant portion of the unique structure resides in the C-terminal region of LigM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most notably, the loops connecting several of the -strands in -sheet D are exceptionally long in comparison with those in the structures of other folate-using aminomethyltransferases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region connecting -strands D1 and D2 spans residues Trp341Thr375 and contains an 11-residue -helix, H12, that sits parallel to and extends beyond the -barrel of domain 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second 18-residue loop lies between -strands D5 and D6; in the present structure this loop folds down against the main body of LigM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these structural elements are specific to LigM, this region appeared a prime candidate to house the residues necessary for the vanillate binding and specific O-demethylation activity of LigM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LigM_Uses_Several_Unique__Catalytically_Relevant_Interactions_with_H4folate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present structure of LigM was solved without H4folate of vanillate bound, despite efforts to obtain substrate-bound structures via cocrystallization and crystal soaking with either substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, significant conservation of both the folate-binding site topology and the conformation of bound H4folate enabled identification of LigMs H4folate-binding site and placement of H4folate within this site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of LigMs closest structural homolog, Tm_T from Thermotoga maritima, was solved in both apo (PDB ID code:1WOS) and H4folate-bound (PDB ID code: 1WOO) forms; structurally, these two forms of Tm_T are essentially identical (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To place H4folate in the LigM structure, LigM was aligned with the H4folate-bound Tm_T structure (rmsd of 2.5 Å over 324 residues).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This alignment encompassed the entirety of the canonical H4folate-binding fold and had a Dali Z-score of 32.5, corresponding to a significant fold similarity as Dali Z-scores greater than two are considered significant (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on rmsd and Dali Z-score, LigM and Tm_T were structurally very similar through their H4folate-binding domains; thus, we were able to determine an accurate initial placement of H4folate within the canonical H4folate-binding cavity of LigM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry of H4folate and the surrounding LigM residues were refined further through quantum chemical geometry optimization calculations, in which the energy was minimized with respect to nuclear positions until the optimal geometry was identified (SI Appendix, 13 and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry-optimized structure of H4folate approximately maintained its overall starting geometry, differing from its preoptimization conformation by an rmsd of only 1.69 Å (SI Appendix, Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the geometry-optimized model of H4folate-bound LigM, H4folate adopts a characteristic kinked conformation in the central internal cavity formed by domains 13, positioned as is observed in the H4folate-bound homologs (Fig 4A and SI Appendix, Fig S2B) (11, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This internal cavity is highly solvated in the present structure and extends 14 Å deep by 12 Å wide into the protein core, opening onto the protein surface presumably to enable the entry and exit of H4folate (SI Appendix, Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H4folate binds the length of this cavity with its pteridine ring deeply buried and its C-terminal group bent along the surface-exposed outer edge of the binding channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three folateprotein hydrogen bond interactions involving residues Asp106, Val120, and Glu215 are highly conserved among LigMs structural homologs (26) and also are predicted to be conserved in LigM (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to its homologs, LigM is predicted to use several aromatic and nonpolar residues to interact with H4folate; these include Gln57, Met61, Gln93, Phe110, Phe188, Phe189, Gln165, and Trp256 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although many of these interactions were expected, based on residue location and reported homolog behavior, Atoms in Molecules (AIM) calculations enabled the first principles determination of the existence of atomatom interactions and quantification of the relative strength of the LigMH4folate interactions (SI Appendix, 3 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on AIM calculations, two glutamine residues appear to play a particularly important role in the binding of H4folate by LigM, thus differentiating LigM from its structural homologs (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LigMs two strongest interactions with H4folate were found between Gln93 and the glutamate tail of H4folate (OX1) and between Gln57 and O4 of the pteridine ring (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, a strong interaction was identified between Phe188 and H4folate-OE2; this interaction was unexpected, given the high degree of variability in residue identity among the homologs at this position (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LigM, much like its homologs, is predicted to interact with H4folate along the entire length of the substrate, forming strong interactions with both the pteridine ring and glutamate tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus these interactions together likely promote the characteristic kinked binding conformation of H4folate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beyond LigMs unconventional use of glutamine residues in binding H4folate, there are several additional striking differences between the residue topology of LigMs H4folate-binding site and those of its closest structural homologs Tm_T (rmsd: 2.4 Å, 23% sequence identity) (11); Arthrobacter globiformis dimethylglycine oxidase (DMGO) (rmsd: 2.7 Å, 21% sequence identity) (20); and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP)-dependent demethylase (DmdA) (rmsd: 3.2 Å, 20% sequence identity) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, LigM contains phenylalanines (Phe110, Phe188) and a tryptophan (Trp256) in place of three key Tm_T tyrosines (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of these tyrosines through the loss of three hydroxyl groups would greatly weaken the direct and indirect water-mediated interactions that LigM could form with H4folate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Trp256, which sits alongside H4folate, stretching from the pteridine ring to the p-aminobenzoate moiety, is hypothesized to influence the orientation of Gln93 and to form stacking interactions with H4folate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Utilization of a tryptophan for H4folate binding is unique to LigM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DmdA also contains a tryptophan (Trp197); however Trp197 plays a greater role in facilitating an interaction with DmdAs second substrate, DMSP, than it does with H4folate (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, LigM differs in the residue composition of the innermost portion of the H4folate-binding cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LigM is predicted to use two unique, direct interactions with the pteridine ring O4 of H4folate, mediated by Gln57 and Gln165.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equivalent interactions are not present in Tm_T, DmdA, or DMGO; however, these homologs make two interactions with the neighboring pteridine amine through conserved glutamine and tyrosine residues (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LigM lacks this tyrosine, interacting only with the amine through Glu215.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tm_T contains an arginine (Arg227) in this region, which is highly conserved among bacterial T-proteins and interacts directly with H4folate (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Markedly different, LigM contains Tyr247 in this position, which, at 5.65 Å from H4folate, is not poised for direct interaction with H4folate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In DmdA, this innermost region of the channel houses Ser122, which interacts directly with H4folate at N1, N8, and the pteridine amine and is expected to greatly influence the nucleophilicity of H4folate-N5 (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences in pteridine ring coordination may reflect differences in precise mechanism and target substrates of these enzymes, quite possibly influencing the nucleophilic strength of H4folate-N5 (LigM, DmdA) or N5/N10 (Tm_T, DMGO) and suggesting differences in both the mechanism and mode of priming H4folate-N5 for nucleophilic attack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Vanillate_Methyl_Moiety_Is_Positioned_31_Å_from_H4folate-N5  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the absence of homologous known structures and without knowledge of LigMs catalytic residues, identification of the vanillate-binding site presented a greater challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the vanillate-binding site would reside in the unique structural region of LigM (Fig 4A), because the second substrate sites of its structural homologs were located adjacent or distal to, but not within, the conserved tripartite folate-binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore possible vanillate-binding site locations in LigM, a global blind docking simulation was performed using AutoDock Vina (SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods) (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three highest-scoring binding modes placed the vanillate methyl 3.5, 15, and 17.2 Å, respectively, from H4folate-N5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Docking calculations then were focused around these sites to refine vanillate positioning further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top site, both in docking score and in the validity of a possible reaction mechanism, placed vanillate perpendicular to H4folate with the leaving methyl situated 3.1 Å from H4folate-N5 (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate a final placement model for vanillate in H4folate-bound LigM, vanillate and nearby binding-site residues were geometry optimized as described for H4folate (SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted vanillate-binding cavity, roughly 9.8 × 10.3 × 7.3 Å in size, is composed predominantly of structure and sequence unique to LigM and carries a predominantly positive charge because of the presence of Arg122 and Arg147.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its internal location, this cavity is solvated in the present structure, indicating that this cavity is solvent-, and quite possibly substrate-, accessible (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vanillate-binding site identified in this work differs from that identified by Rosini et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (12); however, our crystal structure, rigorous computational analyses, and site-directed mutagenesis data (presented below) provide compelling evidence in favor of the vanillate-binding site described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AIM calculations identified a total of 25 direct interactions between LigM and vanillate that ranged from strong, essential binding interactions to weak, auxiliary interactions (SI Appendix, 4, Fig S4, and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LigMvanillate interactions were predominantly focused around the vanillate carboxyl and methyl groups with supplementary interactions involving vanillate aryl ring carbons and the vanillate phenol group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on calculations, carboxylate stabilization is largely dependent on strong interactions between Tyr29 and Arg122 and carboxylate oxygen O1 (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further stabilization is achieved through numerous residue interactions with carboxylate O2 and Tyr29, Tyr31, Met61, and Arg122.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculations suggested that LigM interacts with the vanillate methyl moiety through a strong interaction with Tyr247, and association with the vanillate aryl ring is predicted to occur through interactions with Tyr31, His60, and Met61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple interactions, although weak, are predicted to exist between the vanillate hydroxyl group and Asn250, Pro248, Thr251, and Phe393 (SI Appendix, 4 and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these residues dictate the orientation of vanillate, ensuring that the methoxy moiety is directed toward H4folate-N5 and thus encouraging catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, an intermolecular interaction is predicted to exist between the vanillate hydroxyl and methoxy groups; this interaction also may contribute to proper orientation of the leaving methyl by pointing it upward toward H4folate-N5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indirect, water-mediated interactions are not expected to play a significant role in the LigMvanillate interaction because in the present structure the vanillate-binding site is not large enough to accommodate both water molecules and vanillate (SI Appendix, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

O-Demethylation_by_LigM_Proceeds_via_a_Bimolecular_Nucleophilic_Substitution_Mechanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The computational results provided detailed predictions for the location of the substrate-binding site, residue composition, and critical LigMsubstrate (vanillate/H4folate) interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information, combined with experimental activity data, enabled identification of the molecular determinants necessary for the LigM-catalyzed vanillate O-demethylation reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that to transfer a methyl group from vanillate to H4folate-N5, LigM binds both H4folate and vanillate, situating vanillate so the leaving methyl is 3.1 Å away from H4folate-N5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As occurs in other folate methylation reactions (20, 27), H4folate-N5 is expected to act as a nucleophile with its lone pair of electrons making an attack on the methyl carbon of vanillate in a bimolecular substitution (SN2) reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyr247, the only LigM residue hypothesized to interact strongly with the leaving methyl and its associated oxygen atom, is poised to play a central role in this reaction, stabilizing the methyl-associated oxygen and acting as a general acid to donate a proton upon methyl transfer (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AIM calculations also predicted an interaction between Tyr247 and Gln57 that would stabilize Tyr247 during the reaction, enabling the hydroxyl group of Tyr247 to donate a proton to the methoxy oxygen upon methyl transfer to H4folate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm the proposed vanillate-binding site location and O-demethylation reaction mechanism, single point mutations of integral catalytic and vanillate-binding residues were introduced into LigM, and the mutants were tested for vanillate O-demethylation activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of key catalytic residue Tyr247 was examined by making a loss-of-function mutation at this position, producing a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutant (Y247F) that, by removal of a hydroxyl, was expected to render LigM inactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues lining the binding site and believed to make significant contributions to LigMs ability to bind vanillate were mutated to alanine, thus eliminating potential side-chain interactions at the following residue positions: Tyr29, Tyr31, His60, Met61, and Arg122.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Arg147, via its proximity to Arg122, was also predicted to influence the electropositive environment required for interaction with the vanillate carboxyl group, it was hypothesized that a single alanine mutation at Arg122 might not fully eliminate this electropositive environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a double-alanine mutant, R122A/R147A, also was produced and assayed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that all the LigM mutants behaved identically to wild-type LigM in solution, because they all eluted at the same volume by size-exclusion chromatography (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these mutations had no discernible effect on overall protein fold or solution behavior, allowing us to interpret any changes in activity as being directly related to the mutated residues role in vanillate binding and/or catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability of Y247F, Y29A, Y31A, H60A, M61A, R122A, and R122A/R147A LigM mutants to O-demethylate vanillate was examined using the aforementioned activity assay (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V62ALigM was included as positive control, or null mutation, because an alanine mutation at Val62, which is located near but is not a part of the proposed vanillate-binding site, was not expected to have a significant effect on LigM activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, V62A-LigM performed similarly to WT-LigM in this assay (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted, given Tyr247s crucial catalytic role, Y247F-LigM exhibited a 99.8% reduction in activity compared with WT-LigM, rendering this mutant essentially inactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alanine mutation at key binding residues had a dramatic effect on LigMs vanillate O-demethylation activity, reducing activity by 9799% (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alanine mutation at Arg122 had slightly less effect on activity than the other binding-residue point mutations; however, the double-arginine mutant, R122A/R147A-LigM, essentially abolished LigM activity (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the proposed LigM vanillate O-demethylation mechanism whereby Tyr247 is essential for catalytic activity of LigM, because a loss-of-function mutation at this position could not be overcome by the solvent, thus ruling out a nonresidue, solvent-driven proton transfer mechanism such as that suggested for DmdA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pH-rate profile of LigM-catalyzed vanillate O-demethylation provided additional support for Tyr247s role as a proton donor in this reaction, because LigM displayed maximal catalytic efficiency at pH 8 with an apparent pKa at 10.3, which corresponds to a pKa in the range that is typically observed for the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine (pKa = 9.810.5) (SI Appendix, Fig S6) (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the significant loss of activity resulting from the alanine mutation at critical binding-residue locations highlights the importance of proper binding and precise orientation of vanillate to LigMs activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Through a multifaceted biochemical, structural, and computational approach, we have determined the structure and catalytic mechanism of O-demethylation by the demethylase LigM, for which only a basic knowledge of reaction species had previously been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LigM is structurally more related to folate-using aminomethyltransferases than to other known demethylases, largely because of its conserved folate-binding architecture, and its structural and mechanistic uniqueness expand the diversity of demethylase enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond its canonical folate-binding fold, LigM contains unique structural elements, utilizing several unconventional interactions with H4folate and housing an aryl substrate-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on molecular docking and geometry optimization with vanillate and 3MGA, LigM is predicted to use the same binding site and residuesubstrate interactions to bind vanillate and 3MGA (SI Appendix, 6 and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 6A, LigMs substrate binding sites reside deep within the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This internal binding configuration enables close proximity of vanillate and H4folate and requires that the reaction species have a means of entry into and exit from their respective binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H4folate channel is the largest opening into LigMs interior cavity (SI Appendix, Fig S2C) and thus is the most likely possibility, given homolog behavior in which vanillate enters through the H4folate channel first, and once vanillate is bound, H4folate binds, effectively blocking aryl release until product formation has occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This binding behavior is observed in the LigM homolog DMGO (20), and because our structure of LigM suggests that this binding mode is conserved in LigM, we propose an ordered, sequential kinetic mechanism for LigM, in which LigM binds vanillate before H4folate and releases 5-methyl-H4folate before PCA (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the kinetic data presented here support an ordered, sequential mechanism in which H4folate and 5-methyl-H4folate compete for the same enzyme form of LigM, they do not provide direct evidence that LigM binds to vanillate first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the kinetic data are considered together with the structural data and known behavior of LigMs structural homologs, this proposed binding order is most probable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike the reactions of other characterized demethylases, LigM-catalyzed O-demethylation is tyrosine-dependent, requiring Tyr247 to aid in stabilization of the aryl substrate during methyl removal and, more importantly, to complete the reaction through the generation of the demethylated aryl product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the hydroxyl of Tyr247 forms an interaction with the oxygen of the aryl methoxy moiety, stabilizing this atom during nucleophilic attack of the associated methyl group by H4folate-N5 (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon transfer of the methyl to H4folate, the Tyr247 hydroxyl donates its proton to the demethylated aryl oxygen atom, producing the final aryl product, and is itself regenerated by acceptance of a proton from the solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reaction mechanism is supported by a pH-rate profile analysis, which indicated the involvement of two ionizing groups in reaction progression (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pKas of these groups were found to be 5.6 and 10.3, which, based on the structural, biochemical, and computational analyses described here, most likely correspond to H4folate-N5 and the hydroxyl group Tyr247, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a direct interaction is calculated to exist between Tyr247 and Gln57 during this reaction; thus, by stabilizing Tyr247, Gln57 likely aids in proton donation by Tyr247 (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the structural similarity between vanillate and 3MGA and considering the conservation of predicted LigMsubstrate interactions, O-demethylation of 3MGA by LigM is expected to occur via the same reaction mechanism posited for vanillate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, utilization of a catalytic tyrosine by LigM is unique among described demethylases, and defines a distinct category of catalytic tyrosine-dependent demethylases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understandably, variance in catalytic mechanism is expected among demethylases, and this work sheds light on demethylation and its mechanistic requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, given the similarity in their products, DmdA and LigM might be expected to function with similar catalytic components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although both enzymes rely on the nucleophilic character of H4folate-N5 for reaction progression, they differ greatly in their methyl-donating second substrate and in the degree of protein residue involvement in catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DmdAs reaction is dependent only on water and H4folate-N5, and its second substrate, DMSP, is a short-chain, zwitterionic organosulfur compound (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because DMSPs methyl behaves as a fairly good leaving group, the reaction is able to proceed without involving surrounding protein residues (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, removal of methyl from vanillate/3MGA is less facile, and a negative contribution to the free energy of the reaction is required for reaction progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, residues of LigM must be directly involved in the reaction mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction between the hydroxyl group of Tyr247 and the aryl methoxy oxygen is hypothesized to increase the ease with which the methyl can be displaced by stabilizing the buildup of negative charge on the methoxy oxygen that occurs during methyl transfer and by allowing (potentially concerted) formation of the protonated aryl product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction makes the leaving methyl a better candidate for attack by H4folate-N5 than it would be in the absence of a general acid, such as Tyr247.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the role of catalytic protein residues in demethylation is greatly dependent on the ease with which methyl can be transferred between donor and acceptor molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the target substrate methyl is a poor leaving group, greater protein involvement will be required for catalysis, and additional substrate complexation or protonation may be necessary to facilitate methyl transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With an understanding of the interactions required for substrate binding and catalysis, it is not surprising that LigM-catalyzed O-demethylation functions most readily from pH 68, because proper protonation of the residues involved in H4folate- and vanillate-binding and catalysis is achieved only in this pH range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, at pH 68 the hydroxyl of Tyr247 (pKa = 10.3; PROPKA predicted pKa = 1012.7) (SI Appendix, Fig S6) would be protonated and able to donate a proton to the aryl methoxy oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, Arg122 (PROPKA predicted pKa = 12.515.4) and Arg147 (predicted pKa = 1212.5) would most certainly be protonated and positively charged, aiding in the proper orientation of vanillate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyr29 (predicted pKa = 9.310) and Tyr31 (predicted pKa = 1012.2) also would be protonated, enabling their stabilization of the aryl substrate through its carboxyl oxygen and aryl ring carbon atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of the residues involved in LigMs interaction with H4folate, only Asp106 and Glu215 have ionizable side chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At pH 68, Asp106 (predicted pKa = 3.85.8) and Glu215 (predicted pKa = 4.56.3) would be expected to be deprotonated and thus able to facilitate interaction with H4folate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Glu215 is predicted to be important for correct positioning of the pteridine ring and H4folate-N5 for catalysis, maintaining this interaction may be particularly important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proper binding of H4folate and vanillate and subsequent O-demethylation requires the precise binding and reaction environment created by all interacting and neighboring residues; therefore changes in pH may alter only a few residue protonation states but may have substantial effects on reaction progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Placing aryl O-demethylation in a larger context, enzymatic demethylation of aromatic rings, either singularly or as a prerequisite to further modification or ring opening, is invaluable to the conversion and utilization of common aromatic industrial waste products, such as those derived from depolymerized lignin during biofuel production and paper manufacturing and from agricultural runoff (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, not only does catalytic tyrosine-dependent LigM constitute a distinct branch in the demethylase family tree, given its broader specificity and wide functional temperature range, O-demethylase LigM stands out as a potential biocatalytic tool for aryl O-demethylation either alone or as a component of conversion pathways targeting underutilized aromatic compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
