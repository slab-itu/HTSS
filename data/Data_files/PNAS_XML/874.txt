Ultrafast fluorescent decay induced by metal-mediated dipoledipole interaction in two-dimensional molecular aggregates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitative understanding of the ultrafast energy transfer between fluorescent nanoemitters and the environment is essential in nanophotonics and optoelectronics and beneficial to many industrial applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For nanoemitters like single or colloidal dye molecules or quantum dots, their fluorescence decay near a metallic substrate can be described by a noninteracting single-dipole picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we find a dominant fluorescent decay channel in a 2D molecular aggregate as a result of the strong and coherent dipoledipole interaction mediated by a metallic substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unique mechanism leads to an ultrafast fluorescent decay and 10-times greater energy dissipation rate than expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding opens up a unique way to manipulate energy transfer and to develop light-energy devices on the molecular level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two-dimensional molecular aggregate (2DMA), a thin sheet of strongly interacting dipole molecules self-assembled at close distance on an ordered lattice, is a fascinating fluorescent material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is distinctively different from the conventional (single or colloidal) dye molecules and quantum dots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we verify that when a 2DMA is placed at a nanometric distance from a metallic substrate, the strong and coherent interaction between the dipoles inside the 2DMA dominates its fluorescent decay at a picosecond timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our streak-camera lifetime measurement and interacting latticedipole calculation reveal that the metal-mediated dipoledipole interaction shortens the fluorescent lifetime to about one-half and increases the energy dissipation rate by 10 times that expected from the noninteracting single-dipole picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding can enrich our understanding of nanoscale energy transfer in molecular excitonic systems and may designate a unique direction for developing fast and efficient optoelectronic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Schematics of the model system and the fabricated sample structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D molecular aggregate is placed above the metal surface at a distance d. The aggregate has a brickstone lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecules (dipoles) are all oriented along the same x direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interactions lie between real and image dipoles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To accurately characterize the complex system of 2DMA on a metal surface, we need to choose a 2DMA which has a stable structure and a strong radiation power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that the J aggregate of dye, 5,5,6,6-tetrachloro-1,1-diethy1-3,3-di(4-sulfobuty1)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC), is a superior MA of coupled transition dipoles (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows a very intense, narrow, and redshifted J band with respect to the monomer band and is chemically compatible with various nanofabrication techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bridging single molecules and large-size crystals, TDBC aggregate has been considered as an ideal mesoscopic material for making excitonic devices (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Molecular_Multilayer_Growth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our experiment requires deposition of a well-ordered molecular monolayer on a high-quality metal surface and a precise control of the spacer thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We achieve this by molecular layer-by-layer (LBL) adsorption (45, 46) (schematically shown in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LBL technique has been well known for its reliability in making molecular-level devices (36, 45, 4749).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our substrate is prepared by evaporating 100-nm-thick Ag at a rate of 0.8 Å/s on a well-cleaned ultraflat (less_than5 Å roughness) quartz plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fresh-made substrate is then immersed into a 0.1-M 11-mercaptoundecanoic (11-MUA) acid aqueous solution to conformally coat a monolayer of decanoic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ag with the decanoic acid group on top carries negative charges and is able to adsorb poly(diallyldimethylammonium) chloride (PDDA) (a cationic polyelectrolyte).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anionic polyelectrolyte sodium polyacrylate (PolyArc) is then adsorbed onto the positively charged surface of PDDA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n layers of PDDA and PolyArc, denoted by (PDDA/PolyArc)n, can be subsequently adsorbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It provides a spacer of precisely controlled thickness n×ds at a molecular level (refer to the labeling 4 and 5 in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, TDBC anionic cyanine molecules can strongly adhere to the positively charged PDDA and form a J-aggregate monolayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus make a (PDDA/TDBC/PDDA) assembly on top of the spacer with the thickness dJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall molecular multilayer structure can be written as MUA-(PDDA/PolyArc)n-(PDDA/TDBC/PDDA) from the bottom to the top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Morphology_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The LBL thin films grown on the Ag surface possess a morphology as layered materials bearing nanometric thickness variation (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The topography can be verified by atomic force microscopy (AFM), which also determines the thickness of each layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 shows the AFM (CypherAFM) scanned surface morphology with and without coated molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 100-nm Ag by electron-beam evaporation on quartz has about 50100 nm grain size (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The square-root roughness is around 1.9 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After completing the molecule deposition as shown in Fig 2, the surface morphology changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3B, we can observe the lumped regions with clear boundaries, which are J-aggregate domains (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The domain size (labeled with white lines) is about 2030 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that each TDBC monomer has the in-plane dimension of 13 nm (50), so the total number N of individual molecules in each J-aggregate domain is about 4060, which is consistent with the literature (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histograms of height distribution on the sample can be obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We randomly select a 100-nm×100-nm area on a bare-Ag sample (shown in the black box in Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The histogram (marked with Ag in Fig 3C) shows a Gaussian-like distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To see the multilayer feature of the LBL sample, we select an area near the sample edge where the molecular layers are porous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this area, different numbers of molecular layers are randomly exposed under the AFM tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They cause statistically discrete height variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A histogram of the AFM counts over this area then exhibits discrete steps (marked with numbers in Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The jump between every two peaks corresponds to the thickness of one molecular layer (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to this measurement we can obtain the thickness of each layer from the top to the bottom to be around 1.0 nm, 0.9 nm, 1.2 nm, 1.3 nm, 1.2 nm, and 1.5 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence one spacer layer (ds) is around 2.5 nm thick, the 11-MUA layer (dMUA) is around 1.5 nm thick, and the PDDA (dPDDA) is around 1.2 nm thick.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To systematically study the effect of distance d between TDBC and Ag on the fluorescence behavior, we fabricate a series of samples with n numbers of spacer layers (n=16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides a fine-tuned distance d=dMUA+n×ds+dPDDA from 5.2 nm to 17.7 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our LBL technique guarantees excellent conformity between Ag and PDDA/TDBC molecular layers throughout the major area of the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ensured conformity is the most critical to the optical measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The about 2-nm roughness of Ag over 50100 nm grain area merely induces a slow topography variation to the entire stack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It does not affect our observation of fluorescence lifetime and photoluminescence intensity of 2DMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorescence_Lifetime_and_Photoluminescence_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fluorescence lifetime of the J aggregate is measured by a picosecond streak-camera setup as shown in Fig 4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excitation light is carried out with an optical parametric oscillator (Spectra Physics; Inspire HF 100) pumped by a mode-locked Ti:sapphire oscillator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser pulse width is about 200 fs and the repetition rate is 80 MHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light is guided into a Zeiss inverted microscope (Axiovert 200) and focused onto the sample by a Zeiss 50× objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission signal is detected in the reflection configuration, and the signal passing through a bandpass filter with a bandwidth of 30 meV is collected by a synchroscan Hamamatsu streak camera (C10910-02), whose overall time resolution is 2 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transmissivity of the optical system is carefully calibrated to evaluate the absolute power level at the focusing plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser pulse width is measured by a home-built autocorrelator at the focus throughout the scanning range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incident wavelength is chosen at 585 nm for on-resonance excitation of TDBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sample, the measurement is repeated several times in different areas of samples and the final result is the average of multiple measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4B, the measured time-resolved fluorescent intensities of the molecular structures with one to six spacer layers are shown by the marks of different colors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exponential fitting (solid lines in the same color) assisted with a convolution algorithm (52) indicates the increase of lifetime with the increasing distance d. The overall lifetime is extremely short and only several picoseconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also measured the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum (Horiba Fluorolog-3) for different spacer thickness d, as shown in Fig 4C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result displays a trend that the fluorescence power increases with d. It agrees with our expectation that when the fluorescence material is brought away from a lossy medium, the nonradiative decay usually drops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an important reference, we performed the same measurement for sparsely distributed TDBC monomers near an Ag surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this situation, the monomer lifetime must be well described by the noninteracting single-dipole model following Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use an extremely dilute TDBC solution with the concentration of 1.5M so that only TDBC monomers exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We drop cast only 1 L of such solution onto a sample, which has been precoated with 100 nm Ag and 5 nm SiO2 as a spacer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intermolecular distance can be estimated to be over 10 nm, at which the Coulombic dipoledipole interaction can be completely ignored and the single-dipole model must be valid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed PL spectrum clearly shows the 530-nm monomer peak as opposed to the 590-nm J-aggregate peak (Fig 4D, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fluorescence lifetime measurement on the monomer sample follows the same scheme as in Fig 4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the excitation wavelength is changed to 460 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To select the emitted photons around the monomer peak only, we use a bandpass filter of 530±10 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a long lifetime of about 61 ps, as exponentially fitted in Fig 4D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This number is consistent with the single-dipole model calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Theoretical_Analysis_and_Comparison_with_Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our theoretical analysis for the fluorescent behaviors is based on our interacting latticedipole model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each TDBC monomer is treated as a dipole with the Lorentzian polarizability (46),4()=4()xx=02f0022i0xx,[6]where 0 gives the experimentally observed monomer resonance wavelength around 530 nm, and 0 gives its free-space fluorescence lifetime about 260 ps (53), which is strongly limited by the nonradiative vibration levels (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  f0 is the oscillator strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a brickstone pattern, f0 can be chosen such that the resonance wavelength of the J aggregate can be fitted to the experimentally observed value around 590 nm (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of an incident field, we can summarize Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 into a matrix eigenvalue problem,(2+i002)=,[7]where  is a column vector (p1,p2,pN)T and  is an N×N matrix determined by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eigenfrequencies solved from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 are generally complex valued, =Ji2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imaginary part gives the lifetime of the mode =1 from the nonradiative decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latticedipole mode profile can be obtained by the eigenstates of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the solutions are the so-called dark modes, which cannot be excited by incoming light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are interested only in the so-called bright mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be easily identified, as it necessarily has the least phase variation over the J-aggregate domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The calculated lifetime of the bright mode as a function of the distance d is plotted in Fig 5A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three curves spanning the green region correspond to a variable total dipole number N. The colored circles are the experimental results from Fig 4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our theoretical calculation matches the trend of the experimental results very well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we plot in yellow the lifetime calculated from the conventional single-dipole model (refer to Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apparently, the trend in yellow deviates significantly from the measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the actual lifetime of the J aggregate is much shorter than expected from the single-dipole picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that the major dissipation channel lies in the metal-mediated dipoledipole interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We are also able to analyze the energy dissipation and fluorescent properties in great detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a close distance to the metal surface, the emissive energy of 2DMA mostly goes into the Drude loss (electronphonon collision) inside the metal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can define an energy dissipation ratio as the energy flux toward the metal vs. the total energy flux in all directions, =Re[d]Re[d], where S is the energy flux density calculated using the retarded formula of dipole radiation (43),  is a closed surface surrounding the dipole lattice, and  is the integration area beneath the 2DMA but above the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5B shows  as a function of d with our latticedipole model, in comparison with the conventional single-dipole model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy dissipation rate of the former is about 10 times greater than that of the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that in reality much more emissive energy from 2DMA than one would expect is transferred to the lossy metal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fluorescence process involves excitation and radiation (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abilities of excitation and radiation can be represented by the emission rate emi and the quantum yield Q defined as Q=rad, where rad and  are the radiative decay rate and total decay rate, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So the emission rate can be written as emi=excQ=exc(rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dipoles above a metallic substrate are excited by the addition of incident field inc and reflected field from the substrate rinc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized excitation rate can be expressed asexcexc0=|x[inc+rinc]x[inc+r0inc]|2,[8]where r and r0 are the reflection coefficients of the silver substrate and a reference quartz substrate, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantum yield can be calculated by the ratio of time-averaged energy flux toward the upper space vs. the total energy flux toward the whole space and so can be expressed asQ=rad=Re[+d]Re[d],[9]where + is the part of  facing the upper half-space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To normalize Q, we choose a bare quartz without Ag as the substrate to calculate Q0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 5C shows the normalized quantum yield Q/Q0 and excitation rate exc/exc0 as a function of d. We can see that Q increases with increasing d. It reaches a saturation value when d approaches about 50 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5D shows the emission rate of the 2DMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is strongly suppressed as d is smaller than 20 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5D, Inset gives a zoom-in of the curve for the short distance (the shaded region).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colored circles indicate the PL data from Fig 4C after an appropriate normalization to quartz samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our theoretical calculation matches the experimental results reasonably well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This further proves that the interacting latticedipole model successfully describes the 2DMA near a metallic substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we have calculated the energy flux density of a 6-by-7 dipole lattice, as an example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6A shows the amplitude distribution of the forward and backward energy flux density along z viewed from the top and bottom, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The backward energy flux density, which dissipates into the metal, is much stronger than the forward one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The color map clearly exhibits a brickstone lattice pattern, where the amplitude is stronger in the center and weaker on the edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It displays detailed structures that cannot be obtained from an effective single dipole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6B shows the distribution of Sz viewed from the side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also suggests that the major portion of energy flows into the metal region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have investigated the fluorescent behaviors of 2D molecular aggregates at different distances from a metallic substrate, by measuring the lifetime and photoluminescence intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study shows that when the molecular aggregates are close to the metal surface, the dipoledipole interaction mediated by the metal plays a dominant role in the nonradiative decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It leads to an ultrafast fluorescent decay and ultrastrong energy dissipation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The studies of coupled systems of molecular aggregate and metal can deepen our understanding of the interaction between nanoemitters and nanostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide guidelines to design and optimize fast and efficient molecular optoelectronic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
