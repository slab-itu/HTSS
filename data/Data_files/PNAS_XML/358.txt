Uncovering edge states and electrical inhomogeneity in MoS2 field-effect transistors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The performances of devices based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are far from their intrinsic limits, presumably due to various disorders in these 2D crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, little is known about the magnitude and characteristic length scale of electrical inhomogeneity induced by the disorders in TMDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, strong mesoscopic (submicrometer) electrical inhomogeneity in MoS2 flakes, which reveals the potential fluctuations, was observed by a unique technique termed microwave impedance microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The local conductance of edge states and its contribution to the transport were also resolved and analyzed experimentally for the first time, to our knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential landscape in TMDs, which is very important for the improvement of device performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The understanding of various types of disorders in atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), including dangling bonds at the edges, chalcogen deficiencies in the bulk, and charges in the substrate, is of fundamental importance for TMD applications in electronics and photonics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the imperfections, electrons moving on these 2D crystals experience a spatially nonuniform Coulomb environment, whose effect on the charge transport has not been microscopically studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the mesoscopic conductance mapping in monolayer and few-layer MoS2 field-effect transistors by microwave impedance microscopy (MIM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial evolution of the insulator-to-metal transition is clearly resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, as the transistors are gradually turned on, electrical conduction emerges initially at the edges before appearing in the bulk of MoS2 flakes, which can be explained by our first-principles calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results unambiguously confirm that the contribution of edge states to the channel conductance is significant under the threshold voltage but negligible once the bulk of the TMD device becomes conductive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong conductance inhomogeneity, which is associated with the fluctuations of disorder potential in the 2D sheets, is also observed in the MIM images, providing a guideline for future improvement of the device performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The starting materials of our FETs are few-layer exfoliated and monolayer (ML) chemical vapor deposited (CVD) MoS2 flakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were transferred to or directly grown on SiO2 (285 nm)/Si substrates, after which the source and drain contacts (20 nm Ag/30 nm Au) were formed via conventional electron beam (e beam) lithography and deposition (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid direct contact between the metallic tip and the 2D sheets, which would strongly perturb the semiconducting MoS2, we covered the device by the e-beam deposition of a thin (15 nm) layer of Al2O3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the carrier density in MoS2 can be either globally modulated by the heavily doped Si back gate or locally tuned by the tip as a scanning top gate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thanks to the capacitive tipsample interaction, the MIM is capable of preforming subsurface electrical imaging (2932) on the buried MoS2 nanosheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple exfoliated and CVD MoS2 devices were investigated in this work, all of which exhibited similar behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1B shows the optical and the close-up AFM images of a typical FET fabricated on an exfoliated flake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample consists of two distinct regions with thicknesses of 2.1 nm and 2.8 nm, corresponding to three and four MLs, respectively, of MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excluding several wrinkles from the exfoliation, the surface roughness of the sample is about 0.4 nm, presumably due to the fabrication process and Al2O3 deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear output characteristic IDSVDS curves in Fig 1C, Inset at different back-gate voltages (VBG) are indicative of the good Ohmic contacts between Ag and MoS2 (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the n-type transfer characteristics in Fig 1C, the field effect mobility can be extracted by using the expression FE=(dIDS/dVBG)(L/W)Cox-1VDS-15cm2/(V.s), where Cox is the parallel-plate capacitance of the SiO2 layer, and L and W are the channel length and width, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, although the room temperature mobility is comparable to that of most back-gated devices reported in the literature (3, 5, 6, 16, 17), it is much lower than the theoretical phonon-limited value (33), suggesting the presence of considerable disorder in this device, which will be explored by the MIM study below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2A displays selected MIM images within the channel region of the device in Fig 1B as a function of VBG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete set of data and a video clip showing the gate dependence can be found in Fig S1 and Movie S1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution of local conductance maps vividly demonstrates the insulator-to-metal transition induced by the electrostatic field effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the flake is in the insulating limit at VBG = 30 V, there is virtually no electrical contrast between MoS2 and the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As VBG gradually goes up to 0 V, the contrast first emerges at the edges of the flake and then in the interior of the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the MIM-Im signals are always higher on the four-ML region, with slightly smaller band gap (34) and higher mobility (35) than the three-ML part.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For increasing VBG toward 20 V, strong inhomogeneity is observed in both MIM output channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the MIM signals at the edges gradually merge into the bulk and become indistinguishable with the rest of the flake for VBG  20 V. For even higher back-gate voltages, the sample appears uniformly bright in MIM-Im and dim in MIM-Re.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the entire process, the MIM-Im signals on the MoS2 flake rise monotonically as increasing VBG, whereas the MIM-Re signals reach a peak at VBG 20 V and diminish afterward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar MIM data are observed by gradually ramping up the dc tip bias VTG during the scans, as shown in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The local gating, on the other hand, results in a complex in-plane potential gradient away from the tip (36) and therefore will not be analyzed in detail here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We emphasize that the same trend of MIM response has been seen in all six MoS2 FETs in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2B shows the optical, AFM, and MIM images of a CVD-grown ML MoS2 device (complete set of data included in Fig S3), with the overall behavior similar to that in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, we will focus on the exfoliated sample in Fig 1 for quantitative analysis of the MIM data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The average MIM-Im/Re signals within two 4 m × 2 m areas (white dashed boxes in Fig 2A) on the four-ML and three-ML segments are shown in Fig 2C, where the x axis is converted from VBG to the two-terminal sourcedrain conductance (GDS) by using the transfer curve in Fig 1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantitatively interpret the MIM signals as local conductance, we have calculated the MIM response curves as a function of the bulk MoS2 sheet conductance gbulk using FEA (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the FEA modeling and justification of the simulation parameters are included in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2D, the simulated MIM-Im signal, which is proportional to the tipsample capacitance, increases monotonically as increasing gbulk and saturates at both the insulating (gbulk less_than 109 Siemens·sq or Ssq) and conducting (gbulk  105 Ssq) limits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MIM-Re signal, on the other hand, represents the effective loss in the tipsample interaction and peaks at an intermediate gbulk of 107 Ssq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that GDS  gbulkW/L if the source/drain contact resistance is relatively small compared with the channel resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An excellent agreement between the experimental data and our modeling result can be obtained by comparing the averaged MIM signals in Fig 2C and the simulation in Fig 2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MIM images thus provide a quantitative measure of the mesoscopic conductance distribution in the MoS2 FET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A prominent feature in Fig 2A is the emergence of conductive edge states before the bulk of the sample is populated by conduction electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of localized edge channels on the boundary of a 2D system is one of the most intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of TMDs, both density functional theory (DFT) calculations (2022) and STM measurements (20, 23) have revealed the metallic (semiconducting) states at the zigzag (armchair) edges, whereas their influence on the device performance has not been experimentally probed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MIM-Im images on the three-ML side of the sample at selected VBG are shown in Fig 3A, with the line profiles across the sample edge (yellow dashed line) plotted in Fig 3B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the apparent width of 200300 nm at different locations of the boundary is determined by the spatial resolution or the tip diameter d rather than the actual width wedge of the edge states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the edge conductance, we performed 3D FEA modeling of the MIM response, in which a narrow conductive channel with wedge = 5 nm is situated in between the insulating substrate and the MoS2 bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because wedge less_thanless_than d, the simulation result is invariant with respect to the product of wedge and the sheet conductance of the edge gedge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details and justifications of the modeling parameters are shown in Fig S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The edge and bulk conductance values determined by comparing the 3D FEA and the MIM data are plotted in Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As VBG increases from 30 V to 0 V, gedge rapidly increases for more than two orders of magnitude, whereas the bulk conductance gbulk stays below our sensitivity limit of 109 Ssq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 0 V less_than VBG less_than 5 V, gedge levels off and gbulk starts to rise above the noise floor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For VBG above 5 V, gedge saturates around 4 × 105 Ssq, whereas gbulk continues to increase as VBG increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantitative mapping of gedge signifies the fundamental difference between the topologically trivial edge states in TMDs and the nontrivial quantum Hall (QH) (37) or quantum spin Hall (QSH) (38, 39) edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TMD edges in our case can be treated as a normal 1D conductor, where the carriers experience the usual scattering events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the FET channel length L  10 m in this sample, the maximum contribution of the edge states to the total conduction Gedge = gedgewedge/L is on the order of 108 S, which is negligible once the FET is turned on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QH or QSH edge channels, on the other hand, are dissipationless due to the suppression of backscattering and are responsible for the transport quantization when the bulk is insulating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in our previous MIM studies on both QH (30) and QSH (31) systems, the highly conductive edges display maximum MIM-Im and zero MIM-Re signals, in sharp contrast to the finite signals in both channels for the MoS2 edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For further investigations of the observed edge states, we carried out first-principles DFT calculations (Methods) on one-ML and three-ML MoS2 nanosheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4A shows the computed energy bands of an infinite 2D sheet and a nanoribbon with armchair edges of three-ML MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the bulk band structure, multiple bands appear within the bulk gap for the nanoribbon, reducing its energy gap from the bulk value of 1.1 eV to 0.3 eV, as also indicated by the density of states (DOS) plots in Fig 4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge density of additional electronic states at the M point of the Brillouin zone, circled in Fig 4A, is well localized at boundary atoms in Fig 4C, confirming that the additional bands in Fig 4A are associated with the edge states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a nanoribbon with zigzag edges, there are also edge states within the band gap, which connect the bulk conduction and valence bands as shown in Fig S6 (1820).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For completeness, we have also included the DFT results of one-ML MoS2 in Fig S6, showing similar characteristics to the three-ML MoS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality, the edges in our devices may be a mixture of armchair and zigzag configurations, and the dangling bonds are usually terminated by foreign molecules from the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the additional DOS inside the bulk band gap will be retained, leading to the topologically trivial edge states at the sample boundary (20, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As schematically illustrated in Fig 4D, electrons will first populate the edge states with increasing VBG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After these in-gap states are completely filled and gedge is saturated, the further increase of VBG will then raise the Fermi level EF into the bulk conduction band, resulting in the upturn of gbulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the bulk bands, the edge bands are relatively flat, suggestive of higher effective mass and possibly lower mobility of the edge states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, once the bulk states participate in the transport at high gate voltages, the contribution of the edge states to the overall conductance becomes negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a physical picture nicely matches the evolution of local conductance maps deduced from the MIM data in Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the onset of bulk conduction at VBG = 5 V to the saturation of MIM signals around VBG = 25 V, pronounced spatial inhomogeneity with submicrometer length scale can be observed inside the MoS2 flake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the strengths and spatial dimensions of the conductance fluctuations in this subthreshold regime are of critical importance for the device performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We emphasize that the large variation of MIM signals cannot be accounted for by the surface roughness of the Al2O3 capping layer, as analyzed in Fig S7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 5A, the zoom-in MIM-Im images are displayed at VBG = 20 V, 14 V, and 35 V, together with the corresponding line profiles in Fig 5B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation of MIM signals at VBG = 14 V corresponds to local fluctuations of gbulk from 5 × 108 Ssq to 2 × 107 Ssq in the four-ML region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Admittedly, the MIM-Im response (Fig 2C) is also highly sensitive in this intermediate conductance range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the transistor is completely turned off for VBG = 20 V (EF below the bulk conduction band minimum EC) and on for VBG = 35 V (EF well above EC), as shown in Fig 1C, it is reasonable to expect much weaker spatial conductance variations under these two conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, electrical inhomogeneity is most significant when EF intersects the spatially fluctuating EC, as schematically shown in Fig 5C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MIM maps thus provide both quantitative measurements and direct visualization of the mesoscopic potential landscape in the sample (32), which is the combined effect from defects within the MoS2 layer, charges inside the substrate and the capping layer, and impurities across the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percolation network is vividly demonstrated in the subthreshold regime, which was only indirectly inferred from atomic scale or macroscale studies (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that a similar technique, the alternating current STM (40), can be applied to study the atomic-scale defects in MoS2, which would provide complementary information to our MIM work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we demonstrate the local conductance mapping of functional MoS2 FETs by MIM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that, during the insulator-to-metal transition, electrons induced by the electrostatic field effect first populate the edge states before occupying the bulk of the 2D sheets, a scenario further corroborated by our first-principles calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results unambiguously confirm that the contribution of edge states to the channel conductance is significant under the threshold voltage but negligible once the bulk becomes conductive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude and spatial dimensions of mesoscopic electrical inhomogeneity in the subthreshold regime are also visualized from the MIM data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simultaneous macroscopic transport and mesoscopic imaging experiments on TMD FETs are critically important for both fundamental research and practical applications on these fascinating materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

DFT_Calculations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Density functional theory calculations are performed using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package with the projector augmented wave method and PerdewBurkeErnzerhof exchange-correlation functional (4143).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For three-ML MoS2, the interlayer van der Waals interactions are taken into account by Grimme's D2 correction (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A plane wave cutoff of 400 eV and a k-point spacing smaller than 0.2 Å1 along each periodic direction are used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A vacuum layer of larger than 15 Å is adopted to minimize the interaction between MoS2 nanoribbon/sheet and its periodic images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atomic structures are fully relaxed, with the force on each atom less than 0.01 eV/Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spinorbit coupling (SOC) is included in the calculation of electronic properties, given a giant spinorbit-induced spin splitting in MoS2 layers (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Denser k meshes and a Gaussian smearing of 0.1 eV are applied in the calculation of DOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an infinite sheet of one-ML and three-ML MoS2, we construct supercells with a similar structure to corresponding armchair nanoribbons but without edges, which can be easily compared with the results of armchair nanoribbons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
