Complementary roles of gasotransmitters CO and H2S in sleep apnea  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The carotid body (CB) is the major sensory organ responsible for monitoring arterial blood oxygen content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glomus cells in the CB express heme oxygenase 2 (HO-2) and cystathionine--lyase (CSE), enzymes that generate the gasotransmitters carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In normoxia, CO inhibits CSE from producing H2S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During hypoxia, HO-2 produces less CO, resulting in increased H2S production, which stimulates CB activity, leading to increases in respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that decreased CO and increased H2S generation in the CB causes sleep apnea in HO-2 knockout mice and spontaneously hypertensive rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An inhibitor of CSE eliminates sleep apnea when administered to these animals, suggesting that this approach may have therapeutic utility in patients with sleep apnea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sleep apnea, which is the periodic cessation of breathing during sleep, is a major health problem affecting over 10 million people in the United States and is associated with several sequelae, including hypertension and stroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical studies suggest that abnormal carotid body (CB) activity may be a driver of sleep apnea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because gaseous molecules are important determinants of CB activity, aberrations in their signaling could lead to sleep apnea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that mice deficient in heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2), which generates the gaseous molecule carbon monoxide (CO), exhibit sleep apnea characterized by high apnea and hypopnea indices during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar high apnea and hypopnea indices were also noted in prehypertensive spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats, which are known to exhibit CB hyperactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified the gaseous molecule hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as the major effector molecule driving apneas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic ablation of the H2S-synthesizing enzyme cystathionine--lyase (CSE) normalized breathing in HO-2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacologic inhibition of CSE with l-propargyl glycine prevented apneas in both HO-2/ mice and SH rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations demonstrate that dysregulated CO and H2S signaling in the CB leads to apneas and suggest that CSE inhibition may be a useful therapeutic intervention for preventing CB-driven sleep apnea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HO-2__Mice_Exhibit_Irregular_Breathing_with_Apneas_and_Hypopneas  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Basal breathing was monitored in unsedated 6- to 9-mo-old WT and HO-2/ mice by plethysmography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with WT mice, HO-2/ mice exhibited irregular breathing with episodes of both apnea and hypopnea (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The irregular breathing was quantified by analyzing the variations in the total duration of breaths (TTOT) as described (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HO-2/ mice displayed higher irregularity scores than WT mice (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The number of apneas (defined as cessation of breathing for more than the duration of 2.5 breaths, excluding postsigh apneas, and sniffs) per hour was analyzed and presented as the apnea index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A majority of the HO-2/ mice (40/70, 57%) had 20 or more apnea events per hour (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, only 2/40 WT mice (5%) exhibited such frequent apneas (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apnea duration varied in individual mice, ranging from 1.3 to 4.0 s. Among HO-2/ mice, the apnea index was higher at 6 to 9 mo compared with 6 to 9 wk (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hypopnea was defined as a breathing event with 30% reduction in tidal volume and is presented as the hypopnea index (hypopnea events per hour).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifty-six percent of the HO-2/ mice (39/70), but only 2.5% of the WT mice (1/40), had a hypopnea index of 80 (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of arterial blood gases showed lower partial pressure of O2 (pO2), lower O2 saturation, and elevated pCO2 levels in HO-2/ mice (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that HO-2/ mice exhibit irregular breathing with higher apnea and hypopnea indices than WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Central_and_Obstructive_Apneas_in_HO-2__Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Apneas are of two types, central and obstructive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Central apneas are characterized by the absence of breathing and respiratory muscle activity, and obstructive apneas are associated with impeded airflow and increased respiratory muscle activity (11, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sought to characterize the apneas exhibited by HO-2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we recorded both breathing and inspiratory intercostal muscle electromyographic (I-EMG) activity with chronically implanted electrodes in unsedated HO-2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some apneas were associated with complete absence of I-EMG activity, indicative of central apnea (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other apneas were accompanied by an increase in I-EMG activity, indicative of obstructive apnea (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, HO-2null mice experienced obstructive apnea more frequently than central apnea (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Apneas_and_Hypopneas_Occur_During_Sleep  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether sleepwake state influences the apnea and hypopnea index, an electroencephalogram (EEG) and an electromyogram of neck extensor muscles (EMGneck) were recorded with chronically implanted electrodes, along with breathing, in unsedated WT and HO-2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wake state was characterized by EEG activity of mixed frequency, with low amplitude and high muscle tone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was identified by both the frequency of theta waves (6 to 9 Hz) and muscle atonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-REM (NREM) sleep was characterized by high-amplitude slow waves in the delta frequency range (1 to 4 Hz) and low muscle tone (15, 16) (Fig 2 A and B and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with earlier studies (17, 18), we found reduced tidal volume during NREM and REM sleep, and increased respiratory rate during REM sleep, in WT mice (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apnea and the hypopnea indices were lowest during the wake state, and were similar in WT and HO-2/ mice (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NREM or REM sleep had little impact on the apnea or hypopnea index in WT mice (Fig 2 A, C, and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, HO-2null mice showed increased apnea and hypopnea indices in NREM and REM sleep, with higher indices in REM compared with NREM sleep (Fig 2 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_CB_Chemoreflex_Contributes_to_Apnea  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next sought to determine the mechanisms causing apneas in HO-2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An exaggerated CB chemoreflex has been implicated as a driver of apneas (1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endogenous CO derived from HO-2 is a physiological inhibitor of CB sensory activity (4), and HO-2null mice exhibit markedly diminished CO levels in the CB and heightened CB sensitivity to hypoxia (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration of CORM-3, a CO donor, eliminated the enhanced hypoxic sensitivity of CBs from HO-2null mice (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heightened CB sensitivity to hypoxia was associated with augmented hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), a hallmark of the CB chemoreflex, and i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  administration of CORM-3 prevented the exaggerated HVR in HO-2null mice (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that, if enhanced CB activity causes apneas, the CO donor should restore normal breathing in HO-2null mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility was tested in HO-2null mice by monitoring breathing before and after administration of CORM-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, CORM-3 completely prevented apneas and restored normal breathing in HO-2/ mice (Fig 3 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibitory effects of the CO donor were evident within 10 min after administration of CORM-3 and lasted for 2 h. These findings suggest that increased CB activity causes apneas in HO-2null mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further establish a role for the CB chemoreflex in driving apneas, CBs were bilaterally denervated in HO-2null mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, CB denervation proved lethal to all four HO-2/ mice tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously reported that HO-2null CBs are capable of responding to changes in in O2 levels, due to a compensatory increase in the glomus cell expression of neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase, which catalyzes O2-dependent production of another gas messenger, NO (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, as an alternative approach to modulating CB activity, HO-2null mice were exposed to different concentrations of inspired O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure of the mice to hyperoxia (90% O2), which inhibits CB activity (22), markedly reduced the apnea index and restored stable breathing (Fig 3 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, exposure to hypoxia (15% O2), which stimulates CB activity, markedly increased the apnea index (Fig 3 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyperoxia decreased both obstructive and central apneas whereas hypoxia increased the number of obstructive and central apneas by three- and twofold, respectively (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to an augmented CB chemoreflex, cardiomyopathy (23) and reduced chemosensitivity to CO2 (24) can also result in apnea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assessment of cardiac function by echocardiography revealed that fractional shortening, left ventricular diameter, and ventricular wall thickness were all comparable in WT and HO-2/ mice (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ventilatory response to CO2 was indistinguishable in HO-2/ and WT mice (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure of HO-2/ mice to 2% CO2 for 30 min, which stimulates central chemoreceptors, led to only a modest reduction (26%) in the apnea index, which was primarily due to reduced central apneas (Fig S5 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observations suggest that an enhanced CB chemoreflex, rather than cardiomyopathy or reduced chemosensitivity to CO2, is the major driver of apneas in HO-2null mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Absence_of_Apneas_in_HO-2_CSE_Double-Null_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The exaggerated CB activity in HO-2null mice was shown to be due to increased CSE-derived H2S production in the CB, and HO-2/CSE double-null mice exhibit absence of CB hypersensitivity to hypoxia (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that HO-2/CSE double-null mice with normal CB sensitivity to hypoxia should exhibit stable breathing compared with HO-2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, HO-2/CSE/ mice showed remarkably stable breathing without apneas or hypopneas (Fig 4 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that chronic activation of the CB chemoreflex by CSE-derived H2S contributes to apnea in HO-2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pharmacologic_Blockade_of_CSE_Prevents_Apneas  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined whether pharmacologic blockade of CSE stabilizes breathing in HO-2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first analyzed the efficacy and selectivity of l-propargylglycine (l-PAG), an inhibitor of CSE activity (25), using an in vitro assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  l-PAG inhibited CSE-derived H2S production in a dose-dependent manner whereas it had no effect on the activity of cystathionine -synthase (CBS), another H2S-synthesizing enzyme (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then examined the effects of systemic administration of l-PAG on breathing in HO-2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  administration of l-PAG reduced the apnea index in a dose-dependent manner, with an median effective dose of 30 mg/kg (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced apnea index by l-PAG was evident within 2 h after administration, and the apnea index returned to vehicle-treated levels after 24 h (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  l-PAG reduced the frequency of both obstructive and central apneas (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  l-PAG also lowered the hypopnea index, and, unlike the apnea index, it remained low 24 h after l-PAG administration (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  l-PAG (30 mg/kg i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  markedly reduced the CB sensory response to hypoxia in HO-2/ mice (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oral administration of l-PAG (30 mg/kg) was equally effective in reducing the apnea and hypopnea indices (Fig 5 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oral or i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  administration of l-PAG was well-tolerated, with no sign of overt toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CSE_Inhibitor_Prevents_Apneas_in_SH_Rats  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even before the development of hypertension, SH rats exhibit a heightened CB response to hypoxia, which is associated with increased CSE-derived H2S levels and decreased CO levels, as well as reduced HO-2 activity (6), similar to what was observed in the HO-2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we hypothesized that SH rats also display high apnea and hypopnea indices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we monitored breathing in 4- to 5-wk-old unsedated SH and WKY rats (parental strain for SH rats).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although WKY rats displayed stable breathing, SH rats showed irregular breathing, with high apnea and hypopnea indices (Fig 6 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because l-PAG normalized the CB hypoxic response in SH rats (6), we examined whether l-PAG affects the frequency of apneic episodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within 2 h of i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  administration of l-PAG (30 mg/kg), the breathing of SH rats became stable, and the apnea and hypopnea indices were markedly decreased (Fig 6 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study establishes that dysregulated signaling of the gasotransmitter CO can lead to sleep apnea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HO-2/ mice, which have low CO levels, exhibited several key features of sleep apnea that have been reported in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like patients with sleep apnea, HO-2null mice exhibit high apnea and hypopnea indices during NREM and REM sleep but not when awake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, rodents were thought to exhibit only central apneas (26) whereas sleep apnea patients most often exhibit both obstructive and central apneas (10, 11, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By simultaneously monitoring respiratory muscle activity and breathing, we demonstrated that HO-2/ mice exhibit both central and obstructive apneas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aged HO-2null mice exhibited a greater apnea index than younger mice, mirroring the higher incidence of sleep apnea in middle-aged compared with younger adults (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides apneas, HO-2null mice also showed a higher hypopnea index, another common feature in patients with sleep apnea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The severity of apneas and hypopneas was reflected in deranged arterial blood gases manifested as mild hypoxemia and hypercapnia (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because CB hypersensitivity to hypoxia is seen in HO-2null mice even at a young age (5), it is likely that chronic activation of the CB chemoreflex leads to more frequent apneas with progressing age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further studies are needed to exclude the possibility that HO-2null mice exhibit evidence of lung injury that might contribute to apneas by causing hypoxemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, systemic administration of CORM-3, a CO donor, completely prevented the apnea phenotype in HO-2null mice, supporting the notion that the irregular breathing stems from reduced HO-2derived CO levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH rats, which have decreased CO levels due to decreased HO-2 activity (6), also displayed increased apnea and hypopnea indices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings demonstrate that low CO levels lead to an increased incidence of apnea in both rats and mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How might reduced CO signaling lead to more frequent apneas?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical studies suggest that an augmented CB chemoreflex can drive apneas in patients with sleep apnea (1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HO-2/ mice displayed heightened CB sensitivity to hypoxia and augmented HVR, a hallmark of the CB chemoreflex, and these effects were prevented by administration of CORM-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, CORM-3 restored normal breathing in HO-2/ mice, implicating the enhanced CB chemoreflex in causing apneas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, hyperoxia reduced, whereas hypoxia increased, the apnea index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SH rats also exhibit an augmented CB chemoreflex (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies showed that increased H2S production from CSE is a major signaling mechanism mediating the exaggerated CB activity in HO-2/ mice (5) and SH rats (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, genetic ablation of CSE normalized breathing in HO-2/ mice, and pharmacologic blockade of CSE by l-PAG was equally effective in preventing apneas in both HO-2null mice and SH rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same doses of l-PAG that normalized breathing also reduced CB activity, suggesting that the CB is a major site of l-PAG action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we cannot rule out the possibility that l-PAG also affects CSE activity in brainstem neurons (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the generation of H2S from cysteine, CSE also catalyzes the conversion of cystathionine to cysteine (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CB activity is unaffected by cysteine at concentrations as high as 100 µM, whereas an H2S donor leads to robust CB activation at concentrations as low as 30 µM (3), indicating that CSE-derived H2S, rather than cysteine, is the reaction product that mediates CB activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings suggest that activation of the CB by CSE-derived H2S, and the resulting chemoreflex, drives apneas in rodents with reduced CO levels due to impaired HO-2 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CB has been proposed to drive central apneas (20, 21), but our results suggest that the CB chemoreflex may contribute to both central and obstructive apneas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How might an augmented CB reflex contribute to obstructive apnea, which occurs due to physical obstruction of the upper airway, often due to decreased tone of the tongue muscle?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced CB chemoreflex may initially result in central apneas that then secondarily lead to obstruction of the upper airway due to reduced muscle tone of the tongue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, a recent study found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) disrupt transmission between neurons responsible for respiratory rhythm and the hypoglossal motor neurons controlling tongue muscle tone in mice that were exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia to simulate central apneas (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because increased CB activity leads to increased ROS levels in the central nervous system (33), CB-stimulated ROS signaling may disrupt neural control of the tongue, leading to obstructive apnea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from the CB chemoreflex, whether abnormal upper airway anatomy also contributes to the obstructive apnea in HO-2/ mice remains to be investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current standards of care for patients with obstructive and central apnea are continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (3436) and adaptive servo-ventilation (37, 38), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a substantial number of obstructive apnea patients do not respond to CPAP therapy, and many find CPAP difficult to tolerate (27, 39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adaptive ventilation in heart failure patients was associated with a mortality rate of 30%, with no demonstrable benefits for central apnea (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that current treatment options are suboptimal for normalizing breathing in sleep apnea patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a CO donor prevented apneas in HO-2null mice, its therapeutic potential is limited by a short half-life and likely increase in met-hemoglobin levels in arterial blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to HO-2null mice, HO-2/CSE double-null mice displayed a remarkable absence of apneas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike WT mice, exposure of CSE-null mice to chronic intermittent hypoxia to simulate apneas did not cause enhanced CB activity and hypertension (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be emphasized that CSE-null mice show normal CB responses to hypercapnia (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, genetic alteration resulting in long-term inhibition of CSE activity seems to be a well-tolerated and effective means of preventing apneas in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results suggest that pharmacologic targeting of the CB with a CSE inhibitor, such as l-PAG, might prevent apneas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, l-PAG reduced the number of obstructive and central apneas, as well as hypopneas, in a dose-dependent and reversible manner in HO-2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, l-PAG exhibited efficacy after either oral and i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response to l-PAG was rapid and reversible and did not result in overt toxicity within the dose range tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these observations provide proof-of-concept for the therapeutic potential of CSE inhibitors, the doses of l-PAG that were required to normalize breathing were relatively high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, future studies are needed to develop more potent CSE inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, pharmacologic modulation of the CB chemoreflex by an inhibitor of H2S synthesis, as shown in the present study, has the potential to significantly improve the clinical management of sleep apnea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sleep apnea is a multifactorial respiratory disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from an inherently hyperactive CB chemoreflex due to HO-2 loss of function, sleep apnea can occur as a result of abnormal upper airway anatomy or dysfunctional central CO2 chemoreceptors (24, 43) and secondary to a number of major medical conditions, including heart failure (44), renal failure (45), stroke (46), and diabetes/metabolic syndrome (4749).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be determined whether blockade of the CB chemoreflex with CSE inhibitors also normalizes breathing in patients with sleep apnea due to these other etiologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preparation_of_Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Chicago and were performed on age- and body-weightmatched male and female WT (C57/BL6; Charles River) and HO-2/ mice (colony maintained by S. H. Snyder), as well as WKY and SH rats (Charles River) unless otherwise noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HO-2 and CSE double-knockout mice were created by initially crossing HO-2/ females with CSE/ males (from R. Wang, Department of Biology, Laurentian University, Sudbury, ON, Canada).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_Breathing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Breathing was continuously monitored under room air from 1000 to 1600 h by whole-body plethysmography, at ambient temperature maintained at 25 ± 1 °C as described (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apneas and hypopneas were scored by two individuals who were blinded to genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The breathing irregularity score was determined by the following formula: absolute (TTOTn  TTOTn-1)/(TTOTn+1) × 100%, where TTOT represents total duration of a breath as described (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Echocardiography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in mice anesthetized with 1.5% (vol/vol) isoflurane in oxygen using an ultrasound imaging system (VisualSonics 770).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fractional shortening (FS) was calculated from the equation: FS = (EDD  ESD)/EDD × 100%, where EDD is the end-disastolic dimension and ESD is the end-systolic dimension of the left ventricle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EEG_and_Electromyogram  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electrodes for monitoring EEG and nuchal electromyogram (EMG) were implanted in mice that were anesthetized by i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (9 mg/kg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EEG/EMG signals along with breathing were recorded for 6 h. The data were collected using PowerLab 8/35 (AD Instruments) and scored off-line with commercial software (RemLogic) in a 10-s epoch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_Respiratory_Muscle_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stainless steel electrodes were placed in the inspiratory intercostal muscles of mice anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five days after the surgery, breathing and respiratory muscle EMG activity were recorded for 6 h using PowerLab 8/35 (AD Instruments) and scored off-line with commercial software (RemLogic).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ex_Vivo_CB_Recording  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sensory nerve activity was recorded from CBs that were harvested from anesthetized mice as previously described (3, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensory nerve responses to hypoxia were monitored for 3 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pO2 in the medium was determined by a blood gas analyzer (ABL 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypoxic response was measured as the difference between the sensory nerve activity at baseline and during hypoxia ( impulses per second).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

H2S_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissue homogenates were prepared from freshly perfused mouse liver to measure H2S generation from CSE or CBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H2S was measured using the methylene blue assay as described previously (3, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  l-cysteine was used as the substrate for the CSE-derived H2S assay whereas l-cysteine and homocysteine were used as substrates to assess CBS-derived H2S, as described previously (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H2S concentrations were calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 71,089 M1cm1 at 670 nm and expressed as nmol per h per mg of protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All data are reported as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated in the figure legends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis was performed with either one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures followed by post hoc Tukeys test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2 test was used for analysis of the distribution of apneas and hypopneas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MannWhitney test was used to analyze normalized data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All P values of less_than0.05 were considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
