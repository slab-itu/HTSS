TRiC subunits enhance BDNF axonal transport and rescue striatal atrophy in Huntingtons disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Degeneration of the corticostriatal circuit is a key neuropathological and clinical feature of Huntingtons disease (HD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To define disease mechanisms and explore treatments, we recreated the corticostriatal circuit in microfluidic chambers using neurons from the BACHD mouse model of HD and WT controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that expression of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) induced defects in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transport in BACHD cortical axons that resulted in atrophy of striatal target neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introducing subunits of the cytosolic chaperonin T-complex 1 (TCP-1) ring complex (TRiC) into BACHD cortical neurons reduced mHTT, rescued defects in BDNF transport, and normalized the size of striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings encourage studies to explore a role for TRiC reagents as possible treatments for HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Corticostriatal atrophy is a cardinal manifestation of Huntingtons disease (HD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanism(s) by which mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein contributes to the degeneration of the corticostriatal circuit is not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recreated the corticostriatal circuit in microfluidic chambers, pairing cortical and striatal neurons from the BACHD model of HD and its WT control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were reduced synaptic connectivity and atrophy of striatal neurons in cultures in which BACHD cortical and striatal neurons were paired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these changes were prevented if WT cortical neurons were paired with BACHD striatal neurons; synthesis and release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from WT cortical axons were responsible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these findings, there was a marked reduction in anterograde transport of BDNF in BACHD cortical neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subunits of the cytosolic chaperonin T-complex 1 (TCP-1) ring complex (TRiC or CCT for chaperonin containing TCP-1) have been shown to reduce mHTT levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both CCT3 and the apical domain of CCT1 (ApiCCT1) decreased the level of mHTT in BACHD cortical neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cortical axons, they normalized anterograde BDNF transport, restored retrograde BDNF transport, and normalized lysosomal transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, treating BACHD cortical neurons with ApiCCT1 prevented BACHD striatal neuronal atrophy by enhancing release of BDNF that subsequently acts through tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor on striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are evidence that TRiC reagent-mediated reductions in mHTT enhanced BDNF delivery to restore the trophic status of BACHD striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Corticostriatal_Atrophy_in_HD_Was_Recapitulated_in_Microfluidic_Chambers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although dysregulation of BDNF trafficking and signaling contributes to neurodegeneration in HD (12, 29), the underlying cellular and molecular events are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore how mHTT affects BDNF signaling in HD, we used microfluidic chambers to recreate the vulnerable corticostriatal circuit (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first established that striatal neuron atrophy and reduced synaptic connectivity, well-recognized features of HD (30), were recapitulated in BACHD corticostriatal cultures (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When cocultured with BACHD cortical neurons, BACHD striatal neurons were significantly smaller (74.14 ± 2.67 m2) than when WT striatal neurons (92.89 ± 2.25 m2) were cocultured with WT cortical neurons (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the size of BACHD striatal neurons was markedly increased when cocultured with WT cortical neurons (94.22 ± 3.02 m2) (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, BACHD cortical neurons were deficient in supporting BACHD striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ask if changes in synaptic connectivity were recapitulated, we set up four cortical-striatal cocultures (WT-WT, WT-BACHD, BACHD-BACHD, and BACHD-WT) and immunostained them for synaptophysin and PSD95 (Pierce) in the striatal chamber at days in vitro (DIV)14 (Fig 1 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency of colocalization of synaptophysin and PSD95 was significantly lower in BACHD-BACHD (0.26 ± 0.01) and BACHD-WT (0.27 ± 0.01) than in WT-WT (0.32 ± 0.01) cocultures (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT-BACHD coculture (0.32 ± 0.02), the measure was equivalent to the measure in WT-WT culture (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, reduced synaptic connectivity in the BACHD cortical-striatal cocultures was prevented when WT cortical neurons were paired with BACHD striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anterograde_BDNF_Transport_from_Cortical_Axons_Supported_Striatal_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BDNF, provided through anterograde axonal transport in cortical neurons (11, 31), regulates the size of striatal neurons (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDNF deficits contribute to HD pathogenesis (31, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ask if the axonal supply of BDNF from BACHD cortical neurons to striatal neurons was deficient, we first assessed BDNF responsivity of WT and BACHD striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By frequently changing culture medium, we eliminated a possible autocrine effect of trophic factors secreted by these neurons, including the unlikely possibility that BDNF itself was secreted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following starvation for 48 h, we assessed responses to BDNF (1100 ng/mL) for 48 h (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of BDNF, the sizes of both WT (75.82 ± 1.86 m2) and BACHD (83.84 ± 2.56 m2) striatal neurons were similar to BACHD neurons cocultured with BACHD cortical neurons (Fig 2B versus Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDNF treatment at concentrations as low as 1 ng/mL markedly increased the soma size for both WT and BACHD neurons (34) (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of added BDNF, there was no evident difference in the viability of WT versus BACHD striatal neurons (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test a role for cortical neuron BDNF in supporting striatal neurons further, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown against BDNF in WT cortical neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knockdown efficiency and specificity of the siRNA were confirmed (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When WT cortical neurons were treated with BDNF siRNA, the average size of WT striatal neurons in the coculture was 75.24 ± 2.45 m2, a value equivalent to the value in BACHD cocultures (Fig 2C versus Fig 1D), and significantly smaller than the WT control (92.89 ± 2.25 m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT cortical-BACHD striatal neuron coculture, the effect of the BDNF siRNA was even more striking; BACHD striatal neuron size (60.99 ± 1.70 m2) was even smaller than when cocultured with BACHD cortical neurons (Fig 2C versus Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control siRNA had no significant effect on either WT (87.39 ± 3.30 m2) or BACHD (82.22 ± 3.78 m2) striatal neuron size (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that BDNF synthesis is required for WT cortical neurons to rescue BACHD striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next tested if BDNF release from cortical axons was required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied a mouse monoclonal BDNF neutralizing antibody, BDNF9, (35, 36) at a 1:500 or 1:100 dilution to both the cortical and striatal compartments for 48 h before measuring neuron size (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT-WT cocultures, WT striatal neurons had significantly smaller soma sizes (85.93 ± 1.47 m2 and 86.03 ± 1.37 m2 at 1:500 and 1:100, respectively) than nontreated neurons (96.10 ± 1.81 m2) (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT-BACHD cocultures, the reduction in striatal soma size was 82.20 ± 2.15 m2 at 1:500 dilution and 80.61 ± 1.70 m2 at 1:100 dilution, significantly smaller than control cultures (96.94 ± 1.86 m2) (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the siRNA knockdown experiments, these results suggest that BDNF released from cortical axons following anterograde axonal transport regulates striatal neuron size (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BDNF_Anterograde_Axonal_Transport_Was_Impaired_in_BACHD_Cortical_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if BACHD neurons are deficient in anterograde axonal transport of BDNF, we measured transport in microfluidic chambers (38, 39) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT or BACHD cortical neurons at DIV5 were transfected with BDNF-enhanced GFP (eGFP) for 48 h. Axonal transport of BDNF-eGFP was recorded for 120 s (one frame per second).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Processive stop-and-go anterograde axonal movement of BDNF-eGFP puncta predominated, but with some retrograde movement and pausing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDNF-eGFP transport was analyzed in kymographs (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The instantaneous velocity of BDNF puncta in WT neurons was 1.40 ± 0.24 m/s, significantly greater than in BACHD neurons (0.97 ± 0.13 m/s) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDNF puncta that appeared to stall, or switched direction, resulting in a distance traveled less_than0.2 m/s, were counted as pauses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 94% of BDNF puncta in BACHD neurons paused as compared with only 30% in WT neurons (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the duration of pausing was not significantly different (Table 1), the decrease in instantaneous speed and more frequent pausing resulted in decreased average velocity in BACHD neurons (0.45 ± 0.15 m/s) versus 1.18 ± 0.18 m/s for WT neurons (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, BDNF anterograde axonal transport was significantly impaired in BACHD cortical axons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TRiC_Subunit(s)_and_ApiCCT1_Reduced_mHTT_in_PC12_Cells_and_Cortical_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent findings have shown individual subunits of TRiC (i.e., CCTs) are able to reduce mHTT in yeast (22) and N2A cells (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ask if TRiC subunits or TRiC-derived proteins would engage mHTT in BACHD neurons, we first expressed each of the eight human CCT subunits, C-terminally tagged with mCherry, in PC12 cells as well as in rat embryonic day 18 (E18) cortical neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most CCT subunits showed diffuse red fluorescence in PC12 cells (Fig S3A), and in neurons, the proteins were detected in both cell bodies and neurites (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we examined if CCT subunit expression affected the levels of Htt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PC12 cells, CCT3 and CCT5 levels were robust, with lesser levels detected for the other CCTs (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells cotransfected with wtHttQ25-GFP and individual CCT subunits showed little, if any, effect on wtHttQ25-GFP levels (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When cotransfected with mHTTQ97-GFP, soluble mHTTQ97-GFP levels were reduced in cells expressing individual CCT subunits, particularly CCT1-, CCT3-, CCT5-, CCT7-, and CCT8-mCherry, but not in cells expressing mCherry alone (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, expressing individual CCT subunits reduced mHTT in PC12 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if this effect was also true in primary neurons, due to its robust expression in PC12 cells, we transfected BACHD cortical neurons with CCT3 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-eight hours after transfection, we immunostained BACHD neurons with MAB1574 antibody (Millipore), which specifically recognizes mHTT, but not wtHtt (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CCT3-expressing BACHD cortical neurons, there was a marked decrease in mHTT signal (44.97 ± 2.55%) compared with nontransfected neurons (Fig 3 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a potential TRiC reagent, we tested the 14-kDa ApiCCT1; this protein entered the cytosolic and nuclear compartments of cells (26) and inhibited mHTT aggregation in vitro (20, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BACHD cortical neurons treated with 2.5 M ApiCCT1 for 48 h showed a marked decrease in mHTT signal in comparison to controls (46.02 ± 4.10%; Fig 3 A, C, and D); ApiCCT1 treatment had no significant effect on the size of cortical neurons (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantitate mHTT in BACHD cortical neurons, we performed immunoblotting assays with the MAB1574 antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of mHTT was significantly decreased in neurons treated either with CCT3 lentivirus for 5 d (61.47 ± 21.45%; Fig 3F) or with 2.5 M ApiCCT1 for 2 d (48.52 ± 24.64%; Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The responses to both CCT3 and ApiCCT1 were dose-dependent (Fig 3F), providing evidence that increased delivery of these reagents resulted in increased efficacy in reducing mHTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In view of the fact that no significant changes were detected in the mRNAs for mouse Htt or human mHTT in BACHD cortical neurons expressing CCT3 or treated with ApiCCT1 (Fig S5), we conclude that these reagents had an impact on mHTT at the protein level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine if exogenous ApiCCT1 entered primary cortical neurons, mouse cortical neurons were treated with 1 M ApiCCT1 for 48 h, followed by treatment with proteinase K (PK) to remove cell surface proteins (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total extract/lysate (T), cytoplasmic fraction (C), and nuclear fraction (N) were generated and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, ApiCCT1 was largely eliminated in the total extract by PK treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, ApiCCT1 was found in both the cytosolic and nuclear fractions following PK treatment, indicating that exogenous ApiCCT1 gained access to the neuronal cytosol and nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CCT3_and_ApiCCT1_Normalized_BDNF_Anterograde_Transport  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the finding that CCT3 and ApiCCT1 reduced mHTT, we reasoned that these TRiC reagents might reduce deficits in anterograde axonal BDNF transport in BACHD cortical neurons (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative kymographs of CCT3-transfected BACHD neurons showed that BDNF-eGFP transport was similar to transport in WT neurons (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most noticeably, there were fewer pauses and a marked decrease in to-and-fro movement (Fig 2E versus Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These improvements were also seen following ApiCCT1 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BACHD neurons transfected with mCherry, instantaneous velocity (0.97 ± 0.13 m/s) was lower than in WT neurons expressing mCherry (1.40 ± 0.24 m/s); the change was significant by Students t test (Table 1), but not by Dunnetts multiple comparisons test (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expressing CCT3 in BACHD neurons resulted in an increase in instantaneous velocity of 1.72 ± 0.20 m/s, equivalent to WT neurons (Fig 4C), representing a significant improvement compared with BACHD neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treating BACHD neurons with 2.5 M ApiCCT1 for 2 d also resulted in a significant increase in instantaneous velocity to 1.47 ± 0.09 m/s (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of pausing events was significantly reduced in CCT3- and ApiCCT1-treated BACHD neurons to levels close to the control (Fig 4C); CCT3- or ApiCCT1-treated BACHD neurons also exhibited shorter pauses (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average velocities of BACHD neurons expressing CCT3 (1.29 ± 0.24 m/s) or ApiCCT1-treated (1.03 ± 0.08 m/s) were significantly improved and no longer different from WT neurons (Fig 4C), suggesting that CCT3 and ApiCCT1 blunted the impact of mHTT on anterograde BDNF transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ApiCCT1_Prevented_Atrophy_of_BACHD_Striatal_Neurons_Through_BDNF_Delivery_and_TrkB_Signaling_in_Striatal_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test if ApiCCT1 effects on anterograde trafficking of BDNF would have an impact on the BACHD corticostriatal circuit, we applied 2.5 M ApiCCT1 to the cortical compartment as illustrated in Fig 4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4D shows that BACHD striatal soma size was increased significantly from 74.14 ± 2.67 m2 to 86.50 ± 2.08 m2, 93% of soma size for WT striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ApiCCT1 largely prevented somal atrophy of BACHD striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ask if increasing BDNF in cortical neurons would also increase the size of striatal neurons, we added exogenous BDNF to the cortical compartment to increase BDNF available through transcytosis and anterograde transport (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exogenous BDNF slightly increased soma size to 81.21 ± 1.32 m2 (Fig 4D), but the increase was not significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, adding BDNF and ApiCCT1 together appeared to exert a synergistic effect; striatal soma size was increased to 106.4 ± 1.57 m2, a value even greater than for WT striatal neurons (92.89 ± 2.25 m2) (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that ApiCCT1 acted to increase BDNF release from cortical axons, we added exogenous ApiCCT1 to the cortical compartment and added the BDNF neutralizing antibody to the striatal compartment (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with Fig 4D, treatment of ApiCCT1 alone rescued the striatal soma deficit in BACHD-BACHD coculture; ApiCCT1 treatment had no significant effect in WT-WT and WT-BACHD cocultures (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, in the presence of the anti-BDNF antibody, ApiCCT1 treatment no longer restored striatal soma size in BACHD-BACHD cocultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the BDNF antibody alone significantly reduced the size of striatal neuron somas in WT-WT, WT-BACHD, and BACHD-BACHD cocultures, demonstrating again that BDNF release from cortical axons regulates striatal neuron size, as in Fig 2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that ApiCCT1 acted through BDNF release from cortical axons to regulate striatal neuron size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ask if the effect of ApiCCT1 on striatal soma size was dependent on TrkB-mediated signaling, we applied a TrkB antagonist, ANA-12 (Sigma-Aldrich) (42), in the striatal compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment with ANA-12 blocked BDNF-induced phosphorylation of pTrkB (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in size due to ApiCCT1, as well as the increase in size due to both ApiCCT1 and BDNF, was abolished in the presence of ANA-12 (72.48 ± 0.77 m2 and 80.47 ± 1.49 m2, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, TRiC reagents acted via BDNF delivery and TrkB-mediated signaling to support the trophic status of striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Impaired_Retrograde_BDNF_Transport_in_BACHD_Cortical_Neurons_Was_Improved_by_CCT3_and_ApiCCT1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Retrograde axonal transport of BDNF and BDNF signaling plays a key role in regulating the genomic and cellular events that support the interaction of many neurons with their postsynaptic targets (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDNF released by cortical axons in striatum binds to TrkB receptors on cortical axons to support retrograde signaling to these neurons (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked if retrograde axonal transport of BDNF was also compromised in BACHD neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As depicted in the schematic of the microfluidic chamber (Fig 5A), WT or BACHD cortical neurons were plated in the cell body compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Axons grew into the axonal compartment within 57 d. Quantum dot-conjugated BDNF (QD-BDNF) (38) was used to examine BDNF retrograde transport in cortical axons with or without TRiC reagent treatment (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative kymographs are shown (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In BACHD cortical neurons, the mean retrograde instantaneous velocity was 0.94 ± 0.05 m/s, significantly lower than in WT cortical neurons (1.42 ± 0.08 m/s) (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if CCT3 or ApiCCT1 would normalize retrograde BDNF transport in BACHD cortical neurons, cells were transduced with a lentivirus encoding CCT3 or were treated with ApiCCT1 (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expressing CCT3 in the BACHD neurons resulted in an increase of mean instantaneous velocity to 1.36 ± 0.07 m/s, a value equivalent to the value in WT neurons (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When BACHD cortical neurons were pretreated with 2.5 M ApiCCT1, BDNF instantaneous velocity was increased (1.25 ± 0.07 m/s) to values equivalent to WT neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pausing and to-and-fro movement were more common in BACHD than WT neurons, with 84% for BACHD compared with 46% for WT neurons (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to BACHD neurons, ApiCCT1-treated BACHD neurons showed less pausing (65%), whereas CCT3 had little effect (87%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5D, in BACHD neurons, pauses averaged 25.2 ± 3.9 s, a value significantly greater than for WT neurons (13.0 ± 1.9 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with CCT3 or ApiCCT1 significantly reduced pausing to 16.9 ± 1.9 s and 8.8 ± 1.1 s, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The average retrograde velocity in BACHD neurons was 0.72 ± 0.05 m/s, significantly lower than in WT neurons (1.38 ± 0.06 m/s) (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expressing CCT3 or adding ApiCCT1 increased this measure in BACHD neurons (0.93 ± 0.08 m/s and 0.98 ± 0.07 m/s, respectively), but it was less than for WT neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incomplete normalization was due, in large part, to the persistence of pausing in treated neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the data show that there is impaired BDNF retrograde axonal transport, with more frequent and longer pauses, in BACHD neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These defects were partially normalized by expression of CCT3 or treatment with ApiCCT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CCT3_Reversed_Deficits_in_Retrograde_Transport_of_BDNF  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ask if BACHD neurons were deficient in retrograde axonal transport before treatment with CCT3 or ApiCCT1, we used a microfluidic culture system with shorter microgrooves (150 m) to allow axons to reach the axonal chamber by DIV4 (i.e., 1 d before the time at which treatments were delivered in earlier studies) (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At DIV4, instantaneous velocity was significantly lower than for axons at DIV7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5F shows there was a deficit in the average velocity of retrograde transport in BACHD cortical axons at DIV4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the absence of a significant change in instantaneous velocity, the reduction in average velocity was explained by a significant increase in pausing in BACHD axons, as shown in Fig 5F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in average velocity in BACHD neurons at DIV7 (48%) was greater than at DIV4 (33%), suggesting progressive disruption of BDNF transport with time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that TRiC reagents reversed defects in retrograde transport of BDNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Impaired_Lysosome_Transport_in_BACHD_Cortical_Neurons_Was_Normalized_by_Expression_of_CCT3_or_CCT5  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Htt has an important role in regulating dynein-based transport of a number of cargoes (4448).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand whether or not axonal trafficking defects in BACHD neurons had an impact on other endocytic cargoes, we examined axonal trafficking of lysosomes in mass cultures of cortical neurons using LysoTracker, which specifically labels lysosomes that appear as red fluorescent puncta (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transport was recorded at one frame per second for 60 s. Representative kymographs are shown in Fig S7B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysosomes moved both retrogradely and anterogradely; instantaneous velocities were calculated to include both anterograde and retrograde movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT processes, lysosomes moved processively and largely in one direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in BACHD processes, much more to-and-fro movement with frequent switching of direction was noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average velocity for lysosome movement in WT processes was 1.20 ± 0.06 m/s (Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BACHD, the same measure was 0.96 ± 0.04 m/s, significantly slower than in WT neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the effect of CCT expression, neurons were transfected with CCT3 in a GFP-containing vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BACHD neurons expressing CCT3, the average instantaneous velocity was 1.14 ± 0.06 m/s, significantly greater than for untreated BACHD processes and not significantly different from WT processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCT5 treatment was also effective, but less so than CCT3 treatment (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, defective trafficking of lysosomes in BACHD neurons was normalized by expressing CCT3 or CCT5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CCT3_Reduced_the_Number_of_Inclusion_Bodies_and_mHTT_in_14A26_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore further the impact of CCT3 on mHTT, we turned to 14A2.6 cells, a PC12 cell line that can be induced by ponasterone A (PA) to produce an eGFP-tagged, truncated form of mHTT carrying 103Qs (mHTTQ103-GFP) (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of each of the CCT subunits in 14A2.6 cells induced significant reductions in the level of insoluble mHTTQ103-GFP, but small changes in the level of the soluble protein (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, virtually all of the CCT subunits reduced the insoluble mHTTQ103-GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test if CCT3 had an impact on mHTT aggregation, we expressed CCT3-mCherry for 48 h before induction of mHTTQ103-GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mCherry-expressing cells, there was diffuse green staining, as well as large green puncta (Fig 6A); the latter marked the presence of mHTTQ103-GFP inclusion bodies (white arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were abundant in mCherry-expressing cells (white arrows); note the overlap of puncta and mCherry signals (Fig 6A, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells expressing CCT3, however, inclusion bodies were much less frequent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCT3-expressing cells (yellow arrows) are largely devoid of inclusion bodies (Fig 6A, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCT5 showed a similar effect (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we quantitated the levels of SDS-resistant Htt inclusion using a filter trap assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6B shows that after induction with PA for 24 h, insoluble mHTTQ103-GFP, as detected with the EM48 antibody (50), was present in the cell lysate (Fig 6B, Lower); noninduced samples showed no mHTT immunostaining (Fig 6B, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells expressing CCT3, insoluble mHTT-GFP was less than in nontransfected or mCherry-transfected cells (P less_than 0.05) (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCT3 expression thus significantly reduced SDS-insoluble mHTT aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure the overall mHTT level in CCT3- or mCherry-expressing cells, transfected 14A2.6 cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells transfected with CCT3-mCherry or mCherry were induced to produce mHTTQ103-GFP and sorted into two bins: P2 (Cy5-positive, due to either mCherry or CCT3) and P3 (Cy5-negative, nontransfected) (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FITC mean fluorescence intensity of P2/P3 represents the intensity of mHTTQ103-GFP as a corrected for transfection efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CCT3-expressing cells, the mHTTQ103-GFP signal was reduced significantly to 78.8 ± 0.07% of the mCherry control (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar result was found in CCT5-expressing cells, where the mHTT level was reduced to 71.8 ± 0.07% (Fig S10 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, CCT3 and CCT5 reduced the overall level of mHTTQ103-GFP in 14A2.6 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We used immunoprecipitation to test if Htt interacted with TRiC subunits using 293 cells expressing wtHttQ25-GFP, mHTTQ97-GFP, or GFP (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both wtHttQ25-GFP and mHTTQ97-GFP interacted with TRiC subunits; in particular, we detected CCT2, CCT3, and CCT5 as well as Hsp70 and Hsp40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was relatively more CCT2, CCT3, and CCT5 bound to mHTTQ97-GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we asked whether the CCT3 subunit promoted mHTT degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We monitored the level of mHTTQ97-GFP in 293 cells expressing either CCT3-mCherry or mCherry alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following cycloheximide treatment to inhibit protein synthesis, mHTTQ97-GFP decreased as early as 1 h in cells expressing CCT3-mCherry, whereas mCherry had no effect (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, CCT3 expression enhanced degradation of mHTTQ97-GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize the mechanism, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was used to treat BACHD neurons that expressed CCT3-mCherry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PolyQ staining of mHTT with MAB1574 was used to quantitate mHTT levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of CCT3-mCherry resulted in a decrease in mHTT (44.97 ± 2.55%) (Fig 3 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of CCT3-mCherry was significantly blocked by MG132; the level of mHTT was 76.25% ± 5.84% of the value without CCT3 treatment (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are evidence that overexpression of individual CCT subunits reduced mHTT levels by enhancing proteasomal degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HD pathogenesis manifests through derangement of diverse cellular functions (4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using microfluidic chambers to recreate the corticostriatal circuit, we discovered that BDNF expression in cortical neurons plays a defining role in the trophic status of striatal neurons and the synapses they form with cortical axons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased BDNF release from BACHD cortical neurons was responsible for atrophy of BACHD striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, overexpressing TRiC subunits or a TRiC subunit domain reduced mHTT levels, countered deficits in BDNF transport, and significantly increased the size of BACHD striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the findings argue that mHTT-mediated disruption of BDNF anterograde transport is physiologically significant and motivate consideration of TRiC-inspired approaches for reducing mHTT levels to counter HD pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recreating the corticostriatal circuit provided evidence that (i) the trophic status of striatal neurons features an essential role for BDNF synthesis and anterograde axonal transport in cortical neurons; (ii) mHTT expression in cortical neurons compromises BDNF transport, resulting in striatal neuron atrophy; (iii) mHTT expression has no effect on the size of cortical neurons; and (iv) absent BDNF, mHTT expression has little, if any, effect on the size or BDNF responsivity of striatal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations show that mHTT affects the trophic status of cortical and striatal neurons differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, in demonstrating that striatal neuron atrophy is due to mHTT expression in cortical neurons, they focus attention on the contributions that cortical neurons make to pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mHTT-induced phenotypes likely emerge in both cortical and striatal neurons (51), and striatal cell-autonomous changes have been documented in BACHD mice (5254).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, an important role for cortical afferents was documented in recent studies in which selective deletion of mHTT in cortical afferents partially restored striatal physiological and behavioral phenotypes (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although atrophy and loss of striatal neurons precede neuropathological changes in cortex in HD (2) cortical neuron functions, including BDNF transport, may be negatively affected before striatal neuron degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A role for BDNF in HD is supported by an extensive literature (810, 29, 32, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies extend these observations by providing evidence that reducing mHTT expression in cortical neurons increased the supply of endogenous BDNF to striatal neurons, significantly improving their trophic status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used TRiC reagents to rescue BDNF delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suggesting that using TRiC may have an impact on HD pathogenesis, (i) wtHtt was found to interact with  greater than 700 cellular proteins, including CCT1 and CCT8 (57), and (ii) a Caenorhabditis elegans screening assay showed that six of eight CCT subunits suppressed mutant huntingtin aggregation (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A technical challenge for using TRiC is that the TRiC complex consists of eight CCT subunits; introducing all eight subunits posed a daunting task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this concern was obviated when Frydman and coworkers (20) showed that a single CCT inhibited mHTT aggregation and reduced Htt-induced toxicity in N2A cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, recent studies showed that the apical domain of CCT1 alone effectively reduced mHTT levels (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that individual CCT subunits reduced mHTTQ97 in PC12 cells and that CCT3 and ApiCCT1 reduced mHTT in BACHD neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting the levels of mHTT to reverse salient features of HD pathogenesis has been suggested by others (5961) and has been supported by elegant studies demonstrating that reducing mHTT expression in BACHD neurons improves HD-relevant phenotypes (6, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work will be needed to define the mechanism(s) by which mHTT induces HD pathogenesis and what role is played by deficits in BDNF transport and signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanism(s) by which CCT3 reduced mHTT implicates the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), as demonstrated by showing that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocked CCT3-mediated degradation of mHTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mHTT species engaged by TRiC reagents and the structure(s) of active TRiC species, whether individual subunits or a TRiC complex, are uncertain, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the ability of ApiCCT1 to reduce mHTT levels, it is possible that individual CCTs have TRiC-like activity by presenting a bound target to the proteasome for degradation (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, our study is evidence that reducing mHTT levels may be sufficient to counter HD pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How mHTT disrupted transport of BDNF-containing organelles is uncertain, but at least two classes were affected: one transported anterogradely containing newly synthesized BDNF and the other a retrogradely transported endosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are perhaps best understood by noting that Htt interacts with both anterograde and retrograde motor proteins (4448, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Htt appears to serve as a scaffolding protein to participate in a complex containing huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1), the anterograde motor kinesin-1, and the dynein/dynactin retrograde motor (4548).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, wtHtt is positioned to play a critical role in regulating transport of many types of organelles (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, dynein appears to regulate movement of most, if not all, cargoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That mHTT disrupts the scaffolding function of wtHtt affords a compelling perspective (47, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further insights may come from studies using CCT3 and apiCCT1 to reduce the mHTT levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
