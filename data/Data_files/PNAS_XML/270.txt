Causal evidence for frontal cortex organization for perceptual decision making  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The frontal cortex has long been understood as the seat of higher level cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent research, however, highlights its role in modulating perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a theoretical framework for frontal involvement in perceptual decision making and test it with the causal technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that progressively rostral regions of frontal cortex are involved in the control of progressively later stages of perceptual decision making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These causal findings are further corroborated by functional MRI and simulations of a dynamic model of decision making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results point to a critical role of the frontal cortex in the control of perceptual processes and reveal its intrinsic organization in support of modulating perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although recent research has shown that the frontal cortex has a critical role in perceptual decision making, an overarching theory of frontal functional organization for perception has yet to emerge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perceptual decision making is temporally organized such that it requires the processes of selection, criterion setting, and evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that exploring this temporal structure would reveal a large-scale frontal organization for perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A causal intervention with transcranial magnetic stimulation revealed clear specialization along the rostrocaudal axis such that the control of successive stages of perceptual decision making was selectively affected by perturbation of successively rostral areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations with a dynamic model of decision making suggested distinct computational contributions of each region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the emergent frontal gradient was further corroborated by functional MRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These causal results provide an organizational principle for the role of frontal cortex in the control of perceptual decision making and suggest specific mechanistic contributions for its different subregions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We designed a task in which the processes of selection, criterion setting, and evaluation could be clearly identified (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On each trial, subjects were instructed to attend selectively to one of two peripheral stimuli (selection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The task was to indicate the orientation (clockwise/counterclockwise) of a grating embedded in noise while adjusting the decision criterion so as to emphasize either speed or accuracy (criterion setting).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After making their choice, subjects indicated their level of confidence (evaluation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each subject received training (day 1), then performed the task during the collection of fMRI data (day 2), and finally received TMS to one of four different sites before performing the same task (days 36; Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the fMRI data, for each subject, we identified three progressively more rostral sites in frontal cortex: putative frontal eye fields (FEFs), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC), as well as the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which served as a control site (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then delivered continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to each of these regions for each subject on different days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cTBS has been demonstrated to produce a decrease in the excitation level in the stimulated cortex (15), likely through processes akin to long-term depression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TMS_Evidence_for_Frontal_Organization_for_Perception  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TMS did not influence overall task performance as measured by overall accuracy, reaction time (RT), or confidence (P  0.05 for all pairwise comparisons between any of the four sites; Table S1), suggesting it is unlikely that frontal cortex is necessary for the low-level visual processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now turn to the frontal cortex involvement in the control of selection, criterion setting, and evaluation processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simulating_the_TMS_Effects_with_a_Dynamic_Model_of_Decision_Making  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results suggest that caudal, middle, and rostral frontal cortex have differential contributions to perceptual decision making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the functional role of each region better, we performed simulations using an adapted model of perceptual decision making introduced by Kepecs et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) and De Martino et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22), wherein evidence is accumulated separately for each of the two choices, and the decision is made when one of the accumulators reaches a bound (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confidence is then assigned as the noise-corrupted difference between the winning and losing accumulators (e, the difference in evidence; Fig 3A) such that higher difference indicates higher confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical parameters of the model are (i) the drift rate, which determines how quickly evidence accumulates for each choice; (ii) the bound, which determines how much evidence is needed to make a decision; and (iii) the confidence noise, which determines the strength of the association between confidence and accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This modeling framework provides a natural way to operationalize the processes of selection, criterion setting, and evaluation using the above parameters (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, selection is defined as the process of enhancing the sensitivity for one stimulus over another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the framework of our model, this process is equivalent to boosting the drift rate for the correct choice for the attended, but not the unattended, stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the requirement to set the response criterion according to the speed/accuracy instructions is naturally modeled by an adjustment of the bound to be higher for accuracy compared with speed instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we observed significant variability in the metacognitive scores (from 0.58 to 0.83 in the fMRI session), which points to the existence of confidence noise that varies between subjects (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confidence noise controls how tightly the metacognitive ratings follow a subjects decision accuracy such that a greater amount of this type of noise leads to lower metacognitive scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our simulations demonstrated that changes to these three parameters of the model can qualitatively reproduce our frontal TMS effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the smaller difference in RT between attended and unattended targets after FEF TMS is reproduced by a smaller difference in the drift rate between attended and unattended conditions (red arrows in Fig 3A and results in Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the smaller difference in RT between accuracy and speed instructions after DLPFC TMS is reproduced by a smaller difference in the bound between speed and accuracy focus (blue arrows in Fig 3A and results in Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the unexpected finding of higher metacognitive score after aPFC TMS is reproduced by a decrease in the confidence noise (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations assumed that TMS to each of these regions affected only a single parameter of the model, which is why the simulated data do not perfectly reflect the empirical results (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the metacognitive score after DLPFC TMS increased compared with our control site, but this increase is not reflected in the simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, what is important here is the demonstration that the TMS effects on the processes of selection, criterion setting, and evaluation can be naturally understood computationally in the context of our model of dynamic decision making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Frontal_Organization_Corroborated_by_fMRI  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our TMS results and model simulation were consistent with our predictions that progressively rostral frontal regions are involved in progressively later processing stages during perceptual decision making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because, as we noted above, the three stages are temporally organized, another prediction is that more rostral frontal regions will become active later in the course of each trial of our task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this prediction by using the fMRI data from day 2 to characterize the activity in frontal cortex during the (i) instruction, (ii) stimulus/perceptual judgment, and (iii) confidence epochs of the task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not claim that the selection, criterion setting, and evaluation processes occur exclusively during the instruction, stimulus/perceptual judgment, and confidence epochs of the task, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, a temporal hierarchy exists whereby the stimulus needs first be selected before decision criteria can be applied, and both of these processes need to occur before evaluation can take place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This temporal hierarchy implies that each process should peak later than the previous one, even in the absence of one-to-one correspondence between the three processes and the three task epochs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design of our task was optimized for the TMS effects rather than this particular analysis, but the results confirmed our prediction nonetheless.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we found a clear rostrocaudal gradient such that the activity in progressively rostral frontal regions peaked during progressively later epochs of our task (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first examined the brain activity during each of the three epochs of the task (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole-brain activation patterns for each task epoch are shown and discussed in greater detail in Fig S1 (we note that the pattern of activity in the left hemisphere was similar to the right hemisphere, and we provide a link to complete unthresholded maps; Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we focus on the results in the frontal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that frontal cortex activity during the instruction epoch was mostly constrained to a caudal region, activity during the stimulus/perceptual judgment epoch extended from caudal to midlateral frontal regions, and activity during the confidence epoch extended across the entire lateral surface of the frontal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Critically, we found that progressively rostral frontal regions were activated maximally during progressively later task epochs (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we observed a significant interaction between region (FEF, DLPFC, aPFC) and task epoch (instruction, stimulus/perceptual judgment, confidence) [F(4,40) = 22.16, P less_than 0.00001, repeated measures ANOVA].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, FEF activity was greatest early in each trial, DLPFC activity was greatest in the middle of the trial, and aPFC activity was greatest at the end of the trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most caudal frontal region, FEF, was more active during the instruction [t(20) = 2.09, P = 0.049, d = 0.46] and stimulus/perceptual judgment [t(20) = 4.31, P = 0.0003, d = 0.94] epochs, compared with the confidence epoch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FEF activity during the instruction and stimulus/perceptual judgment epochs was not significantly different (P = 0.99), which may be explained by the observation that FEF is responsive to stimulus presentation (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The middle frontal region, DLPFC, was more active during the stimulus/perceptual judgment epoch compared with both the instruction [t(20) = 4.52, P = 0.0002, d = 0.99] and confidence [t(20) = 2.33, P = 0.03, d = 0.51] epochs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the most rostral frontal region, aPFC, was less active during the instruction epoch compared with both the stimulus/perceptual judgment [t(20) = 7.32, P = 4 * 107, d = 1.6] and confidence [t(20) = 6.88, P = 1*106, d = 1.5] epochs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aPFC activations during the stimulus/perceptual judgment and confidence epochs were not significantly different (P = 0.33), which may be partly due to the evaluation process starting immediately after making the perceptual decision internally, which is likely a few hundred milliseconds before the button press that we used as an external indicator of the end of the stimulus/perceptual judgment epoch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The above results were obtained by creating separate generalized linear model (GLM) models for each task epoch (SI Materials and Methods) to identify the full extent of activity during each task epoch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a control analysis, we analyzed all three task epochs in the same GLM and obtained very similar results (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Session_Sequence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiment took place over 6 d. On day 1, subjects received behavioral training with the task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the data from that day to exclude subjects who were not able to follow the attention or speed/accuracy instructions (as indicated by roughly equal RTs for attended/unattended stimuli or speed/accuracy instructions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data from this day were not analyzed further, so any biases induced from this selection procedure did not affect our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 2, subjects performed the same task in the MRI scanner to allow for the identification of the regions of interest (ROIs) to be targeted with TMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, on days 36, subjects performed the task after receiving TMS to one of four different regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of them were ROIs in the frontal cortex: putative FEF, DLPFC, and aPFC, and the final one was a control region: S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The order of the stimulation sites in days 36 was pseudorandomized across subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All sessions were separated by at least a week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Task  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subjects were instructed to fixate on a small central square throughout the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each trial began with a 1,000-ms presentation of the attentional and speed/accuracy instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The attentional cue was an arrow (length = 3°, height = 1°) that indicated the side (left/right) to which subjects should attend (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The speed/accuracy instruction consisted of the word FAST or ACCURATE presented in Arial font.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To help subjects follow the speed/accuracy instruction, when the word FAST was presented, both the word and the arrow cue were colored in green, whereas when the word ACCURATE was presented, both the word and the arrow cue were colored in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two stimuli were then presented for 200 ms, while the cues were still being displayed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimuli were gray-scale gratings (diameter = 3°) displayed 9° to the left and right of fixation and consisting of a noisy background composed of uniformly distributed intensity values (8% contrast) on top of which we added a grating (0.5 cycles per degree).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each grating was tilted at 45° or 135° from vertical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimuli were then replaced by a postcue in the form of a white circle (diameter = 4°) that appeared around the location of one of the gratings but without inducing backward masking (due to its larger size).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects task was to indicate the tilt of the grating in the postcued location (clockwise vs. counterclockwise from vertical).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The postcue was presented at the attended location on 66.67% of the trials (valid cue trials) and at the unattended location on the remaining 33.33% of the trials (invalid cue trials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were informed about this contingency and encouraged to deploy their attention accordingly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the decision was made via a button press, subjects indicated with a second button press their confidence using a four-point scale, where 1 was defined as low confidence and 4 was defined as high confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were instructed to attempt to use the whole confidence scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During behavioral testing (days 1 and 36), subjects used the 14 keys on a computer keyboard, whereas they used a button box in the MRI scanner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feedback was provided during training (discussed below) but not during the actual experimental sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On each day of testing, subjects completed four runs, each consisting of four blocks of 30 trials for a total of 480 trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were given 15-s breaks between blocks and unlimited breaks between runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fully counterbalanced the speed/accuracy instruction, the direction of the attention (left/right), the validity of the attentional cue (valid/invalid), and the orientation of the postcued stimulus (clockwise/counterclockwise) over the 480 trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of the non-postcued stimulus was chosen randomly on each trial, and was thus also independent of all of the above factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subjects received extensive training on day 1 and shorter additional training at the beginning of days 26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 1, subjects completed 267 trials during which the different components of the task were introduced and the contrast of the stimuli was gradually adjusted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trial-by-trial feedback was provided, except during the last 30 trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast was adjusted during this training session, as well as during the 480 test trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrast was then fixed for days 26 (mean = 8.4%, SD = 2.7%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 2, participants were given two blocks of 24 trials of practice outside the scanner, as well as an additional complete run of 120 trials in the scanner that included trial-by-trial feedback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, on days 36, participants were given one block of 48 trials of practice with no feedback before receiving TMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stimuli were generated using Psychophysics Toolbox (38) in MATLAB (MathWorks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the behavioral testing (days 1 and 36), subjects were seated in a dim room 60 cm away from the computer monitor (19-inch display, 1,024 × 768 pixel resolution, 60-Hz refresh rate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the fMRI experiment (day 2), participants were 57 cm away from a screen mounted to the rf coil where the stimuli were back-projected via a liquid crystal display (LCD) projector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lights in the scanner room were turned off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eye tracking was performed at 60 Hz with an Avotec system (Arrington Research) inside the scanner during day 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data showed that subjects were able to maintain fixation and that there was no difference in eye position with attentional or speed/accuracy instruction (P  0.2 for both).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the TMS sessions (days 36), eye tracking was not possible for logistical reasons but subjects eyes were recorded using a desktop video camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were visually inspected for the presence of large eye movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

fMRI_Acquisition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MRI scanning was done at the Henry H. Wheeler, Jr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain Imaging Center at the University of California, Berkeley.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired on a Siemens TIM/Trio 3 T MRI System using a 12-channel receive-only head coil, with a single-shot gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence [repetition time (TR) = 2,000 ms; echo time (TE) = 24 ms; 37 descending slices; voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm; slice thickness = 3.5 mm; interslice gap = 0.50 mm; flip angle = 70°; field of view = 224 mm, matrix = 64 × 64, fat suppression and prescan normalization included].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high-resolution T1-weighed structural 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient-echo (MP-RAGE) sequence was also acquired for all subjects [160 slices, slice thickness = 1 mm, TR = 2,300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, flip angle = 9°, matrix = 256 × 256, field of view = 256 mm, inversion time (TI) = 900 ms].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After participants were positioned in the scanner, we acquired a diffusion tensor imaging scan for 10 min while subjects were completing the practice run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then collected four runs of the task (each lasting about 10 min), followed by a 10-min resting state scan and a 5-min structural scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diffusion and resting state scans were not used in the current analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scanner collected two dummy volumes before EPI recording began, but we additionally discarded the first two acquired volumes to ensure scanner equilibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

fMRI_Preprocessing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All analyses were performed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preprocessing consisted of converting the raw DICOM images to NIFTI format, slice timing correction to the onset of the first slice, realignment through rigid-body registration to correct for head motion, coregistration of the functional and anatomical images, segmentation of the anatomical image, normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute space using the gray matter image obtained from the segmentation, interpolation of functional images to 2 × 2 × 2 mm, and smoothing with a Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half-maximum of 4 mm for the individual-level analyses used for defining the ROIs and 8 mm for the group-level analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regressors for the first-level analysis of evoked activity were obtained by convolving the unit impulse time series for each condition with the canonical hemodynamic response function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A first model was used to identify the frontal cortex ROIs that would be targeted later with TMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model included four regressors, reflecting the combination of the attentional cue (valid/invalid) and the speed/accuracy instruction (fast/accurate); thus, each trial was encompassed by exactly one of these regressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each regressors onset coincided with the onset of the cues on the corresponding trial and offset coinciding with subjects first response (mean duration = 1.81 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included six nuisance regressors related to head motion: three regressors related to translation and three regressors related to rotation of the head.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Defining_ROIs_for_TMS_Targeting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used individual task activations to identify FEF and DLPFC in every participant based on the main effect of task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we used the contrast task  background (by taking the average activation of the four task regressors) using P less_than 0.001 uncorrected (for a few subjects, more conservative or liberal thresholds were used).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrast did not consistently reveal activations in aPFC; therefore, we opted to define this site based on previous studies (4, 18, 39) that all converged on a very similar spot in the rostral frontal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, S1 was identified based on its known anatomical location in the postcentral gyrus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All regions were defined in the right hemisphere of the frontal cortex, which is thought to be dominant in perceptual tasks (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The putative FEF was defined as the site of maximal activation near the junction of superior frontal sulcus and ascending limb of precentral sulcus (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average coordinates across our subjects were [x = 28 (SD = 3.9), y = 3.4 (SD = 2.9), z = 51.3 (SD = 4.4)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The putative DLPFC was defined in the midlateral frontal cortex (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cases in which more than one locus of activity was found in that area, we chose the site in the middle frontal gyrus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average coordinates across our subjects were [40.2 (SD = 5.3), 35.7 (SD = 6.3), 27.5 (SD = 8)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, aPFC was defined anatomically at [27 53 25] based on the results in a study by Fleming et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (4), where it was determined that this region is involved in generation of confidence ratings [note that similar coordinates were reported by Fleming et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18) and Yokoyama et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (39)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We created 3-mm spheres for each site and used them to guide the placement of the TMS coil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analyses_of_the_Activity_During_Each_Task_Epoch  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the timing of the involvement of different frontal regions in the perceptual process, we created three additional models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these analyses, we included all 21 subjects who were scanned, regardless of whether they completed all six sessions of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each model included just two regressors: one corresponding to the part of the trial epoch of critical interest and one corresponding to the rest periods between blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the instruction epoch model, the first regressor encompassed the 1-s period when the instructions were presented (onset coincided with cue onset; duration was always 1 s); in the stimulus/perceptual judgment epoch model, the first regressor encompassed the period from stimulus onset until the decision was made (i.e., the first button press; onset coincided with stimulus onset; duration varied on each trial: mean = 0.81 s, SD = 0.22 s), and in the confidence epoch model, the first regressor encompassed the period from when the decision was made until when the confidence was given (i.e., the second button press; onset coincided with first button press; duration varied on each trial: mean = 1.06 s, SD = 0.49 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same six motion regressors as above were also included in each model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast of interest was trial epoch  rest, where trial epoch corresponds to the respective first regressor in each model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-brain contrasts were threshold at P less_than 0.05 family-wise errorcorrected, using a voxel-level threshold of P less_than 0.01 and cluster correction of 244 voxels according to simulations using AlphaSim.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ROI analyses were performed by defining spheres of 5 mm around the average coordinates for FEF, DLPFC, and aPFC reported above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The task that we used was optimized to encompass the maximum number of trials to increase the power for finding TMS effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this task was not optimal for cleanly separating the activity during each task epoch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it was critical that the same task was used in the scanner on day 2 as for the TMS sessions (days 36) because making changes to the task could have shifted the loci of activations, and thus could have resulted in suboptimal localization of the TMS targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although we cannot be sure that a regressor for a given task epoch is not contaminated by the processes occurring during an adjacent task epoch, any pattern of difference that we find (such as what is reported in Fig 4) between different brain regions cannot be due to this limitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another potential limitation for this analysis is the possibility that different ROIs may have different hemodynamic response delays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substantially longer delays for the more anterior sites in the frontal cortex may result in apparent activations that are biased for the later epochs, which is exactly the pattern of the observed results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this issue remains to be fully settled by studies that provide reliable estimates for the hemodynamic delays across areas in the frontal cortex, there are several reasons why we think that differences in the hemodynamic delay are unlikely to have had a major influence on our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, all our areas of interest in the frontal cortex receive blood supply from the same vascular system: the superior branch of the middle cerebral artery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the differences in hemodynamic delay between these areas are likely to be small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, hemodynamic delay differences in early sensory and motor areas (the regions where such delays can be computed most precisely) tend to be up to half a second (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted above, the differences between our areas of interest are likely to be substantially smaller than this value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that each epoch lasted around 1 s, even differences on the order of half a second cannot account for our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an additional control analysis, we included all three task epoch regressors described above in a single GLM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results found were very similar to the main results from the separate GLMs (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we note that the lack of independence between the GLM regressors for each task epoch would only decrease the difference in activity between different task epochs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the pattern of results that we found (activity in rostral regions peaking for later epochs) cannot be explained by correlations between regressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TMS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TMS was delivered with a Magstim Super Rapid Stimulator (Magstim Company Ltd.) connected to two booster modules, using a figure-of-eight coil with a diameter of 70 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a standard offline TMS sequence called cTBS that is theorized to reduce cortical excitability (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cTBS involves delivering five bursts of three 50-Hz pulses every second for a total of 600 pulses over 40 s. The stimulation was delivered at 80% of the individual motor threshold (resulting in an average of intensity of 35.5%, SD = 2.7% of maximum stimulator output).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No arm, leg, or other movement was elicited by the stimulation of any of our targeted sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We determined the motor threshold immediately before each delivery of cTBS using a method similar to Rahnev et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we first used a hunting procedure to determine the location where suprathreshold single pulses induce maximal hand twitch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, starting at 30% of the maximum stimulator output, we delivered single-pulse TMS until we reached the lowest intensity that resulted in motor-evoked potentials larger than 50 V peak-to-peak in the targeted muscle on five of 10 consecutive trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This intensity was chosen as the participants motor threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout this procedure and subsequent application of cTBS, the main axis of the coil was always oriented at 45° offset from the posterior-anterior direction with the coil handle extending posteriorly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The exact site of stimulation was determined using a frameless stereotaxic localization system (Brainsight; Rogue-Research, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coil was oriented such that the induced magnetic field was orthogonal to the skull.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimenters were highly trained in TMS delivery and generally allowed less than 1 mm and 1° deviation from the target over the course of the 40-s stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unless otherwise specified, analyses were performed in MATLAB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our main question of interest was in investigating the effects of cTBS applied to different frontal sites on measures related to attention, speed/accuracy instructions, and confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a measure of attention, we used the RT difference between attended and unattended stimuli:attention=RTunattendedRTattended.The reasoning is that if TMS interferes with subjects ability to deploy attention to the attended side, then the RT difference between unattended and attended stimuli will decrease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid interactions with speed/accuracy instructions, only trials with instructions to be accurate were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a similar fashion, our measure of successfully following the speed/accuracy (SA) instructions was the RT difference between trials with accuracy and speed focus:SA=RTaccuracyRTspeed.As above, to avoid interaction with attention, we analyzed only trials with valid cuing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, to measure the quality of the confidence ratings, we determined their correspondence to accuracy on a trial-to-trial basis (thus obtaining an estimate of subjects metacognitive capacity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a widely used nonparametric measure, the Type 2 AUC, that plots confidence as a function of task accuracy (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further repeated these analyses using three alternative measures: meta-d (19), the correlation between confidence and accuracy [phi (20)], and the difference between confidence on correct and incorrect trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All measures were computed for each day of TMS stimulation for each subject.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine how TMS affected each of the above measures, we applied linear mixed-effects analysis using the lme4 package (43) in R (R Core Team, 2012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TMS site was included as a fixed effect, whereas an intercept for subjects was entered as a random effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values were obtained for regression coefficients using the car package (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Planned follow-up tests were performed using paired t tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite our methodology of using the data from day 1 to exclude subjects who did not perform the task well, the remaining subjects still exhibited a large variability in their attention, SA, and metacognitive scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, on day 2 (fMRI day), attention varied from 32 ms to 297 ms, whereas SA varied from 30 ms to 1,243 ms. Small values of these parameters indicate that the attentional or speed/accuracy instructions modulated subjects responses only to a small extent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For such cases, it is impossible for TMS to produce a sizeable behavioral effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for this issue, we weighted the parameter values obtained during the TMS days (days 36) by the corresponding parameter value on the fMRI day (day 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this procedure does not carry any inherent bias that will make any particular TMS site appear to produce higher or lower values compared with any other TMS site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All weights were positive, with the exception of a single attention value of 32, which was replaced by a 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These weights, extracted from the corresponding parameter values on the fMRI day, were included in both the linear mixed-effects analyses and the paired t tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact formulas used can be seen in the codes that we provided and are described in detail elsewhere (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the one-sample weighted t test is conducted by computing the weighted mean:weighted=i=1nwixii=1nwiand weighted variance:weighted2=(i=1nwixi2)(i=1nwi)(i=1nwixi)2(i=1nwi)2i=1nwi2,then by computing the weighted SE:SEweighted=weightedN,and, finally, by computing the t statistic:t=weightedSEweighted.The mixed-effects analyses are conducted in an equivalent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, to check for interactions between the site of TMS and measure affected, we performed another linear mixed-effects analysis on the data from all three measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One difficulty for this type of analysis is that these measures were fundamentally different: Two were RT differences, and one was a metacognitive score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to be able to compare these measures directly, we normalized the data from each measure (mean of 0 and SD of 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We entered the TMS site, the measure type, and their interaction as fixed effects and an intercept for subjects as a random effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, by-subject random slopes were included for the effects of TMS site and measure type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that TMS to each of our three different frontal sites affects a corresponding behavioral measure of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sought to account for these effects using simulations based on a dynamic model of decision making that can account for choice, RT, and confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We adapted a simple model used by Kepecs et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) and De Martino et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22), which is a variant of the race models (23) wherein separate accumulators code each possible outcome and the first accumulator that reaches a threshold determines the perceptual decision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we modeled the stimulus on each trial as a normally distributed random variable s(t)  N(tilt, tilt), where the sign and magnitude of tilt are determined by the actual stimulus orientation and the observed level of performance, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence (e) for left (L) and right (R) tilt accumulates according to the following simple rule:eL/R(t)=0tsL/R(t)dt,wheresR(t)={s(t),s(t)00,s(t)less_than0andsL(t)={0,s(t)0s(t),s(t)less_than0.The decision is made when one of the two accumulators eL or eR reaches a boundary .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, confidence is computed as the difference e between the two accumulators at decision time e=|eR(t)eL(t)|.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following De Martino et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22), we included an extra noise term in the confidence rating such that, on every trial, the reported confidence was drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of e: conf = N(e, conf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intuitively, this noise term made the confidence rating less precise, thus reproducing the imperfect metacognitive performance exhibited by our subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the same parameters as Kepecs et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) and De Martino et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22): stim = 1,  = 100, and dt = 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, tilt was set at 0.02 for unattended stimuli and 0.1 for attended stimuli,  was set at 89 for speed instruction (the value of 100 above was used for the accuracy instruction), and conf was set to 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model produced a continuous measure of confidence; to translate it to the 14 scale rating used in the experiment, we used additional criteria C such that a confidence rating of i was given when Ci1eCi, where C0 = 0, C1 = 8, C2 = 16, C3 = 24, and C4 = .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results we obtained were robust to a range of parameter magnitudes, and the exact values above should not be considered as quantitatively precise model fits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We simulated 100,000 trials for each condition from the 4 (TMS site: S1, FEF, DLPFC, aPFC) × 2 (attended vs. unattended) × 2 (speed vs. accuracy instruction) design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation of the results of S1 TMS used the parameters above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the FEF TMS simulations, we used drift rates that were less different between the attended and unattended targets (exact values were 0.042 for unattended targets and 0.072 for attended targets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the DLPFC TMS simulations, we used bounds that were less different between the accuracy and speed instructions (exact values were 90 for speed and 99 for accuracy instructions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, for aPFC TMS simulations, we used lower confidence noise (we set conf to 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of these simulations are displayed in Fig 3 BD, which demonstrates our main point in performing these analyses: namely, that the effects of TMS to the three frontal sites correspond to different parts of the decision-making process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We emphasize that even though we chose the exact values of the parameters to produce an approximate fit to the average data, any similar manipulation would have produced the same pattern of results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite numerous studies demonstrating the involvement of the frontal cortex in various high-level perceptual processes (25), the roles of distinct areas within frontal cortex during perceptual decision making remain underspecified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we provide a principle for frontal cortex functional organization based on the temporal organization of perception in the processes of selection, criterion setting, and evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, convergent evidence from TMS and fMRI demonstrated that there are distinct frontal regions along a rostrocaudal (i.e., anterior-to-posterior) gradient that are necessary for the control of progressively later stages of the perceptual decision-making process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results based on a causal intervention with TMS provide a critical addition to the literature on the contribution of frontal cortex to perceptual decision making that is largely based on correlational studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using correlational techniques, some studies claimed that relatively caudal regions of the frontal cortex are important for some of the later perceptual stages of processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, speed/accuracy signals were found in FEF neurons (24), and confidence signals were found in supplementary eye field neurons (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our study, disruption of caudal frontal cortex function with TMS did not have a significant effect either on speed/accuracy or on confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that these differences are due to interspecies variation in the organization of frontal cortex and/or the substantial difference in the tasks used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another important possibility is that because the perceptual decision was indicated via a saccade in both of these studies, the speed/accuracy and confidence signals were passed to the eye movement effector system but were nevertheless computed in more anterior areas of frontal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility is consistent with a recent study in which monkeys indicated the perceptual decisions using their hands and speed/accuracy signals were present in the primary motor cortex even though it is unlikely that these signals originated there (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More studies that use causal interventions in both humans and monkeys are needed to determine the etiology of the discrepancies between our and these previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The functional gradient revealed in our data has strong implications regarding the general organization of the frontal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A critical mass of studies has suggested the existence of a rostrocaudal gradient in the frontal cortex (1, 710).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these studies differ in the details of the type of processes or representations being linked to each PFC subregion, each proposes a hierarchical organization with more rostral regions involved in the processing of more abstract representations (1, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies, however, have proposed that the lateral frontal cortex is homogeneous in function without a functional gradient (12, 27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This debate is complicated by the correlational nature of most previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, two previous studies of patients with focal brain lesions found causal support for a rostrocaudal gradient in frontal cortex (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current results extend these previous patient studies by providing causal evidence from healthy human subjects in support of a rostrocaudal functional organization of frontal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulations based on a dynamic computational model of perceptual decision making (2123) were able to reproduce the observed empirical TMS effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in the RT advantage for attended stimuli following FEF TMS could be reproduced by decreasing the difference in drift rate between attended and unattended stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, one possibility is that the caudal frontal cortex biases the processing of visual information such that one stimulus is favored over another through a process akin to gain amplification (16, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility is further corroborated by the known connectivity of FEF to early visual areas that respond to the visual stimulus (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in the RT difference between accuracy and speed focus following DLPFC TMS could be reproduced by decreasing the difference in the decision bound between the two conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that DLPFC is involved in the adjustment of the decision criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a role is facilitated by the wide connectivity of DLPFC with higher visual and parietal (as well as premotor and subcortical) areas (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the improved metacognitive performance after aPFC TMS could be reproduced by decreasing the noise term in confidence decisions, consistent with a role of aPFC in metacognitive evaluations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of metacognitive process likely requires communication only with other high-level regions, such as frontal and parietal cortices, which is consistent with the connectivity pattern of aPFC (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, even though our simulations were intended as, and should only be seen as, a proof of concept, they are consistent with a rostrocaudal organization of frontal cortex function in relation to visual perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar idea has been put forth in the context of linking perception with action (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surprisingly, we found improvement in metacognition after aPFC TMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the unexpected nature of this result, it is actually in line with a pair of recent studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first one reported similar metacognitive enhancement after aPFC TMS on a memory task (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second one showed that monkeys with lesions to rostral frontal cortex showed behavioral improvements on certain tasks (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, they remained more focused in exploiting the current task when faced with various interruptions, potentially suggesting a role for rostral frontal cortex in reallocating cognitive resources for new purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, metacognitive impairment after TMS to a more posterior site in middle frontal gyrus has also been reported (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, in our study, average confidence ratings were not affected by aPFC TMS; instead, what was improved was the correspondence between the trial-by-trial confidence ratings and accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several types of explanations have been provided for TMS-induced performance improvements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if TMS suppresses the noise more than the signal, behavioral performance would improve rather than decline (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility is that behavioral performance can improve if TMS disrupts processes that are normally detrimental to the experimental task (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This last explanation also fits with the monkey data discussed above (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In partial support of this last possibility, we previously suggested a role for aPFC in decreasing the amount to which confidence on a previous trial biases the confidence rating on a current trial, a phenomenon dubbed confidence leak (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such confidence leak is likely beneficial in most everyday tasks but is suboptimal in laboratory tasks in which successive trials are independent and the previous stimulus should therefore be ignored during the current decision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional analyses (SI Results) demonstrated that aPFC TMS decreased the amount of confidence leak, which could have contributed to the improvements in metacognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, in the absence of direct neural evidence, each of these explanations remains speculative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the explanation of our finding, it does support a critical role for aPFC in metacognition, and is consistent with the existence of a rostrocaudal gradient in frontal cortex for perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Confidence leak was computed in similar fashion to experiments 3 and 4 in a study by Rahnev et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (37) by taking the absolute value of the Fisher transform of the lag-1 confidence autocorrelation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the analyses on attention, SA, and the metacognitive scores, we performed weighted t tests using as weights the confidence leak scores from the fMRI day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that confidence leak was significantly decreased after aPFC TMS compared with S1 TMS [t(20) = 2.83, P = 0.012], suggesting that TMS to aPFC may have increased the metacognitive scores, in part, by suppressing irrelevant processes, such as the ones that give rise to the phenomenon of confidence leak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Forty-one subjects were tested in an initial screening session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-one of these subjects were able to perform the task appropriately by following both the attentional and speed/accuracy instructions, and were therefore invited to participate in the five additional days of testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four subjects were unable to complete all six sessions; thus, a total of 17 subjects completed the study (11 females and 6 males, average age = 23.06 y, age range: 2130 y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They received detailed information about the potential side effects of TMS and provided written informed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures were approved by the University of California, Berkeley Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
