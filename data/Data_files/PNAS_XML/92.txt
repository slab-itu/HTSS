Noninvasive detection of fetal subchromosomal abnormalities by semiconductor sequencing of maternal plasma DNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using sequencing of fetal cell-free DNA from maternal plasma has allowed accurate prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidy without requirement of an invasive procedure; this approach has gained increasing clinical acceptance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this manuscript, we evaluate whether NIPT using semiconductor sequencing platform (SSP) could reliably detect subchromosomal deletions/duplications in women carrying a high-risk fetus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that detection of fetal subchromosomal abnormalities is a viable extension of NIPT using SSP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the recent strong interest in NIPT using cell-free DNA, these results should be of broad interest and immediate clinical importance, even beyond the NIPT field, such as for detection of cell-free tumor DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using sequencing of fetal cell-free DNA from maternal plasma has enabled accurate prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidy and become increasingly accepted in clinical practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated whether NIPT using semiconductor sequencing platform (SSP) could reliably detect subchromosomal deletions/duplications in women carrying high-risk fetuses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first showed that increasing concentration of abnormal DNA and sequencing depth improved detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we analyzed plasma from 1,456 pregnant women to develop a method for estimating fetal DNA concentration based on the size distribution of DNA fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we collected plasma from 1,476 pregnant women with fetal structural abnormalities detected on ultrasound who also underwent an invasive diagnostic procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used SSP of maternal plasma DNA to detect subchromosomal abnormalities and validated our results with array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With 3.5 million reads, SSP detected 56 of 78 (71.8%) subchromosomal abnormalities detected by aCGH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increased sequencing depth up to 10 million reads and restriction of the size of abnormalities to more than 1 Mb, sensitivity improved to 69 of 73 (94.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of 55 false-positive samples, 35 were caused by deletions/duplications present in maternal DNA, indicating the necessity of a validation test to exclude maternal karyotype abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study shows that detection of fetal subchromosomal abnormalities is a viable extension of NIPT based on SSP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we focused on the application of cell-free DNA sequencing for NIPT, we believe that this method has broader applications for genetic diagnosis, such as analysis of circulating tumor DNA for detection of cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Optimization_of_Fetal_Deletion_Duplication_Detection_by_SSP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the accuracy of fetal deletion/duplication detection by SSP, DNA derived from the blood of 19 newborns with known deletions/duplications diagnosed by aCGH (Table S1) was mixed with DNA from normal samples at a range of concentrations [5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, and 30% (mass/mass)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mixed sample was sequenced at various depths (3.5, 5, 10, or 15 million reads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples 14,452, 14,095, and 14,181 harbored two deletions or duplications each, whereas the remaining samples had one deletion/duplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 22 deletions/duplications were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stouffers Z scores were generated as described in Materials and Methods for each sample at every concentration and sequencing depth; Z scores increased with both concentration and sequencing depth, with the average Z scores for all samples shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Z scores of sample 14,945, with DNA that contains a 21-Mb deletion, are shown in Fig S1 A and B as an example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S1B shows that, at a constant sequencing depth of 5 million reads, Z-score magnitude increases with greater abnormal DNA concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S1B shows increasing Z-score magnitude with increasing sequencing depth at a constant 15% abnormal DNA concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aCGH plot for sample 14,945 is shown in Fig S1C as a comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increasing the fraction of abnormal DNA as well as increasing the sequencing depth resulted in improved detection and delineation of subchromosomal abnormalities (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the lowest concentration of 5% and 3.5 million reads, the smallest abnormality detected was 20 Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing sequencing depth at this concentration dramatically improved detection of deletions/duplications to as small as 3 Mb with 15 million reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rates of false-positive and false-negative events decreased with increasing concentration as well as increasing sequencing depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show the feasibility of using Stouffers Z scores generated with a sliding window strategy on SSP to detect subchromosomal abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fetal_Fraction_Estimation_in_Maternal_Plasma_DNA_by_Size_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that the concentration of fetal DNA seems to affect the accuracy of NIPT, we investigated a technique using sequencing to estimate the fraction of fetal cfDNA in maternal plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because fetal cfDNA is generally shorter than maternal cfDNA, maternal plasma samples with a higher fetal DNA concentration would have a higher proportion of short DNA fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulated that, if the proportions of short and long DNA fragments in maternal plasma were correlated with the fetal DNA fraction, we would be able to determine the fetal DNA fraction using maternal plasma DNA size analysis alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed plasma samples from 1,456 pregnant women, 712 of whom carried a male fetus, performing SSP at 400 flows to sequence the entire length of fetal DNA fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall DNA fragment size distribution for each maternal plasma sample was generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characteristic size distributions from six individual maternal plasma samples with various fetal DNA fractions are shown in Fig 3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aggregated distributions of all samples are shown in Fig 3B as the average reads ratio at each fragment size, with the variance around each point shown by the gray region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples from 712 women carrying male fetuses were randomly divided into a training group and a validation group, each containing 356 samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fetal DNA concentration was determined from the proportion of Y-chromosome sequences in maternal plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then examined the relationship between the reads ratio of different fragment sizes and fetal DNA fraction in the training group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a correlation between the fetal DNA fraction estimated by the Z score of Y chromosome and the reads ratio of two DNA fragment size regions: 130140 bp (region A in Fig 4A) and 155175 bp (region B in Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 shows regions A and B in relation to the size distributions of the maternal cfDNA fragments denoted by vertical blue or red bands, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in Materials and Methods, we used this correlation to derive an equation for estimating the fetal DNA concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we estimated the fetal DNA fractions for 356 samples in the validation group using the regression equation obtained from the training group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each size region, the size-deduced fetal DNA fractions were highly concordant with those determined using the proportion of Y chromosome (region A: r = 0.839, P less_than 2.2e-16 and region B: r = 0.83, P less_than 2.2e-16 by linear regression).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated fetal fraction was highly concordant between each region as well (Fig 4C) (r = 0.818, P less_than 2.2e-16 by linear regression).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in Materials and Methods, the estimated fetal DNA fraction was considered unreliable for a small number of samples, in which the estimated fetal fraction was inconsistent between the different size regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Performance_of_SSP_for_Detecting_Fetal_Deletions_Duplications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We prospectively recruited a cohort of 1,476 pregnant women presenting with a fetal indication of structural abnormalities detected on ultrasonography for invasive prenatal testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average maternal age of the cohort was 29.7 ± 5.4 y old (range = 1746 y old), and the average gestational age was 24 ± 6 wk (range = 1237 wk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maternal plasma was collected concurrently with fetal DNA obtained using an invasive procedure, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villous sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Invasively collected fetal DNA was tested by aCGH, whereas DNA derived from maternal plasma was sequenced by SSP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied our method described above to estimate the fetal DNA fraction in maternal plasma for the entire cohort (Fig S2); 88.5% samples were estimated to have a fetal DNA fraction of 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the average fetal DNA fraction was greater than 10% for all gestational ages, fetal DNA fraction increased significantly with gestational age (r = 0.5863, P value = 3.0190e-27); 66.7% of samples with a gestational age of 1216 wk had a fetal DNA fraction greater than 10% compared with 95% of samples with gestational age greater than 20 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The same sequencing depth of 3.5 million reads was used like in our previous study on trisomy 21, 18, and 13 and sex chromosome aneuploidies (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that our technique provided results consistent with our previous study, we first assessed the ability of SSP to detect aneuploidy in our cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1,476 samples, 73 cases of chromosomal aneuploidy were identified, with the extra chromosome clearly detected in the 1-Mb bin curve of the SSP analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with aCGH performed on invasively derived fetal DNA, the false-positive rate for aneuploidy was 0.63% (nine false-positive samples), and the false-negative rate was 0%, consistent with our previous study and other previously published results (1113, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most common etiologies of false-positive results in NIPT for aneuploidy are placental mosaicism and a demised twin fetus (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small duplications present in maternal DNA may also lead to relative overrepresentation of a chromosome in cfDNA, leading to a false-positive result (23), although we did not detect any instances of this in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then applied our method to detect subchromosomal deletions and duplications (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventy-eight subchromosomal deletions and duplications ranging from 0.52 to 84 Mb in size were identified by aCGH in 57 samples, many corresponding to known deletion or duplication syndromes; 56 of 78 (71.8%) abnormalities were detected by our method at 3.5 million reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of the deletion/duplication seemed to be the major determinant of the performance of our method; 42 of 45 (93.3%) deletions/duplications larger than 5 Mb and 35 of 35 (100%) larger than 10 Mb in size were detected at 3.5 million reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, only 14 of 34 (41.2%) of samples less than 5 Mb in size and none less than 1 Mb in size were detected at 3.5 million reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for abnormalities greater than 1 Mb in size, sensitivity improved to 69 of 73 (94.5%) with increasing sequencing depth up to 10 million reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several false-negative samples (A0133, A0947, 0899, A0310, A0686, and A0769) had a low estimated fetal DNA fraction, or the fraction could not be reliably calculated, likely making detection of abnormalities more difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, certain regions of the genome, primarily those with highly repetitive DNA sequences, such as near centrosomes, showed significantly greater covariance and thus, made detection of true abnormalities in these regions more challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our analysis, we masked some repetitive sequences before read mapping to increase accuracy of read counting in each bin, which may have resulted in false negatives in these repetitive sequence-rich regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the deletion in sample A0769 (chr22: 1729994219770514) is close to centrosome, and the deletion in A0133 (chr14: 1.01E+081.07E+08) is located at the end of chromosome 14, resulting in false negatives, despite increased sequencing depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our assay produced 58 false positives from 55 samples at a sequencing depth of 3.5 million reads for a false-positive rate of 3.8%; 39 of 58 (67.2%) false positives predicted a deletion/duplication less than 5 Mb in size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that many of these false positives might be caused by deletions/duplications in maternal DNA and therefore, would be detected in the maternal plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this hypothesis, we performed aCGH on all 55 samples of maternal DNA to assess for the presence of deletions and duplications in the maternal DNA; 35 of 55 (63.6%) samples were validated as maternal deletions/duplications, suggesting that the majority of false positives using this method can be accounted for by abnormalities present in the mothers genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding has significant implications for the clinical utility of NIPT to detect subchromosomal abnormalities, because a positive test using this assay may require a follow-up test to rule out deletions and duplications in the maternal DNA before the fetus can be diagnosed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the remaining 20 false-positive samples, repeat sequencing and analysis revealed no repeat false-positive results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these false positives seem to be the random result of our sequencing technique and statistical model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detection of subchromosomal abnormalities would most likely be applied as an extension of current methods of NIPT to detect aneuploidy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When results for aneuploidy and subchromosomal abnormalities are considered together, our assay detected 129 of 151 karyotype abnormalities of all sizes in 1,476 samples at 3.5 million reads for an overall sensitivity of 85.4% compared with aCGH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were 64 false-positive samples total for an overall specificity of 95.7%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If size is restricted to abnormalities greater than 5 Mb, 115 of 117 abnormalities in 1,476 samples were detected for an overall sensitivity and specificity of 98.3% and 98.1%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that detection of subchromosomal abnormalities is a viable extension of NIPT using SSP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study shows that sequencing maternal plasma DNA can reliably produce a fetal karyotype of chromosomal deletions and duplications with relatively high resolution while avoiding the necessity of an invasive procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our NIPT method is less accurate than CMA, especially for deletions/duplications smaller than 5 Mb, it offers the advantage of unbiased testing and is substantially more accurate than current blood-based screening tests for aneuploidy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study population, we detected 75% more abnormal karyotypes than detection of aneuploidy alone at a sequencing depth of 3.5 million reads, with greater sequencing depth significantly increasing sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, because no specific prenatal screening exists for subchromosomal abnormalities, the ability of a single test to detect these abnormalities in addition to aneuploidy represents a powerful extension of NIPT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our false-positive rate of 3.8% for subchromosomal abnormalities was relatively high and would potentially limit the clinical utility of our method as a stand-alone screening test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 64% of false positives were found to be because of abnormalities present in maternal DNA, suggesting that the false-positive rate could be greatly reduced with a reflex follow-up test of maternal DNA collected simultaneously with maternal plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reflex test of maternal DNA would also identify inherited variants, which may represent a significant fraction of true positives as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these variants are polymorphisms and unlikely to be detrimental for the mother.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further lowering of the false-positive rate may be possible with greater sequencing depth; additional study is required to investigate these possibilities adequately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study population was drawn from pregnancies with anatomic abnormalities found on ultrasound to generate a high incidence of karyotype abnormalities, resulting in tested pregnancies ranging in gestational age from 12 to 37 wk, with an average age of 24 wk, much later than NIPT would ideally be applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a future study, detection of subchromosomal abnormalities could be applied to a population with lower but still elevated risk (i.e., advanced maternal age) at a gestational age of 1216 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This timing would offer the advantage of safer, less expensive, and more private elective termination and would be consistent with current prenatal screening practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, many governments limit the legal gestational age at which an elective termination may be performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, accurate diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities at earlier gestational ages is an important goal of prenatal testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the fetal concentration of DNA is lower at a gestational age of 1216 wk, with only 66.7% having a fetal DNA fraction greater than 10% in our study, deeper sequencing than 3.5 million reads is likely required for accurate detection of subchromosomal abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing sequencing depth is likely the most direct way of improving accuracy of diagnosis in general and may be achieved in the near future with additional reductions in sequencing costs over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, certain parts of the genome may not be amenable to adequate coverage because of the inherent nature of chromosome structure or features of DNA (for example, heterochromatin regions or repetitive DNA sequences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One crucial challenge is that our technique may identify deletions and duplications of unknown clinical significance, with incomplete penetrance, or with mild or unpredictable clinical consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these abnormalities may be normal inherited variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, if our extension of NIPT is put into clinical practice, great care must be taken in presenting results and providing appropriate counseling to patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that the utility of NIPT for subchromosomal abnormalities will increase with greater understanding of genomic disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Databases compiling information on these deletions/duplications are being developed, such as DECIPHER (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increased sample sizes and additional clinical correlations, such databases will undergo validation and become more useful in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At minimum, detecting such abnormalities will alert the childs providers to the need for close surveillance for sequelae, such as neurodevelopmental delay or the consequences of a known genomic syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NIPT using SSP is able to reliably estimate the fetal DNA fraction in maternal plasma, which we showed with a large cohort of pregnant women with normal fetuses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied this technique to identify samples with a lower fetal DNA fraction that, thus, might provide a less reliable result, although the presence of a subchromosomal abnormality was correctly identified in many samples with fetal DNA fractions less than 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted above, this effect may be more significant and therefore, estimation of the fetal fraction may be more useful in trials studying women receiving NIPT at earlier gestational ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a clinical setting, this analysis may identify samples that require either deeper sequencing, which may ameliorate the effect of a low fetal DNA fraction, or repeat testing at a later gestational age when the fetal fraction of DNA has increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current cost of sequencing a human genome with 0.5× coverage by single reads, approximately the coverage in our study at 3.5 million reads, is comparable with the cost of CMA while avoiding an invasive procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This depth allowed excellent detection of deletions/duplications greater than 5 Mb in size in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deeper sequencing allows for finer resolution at an additional cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Already, many obstetric practices in the United States are offering NIPT as a replacement for invasive testing for detection of common chromosomal aneuploidies and select common deletions/duplications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our method offers unbiased detection and greater resolution relative to current NIPT methods, with the potential for lower costs because of lower sequencing requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SSP has the potential to be a cheaper and faster technology to use for this purpose compared with Illumina technology; however, both technologies continue to improve, with increasing speed and accuracy and falling costs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crucially, this type of analysis has the potential to be implemented for all high-risk pregnancies and eventually, as standard of care prenatal screening for all women, replacing current screening methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The methods developed here can be applied to any mixed biological sample to determine the subchromosomal abnormalities in the minor component, even when this fraction represents only a small percentage of the total DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In prenatal diagnostics, samples obtained from chorionic villi could be analyzed for mosaic karyotypes or maternal contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, many different cancers have been associated with copy number changes that could potentially be detected from serum cfDNA or a solid tumor sample that contains both normal and cancer cells (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the cost of next generation sequencing continues to drop, we expect that this technique will become applicable for a broad range of diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Subject_Recruitment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Guangdong Women and Children Hospital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Informed consent was obtained from all participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Women were offered participation in our study if they presented with a singleton gestation, in which either CVS or amniocentesis was indicated for structural anomalies detected on ultrasonography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those choosing to participate provided written informed consent after discussion of the potential advantages and risks of chromosomal microarray testing, including the possibility of findings of uncertain clinical significance and the identification of genetic variants in the fetus or a parent that cause adult-onset disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CVS was performed in the usual fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For women undergoing amniocentesis, an additional 10 mL amniotic fluid was retrieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microarray_CGH_Laboratory_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After DNA extraction, an aCGH analysis was performed using Agilents 8 × 60K commercial arrays (Agilent Technologies) according to the procedures described in our previous paper (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were analyzed with Agilent Genomic Workbench Lite Edition 6.5.0.18 software (Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aberrations were identified using the Agilent Genomic Workbench Lite Edition 6.5.0.18 software through the Aberration Detection Method-2 Algorithm, with a sensitivity threshold of 6.0 and a data filter that rejected aberrations that did not include at least five probes with a log2 set of 0.25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All quality control metrics passed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

cfDNA_Preparation_and_Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preparation and sequencing of cfDNA obtained from maternal plasma were performed as previously described (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain complete sequences of cfDNA fragments, sequencing was performed using an Ion Proton Sequencer (Life Technologies) at 400 flows, and BaseCalling options were modified as follows: BaseCallerdisable-all-filters offkeypass-filter offphasing-residual-filter=2.0trim-qual-cutoff 100trim-qual-window-size 30trim-adapter-cutoff 16num-unfiltered 1000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Preprocessing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reads mapping and filtering procedures were performed according to our previous paper (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retained reads were aligned to the human genomic reference sequences (hg19) using the BWA (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads that were unmapped or had multiple primary alignment records were filtered by FLAG field in the alignment file using an in-house Perl script.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Duplicate reads were identified by Picard (broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) with the parameters java -jar MarkDuplicates.jar M=picard_duplication_metrics REMOVE_DUPLICATES=true ASSUME_SORTED=true 1 and removed by an in-house Perl script.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining reads were considered unique reads for additional analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculation_of_Fetal_DNA_Fraction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the full sequences of cfDNA, we used in-house Perl scripts to exclude incomplete reads and determine the size distributions of plasma cfDNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fetal DNA is generally shorter than maternal DNA (28), resulting in the feasibility of predicting the fetal DNA concentration in maternal plasma (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma samples with a higher fetal DNA fraction would have a higher proportion of short plasma DNA fragments (130140 bp; region A) and a lower proportion of long plasma DNA fragments (155175 bp; region B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) regression was applied to fit the fetal fraction against reads ratio in features A and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtain the LOESS fit-predicted fetal fraction PA for feature A and PB for feature B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because both PA and PB predict the fetal DNA fraction, PA and PB should also closely correlate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used reference samples to compare PA and PB and thus, identify instances of poor correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If Pdiff=(PAPB)×2/(PA+PB) is larger than 0.40 (larger than 99% normal samples), PA and PB are inconsistent, and the fetal fraction is considered unpredictable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, we calculated the final predicted fetal fraction using P=(PA+PB)/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_Subchromosomal_Abnormalities  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After reads mapping, guanosine-cytosine (GC) correction was performed according to our previous paper (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, the number of unique reads from each 20-kb bin on each chromosome was counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate the effect of GC bias in different samples, an integrated GC correction method was applied, in which LOESS regression was used to compute the corrected number of unique reads in each 20-kb bin depending on the GC content of the genomic sequence in the corresponding bin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corrected reads number of each chromosome was determined by summing the weighted values of all 20-kb bins of each specific chromosome in a sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Other than GC bias, some genome blocks behaved similarly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Straver et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (29) applied a within-sample comparison method to similar chromosome regions to detect subchromosomal aberrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, reads ratio values were obtained from 500 normal samples as within-sample reference bins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corrected reads ratio Ri for each 1-Mb region in each sample and then, the SD, mean, and coefficient of variation (CV) values for each 1-Mb region were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, for block i and sample j, we obtain the Z score Zij (Zij=RijRiref/SDiref).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For block i of sample j, we obtain a Z score Zij in each independent test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining the Z scores of adjacent blocks would increase the precision to detect subchromosome aberrations using Stouffers Z-score method (29): Stouffer'sZ=i=1kZi/k.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When Stouffers Z score is larger than 3, we classify it as microduplication, whereas when it is less than 3, we classify it as microdeletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested different k values and found that k = 7 performed best.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, if the Stouffers Z scores of adjacent blocks are similar, we would merge these blocks together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the subchromosomal aberration region is larger than 1 Mb, we can use the Stouffers Z score to enlarge the aberration signal and detect abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid false positives, the Z scores of each bin were filtered by a threshold based on fetal DNA fraction and sequencing depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the formula Zij=Co_exp_ratioijCo_exp_ratioi/SD=±fc%/2×Co_exp_ratioi/SD=±fc%2*CV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the formula, CV (CV in each bin) was related to sequencing depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the precision of subchromosomal deletion/duplication detection is closely related to the fetal DNA fraction in maternal plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the fetal DNA fraction is less than 10%, Zij may be less than 3, resulting in a false negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
