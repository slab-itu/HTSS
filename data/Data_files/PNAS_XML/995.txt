DSCAM-mediated control of dendritic and axonal arbor outgrowth enforces tiling and inhibits synaptic plasticity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult neurons are not able to make new connections as easily as developing neurons can; however, future therapies aimed at regeneration and repair of neural circuits in the adult nervous system depend critically on the formation of such connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we studied a recently discovered cell population that has the unusual ability to make new connections into adulthood, but under normal conditions does not grow new axons or dendrites, so that no new cells are contacted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We manipulated this cell population to induce axon and dendrite outgrowth using transgenic methods and determined that this results in stable, functional connections with new cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mature mammalian neurons have a limited ability to extend neurites and make new synaptic connections, but the mechanisms that inhibit such plasticity remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that OFF-type retinal bipolar cells in mice are an exception to this rule, as they form new anatomical connections within their tiled dendritic fields well after retinal maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Down syndrome cell-adhesion molecule (Dscam) confines these anatomical rearrangements within the normal tiled fields, as conditional deletion of the gene permits extension of dendrite and axon arbors beyond these borders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dscam deletion in the mature retina results in expanded dendritic fields and increased cone photoreceptor contacts, demonstrating that DSCAM actively inhibits circuit-level plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrophysiological recordings from Dscam/ OFF bipolar cells showed enlarged visual receptive fields, demonstrating that expanded dendritic territories comprise functional synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results identify cell-adhesion molecule-mediated inhibition as a regulator of circuit-level neuronal plasticity in the adult retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used Htr2a transgenic mice (31, 32) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) against cell-typespecific markers (33) to study structural development and neuronal plasticity of OFF-type BCs during development [postnatal days (P) 15 and 21] and following developmental maturity (P35, 3 mo, and 6 mo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified dendritic and axonal arbor morphology of more than 1,500 type 3b and type 4 BCs (BC3s, BC4s) through manual tracing in confocal fluorescence image stacks of retinal whole-mounts obtained at five time points (Fig S1 and Movie S1), and assessed functional correlates of observed morphological changes with electrophysiological recordings of fluorescence-labeled BC4s in the whole-mount retina, in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BC4s_Form_Novel_Dendritic_Connections_with_a_Fixed_Set_of_Cones_After_Developmental_Maturity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Confocal imaging of retinal whole mounts (Fig 1A) showed that BC4 dendritic arbors in the adult retina tile the retinal outer plexiform layer with minimal overlap, consistent with previous reports (20, 3335).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing BC4 dendritic arbor morphology from P15 through 6 mo (Fig 1 BH), we discovered that BC4s continue to elaborate their dendritic arbors after reaching developmental maturity at 1 mo of age (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This anatomical plasticity was unexpected, and contrasts with ON-type BCs, which establish their adult complement of synaptic connections early in development, at P14 (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine which aspects of the BC4 dendritic arbor change with age, we used quantitative measures to compare dendritic arbor morphology from P15 to 6 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a modest increase in dendritic field area and total length of BC4 dendrites starting at P15 and continuing to 6 mo (Fig 1 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that while the total number of cones contacted per BC4 remained constant (Fig 1K), both the number of BC4 dendritic tips at each cone terminal, each of which contains multiple synaptic ribbons, and the number of dendritic tips not at cones increased over time (Fig 1 LN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was surprising and indicates that mouse BC4s may continue to form new anatomical connections with cones well after retinal maturity (ages  1 mo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the number of cones contacted did not increase in WT after P15 (Fig 1K), these new connections were apparently confined to the set of cones within each cells tiled dendritic field established during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results, we speculated that mature BC4s might form synaptic connections with an increasing number of cones when the constraints on dendritic outgrowth are lifted, for example, by removing factors that enforce dendritic field tiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DSCAM_Limits_BC4_Plasticity_by_Enforcing_Tiling_of_Dendritic_Arbors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that the ability of adult BC4s to expand dendritic arbors and contact previously not-contacted cones in WT mice is constrained by homotypic inhibition from neighboring BC4s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important candidate for blocking circuit-level plasticity by preventing dendritic outgrowth is Dscam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dscam is expressed in all OFF-type BCs, except BC1s (27, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the role of Dscam in establishing and maintaining BC4 tiling, we utilized genetic knockout mice and a floxed allele of Dscam in combination with HTR:Cre mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HTR:Cre selectively targets Dscam deletion to BC4s with minimal disruption to retinal organization and no detectable change in BC4 cell number, common complications of Dscam deletion in other cell types (24) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dscams have been shown to regulate neurite laminar targeting through adhesion in Drosophila (38), chick (25), and at least one retinal cell type in mouse (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since altered laminar targeting may impact cell physiology (39), we first tested if selective deletion of Dscam in BC4 cells affects their laminar targeting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that this was not the case: conditional deletion of Dscam altered neither laminar targeting of BC4 axons (Fig S2 AC and H) nor the distribution and density of upstream cone photoreceptors (Fig S3 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we compared BC4 morphology in Dscam+/+ and DscamFF HTR:Cre retinas from P15 through 6 mo (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence coexpression and IHC validation showed that HTR:Cre deleted Dscam in many BC4s (Dscamflox BC4s) (Fig 2 A and B, red + green), but some nontargeted cells remained (20%; Dscamflox BC4s) (Fig 2 A and B, green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This chimeric expression pattern allowed structural comparison of mutant and WT BC4s within the same retina (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since DSCAM in vertebrates and invertebrates acts as a homotypic cell-adhesion molecule (25, 40), we should expect a structural phenotype also in Dscamflox BC4s directly adjacent to Dscamflox BC4s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the dendritic area of Dscamflox BC4s was increased compared with Dscam+/+ BC4s at all time points (P15 to 6 mo), while Dscamflox BC4s showed an intermediate phenotype (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendrite length was greater in Dscamflox BC4s compared with Dscam+/+ BC4s (Fig 2D) but the retinal area was not (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increased dendritic field area without a change in retinal area implies increased dendritic field overlap concomitant with loss of dendritic tiling (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we mapped the dendritic territories of neighboring BC4s in the Dscam+/+ and DscamFF HTR:Cre retinas (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While dendritic field overlap between Dscam+/+ BC4 pairs was negligible, as expected, overlap between neighboring DscamfloxDscamflox and DscamfloxDscamflox BC4 pairs (Fig 2B) was substantial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, DscamFF HTR:Cre retinas showed the predicted chimeric recombination pattern comprising WT-like tiling between Dscamflox BC4 pairs and loss of tiling between Dscamflox and Dscamflox BC4 pairs (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these data, we conclude that DSCAM acts between mouse BC4s in a cell-typeautonomous manner (i.e., between cells of same type).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using genetic knockout mice, we found a Dscam gene dosage-dependent change in BC4 tiling (WT less_than heterozygous less_than homozygous for the Dscam mutation), consistent with previous results (42, 43) (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DSCAM_Prevents_BC4s_from_Contacting_Cones_Outside_of_Their_Tiled_Dendrite_Territories  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we asked if loss of tiling is accompanied by an increase in the number of cone  BC4 anatomical connections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To answer this question, we counted the number of cones contacted by individual Dscam+/+, Dscamflox, and Dscamflox BC4s at ages between P15 and 6 mo (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a significant increase in the number of cones contacted as a function of age in Dscamflox and Dscamflox BC4s, but not Dscam+/+ BC4s (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found a significant increase in the total number of dendritic tips, number of dendritic tips per cone, and number of dendritic tips not at cones in Dscamflox BC4s compared with Dscam+/+ BC4s (Fig 3 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether dendritic tips not ending at cones contacted rods, we stained retinas with dystroglycan, a marker specific to synaptic clefts and peanut agglutinin (PNA), which labels the cone axon terminal membrane (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no difference in the number of rod contacts in Dscam+/+ vs. Dscamflox BC4s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the number of dendritic tips ending at either photoreceptor type was increased in Dscamflox BC4s, compared with Dscam+/+ BC4s (Fig 3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenotype, too, was dependent on Dscam gene dosage (WT less_than heterozygous less_than homozygous) (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data support a model in which Dscam-mediated recognition enforces BC4 dendritic tiling by preventing dendrite overlap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In support of this model, we found that Dscamflox BC4 dendritic fields continue to grow, with significant increases in dendritic length and dendritic area between 3 and 6 mo of age (Fig 4 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with WT BC4s, in which length and area do not increase between 3 and 6 mo (Fig 1 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing increases in retinal area that occur as the retina ages to changes in BC4 dendritic area and overlap, we found that increases in dendritic area in Dscamflox BC4s exceed retinal area growth and correlate with increases in BC4 overlap (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increases in WT BC4 dendritic area either match growth in retinal area or are not correlated with increases in dendrite overlap between adjacent BC4s (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increases in WT dendritic area between P35 and 3 mo occurred without similar changes in retina area or BC4 overlap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggested that BC4 tiling becomes tighter in the WT retina after P35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we measured unsampled space, defined as retinal area at the level of the OPL that was not sampled by the dendrites of any BC4 (Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a significant decrease in unsampled space in the WT retina between P35 and 6 mo of age (Fig 4I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isoneuronal_Organization_Is_Disrupted_at_the_Cone_Synapse_in_Dscam_Mutant_BC4s  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse Dscam prevents excessive adhesion between cells of a given cell type, while Drosophila Dscam1 helps to provide isoneuronal cuesthose intrinsic to individual neuronsthat prevent excessive overlap of a given cells own dendrites (4447).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isoneuronal recognition is provided in retinal starburst amacrine cells by -protocadherins, but how isoneuronal avoidance is mediated in most retinal cell types remains unknown (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next measured if isoneuronal BC4 dendrite organization was disrupted in the Dscam mutant retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with Dscam+/+ BC4s, Dscam-null BC4 innervation of cones was highly disorganized and the dendrites of a single BC4 appeared to clump together (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Dscamflox BC4 dendrites covered significantly more of the cone (Fig 5B) compared with Dscam+/+ BC4s, while the total number of multiply innervated cones in the DscamFF HTR:Cre retina was increased (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reconstructions of individual BC4 cone innervations showed a significant increase in the proportion of cells with crossing dendrites in Dscamflox BC4s compared with Dscam+/+ BC4s (Fig 5 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceivably, this could be caused by clumping of multiple BC4 dendrite tips constraining dendrite avoidance, but we found increased overlap in BC4 dendrites even in cases where a cone was innervated by a single Dscam mutant BC4 (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the increase in dendrite self-crossing and DSCAMs role in isoneuronal avoidance in Drosophila, we found that DSCAM protein was localized along distal BC4 dendrites, not just at the dendritic tips (Fig 5 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Loss_of_DSCAM_Causes_Enlarged_BC4s_Visual_Receptive_Fields  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our anatomical data show that BC4s lacking Dscam have enlarged dendritic arbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether these cells make functional synaptic connections with cone photoreceptors throughout their extended dendritic field, we performed whole-cell recordings of fluorescence-labeled BC4s in the whole-mount retina in vitro (Fig 6 A and B), and measured their spatial receptive fields using binary white noise stimulation (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dscamflox BC4s, identified by HTR:GFP and Ai9 coexpression in DscamFF HTR:Cre mice, showed similar time course and strength of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance compared with Dscam+/+ BC4s, identified by HTR:GFP expression in Dscam+/+ mice, including both ON and OFF inhibition and excitation (Fig 6 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that presynaptic neurons and basic response properties of Dscamflox BC4 cells were unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Dscamflox BC4s had significantly larger receptive fields compared with Dscam+/+ BC4s (Fig 6 E and F), demonstrating that extended dendrites make functional synaptic connections with cone photoreceptors over a larger retinal area compared with WT BC4s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DSCAM_Enforces_Tiling_of_BC4_Axonal_Arbors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BCs are strongly polarized neurons characterized by axonal and dendritic arbors extending in opposite directions from the soma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DSCAM expression in BC4s is localized to the distal dendrites (27) (Fig 5 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In RGCs, the function of DSCAM differs depending on cellular compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DSCAM prevents clumping in dendrites (24) while promoting growth in axons (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether DSCAM has similar compartment-dependent functions in BCs, we first confirmed that DSCAM protein was localized to BC4 axons (Fig 7 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we compared axonal arbor territories in DscamFF HTR:Cre vs. Dscam+/+ retinas (Fig 7 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dscamflox BC4 axonal arbors were larger and overlapped more with neighboring BC4 axons compared with Dscam+/+ BC4 axons (Fig 7 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that DSCAM has a similar function in BC4 dendrites and axons (i.e., to maintain tiling).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DSCAM_Enforces_Dendrite_Tiling_in_BC3bs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dscam is expressed in multiple OFF BC types (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether the results obtained from BC4s generalize also to other OFF BC types, we next measured how loss of DSCAM impacts dendrite outgrowth of another Dscam expressing OFF BC, BC3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of BC3bs was possible because HTR:Cre targets 1% of BC3bs (31), allowing for the sparse labeling and targeting of Dscam in BC3bs (Fig 8 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC3bs were readily distinguished from BC4s by counterstaining with the BC3b selective molecular marker anti-PKARII (protein kinase A RII ) (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found significant increases in dendritic area and number of cones contacted in Dscamflox BC3bs compared with Dscam+/+ and Dscamflox BC3bs (Fig 8 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, neighboring DscamfloxDscamflox BC3b pairs showed more dendritic field overlap compared with Dscam+/+ or Dscamflox BC3b pairs (Fig 8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of sparse recombination in BC3Bs, most Dscamflox BC3bs are adjacent to other Dscamflox BC3bs, and Dscamflox BC3b phenotypes were not significantly different from WT BC3bs (Fig 8 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these data, we conclude that DSCAM plays a similar role in controlling dendritic field area in BC3b and BC4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DSCAM_Actively_Inhibits_BC4_Plasticity_After_Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results presented thus far show that constitutive loss of Dscam expression leads to expanded BC3b and BC4 dendritic fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceivably, this phenotype is caused by the absence of DSCAM during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it may reflect an active role for DSCAM in maintaining BC dendritic territory after development is complete (1 mo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish between these two scenarios, we deleted Dscam in BCs in adult mice using two independent approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first approach, late deletion of Dscam was mediated by Pou4f2:Cre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pou4f2:Cre targets the conditional allele of Dscam in BCs after 1 mo of age (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we found no differences in dendrite area, dendrite overlap, or cones contacted in DscamFF vs. DscamFF Pou4f2:Cre BC4s before recombination (up to 1 mo of age) (Fig 9 A, B, and EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at this time point a phenotype is clearly observed in the DscamFF Htr:Cre retina compared with WT (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After recombination, at ages 3 and 6 mo, we found significant increases in each of these measurements (Fig 9 CG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no change in retinal area at any of the time points (Fig 9H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the second approach, we used the tamoxifen-dependent CreER system (52, 53), which allowed greater flexibility in the timing of Dscam deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DscamFF and DscamFF CreER mice were injected with tamoxifen at 1 mo and retinas harvested and analyzed at 3 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing CreER-targeted vs. non-CreERtargeted BC4s (Fig 9 I and J), we found significant increases in dendrite area, dendrite overlap, and number of cones contacted (Fig 9 KM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As before, we found no change in retina area (Fig 9N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that DSCAM actively enforces dendritic tiling throughout the lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By blocking dendritic outgrowth, DSCAM prevents BCs from contacting additional cones over time, thus inhibiting circuit-level BC plasticity in the mature retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We provide insight into the regulation of neuronal plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that OFF-type retinal BC3s and BC4s retain the ability to extend and refine components of their dendritic arbors within a defined tiled territory long after the retina is considered developmentally mature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify Dscam as a gene that enforces BC axonal and dendritic tiling and inhibits BC plasticity through interactions between homotypic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that abolishing Dscam expression in BC3bs and BC4s promotes dendritic outgrowth, and show that BC4 dendritic extensions make functional synaptic connections with more cone photoreceptors than in WT controls, resulting in enlarged visual receptive fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that deleting Dscam in the adult retina is sufficient for triggering BC dendrite outgrowth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that Dscam is required for maintaining dendritic territories throughout life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a demonstration of cell-adhesion molecule-mediated inhibition of axon and dendrite outgrowth as a regulator of circuit-level plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because adult plasticity is a key objective for clinical approaches to retinal regeneration and repair, interfering with Dscam or its downstream signaling pathways may serve as a potential strategy for promoting neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis in the adult CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several factors limit neuronal plasticity in the mature CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the spinal cord, myelin and extracellular matrix proteins provide inhibitory cues that prevent sprouting and outgrowth of neurons following damage (5458).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the retina, restriction of axon outgrowth in mature RGCs is mediated, in part, by the down-regulation of factors that promote cytoskeletal dynamics (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the CNS, the bioavailability of growth factors critical for promoting plasticity during development and for learning and memory is reduced with age (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we expand our understanding of the factors contributing to governing circuit-level plasticity by identifying a role for the cell-adhesion protein DSCAM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intrinsic_Plasticity_of_OFF_BCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our mechanistic understanding of BC dendrite and axon development is based primarily on studies in ON BCs (23, 36, 60, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that OFF BC dendritic arbor and synaptic development is qualitatively different from ON BCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas ON BCs have the same number of anatomical connections in the adult retina as they do around the time of eye-opening (18, 60), we show that OFF BCs continue to make and refine anatomical connections within their dendritic territories until at least 6 mo of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in dendritic plasticity between ON and OFF BCs may be related to the different innervation patterns of ON and OFF BCs in the mammalian retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While ON cells make invaginating contacts at synaptic ribbon-containing sites, OFF cells make flat contacts at the base of synaptic invaginations, possibly leaving their dendrite tips free to explore and expand (62, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional difference between ON cone BCs and mouse OFF BC3a, BC3b, and BC4s is that the latter make direct synaptic contacts with rods in addition to cones, analogous to the primate DB3 BCs (33, 50, 64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dendritic field of these OFF BC types reportedly contains an excess of potential presynaptic rod contacts, with only about one in five rods directly contacted (64, 65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe an increase in the number of rods contacted, even as dendritic field size increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, synaptic input to BCs appears to be controlled independent of dendritic arbor size, with reported feedback from axonal contacts as a potential mechanism (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Loss_of_DSCAM-Dependent_Axon_and_Dendrite_Tiling_Results_in_Formation_of_New_Cone_Contacts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While most retinal neurons have axonal and dendritic fields that overlap extensively, ranging from about 3-fold in nonfoveal ganglion cells to about 30-fold for starburst amacrine cells (6769), BCs have tiled dendritic and axonal arbors (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we identify Dscam as the regulator of tiling in two Dscam-expressing OFF BC types (BC3b, BC4) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tiled organization of dendritic and axonal arbors of these BC types suggest that a similar mechanism acts to prevent overlap in other BC types, but the genes that mediate this, as well as tiling in other vertebrate neuron populations, remain to be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four types of OFF BCs express Dscam and all have dendrites that converge onto the cone synapse (27) or axonal arbors that overlap, and yet DSCAM protein appears to function by preventing dendrite and axonal overlap independently in these cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the extensive overlap of the dendritic arbors of different Dscam-expressing cell types in the IPL and a model wherein Dscam does not provide cell-typespecific recognition cues, but rather acts to prevent excessive adhesion or preserve tiling by acting in the context of a larger cell-type identity code (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with Dscam function in chick where DSCAM protein is localized to a narrow band of the IPL and plays a role in laminar targeting, a function that may be mediated in mouse by semaphorins and plexins (70, 71), contactins (72), and cadherins (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localization of DSCAM protein in the mouse IPL at the adherens junctions suggests that cadherins are good candidates for such an identity code (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drosophila Dscam1 has been shown to mediate repulsion (45) after homotypic binding and genetic and biochemical studies in Drosophila have identified an interaction between Dscam1 and tubulin-folding cofactor D that results in microtubule disruption (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conservation of such a system in mouse would be consistent with the findings of this study that Dscam maintains tiling and inhibits dendrite and axonal outgrowth by acting in conjunction with additional factors for cell-type specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BC tiling facilitates efficient transmission of spatiotemporal information from photoreceptors to RGCs (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we report that the physiological tiling of OFF BCs is less strict than the anatomical tiling, with the anatomical BC visual receptive field diameter roughly twofold larger than the dendritic field diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely due to conecone gap junction coupling (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By developing a model system in which we can selectively and inducibly increase the receptive field of identified BC types, we can now test directly how loss of tiling impacts information encoding at the level of the retinal ganglion cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Dscam is widely expressed throughout the CNS (7577), similar perturbations of receptive and projective fields in the brain should be of potential interest for exploring links between mutations in Dscam and autism in humans (78, 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DSCAM_Deletion_in_Mature_Neurons_Triggers_Dendrite_Outgrowth_and_Synaptic_Contact  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During development, Dscams promote axon growth and guidance (49, 8084), laminar targeting (25, 38), and avoidance (22, 24, 44, 45, 85, 86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we report that DSCAM acts in mature neurons to actively suppress dendrite growth, a novel mechanism to inhibit plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Widespread ablation of photoreceptors has been shown to result in rod BC dendrite sprouting and innervation of rods located outside of the ablated region, helping to restore visual function in the ablated region (87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surviving cone BCs, on the other hand, failed to sprout and innervate cones outside of the lesion (87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study predicts that targeting Dscam in this context will activate BC dendrite outgrowth and facilitate restoration of cone-driven visual function in BCs proximal to the lesion site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Other cell-adhesion molecules that regulate neuron self-organization through homotypic binding include the MEGF proteins and the -protocadherin complex (48, 88), while semaphorins and plexins restrict axon and dendrite arbors across the vertical plane of the retina (i.e., photoreceptors to RGCs) (70, 71, 89, 90).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether deletion of factors like MEGF and semaphorin proteins in the adult retina is also sufficient to induce neurite outgrowth is not known but worth exploring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identification of signaling pathways downstream of Dscam and the availability of pharmacological agents to up- and down-regulate these pathways (91, 92) suggest that targeted intervention could be performed to promote or inhibit neurite outgrowth in cases where DSCAM function may be lacking or overexhuberant, including in autism (78, 79, 93), fragile-X syndrome, and Down syndrome (94, 95).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of its sensitivity to graded changes in Dscam expression (e.g., homozygous vs. heterozygous for Dscam mutations), the model system presented here provides a powerful research platform for understanding how manipulations of neurite outgrowth impact neural circuit function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mouse_Strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Animal Use and Care Committees at the University of Idaho and the University of Louisville, and were in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used two different transgenic mouse lines manipulating Dscam: (i) Dscamtm1Pfu and (ii) Dscamtm1.1Pfu; one Cre-dependent reporter mouse: Gt(ROSA)26Sortm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze (referred to as Ai9; The Jackson Laboratory, stock no: 007909) (96); three Cre recombinase-expressing transgenic mouse lines: (i) Tg(Htr2a-cre)KM207Gsat (referred to as HTR:Cre; MMRRC stock no: 036750) (31), (ii) Pou4f2:Cre (courtesy of Vann Bennett, Duke University, Durham, NC); (iii) Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(Cre/ERT2)Tyi (referred to as CreER; The Jackson Laboratory, stock no: J008463) (52); and one GFP transgenic mouse: Htr2a-EGFP (referred to as HTR:GFP; MMRRC, stock no: DQ118) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were maintained on a mixed genetic background containing C57BL/6, C3H, 129, and FVB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutant alleles of Pde6b were crossed out of the colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were fed ad libitum and kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minimum of three retinas from three mice were used in each measurement, except for Pou4f2-Cre at 6 mo of age, in which case four retinas from two mice were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genotyping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were genotyped following standard procedures using previously reported primer sequences (97).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphological analyses were performed blind to genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice taken for study were given a unique alphabetical code that was dissociated from the genotypes to those performing experiments until data collection was complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tail biopsies from each mouse were saved for post hoc verification of genotype, if needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Micrographs were captured using either a Nikon Spinning Disk confocal microscope or an Olympus Scanning Laser confocal microscope (FV1000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image processing was performed using FIJI (National Institutes of Health) or Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems) and was limited to adjustments of brightness or contrast applied uniformly across the image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IHC was performed as previously described (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all images containing HTR:GFP, the GFP was amplified using IHC; the tdTomato RFP from the Ai9 reporter was not amplified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Materials and Methods for details about antibodies and stains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analyses were performed in Microsoft Excel or Matlab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A summary of the statistical tests performed and P values for each measurement can be found in Table S1; resources can be found in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for statistical differences between two groups with numerical data, we used the Students t test; for three or more groups with numerical data we used a one-way ANOVA with a TukeyKramer post hoc test; for categorical data we used a hypothesis test comparing two independent proportions; for IPL lamination data we used a KruskalWallis test with a Dunns post hoc test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A P value less_than 0.05 was considered statistically different and is denoted by an asterisk in the graphs in the figures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Horizontal lines above columns in figures represent comparisons between the column under the left end of the line and all columns to the right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An asterisk above a point on the line represents a significant difference between the left-most column and the column under the asterisk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars show mean ± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Counts__Cell_Spacing__and_Retinal_Thickness  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For total cell counts, eight images (four central, four peripheral), equally sampled from the dorsal, ventral, nasal, and temporal regions, were captured from whole-mount retinas stained with cell type specific markers at 1-m increments along the z axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 60× magnification (44,944-m2 field size) was used to capture BC4s, BC3bs, and cones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 20× magnification (160,000-m2 field size) was used to capture dopaminergic amacrine cells (DACs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image stacks were imported into FIJI and cell bodies were manually marked using the multipoint tool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of cells per retina was calculated by extrapolating the number of cells in the eight sample areas to the total retinal area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retinal area was determined by montage imaging of the entire whole-mount retina and using the polygon tool in FIJI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine cell spacing, xy coordinates of each annotated cell soma were exported from FIJI and imported into WinDRP to compute the nearest-neighbor regularity index (NNRI) and the packing factor (98).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Procedures for quantifying morphological characteristics of identified BC types are described in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DSCAM_Localization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All DSCAM localization was performed in cryo-sections of Dscam+/+ retinas by staining them with antibodies against HTR:GFP, calsenilin, and DSCAM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal images were then taken using a scanning-laser confocal microscope at 1,200× magnification, sampling at 0.5-m increments about the z axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image stacks were then taken into FIJI where they were analyzed by the following metrics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrophysiological_Recordings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings from fluorescence-labeled bipolar cells were performed as described previously (99).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each retina was mounted photoreceptor-side down on nitrocellulose filter paper, centered on a square pattern of four 1.3-mm-diameter apertures to permit visual stimulation from below and electrode access from above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fifth aperture, offset ventrally, was used to focus the stimulus onto the photoreceptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were performed on a custom-built two-photon fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX-51) controlled by Scanimage software (www.scanimage.org), with concentric and parfocal IR bright field and two-photon imaging capability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BC4 cells were selectively recorded by targeting HTR:GFP-expressing, or HTR:GFP and Ai9 coexpressing cells in inner nuclear layer of Dscam+/+ and DscamFF HTR:Cre mice, respectively (for details, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical access resistance was 2540 M; typical input resistance was 350700 M. Pipette internal solution contained: 120 mM Cs-methanesulfonate, 5 mM TEA-Cl, 10 mM Hepes, 10 mM BAPTA, 3 mM NaCl, 2 mM QX-314-Cl, 4 mM ATP-Mg, 0.4 mM GTP-Na2, and 10 mM phosphocreatine-Tris2 (pH 7.3, 280 mOsm), and a red fluorescent dye (Sulforhodamine 101; Thermo Fisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excitatory currents were recorded at a holding potential near the reversal potential for chloride, ECl (67 mV), corrected for the liquid junction potential (9 mV); inhibitory currents were recorded at the reversal potential for cations, Ecat (0 mV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Visual_Stimulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Visual stimuli were generated with an iMac computer using Matlab and Psychophysics Toolbox software (Mathworks; www.psychtoolbox.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimuli were displayed using a DLP video projector (60 fps refresh rate; HP AX325AA; Hewlett-Packard), with the image projected onto the photoreceptor layer using a 20× objective (Olympus) in place of the microscope condenser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimulus was focused under visual guidance and focus accuracy was verified post hoc for each recorded cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pixel size at level of the photoreceptors was 3.25 × 3.25 µm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimuli comprised binary white noise checkerboard (30 × 30 checks, check size 6.5 × 6.5 µm; 100% Michelson contrast, six stimulus frames per second) to measure spatial receptive fields and contrast-modulated spots (100% Michelson contrast; 100-µm diameter; 1 Hz) to measure excitatory and inhibitory conductances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tamoxifen_Dosing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tamoxifen (T5648; Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved at 20 mg/mL in sesame seed oil by incubation at 37 °C until dissolved (about 4 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, 100 L of tamoxifen solution was administered by intraperitoneal injection (1 mg/10 g body weight) daily for 5 d starting at postnatal day 30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were maintained for an additional 3 mo before being taken for study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
