Deconvolution of pro- and antiviral genomic responses in Zika virus-infected and bystander macrophages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interpretation of genome-wide investigations of hostpathogen interactions are often obscured by analyses of mixed populations of infected and uninfected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we developed a system whereby we simultaneously characterize and compare genome-wide transcriptional and epigenetic changes in pure populations of virally infected and neighboring uninfected cells to identify viral-regulated host responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using patient-derived unmodified Zika viruses (ZIKV) infecting primary human macrophages, we reveal that ZIKV suppresses host transcription by multiple mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV infection causes both targeted suppression of type I interferon responses and general suppression by reducing RNA polymerase II protein levels and DNA occupancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneous evaluation of transcriptomic and epigenetic features of infected and uninfected cells provides a powerful method for identifying coincident evolution of dominant proviral or antiviral mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genome-wide investigations of hostpathogen interactions are often limited by analyses of mixed populations of infected and uninfected cells, which lower sensitivity and accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome these obstacles and identify key mechanisms by which Zika virus (ZIKV) manipulates host responses, we developed a system that enables simultaneous characterization of genome-wide transcriptional and epigenetic changes in ZIKV-infected and neighboring uninfected primary human macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that transcriptional responses in ZIKV-infected macrophages differed radically from those in uninfected neighbors and that studying the cell population as a whole produces misleading results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the uninfected population of macrophages exhibits the most rapid and extensive changes in gene expression, related to type I IFN signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, infected macrophages exhibit a delayed and attenuated transcriptional response distinguished by preferential expression of IFNB1 at late time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical and genomic studies of infected macrophages indicate that ZIKV infection causes both a targeted defect in the type I IFN response due to degradation of STAT2 and reduces RNA polymerase II protein levels and DNA occupancy, particularly at genes required for macrophage identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneous evaluation of transcriptomic and epigenetic features of infected and uninfected macrophages thereby reveals the coincident evolution of dominant proviral or antiviral mechanisms, respectively, that determine the outcome of ZIKV exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

ZIKV_Infection_of_Primary_Human_Macrophages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study ZIKVmacrophage interactions, we first developed an in vitro ZIKV infection model that utilizes unmodified viruses to infect primary human blood monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection of HMDMs with ZIKV FSS13025 (ZIKV FSS), an Asian-lineage ZIKV human isolate from Cambodia (2010), at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 (MOI1) resulted in only 1.5% infectivity on average at 24 h postinfection (PI) as measured by intracellular flow cytometry staining of the viral envelope (E) protein using anti-flavivirus E protein (clone 4G2) (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies from individuals previously infected with Dengue virus (DENV) can increase the infectivity of ZIKV by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When HMDMs were infected at the same MOI1 but in the presence of human DENV-immune serum (ADE1), 40% of macrophages were infected on average (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if the MOI was increased to greater than 20 (high-MOI), ADE1 infection still resulted in more infected macrophages than high-MOI conditions (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV SD001 is an Asian-lineage virus isolated in San Diego in 2016 during an acute ZIKV infection in a traveler returning from Venezuela.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of infected HMDMs during infection with ZIKV FSS and SD001 was not significantly different using MOI1 or ADE1 conditions (SI Appendix, Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next compared the production of new infectious virus using MOI1, ADE1, or high-MOI conditions by measuring the yield of secreted virus in the culture supernatant by focus-forming unit (FFU) assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HMDMs infected by ADE1 produced 166-fold more infectious ZIKV than infection by MOI1 and 60-fold more infectious ZIKV than infection by high-MOI (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with ZIKV SD001, ZIKV FSS produced slightly higher infectious titers at 24 h PI under ADE1 conditions (SI Appendix, Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine ZIKV growth kinetics in HMDMs, we first measured the production of viral RNA under ADE1 conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected intracellular ZIKV RNA starting at 8 h PI, with a rapid increase in viral RNA levels occurring at 1224 h PI (SI Appendix, Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular staining of infected HMDMs using the anti-flavivirus E protein antibody 4G2 first detected ZIKV antigen-positive macrophages at 12 h PI (SI Appendix, Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 12 and 24 h PI both the percentage of ZIKV+ macrophages and the intensity of 4G2 staining increase (SI Appendix, Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results demonstrate robust ZIKV replication in HMDMs under ADE1 conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Divergent_Transcriptional_Responses_in_ZIKV-Infected_and_Bystander_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify how ZIKV modulates macrophage responses, we assessed genome-wide transcriptional responses in pure populations of HMDMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HMDMs were infected with ZIKV using ADE1 conditions and were formaldehyde-fixed at different time points PI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HMDMs were then stained intracellularly for the flavivirus E protein using 4G2 antibody and were separated by FACS into infected ZIKV antigen-positive (ZIKV+) and uninfected ZIKV antigen-negative (ZIKV) populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After reverse cross-linking and protease digestion steps, high-quality total RNA was isolated and analyzed using stranded rRNA-depleted total RNA-seq (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach successfully segregated ZIKV+ from ZIKV cells, as significant numbers of reads aligning to the ZIKV genome were found only in the ZIKV+ populations (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the percentage of reads aligning to the ZIKV genome in ZIKV+ cells increased with time PI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 24 h PI, more than 40% of all mapped RNA-seq reads in ZIKV+ HMDMs aligned to the ZIKV genome although the ZIKV genome is only 0.01% the size of all human nonoverlapping exons (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first compared the host transcriptomes of mock-infected (medium alone), ZIKV+, and ZIKV HMDMs using principal component analysis (PCA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though each of the replicates was performed with cells from different individuals, PCA grouped replicates based on infection status and time point PI (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This close association among replicates suggests that interindividual differences have less influence on the transcriptional response of HMDMs than infection status and time point PI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the first principal component (PC1) divided the data into two groups, separating ZIKV macrophages from ZIKV+ and mock-infected HMDMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggested that the transcriptional responses of ZIKV+ macrophages were more similar to mock-infected cells than to ZIKV bystander cells (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, when considering only PC1 and PC2, which captured 68% of the overall transcriptomic differences between the samples, at 12 h PI, the transcriptome of ZIKV+ HMDMs largely overlapped with that of mock-infected macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only at later time points did the transcriptomes segregate along PC2 based on time PI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that ZIKV infection of macrophages, especially at early time points PI, does not elicit a strong transcriptional signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transcriptome studies of in vitro infections have typically analyzed mixed populations of infected cells and uninfected bystanders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine how a traditional mixed-population transcriptome analysis would differ from our approach of isolating and analyzing pure populations of ZIKV+ and ZIKV cells, we used our transcriptional profiles of pure ZIKV+ and ZIKV HMDM populations derived from five different individuals to simulate the transcriptional profiles of hypothetical ZIKV-infected bulk populations over a range of 1000% infected cells (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used these simulated profiles to calculate the recall rate of significantly changed genes identified in pure ZIKV+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our analysis, as the fraction of infected cells decreased from 100%, the ability to identify genes specifically repressed, and to a lesser degree induced, by ZIKV was lost rapidly (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using our highly efficient macrophage infection system, the average percent of infection at 24 h PI was 36%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model estimated that we would identify only 10% of the repressed and 32% of the induced genes in a 36% ZIKV+ HMDM population (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of genes that were induced by ZIKV that would have not been identified at 36% infectivity included IL1A, EIF2AK3/PERK, ASAP2, and KLF4 (Fig 1E and SI Appendix, Fig S1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we would have missed ZIKV-repressed genes such as CCR1, TNFRS11A, and CCL2 (Fig 1F and SI Appendix, Fig S1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to decreased sensitivity in identifying genes regulated by ZIKV, analysis of mixed populations can falsely identify genes as induced or suppressed by ZIKV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 36% infectivity, we estimated that analysis of a mixed population would misidentify 600 genes as induced and 300 genes as repressed by ZIKV (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, multiple inflammatory genes, including EIF2AK2/PKR, IL6, and IFITM2 were strongly induced only in ZIKV bystander cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mixed population analysis would suggest that these genes were strongly up-regulated by ZIKV when in fact these genes were not induced or in many cases were even suppressed in cells productively infected with ZIKV (Fig 1H and SI Appendix, Fig S1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to improved discovery and accuracy, a major advantage of our infection model is the ability to analyze transcriptional responses during infection with unmodified clinical isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using our method, we compared the response of HMDMs during ADE1 infection with two ZIKV isolates derived from human infections, ZIKV FSS and ZIKV SD001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These strains infected the same percentage of HMDMs (SI Appendix, Fig S1B), with FSS infection producing slightly higher infectious titers at 24 h PI (SI Appendix, Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcriptomes of the uninfected bystander ZIKV cells from the FSS and SD001 infections were almost identical, with no genes called as significantly different between these strains (SI Appendix, Fig S1 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the transcriptomes of ZIKV+ macrophages infected with either FSS or SD001 exhibited significant differences, pointing to biological differences between the virus strains (SI Appendix, Fig S1L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ZIKV+ cells, 88 genes were expressed at higher levels during SD001 infection than during FSS infection, while 22 genes were expressed at significantly higher levels during FSS infection than during SD001 infection (SI Appendix, Fig S1K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these 110 genes, 71 genes were also significantly up- or down-regulated compared with mock-infected cells (SI Appendix, Fig S1M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The set of genes down-regulated in ZIKV+ cells during FSS infection compared with SD001 infection and mock treatment was enriched for multiple genes involved in RNA processing and splicing, including the RNA helicases DDX5, DDX17, and DDX42 and the splicing factors SRRM2 and SUGP2 (SI Appendix, Fig S1N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown by our simulation above, transcriptional analyses of mixed populations of ZIKV+ and ZIKV cells have especially poor sensitivity in detecting down-regulated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate that a mixed cell transcriptional analysis with 36% ZIKV+ cells would not identify 36 of the 46 genes specifically down-regulated during FSS infection, including DDX5, DDX17, DDX42, and SRRM2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ZIKV_Infection_Elicits_a_Limited_Transcriptional_Response  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate ZIKVmacrophage interactions over time, we compared the transcriptional responses in ZIKV+ and ZIKV cells at 12, 18, and 24 h PI to mock-infected HMDMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV cells up-regulated a larger number of genes than ZIKV+ cells at 12 h PI (420 genes in ZIKV cells vs. 100 genes in ZIKV+ cells), 18 h PI (708 in ZIKV cells vs. 244 in ZIKV+ cells), and 24 h PI (867 in ZIKV vs. 657 in ZIKV+) (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some inflammatory genes were induced in ZIKV+ cells (examples include CXCL10, RSAD2, IFIT1, IFIT2, CXCL11, IFITM1, IFI44L, CCL8, and TNFSF10/TRAIL), the degree of induction was greater in ZIKV bystander cells (SI Appendix, Fig S2 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as time PI increased, more uniquely up-regulated genes were identified in ZIKV+ cells (SI Appendix, Fig S2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, at 18 h PI, ZIKV+ cells up-regulated AP1S3 and ASAP2, involved in Golgi trafficking, and TNFRSF10D, a decoy TNF receptor that protects against TNFSF10/TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, more than ZIKV cells (SI Appendix, Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h of infection, ZIKV+ cells up-regulated the gene encoding IFN, IFNB1, and the transcription factor KLF4, involved in cell-cycle control, more than their ZIKV neighbors (SI Appendix, Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ZIKV_Suppresses_Inflammatory_Gene_Activation_in_Macrophages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify signaling pathways affected by ZIKV infection of macrophages, we performed gene ontology and pathway analysis on ZIKV and ZIKV+ cells and compared them with mock-infected HMDMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At all time points ZIKV+ HMDMs showed a delayed and diminished induction of genes from multiple inflammation and immune response-related categories including IFN signaling, cytokine signaling, antigen presentation, and pattern recognition receptor (PRR) response pathways (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify how ZIKV manipulates the transcriptional responses in HMDMs, we identified the subset of genes uniquely induced in ZIKV+ cells at 12, 18, and 24 h PI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of uniquely induced genes at 12 h PI in ZIKV+ cells was limited to only 36 genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these genes were significantly enriched for genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, such as HMGCS1, MVD, MVK, and SQLE (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 24 h PI, genes specifically induced in ZIKV+ macrophages were enriched for those involved in the unfolded protein response, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response kinase EIF2AK3/PERK and the transcription factor DDIT3/CHOP (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to suppressed inflammatory gene induction, ZIKV+ macrophages also demonstrated increased down-regulation of genes involved in multiple immune pathways, including leukocyte activation/migration and cytokine signaling/secretion (SI Appendix, Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top functional enrichment category for genes specifically down-regulated in ZIKV+ cells at all time points was histone deacetylases (HDACs) deacetylate histones (SI Appendix, Fig S2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second most enriched pathway in genes uniquely down-regulated in ZIKV+ cells at 18 h PI was signaling by interleukins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Down-regulated genes in this category include multiple dual-specific protein phosphatases involved in regulating MAPK signaling as well as receptors and chemokines involved in immune activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ZIKV+ cells, there was specific down-regulation of many inflammatory response genes at 24 h PI, including the PRR signaling molecules CD14, TLR4, and LY96, cytokines such as CCL2 and CXCL8, and receptors such as C3AR1, C5AR1, and CCR1 (SI Appendix, Fig S2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ZIKV, like other human pathogenic flaviviruses, blocks IFN induction of antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the exact mechanisms by which and where in the IFN response pathway ZIKV blocks ISG activation are not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the IFN response during flaviviral infections is highly context-dependent and varies in a virus-, cell type-, and host species-specific manner (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have demonstrated that ZIKV may block the induction and/or translation of IFN, thereby inhibiting the secretion of IFNs, and/or degrade STAT2 and inhibit the phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT2, which inhibits signaling downstream of the IFN / receptor and induction of ISGs (3133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore examined the expression of IFN and ISG genes in ZIKV+ and ZIKV cells throughout ZIKV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV+ cells express type I and type III IFN genes equivalently to ZIKV cells at 12 and 18 h PI and higher levels than ZIKV cells at 24 h PI (Fig 2D and SI Appendix, Fig S2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ISG expression is markedly reduced in ZIKV+ cells compared with ZIKV cells at 12, 18, and 24 h PI (Fig 2D and SI Appendix, Fig S2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During ZIKV infection of human dendritic cells, IFNs are induced at the transcriptional level, but protein levels are not measurable in the supernatants, suggesting impaired IFN protein production (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if IFN is made and secreted following IFNB1 induction during ZIKV infection of macrophages, we measured the IFN protein levels in supernatants by ELISA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consistently detected IFN in the supernatants of macrophages infected with ZIKV at 24 h PI (SI Appendix, Fig S2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data show that ZIKV broadly suppresses inflammatory gene expression in infected macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type I and type III IFN genes are induced in ZIKV+ macrophages, and IFN is produced, but ZIKV+ macrophages demonstrate markedly reduced ISG induction compared with ZIKV cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests ZIKV blocks type I IFN signaling rather than type I IFN production in macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ZIKV_Degrades_STAT2_to_Inhibit_Type_I_IFN_Signaling_in_Macrophages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore ZIKV inhibition of type I IFN signaling in macrophages, we first asked at which time point PI ZIKV inhibits IFN signaling by treating ZIKV-infected HMDM cultures with exogenous type I IFN before infection or at multiple time points PI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exogenous IFN inhibited ZIKV infection in the HMDM cultures when given at or before 4 h PI but not after 8 h PI (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next measured the kinetics of type I IFN and ISG gene expression during ZIKV infection to determine how rapidly these genes are up-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with mock-infected cells, IFNB1 and ISGs, such as MX1, were consistently up-regulated only at 812 h PI in ZIKV-infected HMDM cultures (SI Appendix, Fig S3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to IFNB1, which is induced similarly in ZIKV+ and ZIKV cells at 12 h PI, there was no induction of MX1 in ZIKV+ cells (SI Appendix, Fig S3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate that ZIKV blocks type I IFN signaling in productively infected macrophages before IFNs can stimulate ISG production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the potential mechanisms by which ZIKV inhibits type I IFN signaling in macrophages, we examined levels of total and phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 proteins in ZIKV+, ZIKV, and mock-infected control HMDMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blots demonstrated decreased STAT2 levels in ZIKV+ cells compared with ZIKV and mock-infected cells, consistent with STAT2 degradation (Fig 2E and SI Appendix, Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not detect STAT2 phosphorylation in either ZIKV+ or mock cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of STAT1 were lower in ZIKV+ than in ZIKV cells but were not statistically different from levels in mock-infected HMDMs (SI Appendix, Fig S3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylated STAT1 was detectable in both ZIKV+ and ZIKV cells but not in mock-infected cells (Fig 2E and SI Appendix, Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the data described above suggesting blockade of downstream IFN signaling early in infection, we observed (i) suppressed induction of STAT1, an ISG, and STAT1 phosphorylation by 12 h PI and (ii) up-regulation of STAT1 protein by 18 h PI in ZIKV cells compared with ZIKV+ cells (SI Appendix, Fig S3 HJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proteasome_Inhibition_Rescues_STAT2_Degradation_but_Minimally_Restores_ISG_Induction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies using cell lines have shown that ZIKV induces STAT2 degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner and that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor can restore STAT2 levels (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that STAT2 is degraded by ZIKV in human macrophages, we wanted to confirm that inhibiting proteasome function would block the degradation of STAT2 and additionally determine if this was sufficient to protect macrophages from ZIKV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infected HMDMs with ZIKV and allowed the virus to establish infection for 12 h. We then added the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or DMSO control and isolated ZIKV+ and ZIKV macrophages 12 h later (24 h PI) (SI Appendix, Fig S3K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of MG132, even at 12 h PI when ZIKV has inhibited IFN signaling, significantly, increased STAT2 protein levels (Fig 2F and SI Appendix, Fig S3L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while restoration of STAT2 levels by MG132 led to significantly increased IFIT3 gene expression in ZIKV+ cells, it did not increase MX1, CXCL10, IFI27, IFI6, and OAS3 expression (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ZIKV_Degradation_of_STAT2_Suppresses_the_Genomic_Activation_Landscape_of_Infected_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Signal-dependent transcription factors (SDTFs) play major roles in the regulation of gene expression by binding to distal enhancers (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activities of transcription factors at enhancer elements can be inferred by changes in H3K27ac, which correlates with transcriptional activity (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, motif analysis of genomic regions exhibiting gain or loss of H3K27ac can be used to infer the activity states of the corresponding transcription factors in an unbiased manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To implement this approach, we performed ChIP-seq for H3K27ac utilizing pure populations of ZIKV+ and ZIKV cells 24 h PI as well as mock-infected controls from three independent infections using HMDMs derived from three different individuals (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to the RNA-seq results that showed suppressed gene induction, ZIKV+ macrophages had far fewer significantly up-regulated H3K27ac peaks than ZIKV cells (547 vs. 2,049 significant peaks) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to ZIKV cells, ZIKV+ macrophages had more significantly down-regulated H3K27ac peaks than up-regulated peaks (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing H3K27ac in ZIKV+ and ZIKV cells identified many H3K27ac regions at promoters and enhancers of genes that were specific to ZIKV cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These included ISGs, such as OAS2 and members of the IFITM family, as well as other inflammatory genes (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cis-regulatory elements marked exclusively by H3K27ac in ZIKV+ cells were associated with genes involved in cell cycle, cell differentiation, delayed senescence, and apoptosis inhibition such as CDK6, BCL2, and KLF4 (Fig 3C and SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide analysis of promoter-distal H3K27ac peaks demonstrated strikingly reduced enrichment of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)/IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) motifs in ZIKV+ cells (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, although enriched to a much lesser extent, NF-B and STAT1 motifs were equally represented in promoter-distal H3K27ac peaks in ZIKV+ and ZIKV macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motifs for PU.1 and C/EBP, two macrophage lineage-determining transcription factors (LDTFs), also showed increased representation in distal H3K27ac peaks in ZIKV cells, likely reflecting their general requirement for binding of SDTFs (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results provide evidence that the dominant transcriptional response of ZIKV cells results from activation of type I IFN signaling and suggest that this response is impaired in ZIKV+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STAT2 degradation in ZIKV+ cells leads to inhibition of genomic activation of ISRE/IRF-containing enhancers and promoters, thereby broadly suppressing inflammatory and ISG activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings confirm and extend the literature by demonstrating that, in human macrophages, the type I IFN system is the dominant anti-ZIKV mechanism and that type I IFN signaling, rather than type I IFN production, is the major target of ZIKV antagonism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ZIKV_Infection_Reduces_RNApol2_Protein_Levels_and_DNA_Occupancy__Particularly_at_Genes_Required_for_Macrophage_Identity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The RNA amounts recovered from ZIKV+ HMDMs were reproducibly lower than the amounts recovered from the corresponding ZIKV cells [mean ZIKV+-to-ZIKV ratio = 0.63, 95% CI (0.470.80)] (SI Appendix, Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the majority of cellular RNA is rRNA synthesized by RNApol1, we focused on RNApol2 because this polymerase produces the majority of protein-coding transcripts involved in antiviral responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the location and relative quantities of RNApol2 genome-wide, we performed ChIP-seq for RNApol2 in equivalent numbers of pure populations of ZIKV+ and ZIKV cells 24 h PI as well as in mock-infected controls (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In three independent infections, using HMDMs derived from three different individuals, we consistently detected less RNApol2 at many locations across the genome in ZIKV+ macrophages than in ZIKV macrophages (Fig 4A and SI Appendix, Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that the lower RNApol2 ChIP levels in ZIKV+ cells were not related to general problems performing ChIP-seq in ZIKV+ cells, we performed ChIP-seq for the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) transcription factor that is involved in regulating chromatin structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to RNApol2, the levels of CTCF were roughly equivalent in both ZIKV+ and ZIVK cells (SI Appendix, Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNApol2 levels were increased at IFNB1 and decreased at MX1, MX2, CXLC10, CCL8, and CCL2 in ZIKV+ cells compared with ZIKV cells, as expected (Fig 4A and SI Appendix, Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, RNApol2 was also significantly decreased at unexpected sites, such as CEBPB, and many snRNAs, such as RNU4-2 and RNU4-1 (Fig 4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, ZIKV+ cells exhibited significantly lower levels of RNApol2 at many genes commonly associated with core macrophage functions such as the LDTFs SPI1, CEBPB, and MAFB, peptidases MMP9, CTSD, and CTSZ, lysozyme LYZ, ferritin light and heavy chain genes FTH1 and FTL, cell-surface receptors CD14 and CD68, and genes involved in antigen processing, i.e., IFI30 and CD74 (Fig 4D and SI Appendix, Fig S4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these genes are associated with superenhancers (SEs) in HMDMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEs are regions of disproportionately high densities of active chromatin regulatory marks and transcription factor binding close to genes that play essential roles in the identity and function of cell types (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the majority of genes have lower RNApol2 levels in ZIKV+ cells than in mock-infected macrophages, genes associated with SEs demonstrated a disproportionate reduction in RNApol2 signal (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNApol2 is a large protein complex made up of 12 subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest RNApol2 subunit, RPB1, contains the DNA-binding domain of RNApol2 and a C-terminal domain that is essential for regulating polymerase activity and associated processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if the decreased RNApol2 ChIP-seq levels in ZIKV+ cells were associated with decreased RNApol2 protein levels, we measured RPB1 levels in mock-infected, ZIKV, and ZIKV+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV+ cells had significantly lower levels of RPB1 protein than ZIKV and mock-infected control macrophages (Fig 4 F and G and SI Appendix, Fig S4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to RPB1 protein levels, transcription of the gene POLR2A that encodes RPB1 was significantly up-regulated in ZIKV+ cells compared with ZIKV and mock-infected control macrophages (Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this observation was similar to the discrepancy in STAT2 RNA and protein levels induced by ZIKV, RPB1 levels did not normalize after the addition of proteasome inhibitor, suggesting that ZIKV employs a different mechanism to lower host cell RPB1 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data demonstrate that productive ZIKV infection reduces RNApol2 DNA occupancy globally but that this effect is amplified at core macrophage genes, many of which are associated with SEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In these studies, we identify the genome-wide signaling networks in primary human macrophages infected with ZIKV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that neighboring ZIKV-infected and uninfected cells have differing, often opposite, transcriptional responses that obscure analyses of mixed populations in which uninfected cells make up even a small percentage of the total population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles of pure populations of infected macrophages thus provide a more accurate map of the human macrophage signaling response during ZIKV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing the transcriptomes and epigenomic features in neighboring ZIKV+ and ZIVK macrophages that are exposed to identical environmental signals, the mechanisms employed by ZIKV to subvert macrophage immunity are revealed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our findings demonstrate that studying a mixed culture of ZIKV-infected HMDMs would lead to the reasonable but erroneous conclusion that infection induces a type I IFN response when, in fact, this response is restricted to cells that do not become productively infected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct comparison of ZIKV+ and ZIKV cells thus provides important insights into the balance of pro- and antiviral mechanisms and an unbiased assessment of the dominant regulatory pathways involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach does not require viral modification and can be performed in difficult-to-infect primary human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it could be used to study genomic responses during infection with any virus and to directly compare hostviral interactions using clinical viral isolates in any cell type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNApol2 ChIP-seq in ZIKV+ and ZIKV cells demonstrated that RNApol2 DNA occupancy is disrupted in cells productively infected with ZIKV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While RNApol2 levels are reduced at most genes, the loss is especially pronounced at many genes associated with SEs that play essential roles in macrophage identity and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of RNApol2 DNA occupancy in ZIKV+ cells is associated with decreases in protein levels of RPB1, the largest RNApol2 subunit that plays critical roles in both DNA binding and transcriptional elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple pathogenic viruses, including poliovirus, some Old World alpha viruses, influenza virus, human herpesvirus 1, and Bunyamwera virus, inhibit RNApol2 during infection through either degradation or dephosphorylation of RPB1, preventing transcription initiation or elongation, respectively (2024).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppression of host transcription during viral infection would increase the cellular resources available for viral production and suppress host antiviral responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific mechanism by which ZIKV infection leads to decreases in RPB1 and RNApol2 DNA occupancy and its effects on pathogenesis remain to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly smaller and more variable decreases in RNApol2 occupancy were also detected in ZIKV bystander cells compared with mock-infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why this occurs in ZIKV cells is unclear, but it may reflect a response to secreted host or viral environmental signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the exact mechanisms of RNApol2 loss are still being identified, models of CNS infection and infection of glioblastoma cells have suggested that ZIKV causes loss of neural as well as cancer progenitor cells by blocking proliferation and inducing cell death (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceivably, loss of RNApol2 in these cell types could contribute to cell death in these tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our genome-wide studies of ZIKV infection in primary human macrophages demonstrate targeted suppression of ISRE/IRF-dependent signaling networks that can be explained by STAT2 degradation and are consistent with previous studies in cell lines demonstrating that ZIKV NS5 protein degrades STAT2 in proteasome-dependent manner (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In macrophages, proteasome inhibitor treatment given more than 4 h after ZIKV has disabled cellular IFN signaling partially restored induction of IFIT3 but not of other ISGs, such as MX1, CXCL10, IFI27, IFI6, and OAS3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While all six of these ISGs have at least one ISRE motif in their promoters [300 to +100 bp from the transcription start site (TSS)], only CXCL10 and OAS3 have NFB motifs in their promoters (SI Appendix, Fig S4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These and other antiviral ISGs that are not partially rescued by MG132 may also be regulated by NFB at distal enhancer elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although these results could reflect gene-specific requirements for NFB, which is inhibited by proteosome blockade, they are also consistent with the inhibitory effects of ZIKV on RNApol2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ZIKV was discovered in 1947 and has caused sporadic human infections for more than 50 y, but only during the recent outbreaks in French Polynesia and South America was ZIKV associated with congenital ZIKV syndrome and GuillainBarré syndrome (13, 14, 39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the specific mechanisms underlying this increased human pathogenicity are still under investigation, it has been suggested that evolution of the ZIKV genome may contribute to this increasing virulence (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this hypothesis, experimental evidence has demonstrated strain-specific differences in viral pathogenesis and neurologic disease in a STAT2-deficient mouse model and single-amino acid substitutions that increase infectivity of Aedes aegypti mosquitos and human and mouse neural progenitor cells (4345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we performed genome-wide transcriptomic analysis comparing human macrophage responses to two patient-derived Asian ZIKV subtypes, SD001 and FSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specificity of our system is demonstrated by the fact that when bystander ZIKV cells from SD001 and FSS infections are compared, we detect no significant differences in gene regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when ZIKV+ cells infected with SD001 or FSS are compared, 110 genes are identified as being regulated in a strain-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similar transcriptional response in bystander ZIKV cells during SD001 and FSS infections suggests that the bystander ZIKV cells principally respond to secreted environmental signals such as IFNs and cytokines and that these environmental signals are largely the same during FSS and SD001 infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed our transcriptional analysis shows that the majority of cytokines/chemokines are made in ZIKV bystander cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV+ cells also respond to environmental stimuli, but their response is modified by viral activation and repression of cellular response pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ZIKV+ populations, strain-specific differences can influence how the virus activates or represses these responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ZIKV+ cells, we identified differentially expressed genes with functional enrichment for RNA processing and RNA splicing and include multiple DEAD box RNA helicases (DDX5, DDX17, and DDX42) that are down-regulated in a strain-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of this protein family can act as PRRs that recognize viral RNA and initiate antiviral responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Japanese encephalitis virus, another flavivirus, has been shown to prevent DDX42 from activating type I IFN signaling (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, RNA splicing is modulated by many human pathogenic viruses, and ZIKV was recently shown to cause alternative splicing events in infected neural progenitor cells (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the accuracy of our method and its ability to study differences between unmodified patient-derived viruses in primary human cells, we anticipate that future studies comparing numerous ZIKV strains could identify key virulence mechanisms associated with viral genome evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although ZIKV largely suppresses inflammatory gene transcription activation, genes associated with specific pathways are selectively up-regulated in ZIKV+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (HMGCS1, MVD, MVK, and SQLE), ER/Golgi trafficking (AP1S3 and ASAP2), and cell survival (TNFRSF10D and KLF4) are all induced in ZIKV+ macrophages and, based on previous data, have the potential to increase ZIKV pathogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cholesterol synthesis plays critical roles in flavivirus innate immune evasion and replication (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flaviviruses bud into the ER lumen and require transport through the trans-Golgi to form mature infectious particles and viruses (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing treatments that target these pathways could prove efficacious, as evidenced by the fact that treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin increased survival rates in a mouse model of DENV-2 infection (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our work demonstrates that ZIKV manipulates macrophage transcription at multiple levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIVK specifically inhibits type I IFN signaling and suppresses global transcription by decreasing RNApol2 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our method for identifying and comparing genome-wide transcriptional and epigenetic changes in neighboring infected and uninfected primary human macrophages using unmodified patient-derived viruses provides an approach to allow rapid deconvolution of complex hostpathogen interactions and directly compare the pathogenicity of clinical viral isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
