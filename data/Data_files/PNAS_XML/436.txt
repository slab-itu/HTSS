title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Partitioning direct and indirect effects reveals the response of water-limited ecosystems to elevated CO2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide affect plants directly by stimulating photosynthesis and reducing stomatal aperture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These direct effects trigger several more subtle, indirect effects via changes in soil moisture and plant structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While such effects have been acknowledged, they have never been assessed quantitatively, partly due to the fact they are inseparable in field experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the indirect effects of elevated CO2 explain, on average, 28% of the total plant productivity response, and are almost equal to the size of direct effects on evapotranspiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding has major implications for our mechanistic understanding of plant response to elevated CO2, forcing us to revisit the interpretation of experimental results as well as simulations of future productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide are expected to affect carbon assimilation and evapotranspiration (ET), ultimately driving changes in plant growth, hydrology, and the global carbon balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct leaf biochemical effects have been widely investigated, whereas indirect effects, although documented, elude explicit quantification in experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used a mechanistic model to investigate the relative contributions of direct (through carbon assimilation) and indirect (via soil moisture savings due to stomatal closure, and changes in leaf area index) effects of elevated CO2 across a variety of ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We specifically determined which ecosystems and climatic conditions maximize the indirect effects of elevated CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations suggest that the indirect effects of elevated CO2 on net primary productivity are large and variable, ranging from less than 10% to more than 100% of the size of direct effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ET, indirect effects were, on average, 65% of the size of direct effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indirect effects tended to be considerably larger in water-limited ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the total CO2 effect had a significant, inverse relationship with the wetness index and was directly related to vapor pressure deficit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results have major implications for our understanding of the CO2 response of ecosystems and for global projections of CO2 fertilization, because, although direct effects are typically understood and easily reproducible in models, simulations of indirect effects are far more challenging and difficult to constrain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings also provide an explanation for the discrepancies between experiments in the total CO2 effect on net primary productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effect_Partitioning  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified four principal effects, which are the main determinants of the total ecosystem response to eCO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first effect (E1) is the well-known, direct physiological effect, where a higher partial pressure of CO2 stimulates photosynthesis in C3 plants and reduces stomatal conductance in both C3 and C4 plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is always positive because it increases gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second effect (E2) is almost always positive and is the indirect effect mediated by reduced stomatal conductance, which leads to soil moisture savings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced stomatal conductance may, in rare cases, suppress plant growth when soil water savings exacerbate anoxia in frequently waterlogged soils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third effect (E3) is related to a potential increase in LAI, which, by itself, may lead to an additional increase in carbon assimilation because of greater leaf area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is always positive for GPP but can be negative in terms of NPP in specific situations of stress, because greater LAI implies greater respiration rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth effect (E4) is typically negative and is related to the higher ET rates associated with an increase in LAI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher ET tends to decrease soil moisture, which may increase plant water deficit, reducing productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality, all effects occur simultaneously, and the water mass budget must be preserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, E4 acts mostly by offsetting the positive effect of E2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total response is finally given by E1 + E2 + E3 + E4, which corresponds to what can be typically observed in a CO2 manipulation experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the above partitioning does not include indirect effects acting through nutrients, increases in root depth, or changes in species composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is incontrovertible that these factors play important roles in regulating ecosystem response to eCO2 (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4144), they remain poorly simulated by current terrestrial biosphere models (4548).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we excluded such effects to avoid introducing further levels of uncertainty related to the specific model structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The combination of six numerical simulations, which were used to separate E1, E2, E3, and E4, is described in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two atmospheric CO2 concentration levels, 375 ppm and 550 ppm, were used in the simulations, representing the ambient CO2 concentration at the beginning of this century and the level used in several FACE experiments, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatment corresponded to an overall step increase in CO2 of +46%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boundary conditions in terms of soil properties and depth, biome parameterizations, and hourly meteorological inputs were taken from 44 sites corresponding to locations where observations from flux towers, manipulation experiments, or experimental stations were available to force and test the model (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, biomes were not parameterized with generic plant functional types, but, for each site, we identified a parameter set able to provide satisfactory results in terms of vegetation productivity, LAI, soil moisture, energy and water fluxes, and local phenology acting on the most sensitive parameters (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capability of the T&C model to reproduce the observed response to eCO2 was evaluated against observations of total effects at three FACE experiments (50, 51): Duke-FACE, ORNL-FACE and TasFACE (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S3), and has been previously tested for the Swiss Canopy Crane FACE experiment (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were satisfactory compared with current capabilities of ecosystem models (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40), especially at the Duke-FACE site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations at ORNL-FACE were less satisfactory, especially in the period when nutrient limitation became significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the overall consistency in simulated and observed average effects for different variables (NPP, ET, and water use efficiency) was adequate for the investigation of the questions posed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NPP_Response  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The total effect of the eCO2 treatment on NPP, computed as (eCO2  aCO2)/aCO2, was a function of the wetness index, WI, i.e., the ratio between annual precipitation and annual potential ET (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decomposing the response between direct and indirect effects shows that the direct effect was unrelated (R2=0.02, P value = 0.35) to WI, whereas indirect effects increased exponentially with decreasing WI, thus driving an increase in the total response (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct effect was positively correlated with annual and growing season air temperature (R2=0.78, P value less_than 0.001), suggesting that the strongest direct physiological response should be expected at warmer sites where photosynthesis is not temperature-limited during most of the growing season (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further subdivision of the three analyzed indirect effects showed that the indirect effect through soil moisture savings, E2, increased exponentially with dryness, reaching values of 20 to 40% of the ambient NPP for WI less_than 0.5 (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indirect effect due to carbon assimilation stimulation through a larger LAI, E3, also increased for very dry conditions, but at lower WI values than E2, and was rarely larger than 20% of the ambient NPP (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern occurred because, at drier sites, LAI is generally lower, so that even a small increase in LAI due to eCO2 may cause significant stimulation of GPP, as the negative feedback of self-shading is minimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, E4 reached large negative values at dry sites (40% of ambient NPP) and counteracted the combined positive effects of E2 and E3 (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the increased LAI generated by eCO2 was typically sufficient to deplete a large fraction of the soil moisture savings, which would otherwise occur because of the reduction in stomatal conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the sum E2 + E3 + E4 almost always yielded a positive value, as testified by Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio between indirect and direct effects (Rid) supports the idea that indirect effects can be comparable (Rid greater than 0.25) to the direct effect at many sites and can be much larger (Rid greater than 1) for dry sites with C4 species (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only wet tropical forest sites, a groundwater-fed ecosystem, and a grassland in Scotland showed a total predominance of direct effects (Ridless_than0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average and across all sites, indirect effects accounted for 28% of the NPP response to eCO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In terms of total eCO2 treatment effect, the 46% increase in CO2 led to greater variation in NPP among sites, but the overall effect on NPP was positive, ranging between 11% and 45% of ambient NPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eCO2 effect was most variable when wetness conditions were intermediate (0.75less_thanWIless_than1.25) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this scatter, a significant negative relationship (R2=0.20, P value = 0.0021) between NPP effect size and WI was evident, with the driest sites having the strongest NPP response to eCO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern was also apparent for sites with a considerable fraction of C4 species (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total NPP effect was even more strongly correlated (R2=0.51, P value less_than 0.001) with the growing season average vapor pressure deficit (VPD) (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whether or not eCO2 stimulates LAI is a matter of debate, because responses differ among experiments (53, 54), and there is contention as to whether nutrient limitation or direct environmental controls limit growth regardless of carbon assimilation rates (12, 44, 5558).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we examined the impact of eCO2 on NPP while holding LAI constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the only mechanisms leading to eCO2 effects on NPP were direct physiological and indirect soil moisture impacts (E1 + E2) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite some site-to-site variability, removing eCO2 effects on LAI had contrasting consequences in dry and wet sites (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In dry sites, the stimulation of LAI by eCO2 resulted in increased water use, more than offsetting the beneficial effects of LAI on photosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, removing the impact of eCO2 on LAI substantially increased the overall stimulation of NPP in dry sites (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in wet sites, preventing eCO2 from stimulating NPP via increased LAI had no effect or reduced the eCO2 effect, because water was clearly not limiting at these sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the impact of changes in LAI in response to eCO2 depend upon whether the ecosystem has the necessary water availability to support greater LAI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ET_Response  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enrichment of CO2 influenced ET in a manner even more tightly controlled by WI than for NPP (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, the ratio of indirect to direct effects was 65%, pointing to a large significance of indirect eCO2 effects on ET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indirect effects on ET through soil moisture savings (E2) and increased LAI (E3) were positive and similar in magnitude, with an exponential increase evident for WI less_than 1 (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both E2 and E3 led to higher ET but for different reasons: E2 alleviated water stress thereby supporting continued ET, whereas E3 simply increased the transpiring leaf area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These theoretical increments in ET cannot be physically sustained, as they would violate the water mass budget, or, in other words, an increase in ET must imply a decrease in soil moisture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, E4 was strongly negative and offset partially, or almost entirely in the most xeric sites, the sum of E2 and E3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct effect reached 15% and was positively and linearly correlated (R2=0.41 P value less_than 0.001) with WI (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern was related to the fact that ET, during periods of high water availability in drier sites, can be larger than in wetter sites, due to higher radiation loads and temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these locations, allowing only the direct effect of stomatal conductance reduction (E1) to occur can lead to more pronounced responses (proportionally lower ET) than in wetter sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the combined indirect effects increased ET in a manner that was negatively and exponentially related (R2=0.70) to WI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, this trend largely offset the direct effect for WI less_than 0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The total effect of eCO2 on ET was generally negative, ranging between 8% and +2% and approaching zero under arid conditions (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was not surprising, because long-term ET at dry sites is almost equal to long-term precipitation, with only a marginal influence of other factors such as CO2 concentration, climate variability, or vegetation composition (39, 59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ecosystem water use efficiency (EWUE), defined as the ratio between GPP and ET, also responded positively to eCO2 following general expectations (40, 6163), with a total increase between 14% and 39%, less than proportional to the 46% increase in CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scatter in the EWUE response was considerable; the response was mostly driven by the direct effect but was enhanced by the sum of indirect effects at the driest sites (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study aimed to determine the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of eCO2 on ecosystem NPP and ET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that, in xeric environments, indirect effects can be comparable to or even larger than the direct, photosynthetic effect of eCO2 on NPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, indirect effects accounted for 28% of the total stimulation of NPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indirect/direct effect ratio ranged from less than 0.1 for tropical and moist sites to more than 1 for semiarid C4 grasslands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypothesized decrease of effect size with extremely dry conditions (28) was not supported by our simulations, which represent integrated responses across multiple years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results should be regarded as potential responses, in the absence of nutrient limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppression of eCO2 effects on NPP by severe water deficit remains a possibility for explaining interannual variation in response within sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, for arid or semiarid sites characterized by herbaceous species and relatively fast biomass turnover rates, eCO2 stimulation of NPP does not necessarily translate to an increase in standing biomass, even after several years (64, 65), but may be detected in an increase in soil organic carbon (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is only partially captured in model simulations that still show a positive effect on biomass also in the most arid ecosystems, even though the effect is considerably smaller than for NPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limitations in nutrient uptake exacerbated by water stress can also dampen the biomass response of the most arid sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, eCO2 may stimulate rhizodeposition, potentially explaining the discrepancy between NPP and biomass responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that changes in ET due to eCO2 were smaller than what a pure, direct response of stomatal conductance would suggest, even at the ecosystem level (i.e., direct effect of 5 to 15%), because indirect effects tend to compensate partially or totally for the direct effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, water saved via reduced stomatal conductance is likely to be consumed in water-limited systems, either immediately via increased LAI or by extension of the growing period if LAI is unaffected by eCO2 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the effects might be due to changes in root biomass, which were included in the model; however, changes in rooting depth in response to eCO2 were not considered, and it is therefore possible that indirect effects of eCO2 may increase beyond those simulated here, if development of deeper roots were able to access water not otherwise available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall difference between the two CO2 scenarios (375 ppm vs. 550 ppm) in terms of water fluxes (ET) was typically less than 8% and mostly constrained between 5% and 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in water use of this magnitude would rarely be observable, due to a combination of measurement uncertainty (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  67) and interannual variability (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the large number of sites we simulated, the total change in NPP with the increase in CO2 concentration was mostly in the order of 20 to 35%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are very similar or slightly larger than observations in FACE experiments when nutrient limitations do not play a role (28, 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, our results should be considered as the potential response of NPP to eCO2 in the absence of sink limitations (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation in the NPP response as a function of the wetness index is quite impressive, because these are numerical simulations from a mechanistic model rather than observations from real experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large scatter in intermediate wetness conditions suggests that differences in phenology, temperature, short-term meteorological variability, biome, and soil type, all of which were accounted for in the simulations, play a significant role in the NPP response to eCO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to the situation with ET, the sum of indirect effects tends to enhance the response of NPP to eCO2 because it adds to the direct physiological response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially evident in semiarid sites, which are responsive to eCO2 even when C4 species are predominant, as supported from observations (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results demonstrate that mechanistic models of terrestrial ecosystems, despite known limitations (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46, 58, 69, and 70), do provide substantial insights on ecosystem response to eCO2 that are impossible to obtain with field experiments alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model limitations and structure may affect the magnitude of some of the estimates but are unlikely to change the prevailing patterns, with the important exception of nutrient limitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, T&C generated total responses to eCO2 that closely matched observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the average modeled eCO2 effect size of NPP, ET, and EWUE is consistent for the Duke-FACE and for the first 7 y of the ORNL-FACE experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regardless of inherent shortcomings of simulation models, ecosystems at the dry end of the climate spectrum, which experience repeated water stress, are expected to be the most responsive to eCO2 in terms of productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When indirect LAI effects are removed, mimicking a lack of stimulation in LAI increase (Fig 2), productivity in these sites responds more strongly to eCO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the significant positive relationships between VPD, a measure of atmospheric dryness, and total NPP response to eCO2 (SI Appendix, Fig S4B) supports the idea that the drier sites are where the most significant effects of eCO2 on NPP should be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding agrees with modeling studies based on optimality principles (71, 72) and is supported by global patterns of positive response of semiarid ecosystems to CO2 fertilization (73, 74), forcing the reevaluation of the role of semiarid ecosystems in the land carbon sink (75, 76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All this evidence corroborates our results and suggests that projections of eCO2 effects at local and global scales are substantially affected by mechanisms and feedbacks contributing to indirect effects, which are inherently more challenging to model than the direct effect on carbon assimilation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information on indirect effects derivable from conventional field experiments is necessarily limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This issue demands both novel experiments specifically designed to target indirect effects and mechanistic solutions in models that do not strongly depend on empirical results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, particular focus should be devoted to addressing the representation of water stress effects on the response of ecosystem productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Partitioning_Direct_and_Indirect_Effects_of_Elevated_CO2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The contributions of the four identified effects (E1, E2, E3, and E4) were quantified by running a series of six simulations with the T&C model (38, 39, 49, 52, 77) (SI Appendix, Text S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first two simulations were used to compute the total eCO2 effect (E1 + E2 + E3 + E4) and simply represent a simulation with CO2 concentration prescribed at ambient level (375 ppm) and one with elevated CO2 (550 ppm), where all of the identified effects cooccur as in reality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect magnitude was computed as (eCO2  aCO2)/aCO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other three simulations were then necessary to partition the four effects (because there were four unknowns in four equations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these simulations, atmospheric CO2 concentration was kept at 550 ppm, and either soil moisture or LAI or both were externally prescribed to be the same as obtained from the ambient or eCO2 simulations, rather than being prognostic variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ran four additional simulations to have redundancy on the estimate and keep the simulation with the total eCO2 effect as a counterproof.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were (i) a simulation with eCO2 and prescribed ambient LAI and soil moisture, where the direct effect only remained (i.e., only E1); (ii) a simulation with eCO2 but prescribed ambient LAI, where all of the indirect effects mediated by LAI were absent (i.e., E1 + E2 occurred); (iii) a simulation with eCO2 and prescribed ambient soil moisture and eCO2LAI, where all of the indirect effects related to soil moisture were eliminated (i.e., E1 + E3 occurred); (iv) a simulation with eCO2 and prescribed eCO2 soil moisture and ambient LAI, where only the E3 effect was eliminated (i.e., E1 + E2 + E4 occurred).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Opportune combinations of the two basic simulations with the four additional simulations with prescribed soil moisture or LAI were able to provide a distinct estimate of the quantitative contributions of the four effects (E1, E2, E3, and E4) to the total (combined) effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that prescribing either soil moisture or LAI externally rather than allowing its prognostic computation in the model violates, to some extent, the water and/or carbon budget in the specific simulation; however, this was the only way to separate the four effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a final check, the sum of the four effects estimated with the additional simulations corresponded almost perfectly to the total eCO2 effect (E1 + E2 + E3 + E4), testifying to the correctness of the procedure (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example of the results obtained with the adopted methodology is illustrated by the time series of NPP simulated imposing ambient CO2 concentration (aCO2), eCO2 concentration, and a case with eCO2 but with LAI and soil moisture fixed to ambient values (SI Appendix, Fig S8 and Text S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the article, only long-term averaged responses over the entire simulation period (SI Appendix, Table S1) are shown, which are the results of effects occurring from the hourly to the multiannual scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Climate_Forcing_and_Vegetation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We selected 44 locations corresponding to sites of flux towers, manipulation experiments, and experimental stations covering different climates and biomes across the globe (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each site, the six described simulations were used to partition the four effects at an hourly scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values averaged over the entire length of the simulation were then reported in the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of meteorological time series depended on the length of the available, good-quality hourly data for each location and ranged from a minimum of 2 y to a maximum of 31.7 y with a median of 7.8 y (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight sites were also characterized by a nonnegligible fraction of C4 species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broad range of climate and vegetation types allowed for robustness in the investigation of eCO2 effect and how it is partitioned, minimizing the risk of idiosyncratic results related to parametrization of a given biome or climate in a single location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, running the model locally rather than globally allowed us to avoid generic plant functional type parameterizations and large-scale climate forcing that may lead to large biases in the ecosystem response at a given site (49, 60, 78, 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
