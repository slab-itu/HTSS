Cytokine signaling through Drosophila Mthl10 ties lifespan to environmental stress  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Invertebrates are productive models for understanding basic molecular principles that link cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathways to aging in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use a high-throughput dsRNA screen to determine that the multifunctional Drosophila cytokine, GBP, is a ligand for the hitherto orphan GPCR, Mthl10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through genetic manipulation of the GBP/Mthl10 axis in larvae and adult flies, we are able to demonstrate how organismal longevity is interconnected to immunological, metabolic, and stress-protective responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide a molecular basis for hypothesizing that a successful defense against environmental insultsbe they pathogenic inflammation or noninfective challengeswill ultimately reduce lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A systems-level understanding of cytokine-mediated, intertissue signaling is one of the keys to developing fundamental insight into the links between aging and inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we employed Drosophila, a routine model for analysis of cytokine signaling pathways in higher animals, to identify a receptor for the growth-blocking peptide (GBP) cytokine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having previously established that the phospholipase C/Ca2+ signaling pathway mediates innate immune responses to GBP, we conducted a dsRNA library screen for genes that modulate Ca2+ mobilization in Drosophila S3 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hitherto orphan G protein coupled receptor, Methuselah-like receptor-10 (Mthl10), was a significant hit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary screening confirmed specific binding of fluorophore-tagged GBP to both S3 cells and recombinant Mthl10-ectodomain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that the metabolic, immunological, and stress-protecting roles of GBP all interconnect through Mthl10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This we established by Mthl10 knockdown in three fly model systems: in hemocyte-like Drosophila S2 cells, Mthl10 knockdown decreases GBP-mediated innate immune responses; in larvae, Mthl10 knockdown decreases expression of antimicrobial peptides in response to low temperature; in adult flies, Mthl10 knockdown increases mortality rate following infection with Micrococcus luteus and reduces GBP-mediated secretion of insulin-like peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further report that organismal fitness pays a price for the utilization of Mthl10 to integrate all of these various homeostatic attributes of GBP: We found that elevated GBP expression reduces lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, Mthl10 knockdown extended lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe how our data offer opportunities for further molecular interrogation of yin and yang between homeostasis and longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identification_of_a_GBP_Receptor_by_High-Throughput_Screening_of_Ca2+_Mobilization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously shown that Drosophila GBP recruits the PLC/Ca2+ signaling pathway to mediate innate immune responses (7, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conducted a dsRNA library screen for a GBP receptor, using Ca2+ mobilization in Drosophila S3 cells as a biological readout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This screening was facilitated by our creating a Drosophila S3 cell line that hosts a genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor, GCaMP3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells (S3GCaMP3) were used to record GBP-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization (7) during screening of a dsRNA library that targets 1,729 genes encoding transmembrane proteins (Fig 1 A and B and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each individual dsRNA was screened in replicate plates, generally with good reproducibility (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We adopted a lenient disambiguation approach: A mean Z score of less_than1.5 for any dsRNA pair was considered a hit (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This minimized false negatives, albeit by generating some false positives (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top 17 hits included several genes that encode known Ca2+-signaling proteins (Itpr, Ca-P60A, PMCA, Stim, Orai; Fig 1B and Fig S2B) (10, 11), plus four genes encoding cell-surface proteins: SR-CIV (scavenger receptor protein); Pvr (PDGF/VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase); Oamb (octopamine Ca2+ signaling/cAMP receptor), and Mthl10, an orphan GPCR (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Mthl10 hit was particularly striking: A high Z score mean of 4.6 was obtained from three separate dsRNA pairs (Fig 1B and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed secondary screening using independent dsRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatment of S3GCaMP3 cells with Mthl10 dsRNA diminished GBP-mediated Ca2+ mobilization by 85% (Fig 1 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted further experiments with thapsigargin (TG), which, by inhibition of Ca-P60A, exposes Ca2+ leak from the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby promoting Mthl10-independent, Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry into the cell (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 and Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results that we obtained (Fig 1 CE and Fig S4) show that Mthl10 dsRNA does not indirectly perturb any aspect of Ca2+ signaling that bypasses the cell-surface GBP receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mthl10 is one of 12 members of the Drosophila Mth superclade, which includes Methuselah (Mth) itself, and 11 Mth-like (Mthl) paralogs, indicative of the possibility of functional redundancy (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this family, ligand-specific functional significance has previously only been ascribed to Mth, which regulates secretion of ILPs in response to the ligand Stunted (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, in our primary screen, Mthl10 was the only hit from within the Mth superclade (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed follow-up experiments, in which independent dsRNA constructs were used to knock down each member of the Mth superclade in S3GCaMP3 cells (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only Mthl10 knockdown attenuated GBP-mediated PLC/Ca2+ signaling (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outside of the Mth superclade, there are four more distantly related paralogs, Mthl1, 5, 14, and 15, which are not viable GBP receptors as they appear not to encode a ligand-binding ectodomain (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these, Mthl5, has been reported to contribute to the development of Drosophila heart tube morphology (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, knockdown of each of these four paralogs did not inhibit GBP-mediated PLC/Ca2+ signaling (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In additional secondary screening, knockdown of either SR-CIV or Oamb did not inhibit Ca2+ mobilization (Fig 1E and Fig S6 AC), indicating these genes are false positives in the primary screen (obtained from only one dsRNA pair; Fig 1B); as stated above, our methodology was expected to yield some false positives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for loss of Ca2+ signaling following Pvr knockdown in the primary screen (Fig 1B), that was partly attributed to an off-target reduction in cell proliferation (Fig S5B; see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, loss of GCaMP3 expression following Pvr knockdown ablated GBP-independent fluorescence responses (Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary screening using Fluo-4 fluorescence (9) showed that equivalent numbers of control and Pvr dsRNA-targeted cells yielded similar GBP-mediated Ca2+ responses (Fig S6 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Validation_of_GBP-Binding_to_Mthl10  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used orthologous methodology to interrogate the validity of Mthl10 as a hit from our primary screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3GCaMP3 cells were incubated with GBP that was C-terminally tagged with tetramethylrhodamine (TMR; Fig 2A and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GBP-TMR retained the ability to mobilize Ca2+, albeit with reduced potency (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis by flow cytometry showed that dsRNA-mediated Mthl10 knockdown reduced the intensity of the cell-associated fluorophore signal to the level at which a scrambled-GBP-TMR construct (Fig S1) nonspecifically bound to S3 cells (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with Mthl10 being a GBP receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, knockdown of either Pvr, SR-CIV, or Oamb did not affect specific binding of GBP-TMR to S3 cells, consistent with our conclusion that these genes are false positives in the primary screen (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since Drosophila Mthl10 and Mth are paralogs (12, 13), we used the crystal structure of Mth (17) as a template to model the Mthl10 ectodomain; the Mthl10 surface is predicted to have a shallow groove, into which we docked GBP (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model aided our design of a gene construct for expression of recombinant, epitope-tagged Mthl10 ectodomain, which we purified to apparent homogeneity; the single smeared band around 45 kDa is indicative of glycosylation (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific binding of GBP-TMR to Mthl10 was confirmed by fluorescence polarization (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The affinity of binding was estimated to be 6 Â± 0.07 M (n = 3; Fig 2F), the value likely reflecting a reduction in true GBP affinity due to the addition of the TMR tag (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mthl10_Integrates_Immunological_and_Metabolic_Functions_of_GBP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Drosophila embryos, larvae, and adults, Mthl10 is expressed in a variety of tissues, including the CNS and the fat body (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13 and Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, multiple biological activities of the Mthl10/GBP axis can be anticipated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assign a specific physiological function for Mthl10 within a single cell type, we knocked down the expression of this receptor in the S2 cell line, a hemocyte-like model (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this cell type, GBP regulates both cellular and humoral innate immune activities (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key cellular immune response in S2 cells, ERK-dependent cell spreading, was severely attenuated by Mthl10 knockdown (Fig 2 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the GBP-mediated humoral response, i.e., the expression of genes that encode antimicrobial proteins (AMP) such as Metchnikowin (Mtk) and Diptericin (Dpt), was also strongly blocked by Mthl10 knockdown (Fig 2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult flies exhibit increased expression of Mtk and Dpt in response to GBP overexpression (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that this immunological response is ablated by knockdown of Mthl10 in Drosophila adults (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggested to us that loss of Mthl10 might increase susceptibility to infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Mthl10 knockdown dramatically increases mortality rates following infection with the pathogenic bacterium, Micrococcus luteus (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that many other members of the Mth superclade are expressed in the brain and eviscerated abdomen of Drosophila adults (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of these paralogs showed off-target changes in their degree of expression following Mthl10 knockdown (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GBP has also been shown to promote AMP production in response to noninfectious stress such as low temperature (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exposed Drosophila larvae to 4 Â°C for 16 h, which normally elevates Mtk expression; this adaptive response was substantially attenuated by Mthl10 knockdown (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to immunological and stressprotection responses, recent work (8) has described a vital metabolic role for GBP in Drosophila larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, nutrient status sensing by Drosophila target of rapamycin (TOR) (19) stimulates the fat body to secrete GBP, which releases insulin-like peptides (ILP) from the brain (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8 and Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore significant that we identified ILP-producing cells within the brain in which both ILP2 and Mthl10 are coexpressed (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Mthl10 knockdown decreased ILP2 secretion, as evidenced (14) by the resulting increase in its cellular levels (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further discovered that GBP overexpression promotes ILP2 secretion (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control experiments, we found ILP2 expression in the brain was unaffected by either GBP overexpression or by Mthl10 knockdown (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, our data indicate that a close relationship exists between the immunological and metabolic effects of the GBP/Mthl10 axis (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is significant because the mounting of an immune response is bioenergetically expensive (20); it takes a considerable energy investment by innate immune cells to synthesize and secrete a battery of cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coordinating release of ILP2 during stress can mobilize nutrients to satisfy the energetic demands of increased AMP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_GBP_Mthl10_Axis_Influences_Lifespan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An intrinsic property of AMP production is its age-dependent up-regulation (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore notable that dietary restriction, which is known to extend lifespan in animals (2224), is associated with reduced GBP expression in Drosophila (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8 and Fig 3G), which is an antiinflammatory adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, GBP-mediated AMP expression is reduced in dietary-restricted, adult flies (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is intriguing that we found this response to dietary restriction to be phenocopied by Mthl10 knockdown (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the levels of Mtk and Dpt expression in Mthl10 knockdown flies are equivalent to those observed after 24 h of dietary restriction (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, our model (Fig 3D) predicts that TOR hyperactivation by excess nutrient intake (19) could recruit GBP/Mthl10 to exacerbate metabolic inflammation; this may be one of the reasons that nutrient excess in Drosophila can model human metabolic syndrome (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These considerations of some of the potential, negative impacts of GBP/Mthl10 signaling led us to study the lifespan of Mthl10 knockdown flies (Fig 3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that these flies lived significantly longer than did control W1118 lines; in females, Mthl10 knockdown was associated with a 25% increase in half-survival time compared with control flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon exhibited some sexual dimorphism; the benefit in longevity was less in males (12%; Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the well-known impact of dietary restriction upon lifespan is also greatest in female flies (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we found that GBP overexpression significantly shortened lifespan compared with the control lines (16% in females; 10% in males; Fig 3I and Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GBP-mediated, shorter-lived phenotype was not observed in a strain with simultaneous knockdown of Mthl10 (Fig 3I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that Drosophila lifespan can be shortened by stress-activated, GBP-Mthl10 signaling pathways (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Concluding_Comments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most important development to emerge from this study is the deorphanization of Mthl10, through the placement of this GPCR at the epicenter of a molecular pathway that pits stress responses against lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show how various immunological and metabolic properties of a single cytokine, GBP, are integrated through its interactions with Mthl10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we show how the operation of the GBP/Mthl10 axis (Fig 3D) usefully matches nutrient supply to the degree of a metabolically expensive inflammatory response; this is an important topic in immunology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model for GBP/Mthl10 functionality (Fig 3D) also shows how it has the potential to exacerbate metabolic inflammation; this may be one of the reasons that nutrient excess in Drosophila can model human metabolic syndrome (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we link these homeostatic functions for Mthl10 to its strong influence upon longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides a molecular foundation for a theory of aging, namely, that a shortened lifespan can be the ultimate price that a young organism pays to successfully combat short-term environmental stresses (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have also considered our findings in relation to previous work (13) that provides a detailed analysis of the expression pattern of Mthl10 in Drosophila embryos and larvae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, due to extensive expression of Mthl10 in imaginal discs, it has been proposed this gene may influence organogenesis (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore relevant that cytokinesincluding the Mthl10 ligand, GBPare well-known to regulate tissue remodeling and development (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, our determination that Mthl10 regulates GBP-mediated innate immune responses (Fig 2 G and H) seems pertinent to earlier observations (13) that Mthl10 is expressed in hematopoietic tissue (which has immunological functions) and also crystal cells, which encapsulate foreign material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that other ligands for Mthl10 remain to be identified, perhaps as a consequence of the expression of alternate Mthl10 transcripts (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The significance of Mthl10 to longevity and metabolism (Fig 3 D, H, and I and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9) is shared by Mth (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, it was the first gene duplication within the Mth superclade that is believed to have given rise to Mthl10, which did not then undergo any further expansion in Drosophila (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, five further rounds of gene duplication apparently occurred before Mth emerged (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that the connection between lifespan and metabolic homeostasis that we observed for Mthl10 is an ancestral trait rather than adaptive specifically to Mth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is not unusual for gene regulatory networks to be widely conserved, even when certain components might undergo evolutionary turnover (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, recent work (30) has shown that although selection pressure has caused GPCR ectodomains and their ligands to codiversify (e.g., Fig S1), there has nevertheless been considerable conservation of the receptors intracellular interactions with G proteins; as a result, flies and mammals share many of the same downstream signaling cascades (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, GBP exhibits some sequence similarity with the human defensin BD2 (Fig S1); both are small, cationic cytokines produced by protease action upon larger, precursor proteins (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, human BD2 acts through an uncharacterized GPCR to stimulate PLC/Ca2+ signaling to initiate inflammatory responses (31); the current study demonstrates that GBP is also a GPCR ligand that initiates PLC/Ca2+ signaling (7, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we propose that there is general applicability to the concepts that emerge from our integration of immunological, metabolic, and lifespan functions for the GBP/Mthl10 axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals_and_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Drosophila melanogaster were normally reared at 25 Â± 1 Â°C on artificial food containing 8.7% (wt/wt) cornmeal, 5.2% (wt/wt) glucose, 3.5% (wt/wt) dried yeast, 0.3% ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate, and 1.0% (wt/wt) agar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under restricted diet condition, flies were reared on special food containing 5.0% (wt/wt) cornmeal, 5.0% (wt/wt) glucose, 1.0% (wt/wt) dried yeast, 0.3% ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate, and 1.0% (wt/wt) agar (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UAS-GBP strain was generated and as described previously (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UAS-dsMthl10 strain was supplied by NIG-FLY (National Institute of Genetics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actin-gal4 and hs-Gal4 strains were derived as described elsewhere (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Drosophila S2 cells were supplied by Riken BRC and maintained as previously described (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drosophila S3 cells were obtained from Karen Adelman, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prepare S3GCaMP3 cells, we subcloned a GCaMP3 transcript (obtained from Karen Adelman) into pAc5.1/V5-His A vectors (Invitrogen) using the EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites (for primers, see Dataset S2); the vector was transfected into S3 cells along with the pCoBlast vector, using a Drosophila Expression System (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both S3 and S3GCaMP3 cells were maintained and utilized at 25 Â°C in Schneiders medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin (Gibco); 25 g/mL blasticidin (Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium for S3GCaMP3 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Primary_dsRNA_Screen  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dsRNA library was purchased from Harvard/Howard Hughes Medical Institute Drosophila RNAi Screening Center (https://fgr.hms.harvard.edu/); 0.25 g/well of dsRNA was used to target each of 1,729 genes that are annotated or computationally predicted to encode transmembrane proteins that it is targeted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The library is provided in duplicate (34 Ã 384-well plates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average number of unique dsRNA pairs per gene is two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each plate is setup with spare wells (no added dsRNA), which we utilized for the following controls (Fig S2): (i) gain of function, using dsRNA against either Tsr or Atx2; (ii) loss of function controls, using dsRNA against Itpr; (iii) bland controls, using dsRNA against an irrelevant gene, LacZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 104 cells were plated in each well of a dsRNA library plate and incubated in 40 L of culture medium (see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 5 d, GBP-induced fluorescence changes were recorded using a FLIPRTETRA (Molecular Devices) at 25 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excitation wavelength was 488 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence emission was selected with a 510- to 575-nm bandpass filter and monitored simultaneously in all wells of a single plate with a cooled charge-coupled device camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total Ca2+ released ([Ca2+]T) was quantified by integrating the area under each Ca2+ trace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Z scores were calculated as the mean value of every unique dsRNA pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hit was defined by a Z score of less than 1.5 (the mean value for a single dsRNA, assayed in duplicate); Z score = ([[Ca2+]T of each dsRNA]  [average [Ca2+]T of plate]) / [SD of plate [Ca2+]T]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The list of Z scores for every gene is available at https://fgr.hms.harvard.edu/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_Real-Time_PCR_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was prepared from either S2 cells, adult Drosophila, or adult Drosophila tissue, as described previously (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First-strand cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT)1218 primer using ReverTra Ace RT-PCR kit (Toyobo), according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time quantitative PCR analysis was carried out by using the Light-Cycler 1.3 instrument and software (Roche Applied Science).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR specificity was confirmed by sequencing of the PCR products and melting curve analysis at each data point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For assay of gene expression in S3GCaMP3 cells, total RNA was isolated from either control- or Mthl10-dsRNA treated cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III First-Strand (Invitrogen) and analyzed by IQ SYBR Green Supermix and IQ5 RT-PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All samples were analyzed in duplicate or triplicate, and assay variation was typically within 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were normalized according to the expression level of, as indicated, either Tub84D (Tubulin) or rp49, determined in duplicate by reference to a serial dilution calibration curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All primers are listed in Dataset S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For comparison of tested activities of culture cells and gene expression levels of flies or larvae, Tukeys honest significant difference tests were carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ShapiroWilk test, showed that data sets do not deviate from the normality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These statistical analyses were performed using JMP 9.0.2 (SAS Institute).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survival ratio comparison was made with the log rank test, using R version 3.2.2 (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis of Ca2+-signaling dynamics and GBP-TMR binding was performed with a paired t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where representative figures are provided, these are one of at least three biological replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
