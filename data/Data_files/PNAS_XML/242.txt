Warm spring reduced carbon cycle impact of the 2012 US summer drought  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems mitigates the impact of anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions on atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but the strength of this carbon sink is highly sensitive to large-scale extreme climate events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2012, the United States experienced the most severe drought since the Dust Bowl period, along with the warmest spring on record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we quantify the impact of this climate anomaly on the carbon cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that warming-induced earlier vegetation activity increased spring carbon uptake, and thus compensated for reduced carbon uptake during the summer drought in 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This compensation, however, came at the cost of soil moisture depletion from increased spring evapotranspiration that likely enhanced summer heating through land-atmosphere coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The global terrestrial carbon sink offsets one-third of the worlds fossil fuel emissions, but the strength of this sink is highly sensitive to large-scale extreme events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2012, the contiguous United States experienced exceptionally warm temperatures and the most severe drought since the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s, resulting in substantial economic damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is crucial to understand the dynamics of such events because warmer temperatures and a higher prevalence of drought are projected in a changing climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we combine an extensive network of direct ecosystem flux measurements with satellite remote sensing and atmospheric inverse modeling to quantify the impact of the warmer spring and summer drought on biosphere-atmosphere carbon and water exchange in 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consistently find that earlier vegetation activity increased spring carbon uptake and compensated for the reduced uptake during the summer drought, which mitigated the impact on net annual carbon uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early phenological development in the Eastern Temperate Forests played a major role for the continental-scale carbon balance in 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The warm spring also depleted soil water resources earlier, and thus exacerbated water limitations during summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that the detrimental effects of severe summer drought on ecosystem carbon storage can be mitigated by warming-induced increases in spring carbon uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the results also suggest that the positive carbon cycle effect of warm spring enhances water limitations and can increase summer heating through biosphereatmosphere feedbacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evidence_from_in_Situ_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the site scale, spring (MarchMay) 2012 anomalies of net carbon uptake significantly increased with temperature (Fig 1A), on average by 15 ± 13 g C m2 season1 (mean ± uncertainty: +29%, n = 22; SI Appendix, Table S2) across all sites, relative to the baseline 20082010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase was linked to earlier and increased vegetation activity (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some sites also experienced precipitation deficits during spring, but the effect on net carbon uptake across sites was not significant (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, summer (JuneAugust) net carbon uptake decreased at most sites by 24 ± 18 g C m2 season1 (17%, n = 22), and these reductions were highly correlated with drought intensity (R2 = 0.64, P less_than 0.001; Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of all sites, 13 (59%) experienced summer drought conditions with precipitation deficits of at least 10% or 19326 mm season1 (SI Appendix, Fig S2 and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, these sites were used to investigate the process level impact of concurrent warmer spring and summer drought at the ecosystem scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spring net carbon uptake increased on average by 25 ± 11 g C m2 season1 (+103%, n = 13), and summer uptake decreased by 32 ± 18 g C m2 season1 (25%) at sites that experienced summer drought (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, a warmer spring compensated, on average, for 78% of drought-related reductions in summer net carbon uptake, and reduced the impact of summer drought on annual net carbon uptake to 17 ± 18 g C m2 season1 (11% compared with baseline; Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A consistent, although smaller, partial compensation pattern was detected for GPP at summer drought-affected sites from both direct EC measurements (40% compensation) and satellite-derived MODIS GPP estimates (39% compensation; SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Large-Scale_Carbon_Cycle_Impact  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the regional scale, the Great Plains ecoregion (23) experienced the strongest drought conditions during summer (SI Appendix, Table S5), with reductions of 123 g C m2 season1 (36%) in GPP from MODIS estimates (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NEP estimates from inverse modeling by CarbonTracker (CTE2014) showed reductions of 71 g C m2 season1 (72%) in net carbon uptake in the Great Plains, which exceeded the reductions in other ecoregions (SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substantial summer reductions were also found for the Northern Forests ecoregion (GPP: 114 g C m2 season1, NEP: 38 g C m2 season1) and for the Eastern Temperate Forests ecoregion (GPP: 86 g C m2 season1, NEP: 17 g C m2 season1), which includes large parts of the Midwest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the warm spring of 2012, these three ecoregions also had among the strongest increases in GPP, ranging from 32 to 75 g C m2 season1 (SI Appendix, Table S6), which was particularly evident across the Appalachians (Fig 3A) because tree phenology benefitted substantially from warmer temperatures during spring (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Eastern Temperate Forests showed by far the highest increase in spring NEP (69 g C m2 season1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual net carbon uptake in the Great Plains was reduced by 46 g C m2 y1, making the ecoregion close to carbon neutral in 2012 (5 g C m2 y1 vs. baseline: 41 ± 24 g C m2 y1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Eastern Temperate Forests had the highest net uptake during the last decade in 2012 (136 g C m2 y1) and were outside the interannual variability from 2001 to 2011 (58 ± 19 g C m2 y1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across the entire CONUS, NEP estimates by CarbonTracker showed total increases of 0.24 Pg C season1 during spring and reductions of 0.23 Pg C season1 in summer 2012 (see SI Appendix, Table S6 for mean values in g C m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2012, spring net carbon uptake (0.76 Pg C season1) was the highest and summer carbon uptake was the lowest (0.38 Pg C season1), and both seasons were clearly outside the interannual variability across the CONUS during the last decade (SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the compensation of drought-induced reductions in summer by increases from warm spring, and lower carbon losses during winter and fall (Fig 3H), net annual carbon uptake across the CONUS was above average in 2012 (0.11 Pg C y1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Net annual carbon uptake in 2012 (0.33 Pg C y1) was the second highest estimated by CarbonTracker since 2001 and outside the interannual variability of the baseline (0.22 ± 0.05 Pg C y1; SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Water_and_Energy_Flux_Feedback  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across all EC sites (n = 22), summer increases in sensible heat (H) flux were highly correlated with reductions in ET or latent energy (LE; R2 = 0.54, P less_than 0.001; SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At sites with summer drought, we observed LE increases of 38 ± 15 MJ m2 season1 (mean ± uncertainty: +14%, n = 13) during early spring and reductions of 66 ± 24 MJ m2 season1 (12%) during summer 2012 relative to baseline (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction in evaporative cooling was associated with soil water limitations and elevated VPD (SI Appendix, Table S8) causing stomatal closure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased ET during spring and reduced ET during summer were also evident from MODIS, both for these sites and at larger regional to continental scales (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the sites with summer drought, our results indicate that the warming-induced increase in vegetation activity during spring caused an earlier depletion of water resources (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9), and thus contributed to soil water limitations during summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This depletion resulted in a relative heating contribution from increased H during the period of peak insolation in summer (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the magnitude of a potential summer heating enhancement by earlier spring vegetation activity, we quantified the impact for sites located in the center of the drought in the Midwest (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sites had summer precipitation deficits of 300 ± 26 mm season1 (74%, mean ± SD), and spring temperatures were warmer by 4.8 ± 1.9 °C (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier vegetation activity was evident in site observations of GPP (Fig 4C) and satellite EVI (SI Appendix, Fig S11), resulting in increased LE, and induced an earlier drawdown in soil moisture (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daily soil moisture was highly and negatively correlated to LE (R2 = 0.72, P less_than 0.001) and GPP (R2 = 0.73, P less_than 0.001) during spring 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the beginning of summer, cumulative ET since January 1 was, on average, 40 mm (98 MJ m2, 26%) higher, which was a 12-d forward shift in the total amount of evaporated water compared with the baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During summer, evaporative cooling through LE was reduced by 201 ± 32 MJ m2 season1 (24%), with the majority of excess energy released through increased H (178 ± 19 MJ m2 season1 or 107%; Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in H had a relative heating effect (Fig 4B) that exceeded elevated incoming shortwave radiation (SI Appendix, Fig S12) and likely contributed to anomalous surface heating of 2.0 ± 1.7 °C (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results consistently show increased carbon uptake in spring and substantial reductions during summer in 2012 across independent observations at the site scale and at the regional to continental scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides further evidence from direct observations for an offset in summer reductions by a warmer spring (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased vegetation activity during the warm spring in 2012 (24) compensated for reductions in net carbon uptake by the severe summer drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the CONUS area remained a carbon sink of 0.33 Pg C y1 during 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the European 2003 summer drought resulted in a carbon source of 0.50 Pg C y1, equivalent to 4 y of carbon uptake across Europe (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A longer lasting drought in western North America reduced carbon uptake by 0.030.30 Pg C y1 during 20002004 but did not turn this region into a carbon source (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, the 2011 Texas drought was reported to have reduced net carbon uptake by 0.23 Pg C y1, which was the largest anomaly in this region since 1950 (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regional estimates of net carbon uptake in 2012 showed that 71% of the total summer reductions across the CONUS originated from the Great Plains (0.16 Pg C season1), whereas 74% of the increased spring uptake originated from the Eastern Temperate Forests (0.18 Pg C y1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can therefore be argued that the higher spring uptake in the Eastern Temperate Forests was the main reason that the large-scale 2012 summer drought did not result in reductions of net annual carbon uptake across the CONUS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spring compensation emphasizes the important ecosystem service of forests for climate and their contrasting response to climate anomalies compared with grasslands (6, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ensemble EC site-scale measurements showed good agreement with the continental-scale estimates by MODIS and CarbonTracker, suggesting that this ensemble of sites represents the large-scale impact of the 2012 climate anomaly across the CONUS quite well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that the carbon cycle anomaly during spring and summer 2012 was outside the range of data uncertainty (for EC sites; Fig 2A) and also outside the large-scale interannual variability (for MODIS and CarbonTracker CTE2014) compared with the baseline (Fig 3 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although EC measurements across all sites were not available before 2008, long-term observations from MODIS and CarbonTracker provide evidence that the baseline years were within the 20012011 seasonal variability for carbon fluxes across the CONUS, yet higher during summer (SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term precipitation data show that summer was slightly wetter (+3%) during the baseline period, although with similar variability compared with the reference period (SI Appendix, Fig S13 and Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, by comparing the extremely dry summer of 2012 with a wetter than normal baseline period, we potentially overestimate the carbon cycle impact of the 2012 event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using MODIS and CarbonTracker data since 2001, we estimate that the potential bias from our baseline selection for the continental-scale impact of 2012 is 11% or less seasonally and 10% or less annually (SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the magnitude of the 2012 drought, uncertainties due to baseline selection thus play a minor role for the large-scale impact assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Due to the coupling of ecosystem carbon and water fluxes, the warmer spring also increased ET, and thus depleted soil water resources earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2012, soil water recharge from precipitation did not occur (Fig 4D); thus, the increased ET in spring further contributed to drought-related soil water limitations (primarily from reduced precipitation) during summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaporative cooling (from LE) inhibits H flux from ecosystems to the atmosphere and prevents extreme heating on the surface and in the lower atmosphere during the period of peak insolation in summer (baseline shown in Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in ET due to water limitations during summer 2012 weakened this cooling effect, shifting the partitioning of available energy toward H, and thus contributed to a positive (enhancing) ecosystem heating feedback (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the positive effect of higher carbon uptake during the warmer spring comes at the cost of soils drying out earlier, and thus potentially exacerbating drought and increasing summer heating in regions with limited soil moisture reserves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Drier soils cause feedback mechanisms that amplify the coupling between drought and heat when ET is inhibited (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous evidence for such heating feedback amplification from spring soil-moisture deficits was shown for European summer heat waves and also indicated that early summer precipitation can mitigate the effect (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central Great Plains, which includes parts of the Midwest, is a region with strong biosphere-atmosphere coupling during summer (i.e., soil moisture also has substantial impacts on local precipitation) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil moisture deficits thus have a positive (enhancing) feedback on drought conditions in this region, highlighting the implications of potential water depletion from earlier vegetation activity during warm spring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our analyses cannot quantify the actual heating contribution from the ecosystem feedback during the 2012 summer drought, these results provide further evidence for a linkage between earlier vegetation activity during a warmer spring, the associated depletion of soil water, and the enhanced heating from reductions in evaporative cooling (28) during subsequent summer drought (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of warm spring and summer drought can also affect species composition based on plant ecophysiology (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although exceptional for the past century, it was found that the sequence of atmospheric circulation patterns that caused the 2012 drought resulted mostly from natural variability in climate (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, large-scale droughts, such as the 2012 drought, are projected to become more prevalent with global warming (18, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) show warmer spring and drier summer mean conditions by the end of this century across the CONUS (SI Appendix, Fig S1), implying that such years will likely occur more frequently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the response observed in 2012 is representative of what can be expected under future climate change remains subject to large uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, CO2-induced increases in plant water-use efficiency are expected to affect plant function strongly, and could influence the effects of drought (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the uncertainties in climate projections are linked to uncertainties in carbon cycle feedbacks (31), it is important to better understand the response of the biosphere to seasonal climate anomalies and their effects on the annual carbon balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the impact of a concurrent warmer spring and summer drought depends on the specific climate anomalies (SI Appendix), the 2012 event serves as an example that enables the quantification of the impact of such climate anomalies on the carbon and water cycles, and the surface energy budget.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conclude that the warm spring reduced the impact of the 2012 summer drought on net annual carbon uptake across the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional differences played a major role for the continental-scale carbon balance in 2012: increased spring uptake in the Eastern Temperate Forests largely compensated for reduced summer uptake in the Great Plains, emphasizing, in part, the ecosystem service value of these forests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the positive carbon cycle effect of a warmer spring and earlier vegetation activity also had potentially detrimental side effects on the water cycle by increasing ET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous evidence on the water cycle effects of spring warming (11), our results suggest that the earlier depletion of soil water can increase ecosystem vulnerability to drought and exacerbate warmer land surface temperatures through reduced evaporative cooling (28) during summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further research is needed to understand such vegetationclimate feedbacks better, because they can have large implications for the management of water resources and can potentially further increase the risk of water shortages during the period of highest demand in midsummer (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the magnitude of the spring compensation effect for the carbon cycle and hydrological feedbacks of earlier vegetation activity highlight the importance of accurately predicting ecosystem responses to spring warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed the impact of concurrent warmer spring and summer drought on land-atmosphere carbon and water exchange across the United States in 2012 using (i) direct measurements of EC, (ii) satellite remote-sensing observations from MODIS, and (iii) estimates from the atmospheric inverse model CarbonTracker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Baseline_Selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anomalies of 2012 were derived relative to the baseline of 20082010 (as anomaly = 2012  baseline) for a consistent reference period across all data streams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selection of this baseline was constrained by two factors: climate and the availability of in situ measured EC data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three consecutive years 20082010 were closest to the long-term mean of dry and wet areas across the CONUS (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean summer precipitation during the baseline was marginally above average (+3%) and showed similar variability compared with the long-term reference period 19822011 (SI Appendix, Fig S13 and Tables S5 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standardized precipitation index (SPI) showed minor deviations from the long-term mean and indicated slightly wetter conditions during the baseline (SI Appendix, Fig S4 and Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We excluded 2011 from the baseline to avoid confounding effects from severe drought in the South and Southwest (25) during that year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides these climatological constraints, the number of available EC sites was increasingly limited before 2008.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_EC_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Direct measurements of half-hourly ecosystem CO2, water vapor, and energy fluxes were used from 22 sites with at least 5 y of data, representing the major ecosystems across the United States (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Croplands were excluded from our analyses of individual sites due to the effect of management on the seasonal timing of ecosystem fluxes, both from crop rotation and from the varying timing of planting/harvest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual site data were standardized and rigorously quality-filtered according to established standards within AmeriFlux (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As suggested by previous comparisons using large EC datasets (33), we used a consistent approach to gap-fill ecosystem fluxes across all sites to quantify total fluxes from a daily to annual scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates of GPP (photosynthesis) were derived from measured NEP by using nighttime data consisting of respiratory fluxes only (i.e., no photosynthesis) and extrapolating to daytime using temperature response functions fit to moving bins within each year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive NEP denotes uptake by the biosphere, and negative values indicate carbon losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Friction-velocity (u*) thresholds were specified by the site principal investigators for each site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More details on the flux partitioning and gap-filling methods used are provided by Barr et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seasonal impact analysis was limited to sites that experienced drought conditions with precipitation deficits of at least 10% during summer (13 of 22 sites; SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ensembles were calculated as the daily, monthly, and seasonal mean of integrated fluxes across sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of seasonal compensation (Comp, %) was calculated from the 2012 seasonal anomalies of spring relative to summer carbon uptake as Comp = 100 * (Spring/Summer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Uncertainty_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The total flux uncertainty includes the components of uncertainties resulting from random measurement errors, gap-filling, and flux partitioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flux uncertainty was estimated at the native temporal resolution (half-hourly or hourly) and propagated to aggregate time scales using a Monte-Carlo approach (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uncertainties for the 2012 flux anomalies were derived from the uncertainties of the baseline and 2012 asUncAnomaly=UncBaseline2+Unc20122.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Satellite_Remote-Sensing_and_Atmospheric_Inverse_Modeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regional and continental scale spatial analyses were based on satellite observations by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) MODIS and estimates from the atmospheric inverse model CarbonTracker (CTE2014 and CTE2015) (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For regional analyses, we used the level I ecoregions (23) provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregion-resources).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MODIS GPP, ET, and potential ET (PET) data were provided by the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group at the University of Montana (Q. Mu and M. Zhao, ftp://ftp.ntsg.umt.edu/pub/MODIS/NTSG_Products).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MODIS EVI data were provided by the US Geological Survey (e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLT/MOD13C2.005).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CarbonTracker data were provided by Wageningen University (www.carbontracker.eu), and biospheric net fluxes were extracted without fire emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posterior biospheric fluxes in CarbonTracker are derived by optimization of modeled prior net carbon exchange from the Simple-Biosphere-Model-Carnegie-Ames Stanford Approach (SiBCASA) biogeochemical model (37) using atmospheric in situ CO2 observations (38) and the atmospheric transport model TM5 (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Drought_Indices_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Large-scale precipitation was derived from reanalysis data by NASAs Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-scale SPI data were extracted from the Global Integrated Drought Monitoring and Prediction System (GIDMaPS, drought.eng.uci.edu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also evaluated site-scale SPI based on long-term precipitation records from nearby meteorological stations (SI Appendix), but only used these data to quantify drought across ensembles of multiple sites (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we used the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), which is a physically based drought index linked to evaporative demand that includes both land-surface (via ET) and atmospheric feedbacks (via PET) (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ESI was calculated from observed ET and PET (estimated by PenmanMonteith parameterization) as ESI = 1  (ET/PET).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaporative fraction (EF) was calculated from EC-measured LE and H fluxes as EF = LE/(LE+H), with values larger than 0.5 indicating that LE (ET in energy units) is dominating the available energy transfer to the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Seasons were classified according to the meteorological definition, with spring as the 3-mo period of MarchMay and summer as the 3-mo period of JuneAugust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The software R was used for all statistical data analyses (R Development Core Team, www.r-project.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
