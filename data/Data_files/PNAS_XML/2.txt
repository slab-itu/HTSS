title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Precursors to morality in development as a complex interplay between neural, socioenvironmental, and behavioral facets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Research in the past decade indicates that the building blocks of morality are present very early in development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about the neural and environmental mechanisms underlying their emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show, for the first time, to our knowledge, using multiple levels of analysis, the complex integration of bottomup and topdown processes in sociomoral evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain wave differences elicited by witnessing the prosocial and antisocial behaviors of others predicted infants and toddlers subsequent attraction to prosocial others and were associated with parental values of justice and fairness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This developmental social neuroscience perspective provides empirical and theoretical clarity to the biological basis and brainbehavior processes involved in moral sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nature and underpinnings of infants seemingly complex, third-party, social evaluations remain highly contentious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical perspectives oscillate between rich and lean interpretations of the same expressed preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some argue that infants and toddlers possess a moral sense based on core knowledge of the social world, others suggest that social evaluations are hierarchical in nature and the product of an integration of rudimentary general processes such as attention allocation and approach and avoidance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these biologically prepared minds interact in social environments that include significant variation, which are likely to impact early social evaluations and behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study examined the neural underpinnings of and precursors to moral sensitivity in infants and toddlers (n = 73, ages 1224 mo) through a series of interwoven measures, combining multiple levels of analysis including electrophysiological, eye-tracking, behavioral, and socioenvironmental.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous EEG and time-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) and gaze fixation were recorded while children watched characters engaging in prosocial and antisocial actions in two different tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All children demonstrated a neural differentiation in both spectral EEG power density modulations and time-locked ERPs when perceiving prosocial or antisocial agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-locked neural differences predicted childrens preference for prosocial characters and were influenced by parental values regarding justice and fairness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this investigation casts light on the fundamental nature of moral cognition, including its underpinnings in general processes such as attention and approachwithdrawal, providing plausible mechanisms of early change and a foundation for forward movement in the field of developmental social neuroscience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Behavioral  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following the SET, children were shown two characters: the prosocial helper and the antisocial hinderer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Childrens preferential reaching (from 54 children who explicitly reached for one character or the other) for helper versus hinderer did not significantly vary from chance, with 27 children reaching for the helper and 27 children reaching for the hinderer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally results from a binary logistic regression indicate that age (in months) does not predict preference for the helper or hinderer ( = 0.049, nonsignificant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Children also engaged in a sharing task where they were given two toys to play with, one desirable and one less desirable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After playing with the toys, when children were prompted with Can I have one?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15 children shared both toys immediately, 11 shared their preferred toy, 7 shared their nonpreferred toy, 4 additional children shared a toy but showed no preference for one toy over the other, and 34 children did not share either toy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a dichotomy (sharing/not sharing), there were no significant differences in the number of children who shared a toy (n = 37) and the number who did not share (n = 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, age (in months) was not a predictor of sharing behaviors ( = 0.036, nonsignificant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Child_and_Parents__Dispositions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three aspects of childrens temperament were calculated from a commonly used measure in early childhood, the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire-Very Short Form (ECBQ-VSF): surgency (level of positive affect), negative affect, and effortful control (an index of early self regulation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Childrens effortful control was directly related to the probability of children sharing (r = 0.269, P less_than 0.05), after controlling for age-related differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, childrens surgency and negative affect were unrelated to sharing behaviors or reaching preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parental disposition in perspective taking from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) was positively related to the probability of children sharing (r = 0.284, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parental personal distress (IRI) was inversely related to childrens probability of sharing (r = 0.317, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spectral_Densities_and_Preferential_Looking_During_Early_Social_Evaluation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Global neural resource allocation differences for helping versus hindering scenes were examined using a 2 (Laterality, Left/Right) × 2 (Region, Frontal/Parietal) × 2 (Condition) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) on 58 Hz EEG power density, controlling for age during the SET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant main effect of condition was observed, F(1, 19) = 4.470, P less_than 0.05, 2 = 0.190, with the global power density of 58 Hz for helping scenes less than the global power density of 58 Hz for hindering scenes, indicating greater underlying cortical activation for helping than hindering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frontal 58 Hz asymmetries were examined with a 2 (Frontal Laterality, Left/Right) × 2 (Condition) repeated-measures ANOVA with 58 Hz EEG power density as the dependent variable, controlling for age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant Laterality × Condition interaction was detected, F(1, 23) = 4.83, P less_than 0.05, 2 = 0.174, with greater asymmetry (left frontal 58 Hz power density  right frontal 58 Hz power density) when observing hindering compared with helping scenarios (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from a 2 (Condition) × 2 (Agent/Target) repeated-measures ANOVA on overall percent looking-time show no significant main effect of condition but a significant interaction of Condition × Character, F(1, 36) = 39.73, P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction was driven by a significantly greater fixation time to the agent of helping than the beneficiary of helping, t(37) = 6.978, P less_than 0.001 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Continuous_EEG_Asymmetries_During_Evaluation_and_Resting_State__and_Attentional_Differences_as_They_Relate_to_Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Resting state 58 Hz power density frontal asymmetries did not predict reaching preferences (r = 0.199, nonsignificant) nor sharing (r = 0.247, nonsignificant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, frontal power density asymmetry during the SET did not predict character reaching preference (r = 0.029, nonsignificant) or sharing behavior (r = 0.088, nonsignificant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, differential fixation to helping scenes versus hindering scenes, as assessed with eye-tracking, was not related to reaching preference (r = 0.249, nonsignificant) or sharing behavior (r = 0.146, nonsignificant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Neural_Temporal_Dynamics_of_Implicit_Moral_Evaluations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the CMST, three time windows of interestan early, 200300 ms; a midrange, 300500 ms; and a late, 6001,000 mswere identified based on previous research with toddlers and preschool children (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from a comparison of average voltage in the 300500 ms range over parietal electrodes (Pz), and controlling for age-related change, revealed a main effect of condition, F(1, 23) = 4.28, P less_than 0.05, 2 = 0.163, with a greater amplitude for the perception of prosocial scenes than antisocial scenes (see Fig 2 for grand-averaged waveforms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from two (frontal, F3, Fz, F4; parietal, P7, Pz, P8) repeated-measures ANOVAs, controlling for age, on the early time window (200300 ms) found no significant differences by condition in frontal, F(1, 15) = 0.079, nonsignificant, or parietal, F(1, 15) = 0.075, nonsignificant, regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, no significant differences between the perception of harmful and helpful scenes, after controlling for age, were found in the late time window (6001,000 ms) in either frontal, F(1, 22) = 0.138, nonsignificant, or parietal, F(1, 15) = 0.023, nonsignificant, regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Individual_Differences_in_Neural_Temporal_Dynamics_Predict_Social_Preferences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individual differences between average neural activation to the perception of helping versus harmful scenes during the CMST in two windowsmiddle (300500 ms) and late (6001,000 ms)were related to reaching preference for a prosocial over an antisocial character (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relations were maximal over frontal areas in both middle (F4, r = 0.503, P less_than 0.001) and late waveforms (F4, r = 0.466, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Children_s_Temporal_Neural_Dynamics_of_Moral_Evaluation_Are_Related_to_Parental_Values  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parental sensitivity to injustice for others was directly predictive of infants and toddlers ERP differences in the perception of helping versus harmful scenes in the CMST between 300 and 500 ms (Cz, r = 0.357, P less_than 0.05; Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual differences in the 6001,000 ms range were not significantly related to parental individual dispositions toward justice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combining neurophysiolgical measures with sociomoral evaluations and sharing behavior in infants and toddlers is both a challenging and exciting endeavor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a multilevel approach has the potential to provide theoretical and empirical clarity into the nature of the precursors to and ontogeny of the foundations of morality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we also investigated how social and parental values shape the online neural underpinnings of early social evaluation in infants and toddlers and expressed sharing behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Infants and toddlers between the ages of 12 and 24 mo exhibited neural differentiation between the perception of harmful and helpful behaviors of others in two paradigms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, spectral asymmetries were robustly present during the viewing of both types of behaviors in a well-established behavioral task for assessing infants social evaluation (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EEG frontal asymmetry has previously been linked to withdrawal/avoidance when left power density is greater than right power density in response to emotionally valenced stimuli (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our hypotheses, relative asymmetry for left versus right was greater for the perception of hindering than helping, implying the engagement of domain-general mechanisms of withdrawal/avoidance when confronted with aversive stimuli and the reduction of withdrawal when viewing positive stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, EEG markers, in the SET, support the privilege of negative social information in early development, as demonstrated by habituation paradigms with 3-mo-old infants (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preferential reaching for a helper over a hindering agent has been documented in younger children in some studies (41) but not in another using a similar paradigm (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current study failed to find such a preference in older toddlers, suggesting early and strong individual, rather than group, differences in preferring a helper that are directly related to the neural dynamics processing of perceiving prosocial and antisocial characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result provides a more nuanced view of developing sociomoral evaluations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Infants and toddlers also expressed preferential looking (as measured with average fixation time to two different predefined areas of interest around the agent and recipient/victim of each scenario) toward a prosocial agent, rather than the beneficiary of an action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, no global fixation differences were detected between the observation of prosocial and antisocial actions, only the aforementioned interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous investigations of infant social evaluation (40, 41) have relied on researcher-coded looking behavior, wherein the specificity of an infants visual fixations is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some have argued that the resulting visual preference data and procedures vary across studies (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of eye-tracking technologies in infants has become more commonplace, allowing for an expanded scope in testing, but is challenging to use (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, infants and toddlers fixations for agents versus beneficiaries/victims of social interactions could be disentangled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants clearly demonstrate a focus on the agent of prosocial actions, rather than the beneficiary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result expands one recent ERP study with 6-mo-old infants wherein greater P400 amplitudes (thought to index attention) for the memory of a previously prosocial agent compared with an antisocial agent were evoked (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, infants and toddlers exhibit a distinct focus on actors who help others and appear to be unmotivated to focus on a beneficiary of a positive action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern of gaze fixation, together with recent empirical findings in developmental science, provide a window into how infants make sense of the behavior of intentional agents engaging in morally laden actions (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using an elaborate time-locked third-party implicit social evaluation paradigm affords a more precise investigation of the mechanisms underlying moral computations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clear neural differentiations between the perception of positive and negative social interactions were detected in infants and toddlers with the CMST ERP paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the condition-level difference that reached significance was in an early to midrange 300500-ms window that has previously been associated with relatively automatic allocation of cognitive resources to salient visual stimuli (37, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean amplitude for the perception of prosocial behaviors exhibited a greater absolute amplitude than that of antisocial behaviors, reflecting increased neural engagement in response to positive social interactions and is consistent with behavioral evidence suggesting the allocation of additional computational resources to evaluate prosocial or fair behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the wealth of developmental work on a negativity bias in the perception of social behaviors, this pattern of response was expected; that is, perceived negative social interactions are more readily processed, because they trigger avoidance and defense mechanisms, which require less cognitive control and associated neural resources (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative interpretation of an infants social evaluations, consistent with this ERP result, is that good behaviors are more novel to them and thus elicit additional computations, whereas bad behaviors are more common and prompt an automatic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results seem to indicate that there is an increased recruitment of resources/computations in processing the anticipation of prosocial outcomes compared with antisocial outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a processing difference has also been documented in preschoolers and adult participants when viewing good versus bad actions or interpersonal help versus interpersonal harm, respectively (22, 26, 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, childrens time-locked neural differentiations between these good and bad actions in the CMST predicted their character preference (preferential reaching toward a hindering or helping character).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous investigations with children and adults examining brainbehavior and braindispositional links in the domain of morality have demonstrated a consistent pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual differences in modulations to later, controlled ERPs (P300, LPP) predict actual sharing behaviors in children (22) and are thought to be related to prosocial dispositions (46) and cognitive empathy and perspective-taking in adults (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, infants and toddlers modulations in Nc (300500 ms) and LPP/PSW (6001,000 ms) over frontal electrodes were predicted by their previous preference for helpful over hindering characters (from the SET).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results illustrate continuity in early social evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those infants who prefer prosocial characters in one behavioral task show the greatest neural differentiation to prosocial versus antisocial actions in an implicit moral evaluation task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, infants and toddlers individual differences in Nc (300500 ms) for viewing positive versus bad actions or in LPP/PSW (6001,000 ms) were not related to the expression of sharing behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although sharing behaviors in infancy and toddlerhood appear to be common (47), many have questioned whether such early expressions are actually representative of morality or rather early self-regulation, compliance, and effortful control (48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the latter argument, our results suggest that sharing propensity is directly related to childrens temperamental effortful control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably, the values of parents regarding justice and their cognitive empathic dispositions already influence toddlers own neural processing of these morally laden scenarios and their propensity to share, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Empathetic disposition and justice motivation are distinct constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work using both personality trait measures combined with moral judgment (50), functional MRI during moral evaluation (35), and high-density EEG/ERPs also during moral evaluation (34) indicates that justice sensitivity is largely guided by reasoning and computations from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and is related, in the same individual, to their own moral cognition but not necessarily their own behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in the current study, parental attitudes toward justice are related to online neural moral evaluation in their children but not behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relatively automatic differences (300500 ms) toward prosocial versus antisocial actors in infants and toddlers ERPs were predicted by their parents sensitivity to injustice for others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Children of those parents who reported higher dispositions in justice motivation demonstrated the greatest neural difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, parental cognitive empathy predicted childrens sharing (or compliance) behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several potential explanations for these parentchild value transmissions are conceivable, including passive, active, or evocative genes by environmental effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parents may directly teach their children these priorities, they may set up environments that allow their children to obtain these values, or childrens characteristics may, in and of themselves, evoke similar environments to those in which their parents were reared (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These previously unidentified and intriguing findings warrant further investigation to decipher what contributes to such an early parentchild reflection of values, which may either be based on biological or socioenvironmental influences, or more likely a dynamic and complex developmental, interactional process between the two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The notion that observed behavioral differences in infants evaluations of prosocial and antisocial agents are markers of or precursors to more complex moral cognition remains highly contentious (13, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides compelling evidence that infants and toddlers discriminate between the prosocial and antisocial actions of others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific neural computations can be identified, including assymetrical frontal spectral power densities during social evaluation, eye-tracking differences in social evaluation, and time-locked condition differences between 300 and 500 ms in the CMST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these results suggest that this differentiation is relatively basic in nature, rooted in approach/withdrawal tendencies and rudimentary resource allocation to relevant stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that domain-general self-regulation and attention systems underlie early social and moral evaluation, supporting mounting evidence from the neuroscience of morality (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted, however, that although the processes and mechanisms of implicit social and moral evaluation in infants and toddlers appear to rely on domain-general processes, the distinction between prosocial and antisocial characters does modulate the relative engagement of these systems, suggesting a possible domain specificity to relative recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, the convergent evidence from multiple measures used in the present study identified specific neural computations underpinning early sociomoral evaluations and their relation to moral preferences as well as parental dispositions, which goes beyond what observational and behavioral assessments can provide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates the potential of developmental social neuroscience to provide productive, new, and exciting directions for the study of moral development, when stemming from an integration of neurobiology, behavior, and social environment (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Seventy-three children between the ages of 12 and 24 mo (M = 18.69 mo, SD = 6.35; n = 37 females) were recruited from a large Midwestern city.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All parents were compensated for their childrens inclusion in the study, and infants were given a small gift (for sample size on each measure, see EEG/ERP Collection and Data Analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon arrival, parents provided consent and were asked to fill out a series of questionnaires measuring their own dispositions toward empathy and sensitivity to fairness and justice as well as basic demographics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Children were acclimatized to the laboratory and then brought to the EEG testing room and seated on their parents lap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parents were instructed to remain silent during the testing and had a pair of blinding glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 17-channel EEG cap (EasyCap, Brain Products) was applied, and impedances were reduced to less than 30 kOhm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following impedance reduction, infants and toddlers watched the SET, completed a preferential reaching paradigm, had 4 min of resting state EEG collected, then viewed harmful and helping scenarios in the CMST, and finally played an infant sharing game.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eye-tracking was continuously monitored during the two EEG tasks with an SMI red-M device (120 Hz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study was approved by the University of Chicago institutional review board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dispositional_Measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parents were asked to fill out several questionnaires about their children and themselves to assess dispositional empathy: the ECBQ-VSF (53), the short form of the Sensitivity to Justice Scale (54), and the IRI (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These standard scales are widely used in many studies of social behavior in young children and adults (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Resting_State_EEG  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Resting state EEG assessment was modeled after a common method used with infants, continuously spinning a large bingo ball cage with colored balls (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cage was spun for a 1-min period, followed by a break (repeated four times), collecting a total of 4 min of continuous EEG data per infant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SET  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this variant of the task, children observed a shape (e.g., a circle) attempting to climb a hill (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They then saw another shape either hinder (block the shape from moving upward) or help (push the shape up the hill).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each scene lasted 15 s on the screen and is repeated at least four times for hindering and four times for helping, randomly, with the experimenter regaining the childs attention between trials, then manually forwarding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Children received one of two versions of the task to account for shape/color preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous EEG was recorded from 17 scalp sites during the presentations as well as eye-tracking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the task, the experimenter put two physical versions of the characters (helper and hinderer) just out of reach of the child, and the infants preferred reaching was documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CMST  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the CMST (22), children watched dynamic visual scenarios of characters intentionally performing either prosocial acts (e.g., sharing food, helping another character after they fall) or antisocial acts, predominately those where a character harms another (e.g., hitting another character, shoving another character).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EEG version of the CMST included 70 trials (35 prosocial and 35 antisocial) 3 s in duration, randomly presented, with a jittered intertrial interval of 5001,500 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sharing_Game  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this game, children were given two toys to play with (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One toy was a very desirable ring, which makes sounds while shaking it and has colorful paintings on the other side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other toy was also a ring but was a single color and made no sound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both toys were handed to the toddler, and the child was given 1 min to play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Childrens preference for toys was documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the minute of free play, an experimenter approached the toddler and said Can I have one?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sharing proclivity was assessed in two ways: first, the toddlers sharing of any toy, and second, the toddlers willingness to share the preferred toy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


EEG_ERP_Collection_and_Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data were collected from a 17-channel (Fz, Cz, Pz, Oz, F3, F4, F7, F8, P3, P4, P7, P8, Fp1, Fp2, TP9, TP10, and ground) active electrode system (actiCHamp, Brain Products) at 2,000 Hz, referenced to Cz, and all electrode impedances were kept below 30 kOhm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrophysiological data analysis was performed using Brain Vision Analyzer 2 software (Brain Products).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were downsampled offline (256 Hz) and rereferenced to the average of all electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EEG data were filtered using an IIR filter of 0.130 Hz and a notch filter of 60 Hz, and artifact rejection was carried out using a 200 µV to 200 µV threshold and visual inspection and rejection by trained researchers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GrattonColes ocular artifact correction was performed on EEG data to identify and correct ocular movements, seeded off electrode Fp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SET_and_Resting_State_Spectral_Density_and_Eye-Tracking_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the SET, the entrance of the helping or hindering character was the starting point for spectral analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous EEG during the helping or hindering actions was subdivided into 500 ms windows with 50% overlap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a Fast Fourier Transform with a Hanning window, power densities were computed for each segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Segments were then averaged for a grand average per individual for each condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based off previous literature, the 58 Hz band was used for all analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For global 58 Hz analyses, frontal (F7, Fz, and F8) and parietal (P7, Pz, and P8) electrodes were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For frontal asymmetry analyses during the task, average power density for left (F3) and right (F4) 58 Hz activity was natural log-transformed and subtracted (leftright).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only infants with at least 60 artifact-free segments were included in all analyses (n = 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, infants and toddlers attention was tracked using an SMI red-m from the entrance of the helping or hindering character 7 s into the 15-s trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 8-s social evaluation period was subdivided into 300-ms segments, and areas of interest were defined surrounding the helping or hindering agent and the beneficiary/victim of the action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average fixation time to each area of interest was exported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Children with average fixations less than 10 ms were eliminated from group analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For resting state asymmetries, continuous EEG from the 4 min was segmented into 1,000-ms segments with 50% overlap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same process used in the social evaluation spectral analyses was implemented, however a left frontal pooled average of power density from F3 and F7 and a right frontal pooled average from F4 and F8 were calculated and subtracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous leftright power density dispositions were then related to behavioral measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Children with at least 100 artifact-free segments (M = 400 segments) were included in further analyses (n = 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CMST_ERP_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following basic EEG preprocessing, data were segmented according to stimulus type (prosocial/antisocial).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epochs were created with 200-ms baselines and 1,000-ms stimulus presentation following the second stimulus presentation (the frame that shows the moral action).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epochs were average by trial type and baseline corrected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corrected averages per individual were combined for a grand average, and ERPs were analyzed across subjects by trial types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to exhaustion, not all participants completed all trials of the CMST or the SET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only children who had at least 15 artifact-free trials for each condition (prosocial/antisocial) in the CMST were included in the grand average (n = 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For measures of individual differences, children with at least 10 artifact-free trials for each condition (n = 25) were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
