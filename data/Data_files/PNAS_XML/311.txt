Temperature-responsive in vitro RNA structurome of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The RNA structure is critical for RNA function in all domains of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the transcriptome-wide RNA structurome of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, a food-borne pathogen, at three physiologically relevant temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis shows that mRNAs tend to have a poorly structured ribosome binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcripts that deviate from this general principle are very good candidates as translational repressor elements, and we identified 16 RNA thermometers able to control gene expression in a temperature-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis demonstrates the power of high-throughput RNA structure probing approaches to identify new sensory and regulatory RNA structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA structures are fundamentally important for RNA function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic, condition-dependent structural changes are able to modulate gene expression as shown for riboswitches and RNA thermometers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By parallel analysis of RNA structures, we mapped the RNA structurome of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis at three different temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This human pathogen is exquisitely responsive to host body temperature (37 °C), which induces a major metabolic transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis profiles the structure of more than 1,750 RNAs at 25 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average mRNAs tend to be unstructured around the ribosome binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We searched for 5-UTRs that are folded at low temperature and identified novel thermoresponsive RNA structures from diverse gene categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regulatory potential of 16 candidates was validated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we present a dynamic bacterial RNA structurome and find that the expression of virulence-relevant functions in Y. pseudotuberculosis and reprogramming of its metabolism in response to temperature is associated with a restructuring of numerous mRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Y_pseudotuberculosis_Transcriptome_and_RNA_Structurome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To catalog RNA structures of the Y. pseudotuberculosis transcriptome, we performed PARS (13) as illustrated in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was isolated from a Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII culture grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an OD600nm of 0.5 (exponential phase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aliquots of rRNA-depleted total RNA were refolded in vitro at 25 °C, 37 °C, or 42 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA samples were then partially digested either with nuclease S1 or RNase V1, enzymes that preferentially cleave phosphodiester bonds 3 of single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) nucleotides, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before this treatment, pilot experiments had been conducted to reach single-hit kinetics at the different temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent capture of degradation products, our library synthesis protocol was optimized for fragments resulting from nucleases digestion (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From each library, between 7.6 and 12.7 Mio cDNA reads were generated and mapped to the YPIII chromosome (NC_010465) and the pYV virulence plasmid (NC_006153).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping statistics are detailed in Dataset S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each read is supposed to represent a S1 or V1 cleavage product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PARS score, defined as the log ratio between the V1 and the S1 events, was calculated for each nucleotide of the transcriptome of Y. pseudotuberculosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A value above zero indicates that the nucleotide is base-paired, and a score below zero represents an unpaired nucleotide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For our analysis, we used 5 ends of 1,642 protein-coding RNAs, 1,614 mapped on the chromosome and 28 on the virulence plasmid pYV (Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This number includes the 1151 previously reported transcriptional start sites (TSSs) (28) and 5 ends of 498 transcripts identified by manual revision of pilot RNAseq experiments (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using the MicrobesOnline resource (29), we identified 1,046 monocistronic RNAs and 568 polycistronic operons on the chromosome and 14 monocistronic and 14 polycistronic operons on plasmid pYV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5-UTRs have a median length of 73 nt and comprise almost 168,000 nt on the chromosome and about 2,400 on the pYV plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight hundred ninety-three ICRs account for about 58,000 nt of the chromosome, with a median length of 34 nt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the accuracy of our approach, we first examined the PARS profiles of well-studied RNA molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our PARS analysis recapitulates ds and ss nucleotides of the 5S rRNA and suggests a thermostable structure (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also the PARS scores obtained for the 84 tRNAs at 25 °C match the expected secondary structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Almost all tRNAs have an average PARS score above zero (from 1.75 to 0.35, with a mean of 0.76) indicating the prevalence of stable structures (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_sRNA_Structurome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The overall architecture is critical for sRNA function and target recognition (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, RNA usually adopts many different structures at physiological temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the structural ensembles of 19 (SI Appendix, Fig S2) of 78 previously described sRNAs in Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII (28), which were sufficiently abundant for PARS profiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are characterized by stable secondary structures at 25 °C, with average PARS profiles ranging from 1.56 to 0.26 and a mean of 0.28 (Datasets S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CsrB and CsrC RNAs are functionally relevant for virulence (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are protein-binding sRNAs that interact with the CsrA regulator via GGA motives (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PARS-derived structures of CsrB and CsrC at virulence temperature suggest a complex architecture exposing multiple GGA sequences (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_mRNA_Structurome_Reveals_Numerous_RNATs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Global RNA structurome studies showed that the region upstream of the start codon is characterized by low structural stability (13, 14, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We aligned 1,642 Y. pseudotuberculosis mRNAs at the translational start site and calculated the average PARS score per nucleotide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, we observed little differences in the folding of 5-UTRs and their downstream ORFs (PARS scores of 0.004 and 0.01, respectively; Fig 3A) and the folding of ICRs and their downstream ORFs (0.008 and 0.01, respectively; Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, both classes of genes show a clear local minimum around the ShineDalgarno (SD) sequence (10 ± 4 nt from the start codon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They exhibit an average PARS score of 0.035 (P less_than 0.01) in 5-UTRs and 0.038 (P less_than 0.01) in ICRs, indicating that accessibility of the RBS is a typical feature of protein-coding transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Translational control elements, like RNATs, are expected to deviate from this general trend as they block the RBS by base pairing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify temperature-responsive RNA structures, we compared the PARS profiles of all SD regions (10 ± 4 from the start codon) at 25 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C and generated a hierarchical list of UTRs and ICRs, in which the RBS is folded at 25 °C but destabilized at 37 °C and 42 °C (ranked according to the PARS score differences between 25 °C and 37 °C in Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventeen candidate UTRs and three ICRs located upstream of genes coding for a variety of different cellular functions were selected from that list for further analysis by reporter gene fusions (Table 1, ranked according to gene categories and PARS differences; sodA was selected as negative control).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strikingly high number of 5-UTRs with temperature-sensitive structures are involved in protection against oxidative stress (grxC, ahpC, trxA, katA, sodB, and sodC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other candidates are positioned upstream of genes for sugar (manX) or oligopeptide (oppA) uptake, amino acid biosynthesis or utilization (cysK-2, putA, and pepN), other metabolic processes (fdoG-1 and aldB), or the heat shock response (yobF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two candidates are associated with Yersinia virulence: ailA (attachment invasion locus protein) and cnfY (cytotoxic necrotizing factor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three representative ICRs derive from upstream regions of iscS-1 (cysteine desulfurase), cpoB/ybgF (tol/pal system protein), and dnaJ (chaperone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PARS profiles of these candidates measured at 25 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C are shown in Dataset S6, and the PARS-driven structures are shown in SI Appendix, Fig S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each region was cloned as translational fusion to bgaB encoding a heat-stable -galactosidase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For two genes (trxA and manX), fusions to a short and long UTR were constructed due to two alternative TSSs (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the bgaB reporter gene system (33), transcription from the PBAD promoter was induced by arabinose, and -galactosidase activity was measured at 25 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ICR between yscW and lcrF, which contains a well-characterized 4U thermometer (6), and sodA served as positive and negative control, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because gene expression generally increases with temperature, only a more than threefold induction was considered a functional RNAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for grxC, ahpC, and aldB and the long fusions to trxA and manX, all selected 5-UTRs and the ICRs were able to repress translation at 25 °C compared with 37 °C and/or 42 °C (Fig 4; corresponding Western blots showing the His-tagged BgaB protein in SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate the PARS-guided predictions of virulence-related transcripts, point mutations designed to stabilize the putative RNATs were introduced into the cnfY and ailA 5-UTRs (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on individual or combined mutations, gene expression was either less temperature responsive or fully repressed, respectively (Fig 5; corresponding Western blots showing the His-tagged BgaB protein in SI Appendix, Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro-transcribed ailA RNA was subjected to structure probing and toeprinting analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the temperature regulation in vivo, the nucleotides in the SD sequencein particular G53 and G54, which are predicted to be paired with C residueswere not accessible to the S1 and T1 nucleases (the latter cuts at single-stranded Gs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cleavage of these residues at 37 °C and 42 °C (Fig 6 A and B) suggests heat-induced destabilization of the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, ribosome binding to the RNA was inefficient at 25 °C but increased with increasing temperature (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this study shows that PARS profiling is an excellent tool to identify translational repressor elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report the genome-scale landscape of RNA structures of the human pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis at three physiologically relevant temperatures reflecting environmental (25 °C), host body (37 °C), and heat shock (42 °C) conditions at single-nucleotide resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the static snapshots of the RNA structurome at different temperatures disclosed the dynamic temperature-responsive reorganization of a bacterial transcriptome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average SD sequence in Y. pseudotuberculosis is unfolded regardless of whether it is located in the 5-UTR or an ICR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is fully consistent with the report that translation efficiency is correlated with the accessibility of the ribosome binding site (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The global information on the 5-UTR structures was exploited to search for RNA signatures not conforming to this general rule with the expectation that such regions might act as translational repressor elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We paid particular attention to the region overlapping the SD sequence and identified numerous structures that are destabilized at elevated temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than 25,000 thermosensitive bases at 1,800 RNA sites were reported in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this eukaryotic organism that is not known to contain RNATs as translational control elements, RNA hairpin structures that melt between 30 °C and 37 °C were shown to be selectively degraded by the exosome, whereas relatively stable structures were not (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our follow-up experiments on the PARS-derived temperature-labile structures of Y. pseudotuberculosis demonstrated that most, but not all, of them are capable of controlling translation in a temperature-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the short forms of two alternative transcripts of trxA and manX were temperature controlled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is reminiscent of the pqsA transcript of P. aeruginosa where only one of two alternative mRNA isoforms folds into a translation-inhibiting structure (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like lcrF (6), the ailA and cnfY genes are virulence related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to thermoregulated transcription, they are under RNAT control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cytotoxic necrotizing factor CNF acts as toxin and is an essential virulence determinant, as it modulates inflammatory responses and counteracts attack by innate immune effectors (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to YadA, the adhesin AilA promotes binding to and subsequent killing of neutrophils via type III secretion-mediated translocation of effector proteins into the target host cell and promotes resistance against complement-mediated killing (3841).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The response to oxidative stress seems to be another important trait that is, at least in part, regulated by RNATs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the glutaredoxin gene grxC and the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase gene ahpC were in the top list of the temperature-responsive RNAs, they did not differentially control reporter gene expression pointing out that structural rearrangements in the 5-UTR are not necessarily associated with translational control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the original sequence context including the ORF might be crucial, which is absent in the bgaB fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with their PARS profiles, thioredoxin, catalase, and superoxide dismutases were regulated in a temperature-dependent fashion, and several nutrient uptake and utilization systems were controlled by temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the RNA structurome revealed that Y. pseudotuberculosis coordinates a wide variety of cellular processes by mRNA-intrinsic structural information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rapidly induce metabolic pathways, the pathogen seems to fully exploit the potential of RNATs that propagate a temperature signal immediately into a translational response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We foresee multiple future applications for RNA structuromics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PARS profiling or other genome-scale strategies such as FragSeq (20) or SHAPE-Seq (42) can easily be extended to other physiologically relevant conditions and temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA preparations from cells grown in minimal media might reveal novel riboswitches, which were underrepresented in our dataset presumably because Yersinia was grown in rich medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison of RNA structuromes from different bacterial strains, for example clinical isolates, might uncover functionally important differences in RNA structures, so called riboSNitches (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report on a P. aeruginosa small colony variant showed that a point mutation in the 5-UTR of a fatty acid biosynthesis gene is sufficient to cause a stable RNA structure with consequence on membrane composition and multicellular behavior (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our ultimate goal will be to correlate the in vitro structurome with the structures as they exist in the living cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the crowded intracellular environment, where an RNA molecule encounters other RNAs, proteins, ions, and ligands, its structure might adopt a conformation different from the one mapped in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membrane-permeable, adenine- and cytosine-modifying probe dimethyl sulfate was used to read out in vivo RNA structures in yeast (23) and A. thaliana (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cell-permeable SHAPE reagent that modifies accessible 2-hydroxy groups of all four nucleotides allowed in vivo probing of the mouse transcriptome (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principal, such approaches are also applicable to bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from charting the intracellular RNA structurome at a given condition, in vivo approaches bear the additional potential to address the contribution of RNA-binding proteins, e.g., Hfq, or sRNAs on a global scale by profiling RNA structures in the corresponding mutant strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in-depth exploration of the currently available and future RNA structurome datasets is going to provide unprecedented information on the functional importance and dynamics of RNA structures in gene regulation and RNA functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Strains, oligonucleotides, and plasmids are listed in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Y. pseudotuberculosis and E. coli were grown aerobically in LB medium at the indicated temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Media were supplemented with ampicillin (150 µg/mL) if required and l-arabinose [0.01% (wt/vol)] to induce the PBAD promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant DNA work was performed according to standard protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Sample_Preparation__Nuclease_Treatment__and_cDNA_Library_Synthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was isolated from an exponential (OD600 = 0.5) culture of Y. pseudotuberculosis YPIII grown aerobically in LB at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two micrograms of rRNA-depleted RNA was refolded and treated with S1 nuclease (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or V1 RNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), at 25 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C under single-hit kinetics conditions according to the PARS protocol (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions were stopped by immediate phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol addition and ethanol precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strand-specific RNA-seq cDNA library preparation and barcode introduction was based on RNA adapter ligation as described previously (28), with some modifications to enrich RNA fragments deriving from nuclease cleavage events, as described in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sequencing_and_Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Single-end sequencing on the HiSeq2500 and Genome Analyzer IIx followed a standard protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All sequenced libraries were clipped and mapped to the YPIII genome (NC_010465) and the pYV plasmid (NC_006153) using Segemehl (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In-house scripts were used to count the cleavage sites per each base, normalize for coverage, and calculate the PARS score at each base as the log ratio of V1/S1 numbers of cuts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PARS profiles of all RNA species were extracted for each of the three experiments at the temperatures 25 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All PARS profiles are deposited at www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/publications/supplements/16-001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final analysis of the PARS sums and computations of the average profiles were done with Microsoft Excel 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Student t tests were computed using R software (version 3.2.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermodynamically optimal RNA structures with and without soft-constraints due to the extracted PARS scores were calculated as described in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implementation of this method in the Vienna RNA package (46) is available since version 2.2.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each PARS profile was transformed to profiles of pairing probabilities applying the logistic function to each score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimal perturbation vectors were derived from the probability vectors (RNApvmin with a / ratio of 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal structures under soft constraints were calculated using RNAfold (shape method W), which internally transformed the perturbation vectors to pseudoenergies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For computed structures of ncRNAs, 5-UTRs (+30 nt of the CDS) and ICRs (+100 nt of the upstream region and +30 nt of the CDS), at 25 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C, see www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/publications/supplements/16-001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary structures are visualized using VARNA applet (version 3.93) (47) and the Vienna RNA package (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

-Galactosidase_Activity_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
E. coli DH5 cells harboring the reporter plasmids were grown to an OD600 of 0.5, reporter gene transcription was induced by 0.01% (wt/vol) l-arabinose, and cultures were split and transferred to 25 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min, cell samples were taken and used for galactosidase assays as described previously (48) and for Western blot analysis (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard deviations were calculated from three technical replicates, and each experiment was performed at least three times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_RNA_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enzymatic structure probing of the in vitro-transcribed and 5-endradiolabeled YPK_1268 (ailA) 5-UTR was performed at 25 °C, 37 °C, and 42 °C, with S1 and T1 nucleases, according to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44, with minor changes (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primer extension inhibition (toeprinting) analysis of YPK_1268 (ailA) 5-UTR was conducted according to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49, with minor modifications (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
