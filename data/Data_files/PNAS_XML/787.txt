BACE inhibition-dependent repair of Alzheimers pathophysiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The accumulation of amyloid- (A) proteins in the brain contributes to Alzheimer´s disease (AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reducing A by inhibiting its production with a -secretase (BACE) inhibitor represents a novel mechanism for treating AD; however, whether this therapeutic strategy is capable of repairing impaired brain circuits associated with AD is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that BACE inhibition is beneficial to all levels of impairment in an AD mouse model: cellular, long-range circuitry, and memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that the rescue is dependent on the reduction of soluble forms of A surrounding amyloid plaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results have mechanistic and therapeutic implications for AD, including A-related memory defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Amyloid- (A) is thought to play an essential pathogenic role in Alzheimer´s disease (AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key enzyme involved in the generation of A is the -secretase BACE, for which powerful inhibitors have been developed and are currently in use in human clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although BACE inhibition can reduce cerebral A levels, whether it also can ameliorate neural circuit and memory impairments remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using histochemistry, in vivo Ca2+ imaging, and behavioral analyses in a mouse model of AD, we demonstrate that along with reducing prefibrillary A surrounding plaques, the inhibition of BACE activity can rescue neuronal hyperactivity, impaired long-range circuit function, and memory defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional neuronal impairments reappeared after infusion of soluble A, mechanistically linking A pathology to neuronal and cognitive dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data highlight the potential benefits of BACE inhibition for the effective treatment of a wide range of AD-like pathophysiological and cognitive impairments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we used 6- to 8-mo-old APP23xPS45 transgenic mice that exhibit severe cerebral A pathology, neuritic and glial cytopathology, and learning and memory deficits (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with a previous protocol (9), we treated the plaque-bearing mice for 68 wk with food pellets containing the BACE inhibitor NB-360 (0.25 mg/g of food, corresponding to a daily oral dose of 20 µmol/kg) or control pellets without the inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NB-360 inhibits the enzymatic activity of BACE, which is required for the generation of A peptides from APP (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, quantification of A revealed a substantial reduction of the A plaque burden (Fig 1 A and B) as well as both insoluble [formic acid (FA)-extracted] and soluble (Triton-Xextracted) A 140 and A 142 levels (Fig 1 CF) after treatment with NB-360.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result confirms and extends previous experimental and clinical studies showing significant lowering of brain A levels by BACE inhibitor treatment (9, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore the consequences of BACE inhibition for neuronal function, we carried out in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging of large populations of layer 2/3 neocortical neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growing evidence from such cellular-level recordings, as well as brain-wide monitoring of activity with blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography, suggest that neuronal hyperactivity is a key pathophysiological feature in AD-like mouse models and in humans with early-stage AD, underlying behavior-relevant local and long-range circuit dysfunctions (1416).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments demonstrated that treatment with NB-360 effectively abolished excess neuronal activity in transgenic mice (Fig 2 AE; Fig S1 shows an example of cortical activity in a WT mouse).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed analysis of all recorded neurons further showed that the treatment substantially reduced the fractions of abnormally hyperactive neurons (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, on an animal-by-animal basis, there was a close correlation between A level and the fraction of hyperactive neurons (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Short-term treatment with NB-360 for just 1 wk resulted in only a partial correction of the hyperactivity phenotype (Fig 2G and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although previous experimental results demonstrated that hyperactive neurons are clustered in plaque-rich regions of the cortex (10, 17), we did not observe such clustering in the NB-360treated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Fig 2B shows that most neurons even in plaque-rich regions exhibit normal activity status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that the microenvironment surrounding amyloid plaques became less toxic after BACE inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a toxicity has been attributed to the presence of prefibrillar A species, including oligomers, which form a diffuse halo around the plaques (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying a recently published protocol for anti-A OC antibody staining (19), we observed a marked reduction in the amount of prefibrillary A in the periphery of plaques (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If such soluble forms of A are indeed crucial for the local circuit dysfunctions, then their reintroduction into APP23xPS45 mice that had been successfully treated with NB-360 should lead to a reemergence of neuronal hyperactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plaques are dimer-rich, and dimers (the smallest A oligomers) are thought to be the principal cytotoxins in the AD brain (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we superfused the cortex of NB-360treated APP23xPS45 mice with synthetic A dimers (21), after which hyperactivity recurred (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the foregoing results provide experimental evidence that prefibrillary forms of A, which are highly enriched around plaques, are the key mediators of hyperactivity, and offer a mechanistic explanation for why hyperactive neurons are clustered near plaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies have shown that hyperactivity is often associated with a shift from the normal pattern of neuronal activity to a more synchronous pattern, which could promote local epileptogenesis (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with those observations, when we quantified the pairwise correlations for all recorded neurons, the untreated transgenic mice showed a greater degree of synchrony than seen in wild-type (WT) mice (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, transgenic mice treated with NB-360 exhibited a significant decrease in neuronal synchrony (Fig 2H and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the effects of BACE inhibitor treatment in nontransgenic animals, we treated WT mice with NB-360 and monitored neuronal activity levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S6, there was no change in activity after the treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently reported evidence indicates that the abnormal accumulation of A in the neocortex of humans with early AD is correlated with an impairment of slow (less_than1 Hz) brain oscillations and memory consolidation (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous study using large-scale Ca2+ fluorescence imaging of the cortical surface, our group found remarkably similar impaired slow-wave activity in APP23xPS45 mice as well (11), strengthening the validity of the mouse model for the study of slow-wave activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we used this method and found that in transgenic mice, treatment with NB-360 changed the slow-wave activity from an impaired, disorganized spatial pattern (Fig 3 A and B) to the WT-like coherent activity pattern (Fig 3 CF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3G summarizes the results from all recorded mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, on an animal-by-animal basis, we found a significant negative correlation between A levels and the degree of restoration of long-range coherence of slow-wave activity (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test independently whether A is sufficient to impair slow-wave activity, we superfused the exposed cortex of NB-360treated transgenic mice with a mixture of synthetic A140 and A142, the most common isoforms of A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that in the NB-360treated mice, the restored activity was abolished by the topical application of A (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these experiments provide strong evidence that the impairment of long-range communication is directly mediated by A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess whether the treatment with NB-360 had any beneficial effects on learning and memory deficits in the aged transgenic mice, we trained mice in a water maze task to find a fixed, visible platform (10, 11) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with WT mice, untreated transgenic mice showed substantially longer escape latencies over all training sessions (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, NB-360treated transgenic mice exhibited significantly improved memory performance relative to the untreated transgenic controls, achieving performance levels not significantly different from those of WT mice (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rule out possible motor defects that could interfere with the ability to perform this task, we calculated the swimming speed, and found no significant difference among the three groups (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that BACE inhibition not only can prevent memory impairment when initiated before the development of A plaques (23, 24), but also has the potential to reverse memory deficits in aged, plaque-bearing mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, on an animal-by-animal basis, the level of long-range coherence of slow-wave activity was inversely correlated with the degree of memory impairment (Fig 4C), consistent with recently reported findings (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, A levels showed a positive correlation with the degree of memory impairment (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that inhibiting BACE reduces the A burden as well as neuronal hyperactivity, leading to the reemergence of long-range functional correlations that are required for normal memory function (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is supported by mediation analysis (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we provide mechanistic evidence that the accumulation of A in the brain promotes dysfunction of local neural circuits and long-range network connectivity, leading ultimately to cognitive impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the pharmacologic inhibition of BACE activity can effectively repair the pathophysiological and cognitive consequences of abnormal A accumulation, even when initiated after the development of extensive A pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results further suggest that neuronal hyperactivity within amyloid plaque-bearing local circuits is likely due to prefibrillary A species, which form a halo around the plaque cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The findings are unexpected in view of previous evidence indicating that at such advanced disease stages, many pathological and cellular processes are chronic and mostly irreversible (7, 8, 2325).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, we found that most dysfunctional neurons in the amyloid-plaque bearing neocortex are still viable, and that their hyperactive phenotype can be reversed by reducing A in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correction of excess neuronal activity correlates with a recovery of long-range circuits as well as memory functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing evidence from animal and human studies indicates that along with contributing to memory impairment, neuronal hyperactivity can worsen A plaque deposition (19, 2628) and even neurodegeneration (29); thus, the BACE inhibitor-associated normalization of neuronal activity levels may directly modify disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to note that our present results are in stark contrast to those of two recent studies that investigated the in vivo efficacy of passive immunotherapies and found that anti-A antibody treatment was associated not only with an exacerbation of neuronal circuit dysfunction (7) but also with an increased risk of sudden death, likely due to fatal seizures (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These discrepant results might be explained by differences in the action profiles of these treatments, in which BACE inhibitors effectively reduce the formation of all A species in the brain, including prefibrillary A surrounding plaques, whereas anti-A antibodies (at least the tested ones) are less effective in neutralizing these most toxic A species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the aforementioned studies showed that the anti-A antibodies were incapable of reducing levels of soluble A (7), as well as A oligomers (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the high potency of BACE inhibitors in reducing brain A levels (30), several compounds are currently either in preparation for or in use in clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these ongoing clinical trials have not reported any major safety issues so far, there remain some concerns about potential (and perhaps subtler) side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, although inhibition of BACE reduced A in the brain, it enhances the accumulation of alternative APP products such as A- peptides, which have been shown to be neurotoxic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These peptides can effectively promote neuronal silencing and impair hippocampal long-term potentiation in mice (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, BACE inhibitors may interfere with physiological functions of the enzyme that are beyond APP processing, such as axon guidance and synapse formation (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we stress that in our in vivo recordings, we did not identify any BACE-inhibitor related adverse effects on spontaneous neuronal activity patterns and memory performance in the APP23xPS45 model; in addition, the treatment did not reveal any changes in cortical activity in WT mice (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our results were obtained in a mouse model showing neuronal hyperactivity and impaired slow-wave activity as observed in AD brains in humans (22), their relevance for the human disease remains to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our observations provide strong in vivo evidence, at many levels of brain function, identifying BACE inhibition as a promising disease-modifying anti-A therapeutic strategy for AD, at least in early stages before massive neurodegeneration occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong support for the relevance of our findings comes from genetic studies showing that human carriers of the A673T mutation, which reduces the enzymatic activity of BACE, are protected against AD (33), whereas humans with the Swedish mutation, which enhances BACE activity, develop AD at an early age (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiments were performed on female APP23xPS45 double-transgenic mice aged  greater than 6 mo overexpressing the human APP with the Swedish mutation (670/671) and the human G384A-mutated PS1 (7, 10, 11, 17, 3537).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this age, mice exhibit widespread cerebral A pathology (10, 17, 36), neuropil dystrophy (10), and astrocytic (17, 38) and microglia (39) impairments, as well as learning and memory deficits (10, 11, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age-matched nontransgenic WT littermates were also used where appropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were housed in standard mouse cages on wood bedding under conventional laboratory conditions (12-h dark/12-h light cycle, constant temperature, and constant humidity) and provided with food and water ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation, care, and use of the animals, as well as all experimental procedures, were conducted in accordance with local animal welfare regulations and were approved by the state government of Bavaria, Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BACE_Inhibitor_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The BACE inhibitor NB-360 was used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed description of the compounds in vitro and in vivo efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and brain penetration in various animal models has been described previously (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oral treatment with NB-360 was provided by incorporating the drug into food pellets (0.25 g/kg; Provimi Kliba, Kaiseraugst, Switzerland).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The APP23xPS45 mice at age 68 mo were fed NB-360 or vehicle control food for 6 wk and then analyzed in the water maze task (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment was continued during the water maze task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were allocated at random to receive drug or vehicle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After behavioral testing, in vivo imaging experiments were conducted, after which the mice were killed for biochemical and histopathological analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the mice had access to food and BACE inhibitor until the imaging experiments started.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No obvious behavioral or health problems were observed during the drug treatment except for patchy hair depigmentation, which has been related to BACE inhibition in melanocytes (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Testing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We subjected the mice to a discriminatory water maze task as described previously (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, the mice had to locate a platform that was stable and kept visible in a fixed position (correct choice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incorrect platform, in a pseudorandom position, sank when a mouse climbed on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laboratory environment provided distal spatial cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A trial was terminated if the mouse failed to climb onto one of the platforms within 30 s (error of omission).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the event of an incorrect choice or error of omission, the mouse was placed by the investigator onto the correct platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice remained on this platform for 5 s before being returned to the home cage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Learning was assessed during five training sessions (days 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each session included five trials separated by 1- to 3-min intermissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether mice used spatial cues to locate the correct platform was validated in an additional session (reversal) after moving the correct platform to the opposite quadrant in the water maze.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latency between the start of the trial and the moment when the correct platform was reached was used to assess memory performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimenter was blinded to the genotype or treatment during the water maze experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavioral data were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model [fixed factors: day and treatment (WT mice, untreated APP23xPS45 mice, or treated APP23xPS45 mice), with random intercept within mouse].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculations were done with MATLAB (Mathworks) using the function fitlme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Two-Photon_Ca2+_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After the behavioral testing, in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging was performed as described previously (7, 10, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane 11.5% (vol/vol) for induction and during surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reduced concentration of isoflurane (0.8%) was used later during the imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skin above the skull was removed, and a custom-made recording chamber was glued to the skull with cyanoacrylate glue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the recording chamber was perfused with warm (37 °C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; 125 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM glucose, pH 7.4 when bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2), and a craniotomy was performed over the frontal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dura was left intact, and extreme care was taken not to damage the cortical tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescent Ca2+-indicator dye Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM (OGB-1) was bulk-loaded into layer 2/3 of the neocortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spontaneous activity of layer 2/3 neurons was monitored by imaging the fluorescence changes with a custom-built two-photon microscope based on a Ti:sapphire pulsing laser operating at a wavelength of 800 nm and resonant galvo mirror system (8 or 12 kHz; GSI) through a 40×, 0.8 NA aperture water immersion objective (Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full-frame images were acquired at 40 Hz using custom-written software based on LabView (National Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Image analysis was performed offline as described previously (7, 10, 17, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around individual somata, and then relative fluorescence change (F/F) vs. time traces were generated for each ROI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ transients were identified as changes in F/F that were three times larger than the SD of the noise band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Astrocytes were excluded from the analysis based on their selective staining by sulforhodamine 101 and their specific morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that OGB-1 effectively labels A plaques allowed us to readily identify these plaques in the stained tissue (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a subset of NB-360treated APP23xPS45 mice, AS26C cross-linked dimers (1 µM; JPT Peptide Technologies) were added to the ACSF used for perfusion in the recording chamber, and neuronal activity was recorded before (baseline) and 60 min after application of the dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the neuronal synchrony analysis (Fig 2H and Fig S5), raw Ca2+ traces were smoothed using a binomial filter with a window size of 1.7 s. The mean of the absolute difference between the raw and smoothed traces was taken as the reference noise level (refNoise).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hilbert transform was used to extract the instantaneous phase of each trace and the phase difference between the two traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the next step, correlated sections were calculated by thresholding the instantaneous phase difference smaller than 54 degrees and the instantaneous phase of both traces smaller than 72 degrees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each correlated section, the energy of both traces was calculated, and only sections with a minimum energy exceeding a threshold (minimum amplitude, 3× refNoise; minimum period, 0.7 s) were preserved as correlated Ca2+ transients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Large-Scale_Ca2+_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vivo camera-based large-scale Ca2+ imaging was performed as described previously (11, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, at the end of the two-photon imaging session, the craniotomy was enlarged and the cortical tissue was bulk-loaded with OGB-1 at multiple sites, resulting in nearly complete labeling of the entire cortical extent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were made using a high-speed digital camera (NeuroCCD; RedShirt Imaging) coupled to a macro zoom fluorescence microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired at 125 Hz (80 × 80 pixels) using a custom LabView data acquisition program (National Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data analysis was performed as described previously (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, Ca2+ signals arising from each camera pixel were first temporally smoothed using a low-pass filter with a corner frequency of 50 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The baseline fluorescence at each pixel was determined every 4 s (500 frames) by selecting the 10th percentile of all fluorescence values from a symmetric 8-s window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values were then interpolated to form the baseline for transforming the fluorescence into F/F values (typical range, 00.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were cleaned of the heart rate artifacts using the denoising source separation (DSS) algorithm (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We subdivided the cortex into four domains along the anteroposterior axis (roughly corresponding to occipital, somatosensory, motor, and frontal cortices).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the long-range spatial coherence of the Ca2+ fluorescence signal, we focused on the fluorescence signal over frontal and occipital cortices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coherence was estimated by the correlation coefficients of 32-s segments of the average fluorescence in the cortical regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a subset of NB-360treated APP23xPS45 mice, the cortex was superfused with a 1:1 mixture of A140 and A142 peptides (Bachem).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptides were added to the recirculating ACSF at a concentration of 1 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slow-wave oscilllations were recorded before (baseline) and 60 min after the A application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determination_of_A_Plaques  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coronal brain slices were obtained from brains imaged in vivo, and thioflavin-S (0.05% wt/vol) was used to stain A plaques, as described previously (17, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pictures were taken using a camera (XC10; Olympus) mounted on a light microscope at a magnification of 2× with a 2× objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the plaque area, quantitative analysis of stained signals was performed using ImageJ software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunhistochemistry_and_Confocal_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The prefibrillary A halo surrounding plaques was analyzed as described previously (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coronal brain sections (30 µm) were prepared with a vibratome (VT1000s; Leica).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OC antibody (AB2286; EMD Millipore) diluted 1:250 in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 4% goat serum was used as a primary antibody for detecting prefibrillary A species, including oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were stained for 2 d at 4 °C, washed, and then stained with an Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody (A21244; Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted to 1:500 for 12 h. For staining of the plaque cores, the sections were stained with thioflavin-S (T1892; Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:10,000 from 2% stock for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal imaging was performed using an Olympus FV3000 system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were obtained through a 60× oil-immersion objective (NA 1.42) at zoom 1, at a 1,024 × 1,024-pixel resolution with a 3-µm z-step size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging parameters and laser settings were kept constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five imaging regions were chosen at random in each brain section, and two brain sections from each animal were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis, the images were processed using ImageJ with maximal z-projection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amounts of plaque and prefibrillary A were calculated by multiplying the area and the signal intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biochemical_Determination_of_A  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Forebrains obtained from brains imaged in vivo were homogenized in 9 volumes of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Diagnostics) using a Sonifier 450 (Branson Ultrasonics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soluble A was extracted from 50 L of homogenate with 50 L of 2% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in TBS, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the extraction of insoluble amyloid peptides, 50 L of forebrain homogenate was mixed with 117 L of 100% formic acid, stored for 15 min, and neutralized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant after centrifugation at 20,300 × g was diluted and used for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A40 and 42 peptides were determined using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay kit based on antibody 6E10 from Meso Scale Discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples and standards were prepared according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data are presented as mean ± SEM unless specified otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical comparison between two experimental groups was assessed by Welchs two-tailed t test, and differences between multiple groups were assessed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeys multiple-comparisons test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P less_than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the assumptions of the parametric tests were not met, permutation tests were performed as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the results of the permutation tests conformed with those of the parametric tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
