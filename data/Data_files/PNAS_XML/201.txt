Intramolecular allosteric communication in dopamine D2 receptor revealed by evolutionary amino acid covariation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Characterizing relationships among protein structure, function, and evolution requires understanding the evolutionary constraints on each constituent residue of a protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that structural information can be retrieved from evolutionary residue covariation in protein families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether the evolutionary history in protein sequences informs on functional interactions between nonadjacent residues has been unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we developed a method that uses evolutionary amino acid covariation to infer functionally coupled residue pairs in the dopamine D2 receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered functional coupling between residue pairs that have coevolved mainly to control responses to dopamine and maintain them at wild-type levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings demonstrate the possibility of extracting the networks of intramolecular allosteric communication from evolutionary residue covariation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structural basis of allosteric signaling in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is important in guiding design of therapeutics and understanding phenotypic consequences of genetic variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Evolutionary Trace (ET) algorithm previously proved effective in redesigning receptors to mimic the ligand specificities of functionally distinct homologs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now expand ET to consider mutual information, with validation in GPCR structure and dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new algorithm, called ET-MIp, identifies evolutionarily relevant patterns of amino acid covariations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The improved predictions of structural proximity and D2R mutagenesis demonstrate that ET-MIp predicts functional interactions between residue pairs, particularly potency and efficacy of activation by dopamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, although most of the residue pairs chosen for mutagenesis are neither in the binding pocket nor in contact with each other, many exhibited functional interactions, implying at-a-distance coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional interaction between the coupled pairs correlated best with the evolutionary coupling potential derived from dopamine receptor sequences rather than with broader sets of GPCR sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the allosteric communication responsible for dopamine responses is resolved by ET-MIp and best discerned within a short evolutionary distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most double mutants restored dopamine response to wild-type levels, also suggesting that tight regulation of the response to dopamine drove the coevolution and intramolecular communications between coupled residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach provides a general tool to identify evolutionary covariation patterns in small sets of close sequence homologs and to translate them into functional linkages between residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ET-MIp_Identified_Pairs_of_Residue_Positions_with_Evolutionary_Covariation_Patterns  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that accounting for species divergence would improve the detection of functionally coupled residues over covariation analyses that ignore phylogenetic information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ET-MIp adds the mutual information metric (5) to ET to keep track of the phylogenetic distance at which a pair of residues vary (Fig 1A; see Materials and Methods and Supporting Information for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2,500 Class A GPCR transmembrane (TM) domain sequences, we found that residue pairs with high ET-MIp scores were more enriched for direct contacts in a reference structure (PDB 2RH1) compared with results obtained with leading alternative methods (5, 37, 38) (Fig 1B), showing that GPCR phylogenetic information improves the coupling signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preliminary analysis of other protein families suggests that this result may be fairly general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opens the possibility that ET-MIp also detects functionally relevant covariation among structurally distant yet coupled residue pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Residue_and_Sequence_Selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test predicted couplings experimentally, we selected 10 covarying ET residue pairs in D2R in which one or both of the residues were involved in allosteric pathways of D2R ligand responses (23), plus two more pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these are predicted to be functionally important by ET and alter function upon mutation (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pairs cover a range of ET-MIp coupling scores and involve structurally distant residues (except T205M5.54/L379F6.41; see Table S1) whose couplings, if any, would be allosteric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the role of functional coupling in discriminating between dopamine and serotonin during evolution, ET residues in D2R were mutated to the corresponding residues in the closely related 5-HT2A serotonin receptor (5-HT2AR), so only sites at which 5-HT2AR and D2R differ were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As single mutations, these substitutions still allow for a functional receptor (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to mutation selection, we considered the choice of sequences used for calculating scores, because this can strongly impact ET-MIp couplings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For structural contacts, ET-MIp can be applied to Class A GPCR sequences because they are all structurally similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For functional allostery in D2R, tuned to a specific ligand and signaling bias, a more restricted alignment may be best.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, multiple alignments were tested (Class A, bioamine, dopamine, and D2Rs) and yielded distinct coupling scores (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Functional_Interactions_Between_Covarying_ET_Residue_Pairs_Maintained_Dopamine_Response_at_WT_Level  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the selected ET residue pairs were functionally coupled, we first compared the effects of single and double mutations on dopamine efficacy using a fluorescence-based assay to study Gi activation induced by agonist-stimulated D2R (Fig 2; see Materials and Methods and Supporting Information for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For five pairs (V83L2.53/V91S2.61, M117F3.35/Y199F5.48, I48T1.46/F110W3.28, V152A4.42/L171P4.61, and N124H3.42/T205M5.54), activation of Gi in response to dopamine was unexpectedly decreased or restored to a near-wild-type (WT) level in the double mutants, even though one or both of the constituent single mutants showed significantly enhanced response (Fig 2 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that covarying ET residue pairs help maintain dopamine responses at the WT level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A trend was that functional coupling was more apparent in pairs with high evolutionary coupling potential when calculated using sequences only from dopamine receptors (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the loss-of-function mutation L379F6.41 is rescued by T205M5.54, with which it has a strong evolutionary coupling potential, but not by N124H3.42, with which the coupling potential is weaker (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the epistatic effect of double mutations, we used four standard models (product, logarithmic, minimal, and additive interaction models) (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for the minimal model, the five residue pairs that were functionally coupled to maintain WT dopamine responses yielded higher epistasis scores, and the epistasis scores correlated better with the evolutionary coupling scores when calculated using input sequences made up only of dopamine receptors (Fig 2C and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the allosteric communication responsible for dopamine response is a unique evolutionary signature of dopamine receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with direct-coupling analysis (DCA), Frobenius norm (FN), and direct information (DI) algorithms (37) (Tables S3 and S4), these ET-MIp results correlated better with experimental epistasis scores (Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the effect of functional coupling on dopamine potency, doseresponse curves were generated to derive EC50 values for WT and mutant D2Rs (Fig 2 D and E and Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used relative ln(EC50) values, defined as the difference between ln(EC50 mutant) and ln(EC50 WT), to approximate free energy changes, because potency reflects differences in ligand binding affinity and/or activation kinetics, either of which must be determined by a free energy term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess nonadditivity, we compared the sum of relative ln(EC50) values of the single mutants with the relative ln(EC50) value of the corresponding double mutants (Fig 2F), except when mutants showed almost no response to dopamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the three residue pairs with the lowest evolutionary coupling potential, the six pairs with the highest evolutionary coupling potential were nonadditivea functional coupling that presumably fine-tunes the sensitivity to dopamine (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here again, deviation from additivity correlated most highly with the evolutionary coupling potential derived from the dopamine receptor sequence set (Fig 2G and Fig S5), and, overall, ET-MIp correlated better with nonadditivity than DCAFN and DCADI (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rescue_Effect_on_Serotonin_Activation_Was_Observed_for_Some_D2R_Double_Mutants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Some of the studied ET residues were involved in discriminating against G16 activation induced by serotonin stimulation of D2R (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the covarying ET residue pairs are functionally coupled with respect to regulating agonist specificity, we compared the effects of single and double mutations on serotonin responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single mutants I48T1.46, Y213I5.62, T205M5.54, L387C6.49, and I105K3.23 had enhanced responses to serotonin, indicating that these positions in D2R participate in discriminating against Gi activation induced by serotonin (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A rescue effect was observed at I48T1.46/F110W3.28 and N124H3.42/T205M5.54, even though F110W3.28 and N124H3.42 alone abolished activation by serotonin, suggesting functional coupling in controlling the specificity for D2R activation in these cases (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the small number of functional coupling cases found, we infer that discriminating against serotonin is not the main functional role of the covarying ET residue pairs studied here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this finding suggests that the allosteric communication responsible for specificity of receptor activation may vary across a protein family, making it difficult for ET-MIp to extract such a pattern from a broad sequence input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nonadditivity_of_Free_Energy_Changes_upon_Ligand_Binding_Was_Observed_at_Some_D2R_Double_Mutants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether covarying ET residue pairs interact to control ligand affinity, spiperone competition binding experiments determined Ki for both dopamine and serotonin and measured the energetic perturbations by calculating the Gibbs free energy change (G0) (Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to EC50, these measurements on whole cell membranes reflect low-affinity non-G protein-coupled binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant differences between (G0A + G0B) and G0AB observed for F202L5.51/Y213I5.62 and T205M5.54/L379F6.41 revealed nonadditive effects on both dopamine (Fig 4 A and C) and serotonin (Fig 4 B and D) binding, indicating functional coupling in regulating receptorligand binding affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, F202L5.51/Y213I5.62 and T205M5.54/L379F6.41 are outside the ligand binding pocket, and yet alter receptorligand interaction (Fig 2H), indicating their involvement in allosteric pathways linking ligand binding and receptor conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the free energy change demonstrated that ET-MIp was able to detect energetic coupling for ligand binding at both proximal (3.6 Å) and long-distance (13.2 Å) residue pairs, even when located far away from the ligand binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the double mutations F202L5.51/Y213I5.62 and T205M5.54/L379F6.41 rendered both dopamine and serotonin binding energetically more favorable (Fig 4 C and D), we did not find evidence for functional coupling responsible for the specificity of ligand binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

G_Protein-Specific_Effects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our new assay for Gi activation let us compare mutational effects on D2R activation of Gi vs. G16 (23), and revealed several striking contrasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For serotonin activation, N124H3.42 greatly decreased maximal activation of Gi (Fig 3C) but significantly increased maximal activation of G16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For maximal dopamine activation, T205M5.54, F110W3.28, I48T1.46, and V91S2.61 all displayed activation of G16 close to that of WT (23), but activated the physiological partner of D2R, Gi, at levels ranging from 2.5-fold to nearly fourfold higher than WT (Fig 2C), implying somewhat different coupling mechanisms for these two G proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ET-MIp predicts functionally coupled residue pairs by weighing mutual variations by the phylogenetic depth of the associated evolutionary divergences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments in D2R suggest the method can reveal allosteric communication between distant and evolutionarily important residue positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most striking observations are that covarying ET residue pairs work together to modulate efficacy and potency of dopamine in D2R, and that the main function encoded by the allosteric communication is to maintain the dopamine response at the WT level and fine-tune sensitivity to dopamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ET-MIp identified functional couplings that regulate receptorligand interactions through residue pairs outside the ligand binding pocket, underscoring the allosteric nature of the pathways extending from the ligand binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covarying ET residue pairs control dopamine responsiveness tightly, possibly reflecting an evolutionary need to maintain distinct dopamine affinities among dopamine receptors (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5) (3436), each activating diverse downstream signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coupling scores calculated at varying evolutionary depth indicate that coevolution coincides with functional separation of the subfamilies fairly late in evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of cosubstitution suggest that deviation in either direction from this highly tuned response conferred selective evolutionary disadvantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There have been few studies of the functional relationships between covarying residues (14, 1618, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal functional coupling of the covarying ET residues in D2R, and the synergistic or antagonistic features of the coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, F202L5.51 and Y213I5.62 have a synergistic effect on dopamine efficacy, whereas the effects on dopamine potency are antagonistic (Fig 2 C and F), suggesting that different interactions govern efficacy and potency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation that covarying ET residue pairs mediate ligand-specific functional interactions without contacting the ligand directly supports the previous proposal of a conformational filter in D2R (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies have proposed models of molecular switches associated with receptor activation, such as the ionic lock (D/E)RY (4247), transmission switch (48), and tyrosine toggle switch (NPxxY) (4447, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of functionally coupled covarying ET residue pairs provides insight into the allosteric pathways connecting ligand binding, molecular switches, and G protein coupling in D2R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the positions of the covarying ET residue pairs mapped onto the structure of D3R (50), we can classify the coupling mechanisms into three categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) The covarying ET residues are far from each other (Table S1), with one at or near the ligand binding site and the other close to the molecular switches, e.g., I48T1.46/F110W3.28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F1103.28 is at the orthosteric binding pocket (50, 51), and I481.46 is in direct contact with D802.50, which interacts with the transmission switch and NPxxY motif through water molecules in molecular dynamics simulations of 1 and 2 adrenergic receptors (52), suggesting a role for this pair in coupling ligand binding to switch residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Both of the covarying ET residues are at or near the ligand binding site, with one close to the 37 lock switch (D1143.32Y4167.43), which forms a link between TM3 and TM7 that breaks upon receptor activation in rhodopsin (47, 50, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include V83L2.53/V91S2.61 and M117F3.35/Y199F5.48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A side-chain rotamer of V83L2.53 can interact with Y4167.43 (Fig S6A) and an inward-facing side-chain rotamer of M117F3.35 could interact with D1143.32, if TM2 and TM3 move apart from each other (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their coupling may contribute to propagation of the dopamine binding signal to the 37 lock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Both of the covarying ET residues are far from the ligand binding pocket but close to the molecular switches or G protein-binding region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include F202L5.51/Y213I5.62, N124H3.42/T205M5.54, and T205M5.54/L379F6.41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F2025.51 is part of the transmission switch, and the side chain of the mutant F202L5.51 can contact the side chain of I1223.40, which is part of the transmission switch (48) (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Y2135.62 interacts with V2155.64, which was found to participate in receptorG protein interactions (44, 46) (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N124H3.42, T205M5.54, and L379F6.41 may interact with the residues making up the hydrophobic barrier in TM2, TM3, and TM6 (47, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, T2055.54 and L3796.41 are in direct contact with P2015.50 and F3826.44, respectively, of the transmission switch(48) (Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A backbone hydrogen bond links L379F6.41 and the G protein interacting residue L3756.37 (V3316.37 in D3R) (46) (Fig S6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, T205M5.54 and L379F6.41 form the lynchpin in a continuous network of contacts leading from the transmission switch to the G protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation that T205M5.54/L379F6.41 are coupled in ligand binding is consistent with bidirectional communication between ligand binding and G protein activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The idea that coupled residues are links in a chain of allosteric interactions is supported by the observation that intervening residues contacting them tend to have high coupling scores (Fig S7 and Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these residues are identical in D2R and 5-HT2AR and could not be tested in our paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The side chain of M117F3.35 points toward the putative cholesterol binding site (55, 56) and may enhance cholesterol interactions; Y199F5.48 points toward the putative receptordimerization interface (57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V1524.42 contacts cholesterol-contacting position I1564.46 (56), and L1714.61 points toward the dimerization interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The side chains of both F202L5.51 and Y213I5.62 may lie at the same interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional coupling observed may reflect effects on modulation by cholesterol (59) and GPCR dimerization (57, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equivalent residue to Y2135.62 in activated 2 adrenergic receptor (46) stabilizes the outward movement of TM6 through a van der Waals contact, consistent with effects of Y213I5.62 on G protein coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, the results support the idea that covariation patterns are signatures preserved in protein sequences during evolution and reflect functional interactions important for fitness-conferring properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They open the possibility of improving structure-based drug design by accounting for intramolecular allosteric communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The involvement of covarying ET residue pairs in allosteric pathways linking ligand binding, molecular switches, and G protein coupling offers the potential to reengineer allosteric pathways of receptor activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The divergent effects on Gi and G16 (23) activation observed in some mutants suggest that covarying ET residue pairs play a role in governing receptor preference for downstream effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this work also serves as a starting point for studies on bias in activation of effectors controlled by covarying ET residue pairs, and on the interpretation of genome variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The key methods are briefly described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For full details, please see Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evolutionary_Trace_and_MI_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify evolutionarily coupled residue pairs, we integrated MI into the ET framework as follows:ET(MIp(i,j))=n=1N1ng=1nMIpg(i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The alignment is broken up into subalignments g according to the phylogenetic tree with N nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measure of mutual information, MIp (5), is computed for all possible residue pairs i and j for each subalignment selected by the phylogenetic tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The performance of ET-MIp in contact prediction was compared with other methods as described in Supporting Information, using an alignment of 2,500 Class A GPCRs to predict interresidue contacts in the structure of the 2 adrenergic receptor (PDB 2RH1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify covarying residues in D2R, BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) analysis of D2R was first performed against the Uniref90 sequence database (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify homologs, protein sequences were filtered by protein length and sequence identity ( greater than 35%,  greater than 42%,  greater than 50%), where each alignment was respectively made up of all dopamine receptors, dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, and only D2 receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bioamine and Class A GPCR alignments were described previously (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Membrane_Potential_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gi activation induced by agonist-stimulated D2R triggers the opening of TRPC4 channels in HEK293 cells, leading to membrane potential changes (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details are given in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ET_and_MI  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify evolutionarily coupled residue pairs that are compensatory or synergistic for transferring function when comutated, we integrated MI into the ET framework as shown,ET(MIp(i,j))=n=1N1ng=1nMIpg(i,j).In this formula, the total alignment is broken up into subalignments g according to the phylogenetic tree with N nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our chosen measure of mutual information MIp (described below) is computed for all possible residue pairs i and j for each subalignment selected by the phylogenetic tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MI is a standard measure for the shared information between two discrete sets of events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the sets are defined by the amino acids found at positions i and j within the protein sequence alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MI is defined asMI(i,j)=E(i)+E(j)E(i,j),where E(i) and E(j) are the marginal entropies and are writtenE(i)=xNp(x)logp(x),where x represents the possible events (i.e., amino acid types) and p(x) represents the frequency of these events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The joint entropy E(i, j) is writtenE(i,j)=xNyNp(x,y)logp(x,y),where p(x, y) represents the frequency that events x and y occur together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MI can be normalized by dividing by the total entropy of the individual eventsnMI(i,j)=MI(i,j)E(i)+E(j).In this study, we used the alternative normalization measure introduced by Dunn et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (5), which approximates the background MI shared by positions i and j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is called the average product correction (APC) and is computedAPC(i,j)=MI(i,x¯)MI(j,x¯)MI¯,where the mean mutual information of column i or j is writtenMI(i,x¯)=1mxmMI(i,x),and the overall mean mutual information is defined asMI¯=2nmimjnMI(i,j),where m and n represent the number of columns in the alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then normalized mutual information MIp is the difference between MI and the APCMIp(i,j)=MI(i,j)APC(i,j),where MIp was the measure integrated into the ET framework to identify evolutionarily coupled residue pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the raw score was normalized to a percentile as shown in Table S2 for easy comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiple_Sequence_Alignments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify covarying residues in D2R, the D2R sequence was first blasted against the Uniref90 sequence database (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify homologs, the protein sequences were filtered by protein length and sequence identity ( greater than 35%,  greater than 42%,  greater than 50%), where each alignment was respectively made up of all dopamine receptors, dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, and only D2Rs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bioamine and Class A GPCR alignments were described previously (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structure_Contact_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A common testing metric for sequence mutual information methods is to test their ability to predict structural contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether adding phylogeny improved predictions, we applied ET-MIp to the alignment made up of 2,500 Class A GPCR TM domain sequences and tested our ability to predict 2 adrenergic receptor (PDB 2RH1) structure contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this experiment, we defined structural contacts (positive set) as amino acids within 6 Å (ignoring hydrogen atoms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1B shows the improved receiver operating characteristic curves with the new algorithm, ET-MIp, compared with MIp (5), DCA algorithms, FN, and DI (37), and a standard measure for normalized mutual information (nMI) (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that including phylogeny dramatically improved the structure prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Epistasis_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To estimate the epistatic effect of double mutations, we used previously described epistasis models, typically referred to as product, logarithmic, minimal, and additive interaction models (39, 40), to calculate epistasis scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These models are used to study interactions between genes (39) but have also been used to study residue interactions within the WW domain (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each model suggests that multiple perturbations should combine in a specific manner, where Ma, Mb, and Mab are experimental values for the individual mutations a and b and the double mutation a + b, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT represents the experimental value of the WT D2R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case, we normalized the data to WT (WT = 1).abproduct=MabMaMb,abadditive=(Mab+WT)(Ma+Mb),ablog=Mablog2((2MaWT)(2MbWT)+WT),abmin=Mabmin(Ma,Mb).To compare prediction by algorithms to phenotype information, each theoretical coupling value was compared with epistatic effects estimated by each model to determine how well the data are explained by the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then measured Pearsons R to indicate how well data fit a model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DCA_Comparison  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare algorithms, the code for DCA (37) was downloaded and applied to the same five alignments discussed in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The code can perform two types of analysis, the original DI score and FN score (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The default parameters were used for both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we normalized these scores to a percentile as described for ET-MIp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized scores for each algorithm are shown in Tables S3 and S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These scores were then compared with phenotypes in the same fashion as ET-MIp (Tables S5 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells stably expressing TRPC4 channels, which were a generous gift from Dr. Michael Xi Zhu (The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (Corning) containing 4.5 g/L glucose and l-glutamine supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (HyClone), 50 unit/mL penicillin, 50 µg/mL streptomycin (Lonza), and 500 mg/L G418 (for TRPC4-expressing cells only) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

D2R_Mutagenesis_and_Transfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate D2R mutants, the cDNA clone of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human D2R (long isoform) (DRD020TN00; Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center) was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutant plasmids were sequenced to confirm the desired mutations and then transfected into TRPC4-expressing HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For membrane potential assay and cell-ELISA, cells were reverse transfected in 96-well plates coated with 25 µg/mL poly-d-lysine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Membrane_Potential_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Twenty-four hours after transfection of negative control [pcDNA3.1(+)], WT, or mutant D2Rs, the original culture medium was discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfected TRPC4-expressing HEK293 cells were then incubated with FLIPR membrane potential dye and quencher combination (FMP2; Molecular Devices), which was diluted in KrebsRingerHepes (KRH) buffer (10 mM Hepes, 4.7 mM KCl, 2.2 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 120 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1.8 g/L glucose at room temperature (RT) for 40 min before the assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assays were performed in a Flexstation 3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) that recorded fluorescence (excitation at 530 nm, emission at 565 nm) at 1.5-s intervals for a total of 180 s at 32 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Agonists (dopamine or serotonin) in KRH buffer were added automatically by the Flexstation 3 apparatus to each well after taking a baseline of background fluorescence for 30 s. Gi activation induced by agonist-stimulated D2R triggers the opening of TRPC4 channels, leading to changes in membrane potential, which were reported by enhanced fluorescence from the membrane potential dye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the efficacy of Gi activation induced by dopamine-stimulated D2R, maximal fluorescence values induced by a saturating amount (10 M) of dopamine were subtracted by the negative control background and then normalized to the receptor surface expression, which was determined by cell-ELISA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For generation of doseresponse curves to determine EC50, cells were treated with various concentrations of agonists, and the data were collected as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximal fluorescence values induced by agonists were used as points in the doseresponse curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The doseresponse data were then analyzed by nonlinear regression curve-fitting analysis with the Hill coefficient set at 1 using GraphPad Prism v. 5.01 software to obtain EC50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both efficacy and potency measurements in intact cells, the amount of DNA for transfection was determined by titration to yield a response whose amplitude was linear with DNA amount, avoiding complications due to excessive receptor levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell-ELISA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At 24 h posttransfection of negative control [pcDNA3.1(+)], WT, or mutant D2Rs, the transfected TRPC4-expressing HEK293 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with 2% (wt/vol) BSA in PBS for 1 h followed by 1-h incubation with the mouse monoclonal HA-probe antibody (clone F7; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (Thermo Scientific) at RT for 1 h. The antibodies used were diluted in PBS with 1% (wt/vol) BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PBS washes were performed after each incubation of the antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect the cell surface expression level of D2Rs, SuperSignal ELISA Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific) was added, and the luminescence was detected with a Flexstation 3 microplate reader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained luminescence values were then subtracted by the negative control background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the measurement of total D2R expression, the cells were permeabilized with 0.4% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 in PBS before incubation with antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell surface to total expression ratios of mutant D2Rs were normalized to that of WT as shown in Fig S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Membrane_Preparation_from_HEK293_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HEK293 cells transfected with WT or mutant D2Rs were scraped and rinsed with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer (1 mM TrisHCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were homogenized with a glass/teflon PotterElvehjem homogenizer and then further lysed by repeated passage through a 26-gauge needle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove nuclei and unbroken cells, the homogenates were centrifuged at 260 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting membrane pellets were resuspended in reaction buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and stored at 80 °C until use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Radioligand_Binding_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The radioligand binding assays were carried out with washed cell membranes from cells transfected and expressing much higher levels of D2R than cells for membrane potential assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on immunofluorescence, most of the overexpressed D2R is in internal membranes, and most is likely not coupled to G proteins because of both the location and the large excess of receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this type of assay does not reflect the affinity of the receptor at the cell surface under physiological conditions, where there would be two (or possibly more) effective affinities, it allows us to make comparisons among receptor variants independent of their efficiency of G protein coupling, with results that are well fit with a single IC50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membrane suspension (525 µg of protein) in reaction buffer was incubated with [3H]spiperone at a final concentration ranging from 1 nM to 8 nM in the saturation binding experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Competition binding experiments were performed with a fixed concentration of [3H]spiperone (0.3 nM for serotonin competition, 0.4 nM for dopamine competition) and various concentrations of cold ligand competitors dopamine or serotonin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonspecific binding was defined as binding of [3H]spiperone to the membranes of negative control [pcDNA3.1(+)] HEK293 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the specific [3H]spiperone binding under each condition, nonspecific binding was subtracted from the total binding of [3H]spiperone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each binding reaction was performed in triplicate and incubated at RT for 1.5 h in a final volume of 525 µL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was terminated by filtration through glass microfiber filters (Whatman GF/A) using a 12-well sampling vacuum manifold (Millipore) followed by three washes of 2 mL ice-cold TBS buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The filter-bound radioactivity, which reported on the amount of [3H]spiperone binding to the cell membranes, was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS6500).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from saturation and competition binding were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism v. 5.01 as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23 to obtain Kd and Ki.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculation_of_Gibbs_Free_Energy_Change_upon_ReceptorLigand_Binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Values of the free energy change upon receptorligand binding were calculated from the equation G0 = RT lnKi, where R = 8.314 J K1mol1 and T = 298.15 K. Ki for dopamine or serotonin was determined by competition binding experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the mutational effects on binding free energy, G0 of each mutant was calculated by the equation G0mutant = G0mutant  G0wt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the effect of double mutations is additive or not, independent two-tailed Students t tests were applied to the comparison of (G0A + G0B) versus G0AB, where A is single mutant A, B is single mutant B, and AB is double mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
