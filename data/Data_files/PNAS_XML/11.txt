Identification of the VERNALIZATION 4 gene reveals the origin of spring growth habit in ancient wheats from South Asia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A precise regulation of flowering time is critical for plant reproductive success and for cereal crops to maximize grain production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wheat, barley, and other temperate cereals, vernalization genes play an important role in the acceleration of reproductive development after long periods of low temperatures during the winter (vernalization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we identified VERNALIZATION 4 (VRN-D4), a vernalization gene that was critical for the development of spring growth habit in the ancient wheats from South Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that mutations in regulatory regions of VRN-D4 are shared with other VRN-A1 alleles and can be used to modulate the vernalization response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These previously unknown alleles provide breeders new tools to engineer wheat varieties better adapted to different or changing environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wheat varieties with a winter growth habit require long exposures to low temperatures (vernalization) to accelerate flowering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural variation in four vernalization genes regulating this requirement has favored wheat adaptation to different environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first three genes (VRN1VRN3) have been cloned and characterized before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the fourth gene, VRN-D4, originated by the insertion of a 290-kb region from chromosome arm 5AL into the proximal region of chromosome arm 5DS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inserted 5AL region includes a copy of VRN-A1 that carries distinctive mutations in its coding and regulatory regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three lines of evidence confirmed that this gene is VRN-D4: it cosegregated with VRN-D4 in a high-density mapping population; it was expressed earlier than other VRN1 genes in the absence of vernalization; and induced mutations in this gene resulted in delayed flowering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VRN-D4 was found in most accessions of the ancient subspecies Triticum aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum from South Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This subspecies showed a significant reduction of genetic diversity and increased genetic differentiation in the centromeric region of chromosome 5D, suggesting that VRN-D4 likely contributed to local adaptation and was favored by positive selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three adjacent SNPs in a regulatory region of the VRN-D4 first intron disrupt the binding of GLYCINE-RICH RNA-BINDING PROTEIN 2 (TaGRP2), a known repressor of VRN1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same SNPs were identified in VRN-A1 alleles previously associated with reduced vernalization requirement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These alleles can be used to modulate vernalization requirements and to develop wheat varieties better adapted to different or changing environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VRN-D4_Is_Linked_to_Early_Expression_of_VRN1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a previous study, we showed that the presence of the Vrn-D4 allele was associated with the up-regulation of VRN1 and FT1 and the down-regulation of VRN2 transcript levels in the leaves (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this result and on the epistatic interactions among these genes, we suggested that VRN-D4 likely operates upstream or as a part of the positive regulatory feedback loop connecting these three genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which of these genes is affected first by VRN-D4, we conducted a developmental time course analysis of gene expression under nonvernalizing conditions in isogenic lines with and without the dominant Vrn-D4 allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Triple Dirk C plants (TDC, winter growth habit, vrn-D4) exhibited low transcript levels of VRN1 and FT1 and high levels of VRN2 at the three tested sampling points (Fig 1 AC) confirming previous results (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, Triple Dirk F plants (TDF, spring growth habit, Vrn-D4) showed increased expression of VRN1 and FT1 and decreasing levels of VRN2 at week 5 (Fig 1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the earliest sampling point (week 1), the differences in VRN1 between TDF and TDC were already highly significant (P = 0.002, 38-fold change, Fig 1A), whereas the differences in VRN2 were only marginally significant (P = 0.05, 2-fold change, Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in FT1 transcript levels between TDC and TDF were detected only in the latest sampling point (week 5, Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that VRN1 is the earliest target (direct or indirect) of VRN-D4 among these three genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the absence of vernalization, TDF flowered much earlier than TDC but still 12.6 d later than Triple Dirk D (TDD, strong Vrn-A1a allele) (17) and 18.3 d later than Bobwhite (BW, alleles for spring growth habit at the three VRN1 homeologs) (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The later flowering of TDF relative to TDD and Bobwhite was associated with lower transcript levels of VRN1 and FT1 and higher transcript levels of VRN2 (Fig 1 AC, week 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surprisingly, we found that VRN-A1 was the only VRN1 homeolog significantly up-regulated in TDF relative to TDC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VRN-A1 transcript levels were higher from week 1, and the levels were similar in TDF and TDD (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, neither VRN-B1 nor VRN-D1 transcripts were detected at the first (Fig 1E) or third week (SI Appendix, Fig S1A) in TDF or TDD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VRN-B1 and VRN-D1 were detected in Bobwhite (dominant Vrn-A1 Vrn-B1 Vrn-D1) after the first week (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that either the VRN-A1 homeolog is a specific target of VRN-D4 or that an additional copy of VRN-A1 is present in TDF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TDF_Carries_a_Second_Copy_of_VRN-A1_Completely_Linked_to_VRN-D4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a VRN1 copy number Taqman assay described in previous studies (6, 37), we observed one copy of VRN-A1 in winter lines TDC and CS5402 (recessive vrn-D4 allele), but two copies of VRN-A1 in TDF (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we sequenced the coding region of VRN-A1 in TDF and Gabo (dominant Vrn-D4 allele), we discovered a fixed A/C polymorphism at position 367 (henceforth, A367C, SI Appendix, Fig S2A) that was not present in any of the VRN1 sequences deposited in GenBank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines carrying the recessive vrn-D4 allele showed only the canonical A at position 367, present in all available VRN-A1 sequences (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A367C SNP was completely linked with spring growth habit in a high-density mapping population (3,182 gametes) segregating for VRN-D4 on chromosome arm 5DS (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The six plants with the VRN-D4 closest recombination events are shown in SI Appendix, Fig S2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this result, we hypothesized that the duplicated copy of VRN-A1 on chromosome arm 5DS was a good candidate for VRN-D4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This hypothesis was further supported by the earlier expression of the VRN-A1 gene inserted on chromosome arm 5DS transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the leaf samples collected from 1- and 3-wk-old TDF plants, all of the transcripts carry the C variant at position 367 (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only by the fifth week, low expression of the A variant (vrn-A1 allele) was detected in TDF together with the stronger expression of the C variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control lines showed the expected results: the winter TDC showed no VRN1 expression, whereas the spring TDD and BW plants showed early expression of the A variant (Vrn-A1a allele from 5AL, SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that the VRN-A1 copy in chromosome 5DS is VRN-D4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Validation_of_the_VRN-D4_Candidate_Gene_Using_Induced_Mutations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the previous hypothesis, we mutagenized a population of 1,153 TDF lines with ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) and screened them using a CelI assay as described before (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified four nonsynonymous mutations and one splicing site mutant in the VRN1 copy in 5DS (SI Appendix, Method S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on their predicted effect on protein function, we selected two mutations for phenotypic characterization (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first mutation generated a change from glutamic acid to lysine at position 158 (E158K, Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this is usually a tolerated amino acid change (BLOSUM 62 score = 1), it is located in a conserved position that suggests some evolutionary constraints (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a population segregating for the E158K mutation, plants heterozygous and homozygous for the mutation flowered 5.1 d (P = 0.0004) and 9.1 d (P = 2.15e5) later than plants carrying the wild-type allele, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants carrying the wild-type allele flowered at the same time as the TDF control (P = 0.76, Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second mutation, found in homozygous state, eliminated the donor splicing site at the fourth exon (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translation of the adjacent intron sequence predicts a premature stop codon 8 bp downstream of the induced mutation that eliminates 40% of the VRN-D4 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of this premature stop codon was confirmed in the transcripts from the TDF mutant (SI Appendix, Method S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TDF control plants flowered on average 48 d after sowing, whereas plants homozygous for the splicing site mutation flowered on average 146 d later than TDF (P less_than 5.04e14) and at the same time of the winter TDC control (P = 0.910, Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two independent mutations confirmed that the duplicated VRN-A1 copy on the proximal region of 5DS is VRN-D4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Physical_Map_of_the_VRN-D4_Region  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A BLAST search of the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) draft sequence of Chinese Spring (CS) chromosome arms (39) using VRN-A1 as query revealed the presence of VRN-D4 (carrying the diagnostic A367C SNP) in the 5DS database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CS does not carry VRN-D4, the CS ditelosomic 5DS line (henceforth, CS-dt5DS) used to sequence the 5DS arm was generated using the variety Gabo (40), which does carry VRN-D4 (36, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The physical map of the 5DS arm from CS-dt5DS, developed as part of the IWGSC, was used to determine the size of the inserted 5AL segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A screen of the CS-dt5DS BAC library minimum tiling path (MTP) clones (SI Appendix, Method S2) (42) yielded BAC TaeCsp5DShA_0038_M14, which is part of overlapping contigs CTG87-CTG61 (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sequenced 12 BACs from these two contigs (SI Appendix, Method S2) and deposited the assembled 680-kb sequence in GenBank (AC270085).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison of the assembled sequence with databases for CS-5AL (39), Triticum urartu (diploid donor of the A genome) (43), and three databases for Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tauschii (D genome) (SI Appendix, Method S2) identified a 290-kb region with high identity ( greater than 99%) to the A genome databases, flanked by sequences with high identity ( greater than 99%) to Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tauschii (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that the VRN-D4 locus originated by the insertion of a large segment from chromosome arm 5AL into chromosome arm 5DS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Annotation of the assembled region of CS-dt-5DS revealed the presence of three genes (AC270085).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VRN-D4 was the only gene in the 290-kb 5AL region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the genes known to flank VRN-A1 in chromosome arm 5AL (7) were detected in the sequence of the inserted 5AL segment or by PCR in the DNA extracted from sorted 5DS chromosome arms from CS-dt-5DS (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two other genes were located in the D-genome region downstream of VRN-D4 (CYCLIN-A2-1 and hypothetical gene TRIUR3_08792).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No genes were detected in the 225-kb sequence upstream of the 5AL insertion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first border of the 5DS/5AL insertion is located 88.3 kb upstream of the start codon of VRN-D4 (henceforth upstream insertion site, Fig 3B) and the second border is located between 201 and 203 kb downstream of VRN-D4 (henceforth downstream insertion site, Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed diagnostic PCR markers for each border (Fig 3C and SI Appendix, Method S3), that were perfectly correlated with the A367C SNP diagnostic for VRN-D4 in the critical recombinants of the TDF × CS5402 fine mapping population (SI Appendix, Fig S2C) and in all of the accessions described in SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that VRN-D4 originated from the same 5DS/5AL insertion event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We could not find a single Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tauschii contig matching both D-genome borders of the CS-dt-5DS sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tauschii contig 5265.1 showed  greater than 99% identity with a 104-kb region of CS-dt-5DS upstream of the 5AL insertion site (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the additional 200 kb of this Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tauschii contig showed no similarity with the CS-dt-5DS D-genome sequence on the other side of the 5AL insertion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that one of the original borders of the 5DS/5AL insertion was likely modified during or after the insertion event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis was further supported by high levels of identity between different Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tauschii contigs and the CS-dt-5DS region downstream of the 290-kb insertion (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the closest source of the 5AL segment inserted on chromosome arm 5DS, we compared the genomic sequence of VRN-D4 with seven VRN-A1 alleles from polyploid wheat (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VRN1 sequences form Triticum monococcum and T. urartu were included as outgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A neighbor joining tree showed that the closest sequence to VRN-D4 was the VRN-A1 allele from CS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two sequences differed only in one SNP (A367C) in 14,912 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VRN-A1 sequences from Jagger and Claire were also very similar, showing only one and three additional SNPs in the analyzed region, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_the_VRN-D4_Allele_for_Spring_Growth_Habit  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although VRN-D4 is expressed early in development in the absence of vernalization, its sequence lacks previously known mutations associated with spring growth habit (7, 1720).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, VRN-D4 has three close SNPs in the RIP-3 region of the first intron (SI Appendix, Fig S8), which acts as a binding site for TaGRP2, a known negative regulator of VRN1 (21) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found the canonical RIP-3 sequence in VRN-B1 and VRN-D1 in polyploid wheat and in VRN-Am1 in diploid wheat T. monococcum (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, we detected two different RIP-3 haplotypes in the VRN-A1 sequence (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first one includes a T-to-C mutation at position 2,783 from the start codon (henceforth, T2783C or RIP-3VRN-A1) and was found in all 33 T. urartu, 13 T. turgidum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dicoccoides, 13 T. turgidum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dicoccum, and 12 T. aestivum sequenced accessions (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second haplotype, found in VRN-D4 and the related VRN-A1 sequences in CS, Jagger, and Claire (henceforth RIP-3VRN-D4), included the previous T2783C SNP and two additional SNPs at positions 2,780 (G2780C) and 2,784 (C2784T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the VRN-A1 alleles from Jagger and Claire have been previously linked to a weak vernalization requirement (6, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test if these SNPs at the RIP-3 region affect the binding of the TaGRP2 protein (SI Appendix, Fig S9A), we performed RNA-electrophoretic mobility shift assays (REMSA, SI Appendix, Method S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we tested a 27-nt RNA probe (SI Appendix, Fig S9B) identical to the previously published RIP-3 fragment (21) and compared it to two 27-nt RNA probes containing the SNPs present in RIP-3VRN-A1 and RIP-3VRN-D4 (SI Appendix, Fig S9C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TaGRP2 bound to the RIP-3 fragment in a dose-dependent manner (SI Appendix, Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of the binding decreased in the presence of the T2783C mutation in RIP-3VRN-A1 and was almost eliminated in the presence of the three mutations characteristic of the RIP-3VRN-D4 allele (SI Appendix, Fig S9C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The predicted secondary structure of the 27-nt RIP-3 sequence was different from the one generated using longer RIP-3 flanking sequences (200 nt) and was affected by the SNPs in RIP-3VRN-A1 and RIP-3VRN-D4 (Fig 4B and SI Appendix, Fig S9D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if these differences have an effect on the differential binding of TaGRP2, we developed longer RIP-3 RNA probes (34 nt, henceforth RIP-3L) that have similar structures to that predicted for RIP-3 with longer flanking regions (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three polymorphic SNPs are all located within a single-stranded RNA loop of the predicted RIP-3L structure and their presence does not affect the predicted structure of the probes (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TaGRP2 showed a strong binding to the RIP-3L probe with the canonical sequence, a weaker binding to the RIP-3LVRN-A1 probe with one SNP, and almost no binding to the RIP-3LVRN-D4 probe with 3 SNPs (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar result was found when the experiment was repeated under low binding temperature (4 °C, Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the two probe lengths and two binding temperatures tested in the in vitro assays showed similar relative binding intensities for RIP-3, RIP-3VRN-A1, and RIP-3VRN-D4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Geographical_Distribution_of_VRN-D4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two markers for the 5DS/5AL insertion and for the A367C SNP are diagnostic for the presence of VRN-D4 and were used to study the distribution of VRN-D4 in hexaploid wheat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RIP-3VRN-D4 haplotype is also informative, but its presence should be interpreted with caution because this haplotype is also present in the VRN-A1 locus in some accessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These four markers were all present in 22 of the 26 T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aestivum accessions (SI Appendix, Table S4) previously proposed to carry VRN-D4 based on genetic analyses (3234).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, markers for the 5DS/5AL insertion and for the A367C SNP were not detected in accessions IL193, CL035, IL346, and CL030 (SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copy number assays showed that these four accessions have no additional copies of VRN-A1 outside the ones in chromosome arm 5AL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accessions IL193 and CL035 have only one copy of VRN-A1 carrying the RIP-3VRN-D4 haplotype (same as Jagger, Claire, and CS), whereas accessions IL346 and CL030 have two linked copies of VRN-A1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last two lines have a C349T fixed SNP (SI Appendix, Table S4) that is diagnostic for a tandem duplication of VRN-A1 on chromosome 5AL (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirmed the absence of VRN-D4 in these four accessions, suggesting that the original crosses and genetic analyses should be repeated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The collection sites of the T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aestivum accessions carrying VRN-D4 (SI Appendix, Table S4) partially overlap with the distribution of T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum (Punjab region, current Northeast Pakistan and Northwest of India, SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This last subspecies has been previously proposed as a putative source of VRN-D4 (41), a suggestion that is supported by the high frequency of VRN-D4 (94%) among the 33 T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum accessions characterized in this study (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only two accessions classified as T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum lacking VRN-D4 were collected in China (CItr 8610 and CItr 10911).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two lines also differed from the other T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum accessions by the presence of the Vrn-D1a allele (SI Appendix, Table S5), which carries a large intron deletion that is associated with a spring growth habit and that is present at high frequency in China (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analyses of additional molecular markers for six VRN1 and VRN3 alleles showed no additional alleles for spring growth habit among the 31 T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum accessions that carry VRN-D4 (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each accession, we also extracted RNA from leaves of 1-wk-old unvernalized plants and performed RT-PCR with primers that amplify both VRN-D4 and VRN-A1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing of the amplification products showed only the VRN-D4 allele (A367C SNP), confirming that this gene is expressed early in development in these T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum accessions (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if the absence of VRN-D4 from these two lines from China was the result of admixture with other T. aestivum subspecies, we compared them with accessions from five different T. aestivum subspecies (SI Appendix, Method S5 and Table S6) using the 90K iSelect SNP chip (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The five subspecies were clustered into six groups, including two different groups for T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum and one group combining the spring accessions of T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aestivum with the accessions from T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  compactum (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chinese accessions CItr 8610 and CItr 10911 exhibited evidence of extensive admixture, which may explain the absence of VRN-D4 in these two lines (asterisks in Fig 5C and SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The VRN-D4 gene was found in all of the T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum accessions from the Punjab region, suggesting that it likely contributed to local adaptation and was favored by positive selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we estimated the average genetic diversity (47) across chromosomes and chromosome regions in the different T. aestivum subspecies using 14,236 SNPs with known chromosome locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce the possible effect of ascertainment bias, diversity values per chromosome were divided by the average diversity of their respective genome and subspecies (SI Appendix, Method S6 and Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values, referred to hereafter as standardized genetic diversity, are summarized in SI Appendix, Fig S12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For chromosome 5D, the standardized genetic diversity of the T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum accessions carrying VRN-D4 is less than half the average of the values from the other four T. aestivum subspecies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the other 20 chromosomes showed such a large difference in standardized genetic diversity among subspecies (SI Appendix, Fig S12A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine which region of chromosome 5D was responsible for the reduced diversity, we divided each chromosome arm into one proximal (1/3 of the genetic length including VRN-D4) and one distal region (2/3 of the genetic length).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, a similar analysis was performed for homeologous chromosomes 5A and 5B (Fig 5E) and for all of the chromosomes of the D genome (SI Appendix, Fig S12B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromosome 5D of T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum showed a 1.8-fold reduction in standardized genetic diversity in the distal region and a 4.7-fold reduction in the proximal region compared with the average of the other four subspecies (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a drastic relative reduction in diversity in the proximal region was not observed in chromosomes 5A and 5B (Fig 5E) or in any of the other chromosomes of the D genome in T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum (SI Appendix, Fig S12B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centromeric region of chromosome 5D, where VRN-D4 is located, also showed the highest level of genetic differentiation (FST) between T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum and the pooled data from the other four subspecies (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, these results indicate that the proximal region of chromosome 5D in T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum accounts for most of the observed reduction in genetic diversity in chromosome 5D in this subspecies and contributes to its genetic differentiation of T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum from the other subspecies of T. aestivum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Dynamic_Wheat_Genome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study shows that the VRN-D4 gene originated from the insertion of a large region of chromosome arm 5AL (including VRN-A1) into chromosome arm 5DS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of genes and gene fragments in noncolinear locations is relatively frequent in the large genomes of the temperate grasses, which originated from massive amplifications of repetitive elements (39, 4850).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some DNA transposons in wheat (e.g., CACTA) are able to move genes and gene fragments to noncolinear locations (51), as reported for rice Pack-MULEs (52) and maize helitrons (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this mechanism is associated with mobilization of small DNA fragments (less_than3 kb) (54) and is unlikely to explain the 290-kb insertion that originated VRN-D4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An alternative mechanism proposed to explain noncolinear DNA sequences involves the insertion of nonhomologous DNA segments to repair double-strand breaks generated by the insertion of repetitive elements (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hallmark of this mechanism is the presence of a retrotransposon insertion in one of the borders of the acceptor site (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is associated with a wide range of insertion sizes and therefore can explain the 290-kb 5AL insertion in chromosome arm 5DS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, one of the original downstream borders of the 5AL insertion has been altered in the CS-dt-5DS sequence, limiting our ability to determine the molecular mechanism that originated this large 5AL insertion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The insertion of the 5AL chromosome segment into the 5DS chromosome arm provides a well-documented example of the ability of large wheat chromosome regions to move to different chromosome locations within historical times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that contigs in a chromosome arm database that match sequences in different chromosomes may represent real insertion events and should not be automatically discarded as DNA contaminations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our results demonstrate that some of the sequences deposited in the wheat survey sequences of CS (39) actually belong to different wheat varieties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between CS and CS-derived cytogenetic stocks have been reported before (40) and should be considered when analyzing the CS survey sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Origin_of_VRN-D4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous genetic studies identified the presence of VRN-D4 in a few accessions of T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum and suggested that this subspecies could be the source of VRN-D4 (32, 41, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This subspecies, first described in 1921 (56), has been found mainly in the Punjab region, including vast areas of eastern Pakistan and northern India.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characteristic round grains are abundant in archeological sites from the Indus Valley Civilization between 4,600 and 3,900 y ago (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identification and characterization of VRN-D4 allowed us to study the distribution of this gene in a larger germplasm collection (SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found VRN-D4 in 31 of the 33 accessions of T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum (SI Appendix, Table S5) but in none of the accessions from the other subspecies described in SI Appendix, Table S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results, together with the higher frequency of VRN-D4 in T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aestivum accessions from South Asia (SI Appendix, Table S4), support the hypothesis that VRN-D4 originated in T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only two accessions classified as T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum that lacked the VRN-D4 were collected in China (outside the central area of distribution for this subspecies) and carry the alternative VRN-D1a allele for spring growth habit (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two accessions exhibit high levels of admixture (Fig 5), which may explain the absence of VRN-D4 and the presence of a different allele for spring growth habit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Except for the previous two accessions from China, none of the T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum accessions described in SI Appendix, Table S5 carry known VRN1 or VRN3 alleles for spring growth habit (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that VRN-D4 may be the only allele for spring growth habit in this subspecies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was confirmed for accessions K-5498 and K-23822 (SI Appendix, Table S5) in a previously published genetic study (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of VRN-D4 in the induction of spring growth habit in this subspecies was also supported by the early expression of this gene during development in the absence of vernalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early expression was confirmed for all of the accessions of T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum carrying this gene (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Patterns_of_Genetic_Diversity_in_the_VRN-D4_Region  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The proximal region of chromosome 5D in T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum showed a four- to fivefold reduction in standardized genetic diversity and a local increase in genetic differentiation relative to the other four subspecies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe reductions in genetic diversity of this magnitude in the proximal regions of homeologous chromosomes 5A and 5B (Fig 5E) or in the proximal regions of the other six chromosomes from the D genome (SI Appendix, Fig S12B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These patterns of genetic diversity are likely associated with adaptive selection for Vrn-D4 or a tightly linked gene in the centromeric region of chromosome 5D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Indirect support for Vrn-D4s role in local adaptation is provided by previous studies showing evidence of selection for different VRN1 loci (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among modern wheat varieties, the strong Vrn-A1a allele for early flowering is predominant in regions of very cold winters, where spring wheats are planted in the spring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the weaker Vrn-B1a and VrnD1a alleles are present at higher frequencies in the Mediterranean climates where spring wheats are planted during the fall (45, 59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide an example of the selective forces that could have also operated on VRN-D4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adaptive selection for VRN-D4 might have been favored by the absence of other alleles for spring growth habit in the T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum accessions from South Asia (SI Appendix, Table S5) and by the partial dominant nature of the Vrn-D4 allele for early flowering (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We currently do not know when the VRN-D4 gene originated in T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum and how fast it was adopted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if DNAs can be obtained from ancient archeological samples of T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum, the diagnostic markers developed in this study for VRN-D4 can be used to answer these questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genetic_Differentiation_of_T_aestivum_ssp_sphaerococcum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the characterization of the VRN-D4 region, this study provides an overall view of T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum genetic diversity that is very different from the one suggested in earlier studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early studies based on few morphological traits proposed that T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum and ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aestivum differed only in a few loci (61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our study based on a genome-wide sample of SNPs, suggests a very different picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the FST and cluster analyses showed that T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum is one of the most differentiated subspecies of T. aestivum (Fig 5D and SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A genome-wide scan of FST values across the 21 chromosomes revealed multiple genomic regions with strong differentiation, including VRN-D4 (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be interesting to investigate if these differentiated regions are also targets of adaptive selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesize that as common wheat moved eastward and westward from its original area on the south coast of the Caspian Sea, it differentiated and adapted to new environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limited exchanges between the western and Asian human populations during the early stages of agriculture expansion likely favored the simultaneous differentiation of crops, cultures, and languages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The divergence of T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum from the western T. aestivum subspecies parallels the differentiation of the Indo-European languages, where the Indo-Iranian subfamilies are more distinct from the western Celtic, Germanic, Italic, and Balto-Slavic families (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

VRN-D4_Provides_Insights_into_the_Regulation_of_Vernalization_Requirement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
None of the polymorphisms previously known to be associated with spring growth habit in VRN1 regulatory regions (1720) were found in VRN-D4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, alternative mechanisms are required to explain the dominant spring growth habit associated with the Vrn-D4 allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss below three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Triple Dirk F (TDF, spring, Vrn-D4) and Triple Dirk C (TDC, winter, vrn-D4), and Triple Dirk D (TDD, Vrn-A1a) are part of a series of isogenic lines carrying different alleles for spring growth habit in the genetic background of Triple Dirk (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Australian variety Gabo is the source of the VRN-D4 allele in TDF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines with the closest recombination events to VRN-D4 were used to validate the VRN-D4 candidate gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lines were identified in a high density map of VRN-D4 generated from the cross between TDF and a substitution line of chromosome 5D from synthetic wheat 5402 in CS (CS5402) (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We characterized two common wheat varieties with reduced vernalization requirement linked to the VRN-A1 locus (6, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jagger (KS-82-W-418/STEPHENS), a hard red winter wheat, was the most widely planted variety in Kansas and Oklahoma for 12 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its early maturity helps Jagger to partially avoid wheat rust and heat stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Claire (WASP/FLAME) is a variety from the United Kingdom released in 1999 that remains popular for its suitability for early sowing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the geographic distribution of VRN-D4, we characterized a collection of 26 T. aestivum accessions with known vernalization genes (3234) (SI Appendix, Table S4) and a collection of 33 T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum accessions obtained from the National Small Grains Collection (NSGC) and the Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For progeny tests and expression experiments, plants were grown in PGR15 growth chambers (Conviron) adjusted to 16 h of light (22 °C) and 8 h of darkness (18 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Expression_Profiles_and_Copy_Number_Variation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA samples were extracted from leaves using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VRN1, VRN2, FT and ACTIN primers for SYBR GREEN quantitative PCR were developed in previous studies (10, 70, 71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VRN-A1, VRN-B1 and VRN-D1 expression was tested using genome specific qRT-PCR primers described before (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green and a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplified products were confirmed by sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VRN-A1 and VRN-D4 transcripts were differentiated by the presence of an additional BstNI restriction site in VRN-D4 (A367C polymorphism, SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VRN-A1 copy number estimation was performed using the Taqman assay described before (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Physical_Map  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MTP clones of the CS-dt-5DS BAC library (42) were screened at Sabanci University (Turkey) with three pairs of primers for VRN-D4 listed in SI Appendix, Table S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selected BAC and 11 overlapping BACs belonging to two overlapping contigs (SI Appendix, Table S2) were sequenced using a combination of Illumina and 454 sequencing (SI Appendix, Method S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annotation was conducted using Triannot (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assembled sequence was compared with the 5AL arm database of the IWGSC (39), T. urartu (v1.26 plants.ensembl.org) (43), and three Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tauschii (D genome) databases (plants.ensembl.org/Aegilops_tauschii/, GCA_000347335.1 (73), aegilops.wheat.ucdavis.edu/ATGSP/ (74), and https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/download/iwgsc/TGAC_WGS_assemblies_of_other_wheat_species, TGAC_WGS_tauschii_v1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used BLAT v. 35 filtered for matches that were longer than 500 bp and  greater than 99% identical (SI Appendix, Method S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Targeting_Local_Lesions_in_Genomes_Mutants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A targeting local lesions in genomes (TILLING) population of 1,153 lines of hexaploid wheat line TDF (VRN-D4) was mutagenized with 0.9% ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) and screened using a CelI assay as described before (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA pools (four lines per pool) were screened with three sets of primers (SI Appendix, Method S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential effects of the different mutations on protein function were predicted using programs PROVEAN, SIFT, and PolyPhen-2 (SI Appendix, Method S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T_aestivum_ssp_sphaerococcum_Population_Structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A total of 100 lines including 33 T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum, 15 T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  macha, 17 T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  compactum, 15 T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  spelta, and 20 T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aestivum (10 spring and 10 winter) accessions obtained from the NSGC (SI Appendix, Table S6) were genotyped with the iSelect 90k SNP array (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The population structure analysis was conducted using the program STRUCTURE version 2.3.4 (SI Appendix, Method S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fixation index (FST) between all possible pairwise combinations of the five subspecies was calculated using the program Arlequin (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean FST values were calculated using a sliding window of seven mapped SNPs (46) with steps of four SNPs to generate smoother curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FST values for each SNP were calculated by comparing T. aestivum ssp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sphaerococcum with pooled data from the other four subspecies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
