Drosophila larvae synthesize the putative oncometabolite L-2-hydroxyglutarate during normal developmental growth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oncometabolites are small molecules that promote tumor formation and growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG) is a putative oncometabolite that is associated with gliomas and renal cell carcinomas, as well as a severe neurometabolic disorder known as L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite that L-2HG is commonly considered a metabolic waste product, this compound was recently discovered to control immune cell fate, thereby demonstrating that it has endogenous functions in healthy animal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we find that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, also synthesizes high concentrations of L-2HG during normal larval growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our discovery establishes the fly as a genetic model for studying this putative oncometabolite in healthy animal tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG) has emerged as a putative oncometabolite that is capable of inhibiting enzymes involved in metabolism, chromatin modification, and cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite the ability of L-2HG to interfere with a broad range of cellular processes, this molecule is often characterized as a metabolic waste product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila larvae use the metabolic conditions established by aerobic glycolysis to both synthesize and accumulate high concentrations of L-2HG during normal developmental growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A majority of the larval L-2HG pool is derived from glucose and dependent on the Drosophila estrogen-related receptor (dERR), which promotes L-2HG synthesis by up-regulating expression of the Drosophila homolog of lactate dehydrogenase (dLdh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that dLDH is both necessary and sufficient for directly synthesizing L-2HG and the Drosophila homolog of L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (dL2HGDH), which encodes the enzyme that breaks down L-2HG, is required for stage-specific degradation of the L-2HG pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, dLDH also indirectly promotes L-2HG accumulation via synthesis of lactate, which activates a metabolic feed-forward mechanism that inhibits dL2HGDH activity and stabilizes L-2HG levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we use a genetic approach to demonstrate that dLDH and L-2HG influence position effect variegation and DNA methylation, suggesting that this compound serves to coordinate glycolytic flux with epigenetic modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our studies demonstrate that growing animal tissues synthesize L-2HG in a controlled manner, reveal a mechanism that coordinates glucose catabolism with L-2HG synthesis, and establish the fly as a unique model system for studying the endogenous functions of L-2HG during cell growth and proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Drosophila_Larvae_Synthesize_High_Concentrations_of_L-2HG  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In an effort to characterize the metabolic basis of Drosophila larval growth, we used a targeted GC-MSbased approach to identify compounds that are abundant in larvae but absent in other developmental stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach identified 2HG, whose levels are elevated between threefold and 10-fold in larvae compared with embryos, wandering third-instar larvae, white prepupae, and adults (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize this larval 2HG pool further, we used a chiral derivatization method to individually measure the concentrations of D-2HG and L-2HG in w1118 second-instar larvae (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although L2 larvae harbor relatively low quantities of D-2HG (0.1 nmol/mg of body mass; Fig 1B), the concentration of L-2HG surpasses 2 nmol/mg of body mass (Fig 1B and Fig S1B), which exceeds the IC50 of all analyzed 2OGDs and indicates that larvae accumulate physiologically relevant levels of this compound (6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, we observed that the Drosophila late embryonic and L3 cell lines Kc167 and BG1-c1, respectively, also produce relatively high concentrations of L-2HG (0.20.8 nmol/mg), but only possess a basal level of D-2HG (Fig 1C), indicating L-2HG accumulation is a general feature of rapid cell growth and proliferation in flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The extent to which larvae accumulate L-2HG is striking, as the only other healthy tissues known to accumulate high concentrations of L-2HG are T lymphocytes and cultured human cells that experience hypoxia (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we raised larvae under normoxic conditions (Materials and Methods), our results suggested that larvae accumulate L-2HG via a novel metabolic mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To pinpoint the metabolic origin of L-2HG, L2 larvae were fed semidefined media that were supplemented with either U-13Clabeled glucose or U-13Clabeled proline (an anaplerotic amino acid in insects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larvae raised on labeled food incorporated 13C into L-2HG, indicating that Drosophila metabolism is capable of synthesizing this compound (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, 60% of the L-2HG pool was labeled with 13C after 24 h of U-13C-glucose consumption, but only 15% of this pool contained 13C as the result of feeding labeled proline (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because animal cells synthesize L-2HG from 2OG, our results suggested that larvae ultimately generate this compound by shuttling glucose-derived pyruvate into the TCA cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that m + 2 was the most abundant L-2HG isotopologue following U-13C-glucose feeding, an observation that is consistent with fully labeled pyruvate entering the TCA cycle via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, feeding of U-13C-proline primarily produced the m + 5 isotopologue (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are likely additional anaplerotic compounds that are used to generate L-2HG, our observations indicate that a majority of the larval L-2HG pool is generated from glucose oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

dERR_Promotes_L-2HG_Accumulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rapidly growing Drosophila larvae rely on elevated levels of glucose catabolism to generate biomass (24); therefore, our 13C tracer analysis suggests that larvae generated L-2HG as a byproduct of this metabolic program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this hypothesis by measuring L-2HG levels in dERR mutants, which fail to up-regulate carbohydrate metabolism before the onset of larval development (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only were L-2HG levels dramatically lower in dERR mutants compared with w1118 controls but this L-2HG phenotype was also rescued by the expression of a dERR-GFP transgene in the dERR mutant background (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies indicated that L-2HG production is dependent on the metabolic program that is established by dERR at the onset of larval growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In an effort to identify the enzyme that synthesizes L-2HG, we searched for enzymes that are both regulated by dERR and only expressed at a high level in larvae, mimicking the L-2HG accumulation pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One gene that fulfilled these criteria was the Drosophila homolog of LDH (dLdh; also known as ImpL3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of dLdh is dependent on dERR activity and is restricted to late-stage embryos and growing larvae, and lactate levels decrease at the onset of metamorphosis, mirroring the temporal changes we observe in L-2HG abundance (24, 27, 28) (Fig 2B and Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if dERR mutants lack L-2HG due to loss of dLDH activity, we used the da-GAL4 driver to express a UAS-dLdh transgene ubiquitously in this mutant background (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though most L-2HG is derived from glucose and glycolytic capacity is severely impaired in dERR mutants (24), UAS-dLdh expression increased L-2HG levels by threefold in dERR-mutant larvae compared with the negative control strains (Fig 2C), indicating that dLDH is sufficient to drive L-2HG accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if dLDH is also necessary for larval L-2HG synthesis, we generated two mutations that eliminate dLdh gene expression (Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals that harbor a trans-heterozygous combination of these null alleles, dLdh16/dLdh17, grow at a normal rate until the midthird instar, at which point 50% of the larvae die and the remainder develop into morphologically normal adults (Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite the normal growth rate, GC-MS analysis of the dLdh16/dLdh17 midsecond-instar larvae revealed dramatic metabolic phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mutants not only displayed a fivefold increase in pyruvate and a 20-fold decrease in lactate but 2HG levels were almost undetectable compared with a precise excision control strain (dLdhprec) (Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these metabolic defects were specifically due to the loss of dLDH activity, as the aberrant pyruvate, lactate, and 2HG levels observed in dLdh16/dLdh17 mutants were completely rescued by a dLdh transgene (Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained a similar phenotype by expressing a UAS-dLdh-RNAi transgene, which depleted dLdh mRNA levels and induced a significant reduction in the abundance of lactate and 2HG (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we confirmed that loss of dLDH activity predominantly affects the L-2HG pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While dLdh16/dLdh17 larvae exhibited a modest decrease in D-2HG levels, the abundance of L-2HG decreased by 98% in these mutants (2.1 nmol/mg [dLdhprec] vs. 0.04 nmol/mg [dLdh16/dLdh17]; Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results demonstrate that dERR promotes L-2HG synthesis by up-regulating dLdh gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

dLDH_Directly_Synthesizes_L-2HG_from_2OG  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings that dLDH is both necessary and sufficient for L-2HG accumulation suggests that this enzyme could be directly responsible for synthesizing L-2HG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this possibility by incubating purified dLDH with NADH and either pyruvate or 2OG, which serves as the precursor for L-2HG in mammalian cells (17, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on changes in both NADH concentration (340-nm absorbance) and end-point GC-MS analysis, dLDH not only converts pyruvate to lactate but also synthesizes L-2HG from 2OG (Fig 3 A and B and Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with earlier studies (16, 21), we also observed that human LDHA catalyzed the reaction of 2OG to L-2HG, thereby demonstrating that LDH generates L-2HG via an evolutionarily conserved enzymatic mechanism (Fig 3B and Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the course of these kinetic analyses, we discovered an unexpected relationship between lactate and L-2HG synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although dLDH converted pyruvate to lactate with normal MichaelisMenten kinetics (Km, pyruvate = 3.6 mM at pH 7.5; Fig 3C), dLDH catalyzed the reduction of 2OG with a much lower efficiency and displayed non-MichaelisMenten kinetics (K0.5, 2OG = 57.5 mM; Hill coefficient = 3; Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite the ability of dLDH to synthesize lactate at a much faster rate than L-2HG, both of these compounds are found at nearly identical concentrations in midsecond-instar larvae (Fig 3C), indicating that lactate and L-2HG levels are coordinately regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Drosophila_L-2-Hydroxyglutarate_Dehydrogenase_Regulates_L-2HG_Accumulation_in_a_Lactate-Sensitive_Manner  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering that dLDH acts on 2OG with a relatively low efficiency, we hypothesized that the larval L-2HG pool represents a combination of increased synthesis and decreased degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mammals, the mitochondrial enzyme L2HGDH controls L-2HG levels by converting this compound to 2OG (13, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if Drosophila L-2HG levels are controlled by a similar mechanism, we generated two mutations in the sole fly L2HGDH ortholog (dL2HGDH; also known as CG10639; Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals that carry a trans-heterozygous combination of these mutations, dL2HGDH12 and dL2HGDH14, are viable and display significantly higher L-2HG levels throughout the fly life cycle (Fig 4A and Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ubiquitous overexpression of UAS-dL2HGDH in a dL2HGDH12/dL2HGDH14 mutant background completely rescued this metabolic phenotype (Fig 4B), demonstrating that dL2HGDH is responsible for degrading L-2HG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most dramatic aspect of the dL2HGDH mutant phenotype, however, was found in early prepupae, where L-2HG levels were elevated nearly 20-fold in dL2HGDH12/dL2HGDH14 mutants (Fig 4A), a difference that reflects the stage-specific regulation of L-2HG metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although control larvae experience a 90% decrease in L-2HG immediately before metamorphosis (Fig 1A), this metabolic switch fails in dL2HGDH mutants and L-2HG levels remain at levels normally associated with larval stages (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The manner by which L-2HG levels drop at the onset of metamorphosis suggests that dL2HGDH enzymatic activity is relatively low in larvae compared with pupae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stage-specific regulation, however, does not occur at a transcriptional level, as dL2HGDH mRNA levels peak during larval development and actually drop before puparium formation (27) (Fig S6C), indicating that larval L-2HG degradation is controlled at a posttranscriptional level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that both lactate and L-2HG are structurally similar -hydroxy acids, we hypothesized that lactate might regulate L-2HG levels by acting as a competitive inhibitor of dL2HGDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we raised larvae on food supplemented with increasing lactate concentrations and measured the relative abundance of both lactate and L-2HG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both control and dLdh mutant larvae exhibited significantly elevated levels of L-2HG when raised on high-lactate food (Fig 5 A and B and Fig S7), L-2HG levels in dL2HGDH mutants were resistant to this dietary treatment (Fig 5C), suggesting that lactate-mediated L-2HG accumulation requires dL2HGDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this hypothesis, lactate inhibited the activity of partially purified dL2HGDH in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A concentration of lactate similar to the concentration found in midsecond-instar larvae, 2 mM, induced an 50% decrease in dL2HGDH activity, whereas the addition of 10 mM lactate nearly eliminated L-2HG degradation (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These findings hint at an elegant model for how dLDH can generate such high levels of L-2HG accumulation despite its low affinity for 2OG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If lactate inhibits dL2HGDH activity, then the stage-specific dLdh expression could both increase L-2HG synthesis and inhibit dL2HGDH activity via lactate production, thereby stabilizing the larval L-2HG pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a model would also explain why both dERR and dLdh mutant larvae exhibit such low L-2HG levels, because the loss of dLDH activity would result in both decreased synthesis and increased degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, when we measured L-2HG abundance in dL2HGDH; dLdh double mutants, where loss of dL2HGDH renders larvae unable to degrade L-2HG, we found that L-2HG levels were increased 20-fold compared with the dLdh single mutant (Fig 5 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results reveal a metabolic feed-forward mechanism, wherein dLDH both synthesizes L-2HG and indirectly inhibits L-2HG degradation via the production of lactate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

L-2HG_Regulates_PEV  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 2HG accumulation in mammalian cells is associated with changes in epigenetic modifications and chromatin architecture (6, 7), suggesting that the larval L-2HG pools function in a similar capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this possibility using the In(1) y1 wm4 inversion of the X chromosome as a readout of heterochromatin formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In flies that harbor this chromosome, the white (w) locus is positioned near the centromere, and as a result, w expression is silenced by the pericentric heterochromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon is known as PEV, and the resulting changes in w gene expression are primarily influenced by heterochromatin formation (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis revealed that dLdh mutations are very strong recessive suppressors of PEV (Fig 6 A and B), demonstrating that dLDH activity normally promotes heterochromatin formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the dL2HGDH mutations do not consistently alter PEV under these conditions (Fig 6 A and B), suggesting that this phenomenon is sensitive to loss of L-2HG, but not excess amounts of this compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a result is not unexpected because the larval concentration of L-2HG exceeds the reported IC50 values of most 2OGDs, and increased levels would likely have a minimal effect on the activity of target enzymes (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Drosophila larvae absorb minimal amounts of L-2HG from their food (Fig S8), we assessed the PEV phenotype in dL2HGDH; dLdh double mutants, which accumulate much higher L-2HG levels than the dLdh single mutant (Fig 5 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that this double-mutant strain exhibits the same level of eye pigmentation as wild-type controls (Fig 6 A and B), indicating that the ability of dLdh mutations to suppress the PEV phenotype is due to loss of L-2HG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intriguingly, we found a similar correlation between L-2HG production and DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the Drosophila genome contains very low levels of 5-methylcytosine, the Drosophila Tet-family homolog was recently found to regulate N-6-methyldeoxyadenosine (6mdA) abundance in embryos (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used LC-tandem MS to measure 6mdA quantitatively in larval and adult genomic DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although dLdh mutants maintained normal 6mdA levels during larval development (Fig S9), the abundance of 6mdA in adult genomic DNA was decreased in the absence of dLDH activity (Fig 6C), suggesting that L-2HG production during larval development influences 6mdA levels in cells that will form adult tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the dL2HGDH mutations did not consistently alter 6mdA levels (Fig 6C), suggesting that similar to the PEV result, DNA methylation is sensitive to loss of L-2HG, but not to elevated amounts of this compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the dL2HGDH; dLdh double-mutant strain exhibited significantly higher 6mdA levels than the dLdh single mutant (Fig 6D), indicating that the dLdh mutant genomes contain fewer 6mdA residues as the result of decreased L-2HG accumulation, and revealing a direct link between synthesis of this compound and the regulation of epigenetic modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
L-2HG was long considered a metabolic waste product, as eukaryotic genomes lack enzymes devoted to synthesizing this molecule, most cell types quickly degrade L-2HG, and L-2HG accumulation in humans is primarily associated with disease states (3, 12, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies, however, indicate that L-2HG can function as a metabolic signaling molecule and demonstrate a need to better understand the normal cellular functions of this compound (17, 20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings establish Drosophila as a model for studying L-2HG and provide a genetic framework for conducting in vivo studies of this putative oncometabolite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike previous reports of L-2HG production in cancer cells and diseased tissues (10, 14), flies generate L-2HG in a controlled fashion, demonstrating that studies of larval metabolism can be used to elucidate the endogenous molecular mechanisms that regulate L-2HG accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, although our analyses reveal that a majority of the larval L-2HG pool is derived from glucose oxidation, L-2HG accumulation is dependent on the normoxic production of lactate, which is a hallmark of aerobic glycolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicate that rapid tissue growth in flies relies on the complex integration of glucose-dependent biosynthesis, lactate production, and mitochondrial metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance of recent stable isotope tracer studies of in vivo cancer metabolism, which revealed that tumors not only generate lactate but are also reliant on significant levels of glucose oxidation (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because endogenous tumor metabolism appears to strike a balance between lactate production and the shuttling of pyruvate into the mitochondria, our results suggest the metabolic mechanism that generates L-2HG in flies could also function in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to describing a metabolic feed-forward mechanism that promotes L-2HG accumulation, our findings reveal that the nuclear receptor dERR is capable of promoting L-2HG accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although recent studies in both T lymphocytes and mammalian cell culture have focused on the role of HIF1 in promoting L-2HG metabolism (17, 20, 21), siRNA targeting of HIF1 in human lung fibroblasts is not sufficient to prevent hypoxia-induced L-2HG production, hinting at an alternative mechanism that promotes synthesis of this compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings indicate that the ERR family could serve this role and suggest that future studies of L-2HG in mammalian systems should examine this conserved family of nuclear receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering that many aspects of glucose metabolism are conserved between flies and mammals, the amount of L-2HG present in larvae is striking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultured mammalian cells maintain very low levels of L-2HG (17, 21), and although certain organs seem predisposed to accumulating this molecule (e.g., testis, brain) (13, 16), L-2HG is efficiently degraded in most tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a clear link, however, between disruption of mitochondrial metabolism and L-2HG production, as hypoxia, activation of HIF signaling (21), disruption of the electron transport chain, and defects in citrate transport result in elevated L-2HG synthesis (17, 2023).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our study demonstrates that flies can generate L-2HG under normoxic conditions, larvae likely experience regular bouts of hypoxia, both while immersed in their food and as a direct result of rapidly increasing body size (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, dERR is both required for the hypoxia response in larvae and physically interacts with HIF1 (34), indicating that larval metabolism is acutely prepared to deal with a low-oxygen environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we propose a model wherein larvae constitutively express dLdh and generate L-2HG both as a means of supporting biosynthesis and preempting the need to frequently mount a hypoxia response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is supported by our findings that larval L-2HG is generated from glucose oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By converting 2OG into L-2HG, larvae can couple glucose catabolism with biosynthetic processes that rely on the mitochondria (e.g., synthesis of fatty acids) regardless of oxygen availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
L-2HG can likely inhibit dozens of enzymes, indicating that this compound could act as a means of coordinating metabolic flux with a wide range of cellular processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this possibility, our preliminary studies suggest that this compound regulates epigenetic modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the manner by which dLDH activity modifies the PEV phenotype indicates that L-2HG can influence heterochromatin formation in cells that will form the adult body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, future studies of dLDH and L-2HG could serve as a model for understanding how dietary cues can influence gene expression and metabolic disease symptoms over extended periods of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, our findings suggest that L-2HG is more than a metabolic waste product; rather, it serves to coordinate glycolytic flux with 2OG-dependent processes, such as heterochromatin formation and gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The dL2HGDH mutations were generated using CRISPR/Cas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, guide RNA constructs that targeted two unique regions of dL2HGDH (5-gctggcatctactataagcc-3 and 5-gatcgaaggcagcgagattc-3) were designed using the Fly CRISPR Optimal Target Finder (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oligonucleotides containing these sequences were inserted into pU6-BbsI-chiRNA (Addgene no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45946), and the resulting plasmid was independently injected into Bloomington Stock no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52669 (Rainbow Transgenic Flies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations were identified using a PCR-based method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For UAS-dL2HGDH, the coding region of CG10639 was PCR-amplified from Drosophila Genomics Resource Center (DGRC) clone LD39082, sequenced, and inserted into pUAST-attB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dLdh rescue construct was generated by amplifying 7.5 kb of genomic DNA from BAC clone BACR30A03 and inserting the resulting PCR product into pAttB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complete list of strains and reagents is provided above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Eye_Pigment_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eye pigment was quantified according to a previously described method (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, adult male flies were aged at 25 °C for 3 d posteclosion, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each genotype, a minimum of 20 flies were manually decapitated, and individual heads were extracted in 100 L of 30% acidified ethanol (pH 2, adjusted with HCl), homogenized with a pestle, and incubated in the dark for 48 h at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was centrifuged to clear debris, and the absorbance at 480 nm of the supernatant was measured using a BioTek Cytation 3 plate reader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chiral_Derivatization_and_Detection_of_D-2HG_and_L-2HG  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantification of D-2HG and L-2HG was based on a previously described protocol (36) in which 0.1 mL of R-2-butanol (Sigma) and 0.01 mL of 37% HCl (Sigma) were added to each dried sample, and the samples were incubated at 90 °C for 3 h at 300 rpm using a ThermoMixer F1.5 (Eppendorf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After cooling, samples were extracted twice with 0.5 mL of n-hexane (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collected organic phase was dried with a Speed-Vac (Savant), and 60 L of pyridine (EMD Millipore) and 60 L of acetic anhydride (Sigma) were then added with heating at 80 °C for 1 h. After evaporation, the residues were suspended with 60 L of n-hexane in preparation for GC-MS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent GC6890-5973i mass spectrometer equipped with a Gerstel MPS autosampler.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chromatographic separation was achieved on a Phenomex ZB5-5 MSi column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selected ion monitoring for quantitation was chosen to record the ions at m/z 173 for 2HG and m/z 176 for [2H3]-2HG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantitation was determined by comparison with [2H3]-2HG internal standard and normalized by the mass of fresh larval pellets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density of larval pellets was estimated as the density of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

13C-Isotope_Labeling_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Larvae were incubated in Semi-Defined Food containing 50% U-13C-glucose or 64% (10 mg/mL) of U-13C-proline (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolites were detected using GC-MS, and the labeled fraction was calculated as reported previously (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isotopologue distributions were corrected based on the natural abundance of elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculating_the_Contribution_of_Labeled_Carbon_to_the_L-2HG_Pool  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 2-HG isotopologue distributions are as follows: (M + 0, M + 1, M + 2, M + 3, M + 4, M + 5) = (m0, m1, m2, m3, m4, m5), where mi (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) is the percentage of the corresponding isotopologue (m0 + m1 + m2 +m3 + m4 + m5 = 1) and p is the percentage of U-13C-glucose or U-13C-proline in the food:Fractionoflabeled2-HG=(1m1+2m2+3m3+4m4+5m5)/5/p  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Purification_of_Drosophila_LDH  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dLDH cDNA was amplified from DGRC clone LD20346 using oligos 5-atgaattcatggccgccattaaggacagtctg-3 and 5-tagcggccgccttagaacttcagaccagcctggac-3, and the resulting fragment was inserted into the EcoR I and Not I sites of pGEX-4T1 (Amersham).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dLDH was expressed in and purified from BL21-competent Escherichia coli as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were grown in LB containing 200 g/mL ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking until OD550 = 0.6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the temperature was changed to 20 °C, and protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.5 mM for about 16 h. After IPTG induction, cells were resuspended in buffer A [140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.3), 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 cOmplete Tablet/10 mL (Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets from Roche), 4 mM DTT] and lysed by sonication in an ice water bath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 10,000 × g supernatant was loaded on Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) for protein binding according to the manufacturers instructions and washed for 10 column volumes with buffer B [140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4 (pH 7.3)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After buffer B wash, the column was incubated with 0.08 U/L thrombin (T1063; Sigma) dissolved in buffer B at room temperature for 16 h. Then, the column was eluted with buffer B, and the eluate was collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein of interest was identified by SDS/PAGE, and the known reaction was catalyzed by LDH from pyruvate to lactate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

dLDH_Kinetic_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For measurement of kinetic parameters, the enzymatic constants of the reaction from pyruvate to lactate were fit to the MichaelisMenten equation by nonlinear least squares using R. The reaction from 2OG to L-2HG catalyzed by dLDH does not obey the MichaelisMenten equation, so the kinetic parameters were fit to the Hill equation with Hill coefficient of 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lactate_Feeding_Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Embryos were transferred to semidefined media that were supplemented with indicated concentrations of lactate (Sigma; the pH of the lactate solution was adjusted to 7.0) and incubated at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Media for dLdh mutant larvae were also supplemented with 0.1 mM L-2HG (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Midsecond larvae (60 h after egg lay) for control and dL2HGDH mutant and early L2 larvae (48 h after egg lay) for dLdh mutant were analyzed using GC-MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

L-2HG_Degradation_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fifty male w1118 flies aged 3 d posteclosion were gently homogenized in 700 L of lysis buffer [20 mM Hepes (pH 7.1), one tablet per 10 mL of protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche), 0.1% Triton X-100] with a motor and pestle on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lysate was centrifuged at 100 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube for in vitro analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the reactions were performed at 25 °C in a previously described reaction buffer [20 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.1), 2 mM L-2HG (Sigma), 0.4 mM FAD (Sigma), 1.5 mM iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (Sigma), varied concentrations of lactate (Sigma)] for 2 h. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 1 mL of methanol (20 °C), and the samples were dried in a SpeedVac (Savant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of L-2HG were detected by GC-MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Synthesis_of_L-2HG  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enantiomerically pure L-2HG was generated using base-catalyzed ring opening of S-(-)-5-oxo-2-tetrahydrofurancarboxylic acid (catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  301469; SigmaAldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each reaction contained 2 g of precursor in 50 mL of 0.4 M NaOH (EMD Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 2 h and then rapidly cooled on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cooled mixtures were dried under N2(g) to concentrate contents into a 3- to 4-mL slurry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The L-2HG was separated from residual precursor on a preparative Intelliflash (Varian) flash chromatography system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentrated slurry was loaded onto an Agela Technologies column packed with 12 g of amino-silica beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mobile phase contained 95% HPLC grade MeOH (Fisher) and 5% acetic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first three 15-mL fractions were saved to retain the unreacted precursor for subsequent rounds of ring opening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The column was washed with 10 column volumes with the mobile phase, and pure L-2HG was then eluted by loading the column with 15 mL of HPLC-water preheated to 55 °C, incubating for 15 min, and repeating with an additional 15 mL of preheated water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful separation of product from precursor was verified using LC-MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pure L-2HG was concentrated by drying under N2(g) and quantified by LC-MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_Methylation_Analysis_with_Ultra-Performance_Liquid_ChromatographyTandem_MS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA was extracted using a Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA samples were prepared and analyzed as described previously (40), with a little modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One microgram of DNA was digested into single nucleosides with 5 units of DNA Degradase Plus (ZymoResearch) at 37 °C for 16 h. The digested DNA was extracted with 200 L of cold 90% methanol three times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatants were pooled together and dried by SpeedVac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dried samples were dissolved with 25 L of resuspension solution [water/methanol/formic acid (95:5:0.1)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)tandem MS analysis was performed on an ultra-HPLC system coupled with a QTRAP 4000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray ion source (Sciex), operating in positive mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five microliters of nucleosides was injected into a reverse phase UPLC column (HSS T3 C18, 2.1 × 100 mm, 1.8-m particle size; Waters) using isocratic conditions [water/methanol/formic acid (95:5:0.1), 300 Lmin1, 45 °C column temperature] for separation provided by a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Dionex Corporation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following multiple reaction monitoring transitions were monitored: m/z 252.1136.1 for deoxyadenosine and m/z 266.1150.1 for 6mdA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification was obtained by standard curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyst 1.5 software was used to calculate the quantitative results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
