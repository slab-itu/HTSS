A protein constructed de novo enables cell growth by altering gene regulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We describe a novel regulatory protein that was discovered in a library of de novo-designed proteins never sampled by nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This de novo protein, SynSerB3, rescues a conditionally lethal mutation in Escherichia coli cells that prevents growth in the absence of serine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that SynSerB3 does not catalyze the biosynthesis of serine but rather upregulates an endogenous protein, histidinol phosphate phosphatase, which can synthesize serine via a promiscuous catalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This regulatory function of SynSerB3 sustains life in E. coli cells under conditions that are otherwise lethal and is a synthetic addition to natural gene regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent advances in protein design rely on rational and computational approaches to create novel sequences that fold and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, natural systems selected functional proteins without any design a priori.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an attempt to mimic nature, we used large libraries of novel sequences and selected for functional proteins that rescue Escherichia coli cells in which a conditionally essential gene has been deleted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, the de novo protein SynSerB3 was selected as a rescuer of cells in which serB, which encodes phosphoserine phosphatase, an enzyme essential for serine biosynthesis, was deleted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, SynSerB3 does not rescue the deleted activity by catalyzing hydrolysis of phosphoserine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, SynSerB3 up-regulates hisB, a gene encoding histidinol phosphate phosphatase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This endogenous E. coli phosphatase has promiscuous activity that, when overexpressed, compensates for the deletion of phosphoserine phosphatase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the de novo protein SynSerB3 rescues the deletion of serB by altering the natural regulation of the His operon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The_de_Novo_Protein_SynSerB3_Enables_Growth_of_serB_Cells_on_Minimal_Medium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The serB gene in E. coli encodes phosphoserine phosphatase, which catalyzes the final step in serine biosynthesis (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because serine is an essential metabolite, serB cells are auxotrophs and cannot grow on minimal medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reported previously that several de novo proteins from our binary patterned libraries rescue the serB deletion on minimal medium (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose one of these proteins, SynSerB3, for detailed characterization because it rescues serB in fewer days than the other SynSerB proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before setting out to determine the mechanism of rescue, we sought to confirm that SynSerB3 is indeed responsible for the rescue of the serB auxotroph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As depicted in Fig 1B, serB cells were transformed with plasmids expressing SynSerB3, LacZ (negative control), or WT E. coli SerB (positive control).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transformants were plated on M9/glucose minimal plates containing isopropyl--d-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to induce expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, serB cells expressing LacZ failed to grow, even after 14 d, whereas those expressing the native E. coli SerB formed colonies in 2 d. The same cells expressing SynSerB3 formed colonies in 4 d, confirming that SynSerB3 rescues the serB deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly, growth sustained by the de novo protein is slower than that of the natural protein, which had been selected by billions of years of evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm the results observed on plates and to quantify the growth rates of the rescued cells more accurately, we assayed growth in liquid cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1C, the controls produce the expected growth curves in minimal medium: serB cells expressing the natural SerB gene showed exponential growth with a relatively short lag time, and cells expressing LacZ did not grow at all.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected from our results on solid medium, cells expressing the de novo protein SynSerB3 grew in minimal medium but did not grow as rapidly as cells expressing the native E. coli protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further confirm that the sequence of SynSerB3 is responsible for the rescue, we performed following additional experiments:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_SynSerB3_Protein_Has_No_Detectable_Phosphoserine_Phosphatase_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In principle SynSerB3 could rescue serB cells either by enabling the conversion of phosphoserine to serine (the reaction deleted by serB) or by facilitating a novel pathway that bypasses this step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If SynSerB3 facilitated a bypass pathway, it would be expected to rescue the deletion of other enzymes in the serine biosynthesis pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as reported by Fisher et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (9), SynSerB3 does not rescue serC, which encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the step before SerB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, SynSerB3 does not bypass the natural serine biosynthesis pathway; it rescues serB cells by enabling the same step catalyzed by the deleted enzyme, phosphoserine phosphatase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because expression of SynSerB3 enables the conversion of phosphoserine to serine, we began our studies by testing whether the de novo protein accomplished this conversion by direct action, i.e., by catalyzing this reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We purified the SynSerB3 protein using affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure there was no possibility of contamination by the natural E. coli phosphoserine phosphatase enzyme, all purifications were done from serB cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purified SynSerB3 protein was incubated with phosphoserine in a variety of buffers, and liberation of phosphate was assayed using a standard malachite green assay (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive control, SerB from E. coli, showed high levels of activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the de novo SynSerB3 protein displayed no detectable activity under any of the conditions tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the purified SynSerB3 protein was not enzymatically active, we considered the possibility that SynSerB3 might require an endogenous molecular partnereither another protein or a cofactor to catalyze the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we assayed for phosphoserine phosphatase activity in cell lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the malachite green assay is unreliable in lysates, we used 13C NMR to assay the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, lysates containing the positive control protein, native E. coli SerB, showed rapid conversion of phosphoserine to serine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, the negative control containing LacZ also showed low levels of activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute this activity to nonspecific E. coli phosphatases in the lysate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, alkaline phosphatase can catalyze the phosphoserine phosphatase reaction but does not rescue serB in vivo because it resides in the periplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysates from cells expressing SynSerB3 showed activity similar to those from cells expressing LacZ, and we presume this activity is also caused by endogenous nonspecific phosphatases in the lysate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not surprisingly, all lysates also showed the eventual disappearance of serine, which can be attributed to downstream metabolic processes that use serine to synthesize other metabolites (Fig S1) (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SynSerB3_Alters_Gene-Expression_Profiles_in_E_coli  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our finding that purified SynSerB3 is not active as a phosphoserine phosphatase suggests that this de novo protein rescues serB cells by an indirect mechanism involving regulation and/or activation of endogenous E. coli genes or proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe for altered gene regulation in a model-independent and unbiased way, we performed quantitative RNA sequencing (RNAseq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAseq profiles of cells expressing SynSerB3 were compared with those of controls expressing WT E. coli SerB from the same vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments were performed in two cellular backgrounds, the serB auxotroph and the pseudo-WT Keio parent strain, BW25113.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were grown in minimal medium, and samples were collected during mid-logarithmic growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Fig S2 for all-sample quality control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the parental (nondeletion) strain BW25113 we observed dramatic differences between cells expressing SynSerB3 and control cells expressing E. coli SerB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the chromosome of this pseudo-WT strain encodes all the genes required for growth in minimal medium, the observed differences must be caused by the expression of different proteins on the plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the RNAseq data revealed that BW25113 cells expressing the de novo protein SynSerB3 contain 10-fold higher levels of mRNAs from the histidine biosynthetic operon (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of SynSerB3 also led to the down-regulation of aromatic amino acid biosynthetic genes (Dataset S1, table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [When comparing cells expressing SynSerB3 with those expressing E. coli SerB, it can be difficult to determine whether one protein causes down-regulation or the other causes up-regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current example, we state that SynSerB3 alters regulation because separate control experiments showed that overexpressing E. coli SerB in BW25113 cells has little effect on the expression profile (Dataset S1, table 1).]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next we examined expression profiles in the deletion strain, serB, and compared cells expressing SynSerB3 with the same cells expressing native E. coli SerB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this strain, many more genes were differentially expressed, presumably because of the added complexities associated with the chromosomal deletion of the serB gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the RNAseq data revealed that expression of 633 genes was altered fourfold or more in serB cells expressing SynSerB3 versus the control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some genes, such as those involved in fermentation and other carboxylic acid biosynthetic processes, were down-regulated; others, including those involved in the SOS response, were up-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are discussed further below and in SI Discussion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An advantage of the RNAseq method is its ability to probe the entire transcriptome in an experiment that is not biased by models or expectations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, a disadvantage of RNAseq is that it can be difficult to determine which of the observed changes are responsible for the biological phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current situation, several orthogonal experiments described in the next sections suggest that up-regulation of the his operon is responsible for the rescue of serB cells by SynSerB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we hypothesized that overexpression of HisB, which encodes histidinol phosphate phosphatase, might rescue the deletion of phosphoserine phosphatase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore it was gratifying to see that expression of the his operon was enhanced 10-fold by expression of SynSerB3 in BW25113 cells (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the serB strain, enhanced expression of the His operon was not observed by RNAseq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used a second method, quantitative PCR (qPCR), to measure changes in the expression of HisB in both strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2B, qPCR showed that hisB transcripts were increased in response to SynSerB3 in both cellular backgrounds: fivefold in serB cells and 25-fold in BW25113 cells (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, both model-free assays (RNAseq) and focused experiments (qPCR) demonstrated that the de novo protein SynSerB3 leads to an increase in the transcription of HisB, which encodes histidinol phosphate phosphatase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SynSerB3_Activates_Transcription_of_the_His_Operon  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The RNAseq and qPCR results described in the preceding section demonstrate that SynSerB3 increases the abundance of mRNA transcripts from the his operon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, abundance could be increased either by stimulating the transcription of the mRNA or by slowing its degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish between these possibilities, we replaced the sequence of the long polycistronic his mRNA with GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown Fig 3A, this construct contains all the his operon regulatory signals for transcription and translation but does not contain the his structural genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these latter sequences presumably dictate the rate of his operon mRNA degradation, the induction of increased GFP fluorescence by SynSerB3 would indicate an increase in the rate of transcription initiated at the his regulatory region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the center pair of bars in Fig 3B, SynSerB3 increased GFP fluorescence fivefold above controls, demonstrating that the de novo protein increases transcription of the his operon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transcription of the his operon in E. coli is natively regulated in two ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, transcription is stimulated in the stringent response (induced by amino acid starvation) by allosteric binding of ppGpp-DksA to RNA polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, transcription is attenuated by high intracellular concentrations of histidine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both mechanisms are regulated by sequences upstream of the his structural genes in a regulatory region that includes the promoter, his leader peptide (hisL), and attenuator sequence (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed several experiments to determine whether SynSerB3 affects regulation via the stringent response or the attenuation mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, to assess whether SynSerB3 activates the stringent response, we compared the known gene-expression signatures of this response, which includes increased expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes and decreased expression of stable RNAs (rRNA and tRNA) (1416), with the RNAseq data from the current study (Fig S3) Although there are some correlations between the stringent response and the RNAseq results for serB cells expressing SynSerB3, these correlations are not observed when SynSerB3 is expressed in pseudo-WT BW25113 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the genetic background of the cells, serB, which leads to a shortage of serine, rather than expression of the de novo protein per se, is responsible for the observed correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See further discussion in SI Discussion.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For further confirmation that the stringent response is not regulated by SynSerB3, we constructed several different fusions of the his regulatory region to GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the center pair of bars in Fig 3B, SynSerB3 has a substantial impact on expression of GFP from the full-length his regulatory sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, deletion of the attenuator sequence equalizes GFP fluorescence between cells expressing SynSerB3 and those expressing the control protein (Fig 3B, right pair of bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that SynSerB3 alters regulation via the attenuation mechanism and not by the ppGpp-mediated stringent response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (In constructs where the attenuation sequences are deleted, GFP fluorescence is high in cells with or without SynSerB3 because the his promoter is a strong promoter, and there is no stem-loop to attenuate transcription.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these results we conclude that SynSerB3 activates transcription of the his operon by deattenuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In principle, there are several ways that SynSerB3 could cause deattenuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, SynSerB3 could reduce the abundance of histidine, which is required for the attenuation mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this possibility, we measured the concentration of histidine in cells expressing SynSerB3, relative to controls expressing WT SerB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4, LC/MS showed that cells expressing SynSerB3 contain higher amounts of histidine, presumably because of the overexpression of the histidine biosynthesis genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we can rule out a mechanism by which SynSerB3 reduces the abundance of histidine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another mechanism by which SynSerB3 could cause deattenuation would be by decreasing the amount of the single histRNA, encoded by hisR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this possibility, we used RT-qPCR to measure the amount of histRNA in both serB cells and pseudo-WT BW25113 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no significant difference in abundance between cells expressing SynSerB3 and controls expressing native SerB, thereby demonstrating that the de novo protein does not function by altering histRNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although SynSerB3 does not alter the intracellular abundance of histidine or histRNA, in principle it could alter the functional pool of histRNA by inhibiting successful charging of the histRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, SynSerB3 could disrupt attenuation by binding the attenuator RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histidinol_Phosphate_Phosphatase_Encoded_by_HisB_Is_Promiscuous_and_Catalyzes_Hydrolysis_of_Serine_Phosphate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our finding that SynSerB3 rescues the serB auxotroph by causing overexpression of HisB suggests that histidinol phosphate phosphatase might have a promiscuous activity capable of catalyzing the hydrolysis of serine phosphate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggestion can be tested both genetically and biochemically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic studies were first reported by Patrick et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17), who conducted a large-scale study to test whether chromosomal deletions of single genes in E. coli could be rescued by other E. coli genes overexpressed from a plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the serB auxotroph, Patrick et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17) found that overexpression of HisB rescued the deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We repeated this experiment and observed the same result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In related experiments, Blank et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18) searched for chromosomal mutations that rescue deletions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of serB, they also found rescuing mutations that either enhanced expression of HisB or relaxed its specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability of histidinol phosphate phosphatase to hydrolyze serine phosphate was confirmed biochemically by Yip and Matsumura (19), who reported a kcat/Km value of 7.6 M/s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This promiscuous off-target activity of the HisB-encoded enzyme is 10,000-fold lower than the native activity of the E. coli SerB enzyme for the same substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dramatic difference in catalytic activity is consistent with the requirement that HisB must be overexpressed for it to rescue serB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the auxotrophy of the serB mutant shows explicitly that endogenous chromosomal expression of HisB is not sufficient to enable the growth of serB cells on minimal medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_E_coli_HisB_Gene_Is_Required_for_Rescue_of_serB_Cells_by_SynSerB3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiments described above demonstrate that the de novo protein SynSerB3 increases expression of the E. coli gene HisB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because HisB encodes a phosphatase, these results suggested that rescue by SynSerB3 of the phosphoserine phosphatase deletion in serB is mediated by the overexpression of an alternative E. coli phosphatase with promiscuous activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, other transcripts also were increased or decreased in response to SynSerB3, and the observation of enhanced transcription of HisB does not explicitly prove that it is responsible for the rescue phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that increased expression of HisB is essential for the rescue, it is crucial to show that rescue of the serB auxotroph by SynSerB3 cannot occur in the absence of HisB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we constructed the double-deletion strain, serBhisB, and tested whether the de novo protein still could rescue the serine auxotroph in this genetic background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the deletion of hisB causes a requirement for histidine, which is tangential to the current study, we added histidine to the medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmid encoding SynSerB3 was transformed into the double-knockout strain, and no growth was observed after 14 d. This finding and appropriate controls are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in agreement with the hypothesis that SynSerB3 rescues serB by enhancing expression of histidinol phosphate phosphatase, the presence of the HisB gene is indeed required for auxotroph rescue by SynSerB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_SOS_Response_Is_Induced_by_Expressing_SynSerB3_in_serB_Cells_Grown_in_Minimal_Medium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of RNAseq data for serB cells expressing SynSerB3 showed enhanced expression of genes associated with the SOS response (Fig 5A) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further assayed this response using qPCR to measure the induction of two proteins associated with SOS: RecA, a central regulator of SOS, and SulA, a known inhibitor of cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that recA and sulA are induced when serB cells expressing SynSerB3 are grown in minimal medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise a filamentous cell shape, also associated with SOS (21), was observed for serB cells expressing SynSerB3 in minimal medium (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the filamentous morphology and the induction of recA and sulA were observed only in serB cells expressing SynSerB3 in minimal medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were not observed when stress was relieved by using the pseudo-WT strain (in minimal medium) or by expressing SynSerB3 (in either strain) in rich medium (Fig 5B and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it appears that overall stress, rather than the expression of SynSerB3, induces SOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nonetheless, we considered the possibility that the SOS response might be responsible for rescuing the serB auxotroph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we plated serB cells on minimal medium spiked with sublethal concentrations (210 g/mL) of nalidixic acid, a known inducer of SOS (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells did not grow on minimal medium, thereby confirming that induction of the SOS response is not responsible for rescue of the serB auxotroph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further evidence that induction of the his operon by SynSerB3and not the SOS responseis responsible for the rescue of serB cells comes from several of the results described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) Both RNAseq and qPCR (Fig 2) show that SynSerB3 induces expression of the his operon in the BW25113 strain; however SynSerB3 does not induce filamentation, recA, or sulA in this strain (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) GFP fusions to the regulatory region of the his operon show that SynSerB3 alters the regulation of this operon (Fig 3) under conditions in which SOS and filamentation are not induced in BW25113 the strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that the de novo protein SynSerB3 rescues serB cells by inducing the promiscuous phosphatase encoded by HisB and that the SOS response results from the overall stress these cells experience while growing in minimal medium using a rescue mechanism that is not robust, but is just sufficient to sustain life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Reagents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oligonucleotide primers and the codon-optimized SynSerB3 gene sequence were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were grown in LB medium or M9-glucose minimal medium (1×M9 salts, 0.4% glucose, 2 mM MgSO4, 100 M CaCl2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective agents and inducers were used at the following concentrations: kanamycin (kan, 30 g/mL), chloramphenicol (30 g/mL), IPTG (50 M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histidine was added to cultures at a final concentration of 12 g/mL, and serine was added at a final concentration of 200 g/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pUA66 plasmid was a gift from A.

Strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Keio parent cells are strain BW25113, with genotype [(araD-araB)567, lacZ4787(::rrnB-3), -, rph-1, (rhaD-rhaB)568, hsdR514] and serB cells are [serB784::kan] in the BW25113 background; both strains were obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (cgsc.biology.yale.edu/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  serBhisB cells are [hisB720, serB784::kan] in the BW25113 background; this strain was made using standard P1 transduction methods (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, P1 virus lysate was made using the donor strain serB::kan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kanamycin cassette in hisB::kan cells was excised using plasmid pCP20 (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hisB cells then were transduced with serB::kan P1vir lysate and were plated on selective medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirmation of the strain was performed with the locus-specific primers listed in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electroporation and heat shock transformations were done according to standard protocols (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For rescue experiments, after transformation, cells recovered in SOC medium (34) for 1 h with shaking and then were washed twice with 1×M9 before plating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LacZ, WT-SerB, SynSerB3, and its mutants were expressed from vector p3Glar, a derivative of pCA24N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Point mutations and the nucleotide-insert mutants were made using standard QuikChange PCR (Agilent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFP promoter fusions were made by performing PCR on Keio parent colonies using primers surrounding the selected regions and cloning into the BamHI-XhoI sites of pUA66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Primers are listed in Table S1.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Growth_Curves  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overnight cultures were normalized to the same OD600, washed twice with 1×M9, and then were inoculated in 96-well plates in a 1:1,000 dilution into minimal medium containing the appropriate antibiotics and IPTG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mineral oil was added to the top of the inoculum to minimize evaporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were grown at 37 °C in a shaking Varioskan plate reader (Thermo Scientific), and the optical density was measured at 600 nm every 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Expression_and_Purification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
serB cells containing plasmid-born SynSerB3 or control plasmids were used to inoculate a 5-mL starter culture overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The starter culture was diluted 1:100 into 1 L of LB medium, and the culture was induced with 50 mM IPTG when the OD600 0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cultures were grown for an additional 8 h to allow protein expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were harvested and lysed using an EmulsiFlex homogenizer (Avestin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were purified using a HisTrap HP column (GE) with 100 mM Tris (pH 7.2) + 500 mM NaCl binding buffer and 100 mM Tris (pH 7.2) + 500 mM NaCl + 500 mM imidazole elution buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eluates were loaded onto a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg column (GE) running in 50 mM Tris (pH 7.2) + 150 mM NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phosphatase_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The malachite green assay was performed using the published protocol (11) in the buffers below with purified protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR assays were performed with 100 L cell lysate, 100 L 500 mM phosphoserine, 50 L D2O, and 250 L 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing some or all of the following components: 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lysates were prepared as above but with a 25-mL culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13C NMR was performed on a 500-MHz (125 MHz 13C) Bruker Avance III instrument with a cryoprobe with a 2.09-s acquisition time and 1.90-s relaxation delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNAseq_and_Differential_Expression_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were grown in an overnight culture, washed twice with 1×M9 salts, and used to inoculate minimal M9-glucose medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When cells reached midlog phase, they were incubated with two volumes of RNAlater reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were harvested and stored at 20° until all samples could be prepped concurrently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was prepared using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), and RNA quality was assayed using a NanoDrop and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ribosomal RNA was extracted using Ribo-Zero rRNA removal kit for bacteria (Illumina).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The library was prepared using the Illumina TruSeq protocol, and sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads were mapped to the E. coli genome (National Center for Biotechnology Information reference number NC_000913.2) using TopHat2 (35), and read counts for each gene were obtained using htseq-count (36) on a Galaxy server (3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A standard differential expression analysis was performed with DEseq2 (40) package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design formula for the all-sample quality control was population + treatment (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design formula for pairwise differential expression analysis was batch + treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the P value cutoff P less_than 0.05 and a magnitude cutoff for the log2(fold change) |log2foldchange| 2, we analyzed genes using DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RT-qPCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA was isolated as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was removed using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNA was prepared from 2 g RNA using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-qPCR reactions were made in a final volume of 20 L containing 10 L Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 2.4 L of 10-M stocks of each amplicon primer, and 4 L cDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers used are listed in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems ABI 7900 instrument with conditions as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, [95 °C 15 s, 60 °C 1 min] × 40, 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C 15 s, and 95 °C 15 s. Each sample had three technical replicates, and one plate contained three biological samples grown from three separate cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcript levels were normalized to the rrs mRNA to determine relative expression levels using the 2-Cq method (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

GFP-Reporter_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BW25113 cells containing two complementary plasmids, a pUA66-derivative containing the his promoter region fused to GFP or pUA66 (42) and a p3Glar-derivative expressing either SynGltA or SynSerB3, were cultured on agar plates, and a single colony was used to inoculate LB medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IPTG was added to the overnight culture to induce protein expression, or glucose was added to repress leaky protein expression from the p3Glar plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 12 h, the overnight LB cultures were washed twice with PBS, and an aliquot was placed in a 96-well plate to be read in a Varioskan plate reader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OD600 and fluorescence at 509 nm were measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment was performed in quadruplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LC_MS_Metabolomic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were grown in minimal medium exactly as for RNAseq profiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extract cellular metabolites, 3.0 mL of cells at OD600 = 0.30.5 were quickly vacuum-filtered onto nylon membranes with a 0.45-m pore size (Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were transferred into 60-mm Petri dishes containing 1.2 mL of cold (20 °C) extraction solvent (40:40:20 methanol/acetonitrile/H2O, HPLC grade) and were extracted at 20 °C for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes then were washed with cold extraction solvent in the dish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracts were collected in microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 × g at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A portion of the supernatant (500 L) was transferred to a new tube, and supernatants were dried under N2 gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolites were resuspended in HPLC-grade H2O and analyzed by reversed-phase ion-pairing LC coupled to a stand-alone Orbitrap mass spectrometer by negative-ion mode electrospray ionization (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolite peaks that matched the retention times and mass-to-charge rations of authenticated standards were quantified using MAVEN (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abundances of metabolites were normalized to cell density (OD600).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three biological replicates for each sample were grown and extracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One possible mechanism by which SynSerB3 may induce expression of the his operon is by inducing the stringent response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies have shown that the stringent response induces a wide variety of changes in gene expression, including induction of the his operon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We probed whether there was any correlation between the expression of SynSerB3 and induction of the stringent response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S3 shows the number of genes found both on the lists of altered genes in our study and in studies that explicitly induce the stringent response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genes differentially expressed in pseudo-WT + SynSerB3 are 030% similar to other studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greatest overlap is between pseudo-WT + SynSerB3 up-regulated genes and genes positively regulated by ppGpp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon close examination, the only overlap in the genes up-regulated in pseudo-WT + SynSerB3 and those positively regulated by ppGpp list are the genes in the his operon, excluding the leader peptide hisL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that in the pseudo-WT cells, SynSerB3 functions specifically at the his operon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the genes known to be negatively regulated by ppGpp are down-regulated in pseudo-WT + SynSerB3 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in pseudo-WT cells we do not observe a correlation between the expression of SynSerB3 and the induction of the stringent response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When SynSerB3 is expressed in serB cells, expression profiles show a small correlation with those reported previously for the stringent response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 11% of genes up-regulated after serine hydroxamate treatment and 22% of genes up-regulated after isoleucine starvation were also up-regulated in serB + SynSerB3 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, 1927% of genes down-regulated after serine hydroxamate treatment and 13% of genes down-regulated after isoleucine treatment were down-regulated in serB + SynSerB3 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 22% of the amino acid genes known to be up-regulated by ppGpp were down-regulated in serB + SynSerB3 cells (argI, leuO, and thrABCL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the ribosomal proteins known to be negatively regulated by ppGpp was down-regulated in serB + SynSerB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because correlations with the stringent response are observed only in serB + SynSerB3 cells, not in pseudo-WT + SynSerB3 cells, we attribute these effects to the serB genetic background and not to the expression of SynSerB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We can analyze these correlations by their intended metabolic effect on cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The serine hydroxamate treatment blocks the seryl-tRNA synthetase and thereby mimics serine starvation (15), which also is present in serB cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isoleucine starvation was induced by growing cells in minimal medium with an excess of all 19 amino acids except isoleucine; valine toxicity was a confounding metabolic effect (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, because of the complexities of amino acid starvation present in all these systems, it is not surprising that there are similarities between these two studies that induced a stringent response and the results obtained in the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that a stringent-like response is induced in serB cells because of the general inefficiency of SynSerB3s rescue mechanism in serB cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, we see a correlation between the induction of the stringent response and SynSerB3 expression only in the serB background and not the pseudo-WT background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the stringent response is not activated in pseudo-WT cells expressing SynSerB3, we conclude that the expression of SynSerB3 does not induce a generic stringent response but instead induces expression of the his operon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also observe similarities between genes up-regulated in serB + SynSerB3 cells and genes thought to be regulated by LexA, the transcription factor that regulates the SOS response (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed this similarity using the DAVID database and confirmed it using the gene list of Fernández de Henestrosa et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SOS response was activated in the study by Durfee et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (15) when the stringent response was activated, so these cellular stresses have several overlaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SOS response often leads to filamentous phenotypes in E. coli (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in the main text, expression of SynSerB3 enables serB cells to grow in minimal medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these cells grow slowly and with a significant lag phase (Fig 1C), we questioned whether they also grow with altered cell morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we examined these cells and several controls using phase-contrast microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S4, serB cells expressing SynSerB3 in minimal medium form long filamentous structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This morphology likely explains the apparent lag in the growth curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the importance of (i) the strain, (ii) the expressed protein, and (iii) the growth medium in causing this phenotype, we changed each of these variables independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the strain by growing pseudo-WT cells (BW25113) expressing SynSerB3 in minimal medium; we tested the protein by expressing native E. coli SerB in serB cells growing in minimal medium; and we tested the medium by growing serB cells expressing SynSerB3 in rich medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S4, changing any of these variables restored the cells to normal morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, expressing SynSerB3 per se does not cause filamentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the exact mechanism responsible for the observed filamentation is not clear, this is not the first example of a de novo protein causing aberrant cellular morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stomel et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (45) reported that expression in E. coli of an artificial ATP-binding protein also caused extensive filamentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATP sequestration by an artificial protein (45) or by excessive histidine biosynthesis (this study) [which requires 41 ATP molecules per molecule of histidine (46)] could cause filamentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There also is evidence that overexpression of the histidine biosynthetic enzymes HisH and HisF can cause filamentation in E. coli (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data show that pseudo-WT cells expressing SynSerB3 do overexpress His biosynthetic enzymes but do not form filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the aberrant morphology apparently results from the overall stress associated with growing the deletion strain in minimal medium while relying on a relatively inefficient rescue mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The number of sequences that can be encoded by an alphabet of 20 amino acids far exceeds the number of atoms in the universe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even for relatively short sequences of 102 amino acids, there are many more possibilities (5 × 10132) than could have been sampled by evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this large universe of possibilities, nature selected relatively small collections of sequences (proteomes) to sustain the growth of living organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the E. coli genome encodes only 4,300 proteins (24), and even the human genome contains only 20,000 sequences (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These considerations led us to question whether novel protein sequences, never sampled by nature, might be able to provide essential functions necessary to sustain life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this possibility, we imposed life-or-death selections to isolate functional proteins from a library of 1.5 million de novo sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several novel sequences were discovered which rescued a range of different deletions (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these, SynSerB3 was isolated as a rescuer of serB, an auxotroph in which phosphoserine phosphatase, which catalyzes the last step in serine biosynthesis, was deleted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the outset, we anticipated that the novel protein would rescue serB by functioning in the same way as the deleted enzyme, i.e., by catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphoserine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, extensive studies demonstrated that SynSerB3 is not active as a phosphoserine phosphatase and therefore must exert its life-sustaining phenotype by functioning as a regulator of endogenous genes and/or proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Through a series of experiments including both unbiased searches (RNAseq) and targeted analyses (qPCR and GFP fusions), we showed that SynSerB3 enhances expression of HisB, which encodes histidinol phosphate phosphatase, by deattenuating the his operon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experiments showed that (i) histidinol phosphate phosphatase has promiscuous activity that can hydrolyze phosphoserine in vitro, and (ii) this promiscuous activity, when expressed at high levels, is sufficient in vivo to sustain the growth of serB cells on minimal medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After showing that HisB was sufficient for rescue, we confirmed that it was necessary by demonstrating that the ability of SynSerB3 to rescue serB cells absolutely requires the presence of the HisB gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings demonstrate that a novel protein, unrelated to sequences in nature, can enable cell growth by altering the natural regulatory landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Evolution is an opportunistic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When presented with environmental challenges, organisms adapt by using a range of strategies, including new enzymatic functions and novel regulatory processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In natural systems, there are numerous precedents showing that selecting for growth under specified conditions can yield mutations that rewire gene regulation (2731).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Taylor et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (27) showed that immotile mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens subjected to selections for motility evolve by repurposing a protein that normally functions in nitrogen uptake toward a new function involving flagellar regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our studies demonstrate that nonnatural, synthetic biological systems can also surmount environmental challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than mutating a naturally occurring gene, as in the above examples, we demonstrate that a de novo-designed protein can drive adaptive changes in gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a de novo protein that provides a life-sustaining regulatory function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
