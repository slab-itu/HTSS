First evidence for silica condensation within the solar protoplanetary disk  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The oldest solar system solids dated are refractory inclusions [Ca-Alrich inclusions (CAIs) and amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs)], which occur in chondritic meteorites and provide records of high-temperature processes in the early solar system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ultrarefractory CAI and the silica-phase quartz occur in an AOA from the carbonaceous chondrite Yamato-793261, indicating formation over a temperature range exceeding 650 K. The minerals have 16O-rich compositions consistent with the nebular setting associated with refractory inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This AOA provides direct evidence that silica condensed from gas in a CAI/AOA-forming region in our solar system indicates that gas became Si-rich as Mg condensed and may explain the origin of silica detected from infrared spectroscopy of T Tauri and asymptotic giant branch stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Calcium-aluminumrich inclusions (CAIs) and amoeboid olivine aggregates (AOAs), a refractory component of chondritic meteorites, formed in a high-temperature region of the protoplanetary disk characterized by approximately solar chemical and oxygen isotopic (17O  24) compositions, most likely near the protosun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a 16O-rich (17O  22 ± 2) AOA from the carbonaceous Renazzo-type (CR) chondrite Yamato-793261 containing both (i) an ultrarefractory CAI and (ii) forsterite, low-Ca pyroxene, and silica, indicating formation by gassolid reactions over a wide temperature range from 1,800 to 1,150 K. This AOA provides direct evidence for gassolid condensation of silica in a CAI/AOA-forming region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a gas of solar composition, the Mg/Si ratio exceeds 1, and, therefore, silica is not predicted to condense under equilibrium conditions, suggesting that the AOA formed in a parcel of gas with fractionated Mg/Si ratio, most likely due to condensation of forsterite grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermodynamic modeling suggests that silica formed by condensation of nebular gas depleted by 10× in H and He that cooled at 50 K/hour at total pressure of 104 bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Condensation of silica from a hot, chemically fractionated gas could explain the origin of silica identified from infrared spectroscopy of remote protostellar disks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Petrology_of_AOA_4_in_CR_Chondrite_Y-793261  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Y-793261 meteorite is composed of chondrules, refractory inclusions, mineral fragments, and fine-grained matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It experienced a minor degree of aqueous alteration that resulted in partial replacement of chondrule glass and matrix by phyllosilicates and of Fe,Ni-metal by magnetite and Fe,Ni-sulfides; olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts in chondrules, however, are largely unaltered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar alteration features are described in weakly altered CR chondrites of petrologic types 2.52.6 (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Raman spectra were collected on randomly selected matrix areas in a polished thin section of Y-793261.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown previously that D and G bands (at 1,350 and 1,600 cm1, respectively) in Raman spectra of organic matter in chondrite matrices vary with thermal metamorphic recrystallization of the host meteorite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, the full width, half-maximum (FWHM) of the D band decreases and the intensity ratio ID/IG increases with thermal maturity of the organic matter (2022).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison with Y-793261, Raman spectra were also collected from matrix areas in thin sections of Allan Hills (ALH) 77307 [carbonaceous Ornans-type (CO) 3.03], Y-81020 (CO 3.05), Efremovka [carbonaceous Vigarano-type (CV) 3.13.4], Axtell (CV  3.6), Allende (CV  3.6) (petrologic subtypes from refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21 and 23), and eight CR chondrites of the National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The wide FWHM-D and low ID/IG of Y-793261 indicate that this meteorite experienced only weak thermal metamorphism (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Raman parameters are similar to other CRs that we analyzed (labeled CRs-NIPR in Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Busemann et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24) and Quirico et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (25) collected Raman spectra from diverse chondrites, including CRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Quirico et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (25) data are similar to our results for ID/IG but have slightly lower FWHM-D; the Busemann et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24) data for CRs overlap with ours but range to higher ID/IG and lower FWHM-D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between the three datasets are not surprising given that (i) they are based on different CR meteorites and (ii) spectra reported by refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 and 25 were collected from extracted insoluble organic matter and raw matrix grains, respectively, whereas our data were collected from matrix areas of polished thin sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the low thermal maturity of organic matter indicated by Raman spectra (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 and 25 and this study) shows that most CR chondrites, including Y-793261, as well as CM (carbonaceous Mighei-type) chondrites, did not undergo thermal metamorphism to the same extent as most type 3 ordinary, CO (Ornans-type), and CV (Vigarano-type) chondrites (26) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some CR and CM chondrites have relatively low FWHM-D and high ID/IG, probably due to shock heating (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25 and 27 and this study; CRs and CMs-heated in Fig 1); however, these meteorites are relatively rare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the Raman data confirm the supposition that most CRs have a high probability of preserving minerals and textures of nebular origin (26, 2831).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AOA 4 consists of an aggregate of nearly pure forsterite (Fo9799) and low-Ca pyroxene enclosing multiple fine-grained Ca-Alrich minerals, including Al,Ti-diopside (in wt %, 510 Al2O3, 24 TiO2; SI Appendix, Table S1), anorthite, and ±spinel (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Olivine occurs as a circuitous chain of equant grains no more than 10 µm across.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-Ca pyroxene forms thin (12 µm across) layers around some olivine crystals and also occurs in 5- to 10-µmsized aggregates of individual grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fe-hydroxiderich veins cutting the AOA are probably due to terrestrial weathering in Antarctica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Silica is present at a few localities in the AOA interior, where it occurs as anhedral, 5-µmsized grains associated with low-Ca pyroxene (Fig 2 A and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raman spectra of the silica grains show a sharp peak at 464 cm1, diagnostic of quartz (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quartz in AOA 4 is similar in texture to the more refractory AOA minerals (interlocking textures typical of igneous crystallization and vein quartz typical of an alteration origin are conspicuously absent) suggesting an origin by gassolid reactions, although the original SiO2 phase might have been a phase other than quartz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 1 bar pressure, transitions to higher-temperature silica polymorphs, tridymite and crystobalite, occur at 1,150 and 1,740 K, respectively (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the Ca-Alrich domains of AOA 4 is mineralogically distinct: it consists of Zr,Sc,Al,Ti-rich pyroxenes (in wt %, 2032 Al2O3, 515 TiO2, and 28 Sc2O3 and ZrO2; SI Appendix, Table S1), compositionally similar to davisite (34), enclosing submicron grains of Zr-rich oxides and spinel, and surrounded by Al,Ti-diopside (Fig 2 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zirconium and scandium (Sc) are very refractory elements, with 50% condensation temperatures at 104 bar of 1,764 K for Zr and 1,659 K for Sc (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several previous studies, temperature-fractionated rare earth element (REE) patterns have been used as criteria for characterizing a given CAI as ultrarefractory (UR) (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3639), but REE concentrations have not been determined yet for the UR CAI in AOA 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, Zr,Sc-rich pyroxene and/or oxides are characteristic minerals of previously identified UR CAIs and, in light of the high condensation temperatures of Zr and Sc, are indicators of crystallization at UR conditions (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Concentrations of ZrO2 and Sc2O3 in pyroxene are highest in the core of the Ca-Alrich domain and decrease toward its peripheral boundary with typical AOA forsterite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This zoning may be roughly analogous to normal zoning in igneous systems in that an early-stage, high-temperature composition was preserved in a crystal that grew while temperature declined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive correlation between ZrO2 and Sc2O3 at or above the solar value is similar to pyroxenes in UR CAIs 3N-24 from CV3 chondrite northwest Africa (NWA) 3118 and 33E-1 from the CV3 Efremovka (40) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fassaitic pyroxenes in UR CAIs Murchison HIB-11 and Efremovka 101.1 also have positive correlations between ZrO2 and Sc2O3 but at subsolar Zr/Sc, possibly as a consequence of partitioning between phases during postcondensation partial melting (37, 38) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the UR CAI-like domain of AOA 4 and in CAI 33E-1, the most Zr,Sc-rich pyroxene compositions have Zr/Sc ratios above the solar value, which may reflect temperature-dependent fractionation of the more refractory Zr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chondritic Zr/Sc ratios of the less Zr,Sc-rich pyroxene suggest that melting did not occur after original crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of UR minerals indicates that initial formation of AOA 4 either (i) started at higher temperatures than other AOAs in CR chondrites or (ii) started at temperatures similar to other AOAs but cooled so rapidly that early-formed UR minerals did not reequilibrate at lower temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Oxygen_Isotope_Compositions_of_Minerals_in_AOA_4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Forsterite, Al-diopside, low-Ca pyroxene, quartz, and Zr,Sc-rich pyroxenes in AOA 4 have similar 16O-rich compositions (17O  22 ± 2; SI Appendix, Table S2 and Fig 4) typical of CAIs and AOAs from unmetamorphosed chondrites (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uniformly 16O-rich composition of the AOA is distinctly different from the 16O-poor compositions of whole-rock samples of CR chondrites (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42 and references therein) (Fig 4A), olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts in CR chondrules (17O  60) (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43), and secondary carbonates and magnetite that precipitated from aqueous solutions in CR matrices (17O  3 to +2) (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicate that the minerals in AOA 4 originated in an 16O-rich gaseous setting of approximately solar composition and subsequently avoided oxygen isotopic exchange with 16O-poor reservoirs, such as nebular gas associated with chondrule formation and aqueous fluid associated with alteration of CR chondrites (1, 10, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of ultrarefractory Zr- and Sc-rich pyroxene, spinel, anorthite, Al-diopside, low-Ca pyroxene, and quartz within a single AOA provides evidence for a large temperature range during gassolid reactions recorded by this object, between 1,800 and 1,150 K. Given the high condensation temperatures of Zr and Sc (36), the ultrarefractory CAI could have formed by either evaporation or condensation at 1,7001,800 K. The less refractory spinel-anorthite-Al-diopside CAIs recorded gassolid interaction at much lower temperature: the 50% condensation temperatures of these minerals are 1,4001,350 K. Forsterite condensed directly from the nebular gas at 1,375 K:2Mg(g)+SiO(g)+3H2O(g)=Mg2SiO4(s)+3H2(g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [R1]Low-Ca pyroxene becomes stable at 1,300 K (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two textural occurrences of low-Ca pyroxene in AOA 4 (rims around forsterite grains and aggregates of euhedral crystals) may indicate its formation by two mechanisms: by interaction between forsterite and gaseous SiO,Mg2SiO4(s)+SiO(g)+H2O(g)=2MgSiO3(s)+H2(g),[R2]and by direct gassolid condensation,Mg(g)+SiO(g)+H2O(g)=MgSiO3(s)+H2(g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [R3]The 16O-rich low-Ca pyroxenes replacing forsterites (Reaction R2) have been previously described in 10% of AOAs from carbonaceous chondrites (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct gassolid condensation of 16O-rich low-Ca pyroxenes (Reaction R3) has been proposed to explain 16O-rich (17O  24) low-Ca pyroxenes grains dispersed in matrix of the K chondrite Kakangari (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Condensation_Calculations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a gas of solar composition, the Mg/Si ratio exceeds 1 (35), and silica is not predicted to condense under equilibrium conditions (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of silica in AOA 4 suggests that the parcel of gas in which it formed underwent extensive Mg/Si fractionation similar to the condensation with partial isolation model (45, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used the GRAINS code (48) to explicitly model how variations in pressure, dust/gas ratio, and cooling rate affect the isolation of Mg and Si in growing forsterite grains, which, in turn, may affect the condensation sequence (45, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A specific feature that distinguishes the GRAINS code (Materials and Methods) from other condensation codes is that it calculates the amount of condensate isolated in the cores of metal and olivine grains based on their sizes which, in turn, depend upon number densities of corresponding atoms in the gas (defined by the gas composition and pressure) and cooling rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the observed sizes of olivine grains in AOA 4 place an important constraint on pressure during condensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We modeled condensation of gas of solar composition and gas depleted in H2 and He by a factor of 10 relative to the solar value in the pressure range of 103 to 106 bar assuming different cooling rates as summarized in SI Appendix, Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ferromagnesian minerals of AOA 4 contain sufficient FeO (all analyses 0.6 wt %; SI Appendix, Table S1) to imply condensation under more oxidizing conditions than those of the classic solar nebula (3, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47, we assume that more oxidizing conditions were caused by local depletion of the solar nebula in H2 (and He) gas, which is expressed as dust to gas ratio (D/G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The admissible pressure range is found to be 103 to 105 bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher pressures, condensation of forsterite is preceded by a significant amount of Fe,Ni-metal, which is inconsistent with our petrographic observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At lower pressures, small sizes of forsterite grains, irrespective of cooling rate, result in nearly complete equilibration with the ambient gas so a silica polymorph never forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find that the observed forsterite grain size (5 µm) and chemical composition of low-Ca pyroxene (SI Appendix, Table S1) are reasonably matched by condensation of nebular gas depleted by 10× in H2 and He that cools at a constant rate of 50 K/h at a total pressure of 104 bar (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forsterite grains start to grow by condensation from the gas at 1,525 K and reach 5 m across at 1,440 K when they start to react with gaseous SiO to form low-Ca pyroxene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 1,435 K forsterite grains become completely isolated from the gas, whereas the low-Ca pyroxene continues to condense alone until cocondensation of cristobalite begins at 1,417 K. Quartz becomes stable below 1,169 K; it would form by either transformation of cristobalite or thermal annealing of amorphous silica if the latter condensed instead of cristobalite, which is likely at such rapid cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated cooling rate of AOA 4, similar to that of igneous CAIs (5), implies a rapid (hours) processing of AOAs and CAIs in the early solar nebula, perhaps, on highly localized scales (47) and slightly variable dust-to-gas ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Astrophysical_Implications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of silica condensates in dust shells of oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch stars has been previously suggested from infrared spectroscopic observations (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presolar silica grains characterized by isotopically anomalous O isotope compositions were subsequently identified in matrices of chondrites ALH 77307 (CO3.03) (50) and of LaPaZ 031117 (CO3.0) and Grove Mountains 021710 (CR2) (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on infrared spectra of T Tauri stars with the Spitzer Space Telescope, the presence of crystalline silica (tridymite or cristobalite) was also inferred in protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars, where its origin was attributed to incongruent melting of enstatite to form a silica-enriched liquid, followed by rapid cooling, possibly during transient heating events hypothesized to create chondrules (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An igneous origin of remotely detected silica is consistent with the presence of igneous tridymite and cristobalite in chondrules from primitive chondrites (53, 54) and in 81P/Wild 2 cometary dust returned by the NASA Stardust mission (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AOA 4 from CR chondrite Y-793261 provides an alternative to an igneous origin of silica in protoplanetary disks and constitutes direct evidence for gassolid condensation of 16O-rich silica coincident with formation of refractory inclusions in the solar nebula.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the presence of UR minerals and silica in the same AOA in a CR chondrite resulted from a condensation with partial isolation-type process (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A polished thin section of Y-793261 was studied using SEM, EPMA, Raman spectroscopy, and SIMS oxygen isotopic analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Petrologic observations and mineral identifications were made using a JEOL JSM-7100F field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) with backscattered electron (BSE) mode at NIPR, Japan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Semiquantitative compositional analyses for fine-grained minerals and X-ray elemental mapping were also performed with an energy dispersive spectroscopic detector (Oxford AZtek system) attached to the JSM-7100F FE-SEM, with a 3-nA electron beam accelerated at a voltage of 15 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative elemental analyses were performed using a JEOL JXA-8200 electron microprobe at NIPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses were conducted at 15 kV and a sample current of 20 nA olivine and 30 nA for Ca-rich pyroxene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Ca-rich pyroxene analyses that contain Sc and Zr, pulse height analyzer settings were adjusted to minimize X-ray interferences of Sc K and Zr L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Raman spectra were collected from polished thin sections using a JASCO NRS-1000 Raman microspectrometer at NIPR using 532-nm excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each analysis, the laser light was focused to a spot size of 23 µm using a 40× microscope objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectra were acquired under atmospheric conditions in the spectral region 1,0001,800 cm1 for matrix and 3001,000 cm1 for silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oxygen isotope compositions were measured in situ using the University of Hawaii (UH) Cameca ims-1280 secondary ion mass spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A primary Cs+ ion beam accelerated to 10 keV was used to sputter the sample with an impact energy of 20 keV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to small grain sizes in the AOA (less_than10 m in diameter), an 20-pA primary beam focused to 12 µm was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A normal incident electron flood gun was used for charge compensation with homogeneous electron density over a region of 70 m in diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three oxygen isotopes were measured simultaneously using a Faraday cup detector for 16O and two electron multipliers for 17O and 18O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mass resolving power (M/M, 10% definition) on 16O and 18O was set to 2,000, whereas 17O was measured with a mass resolving power of 5,500, which is sufficient to almost completely resolve the interfering 16OH from the 17O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the abundance sensitivity tail of the 16OH peak, we made a small tail correction (typically less_than0.1) on 17O based on 16OH count rate measured after each measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were collected for 30 cycles of 20 s each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For accurate locations of SIMS analyses, we used the UH JEOL 5900LV SEM to focus the electron beam on spots we intended to measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposing the electron beam to the surface for 520 min leaves a submicrometer hole in the carbon coat, which can be recognized as a mark on the spot of interest from a 16O scanning ion image in the ion probe, as described by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxygen isotope compositions are reported as 17O and 18O, deviations from SMOW in parts per thousand,17,18SMOW=[(17,18/sample16)/(17,18/SMOW16)1]×1000,  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
and as 17O, deviation from the terrestrial fractionation (TF) line,17=170.52×18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reported 2 uncertainties include both the internal measurement precision on an individual analysis and the external reproducibility of standard measurements during a given analytical session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The GRAINS thermodynamic and kinetic code calculates equilibrium partitioning of 33 elements among 242 gaseous and 520 condensed species (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It contains two subroutines which model growth of Fe,Ni-metal and olivine grains by condensation based on kinetic theory of condensation and subsequent diffusional redistribution of elements along grain radii in response to changing temperature and surface concentrations of the elements as the gasdust assemblage of the solar nebula cools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For given temperature, pressure, and system composition the GRAINS code first calculates equilibrium mole fractions of condensed and gaseous species, then sizes of metal and olivine grains and their compositional profiles, then outputs abundances and chemical compositions of stable phases and zoning profiles of metal and olivine, adjusts mass balance by subtracting the amounts of isolated elements, changes the temperature by a specified increment, and repeats the cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
