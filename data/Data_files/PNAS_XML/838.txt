title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bilingual infants control their languages as they listen  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bilingual infants must manage two languages in a single developing mind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms that enable young bilinguals to manage their languages over the course of learning remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that bilingual infants monitor and control their languages during real-time language listening, and do so similarly to bilingual adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ability could help bilinguals language learning to keep pace with that of their monolingual peers, and may underpin the cognitive advantages enjoyed by bilinguals in both infancy and adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Infants growing up in bilingual homes learn two languages simultaneously without apparent confusion or delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms that support this remarkable achievement remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that infants use language-control mechanisms to preferentially activate the currently heard language during listening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a naturalistic eye-tracking procedure, bilingual infants were more accurate at recognizing objects labeled in same-language sentences (Find the dog!)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  than in switched-language sentences (Find the chien!).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements of infants pupil size over time indicated that this resulted from increased cognitive load during language switches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, language switches did not always engender processing difficulties: the switch cost was reduced or eliminated when the switch was from the nondominant to the dominant language, and when it crossed a sentence boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults showed the same patterns of performance as infants, even though target words were simple and highly familiar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide striking evidence from infancy to adulthood that bilinguals monitor their languages for efficient comprehension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Everyday practice controlling two languages during listening is likely to explain previously observed bilingual cognitive advantages across the lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Exp_1__Infants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants were 20-mo-old EnglishFrench simultaneous bilingual infants (n = 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We established infants dominant (L1) and nondominant (L2) languages via parental report of the most-heard and least-heard language.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each infant saw one block of 18 trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each block was defined by the use of sentence frames presented in a consistent language, either in participants dominant or nondominant language (English: Look!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Find the; French: Regarde!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trouve le/la).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each block, there were two trial types that varied the language of the final noun: same-language (six trials per block) and switched-language trials (six trials per block).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional six same-language filler trials (not analyzed) were included in each block to decrease the frequency of language switching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The language switch occurred between the determiner and the noun (i.e., the chien or le dog), which is a common switch location for bilingual speakers of French (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Target nouns were chosen to be highly frequent and understood by infants of this age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Fig 1 for sample stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because infants have limited attention spans, they participated in only one block, randomly assigned to be in their dominant or nondominant language.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An eye tracker measured the direction of participants eye gaze and the diameter of their pupils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an index of processing, we examined participants accuracy in looking to the target picture during a time window of 3602,000 ms after the target noun onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was operationalized as the proportion of time infants looked at the target picture relative to the total time they looked at either picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Means for each group are displayed in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, infants looked significantly more to the target on same-language trials [meansame = 0.60 (SD = 0.13)] than on switched-language trials [meanswitched = 0.51 (0.12); t(23) = 2.72, P = 0.012, dz = 0.56], showing an overall decrease in accuracy for language switching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was moderated by the direction of the language switch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 plots the time course of looking to the target picture during different trial types according to block type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants who were tested in a dominant language block (L1L2 switch) showed a more pronounced switch cost [meansame = 0.62 (0.16), meanswitched = 0.48 (0.09), t(11) = 3.61, P = 0.004, dz = 1.04] than infants tested in a nondominant language block (L2L1 switch) [meansame = 0.58 (0.097), meanswitched = 0.54 (0.14), t(11) = 0.85, P = 0.42, dz = 0.24].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that whereas studies of language production often find a larger switch cost from L2 to L1 (17), our finding of a larger switch cost from L1 to L2 is consistent with both experimental and computational work in the auditory domain (28, 29, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This switch asymmetry is not reducible to infants simply showing better understanding of L1 target words relative to L2 target words.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this explanation would correctly predict an L1L2 switch cost, it would also predict something we did not observe: higher accuracy when listening to L2L1 switches relative to sentences fully in L2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, bilingual infants performance was a function of both the carrier phrase and target word language, reflecting a switch cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we examined participants task-evoked changes in pupil size over time, because pupil diameter can index cognitive load (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants baseline-corrected pupil size was calculated over the course of the trial, as a function of block type and age group (displayed in Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequential t tests were performed for each 200-ms time slice to compare pupil size during the same-language and switched-language trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the dominant language block (L1L2 switch), pupil size was significantly larger (P less_than 0.05) during switched-language trials than during same-language trials from 1,000 to 2,000 ms after noun onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants did not show significant pupil dilation in the nondominant language block.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pupillometry data provide convergent evidence that infants were under increased cognitive load when switching from the dominant to the nondominant language.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both accuracy and pupillometry data indicate a processing cost for language switches, which we interpret as evidence that bilingual infants control their languages as they listen to everyday sentences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Exp_2__Adults  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 examined the continuity of language-control mechanisms across the lifespan by testing bilingual adults using the same stimuli and procedure as bilingual infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach provided a highly conservative test for adults, as the words and sentences used in the experiment are highly familiar and learned early in life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults process high-frequency words rapidly (38), and thus participants might show a ceiling effect even when such words occur at a language switch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if bilingual adults do show a processing cost in this experiment, this would suggest that language control operates pervasively, even in very simple listening situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pupil dilation measures could be particularly revealing for adults, as pupillary responses are involuntary and thus would be unaffected by explicit response strategies that adults might deploy in this simple task (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested 24 highly proficient EnglishFrench bilingual adults, whose dominant (L1) and nondominant (L2) languages were measured via self-report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults were told that they would see a video intended for infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike infants, who saw just one block of trials, adults saw both blocks in a counterbalanced order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adults showed high overall accuracy in looking to the target object during the 360- to 2,000-ms time window (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was nonetheless evidence for a switch cost, as adults showed significantly greater looking to the target object during the same-language than the switched-language trials [meansame = 0.95 (0.038), meanswitched = 0.91 (0.047), t(23) = 4.81, P less_than 0.001, dz = 0.98].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mirroring the asymmetry shown by infants, this was moderated by the direction of the language switch (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults within-subject data confirmed a switch cost in the dominant language block (L1L2 switch) [meansame = 0.95 (0.033), meanswitched = 0.88 (0.086), t(20) = 5.21, P less_than 0.001, dz = 1.14], but no switch cost in the nondominant language block (L2L1 switch) [meansame = 0.94 (0.058), meanswitched = 0.94 (0.038), t(20) = 0.045, P = 0.96, dz = 0.01].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we examined adults pupil dilation in the same manner as Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the dominant language block (L1L2 switch), pupil size was significantly larger during switched-language trials from 800 to 2,000 ms after target noun onset, and in the nondominant language block (L2L1 switch) from 1,000 to 1,600 and 1,800 to 2,000 ms after target noun onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pupil sizes were not significantly different in other time slices (Ps  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results indicate that, like infants, bilingual adults control their languages during real-time sentence processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both groups, a language switch from L1 to L2 reduced the accuracy of looking to a labeled target, although accuracy was not affected for switches from L2 to L1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, processing language switches caused increased pupil dilation for both infants (L1L2 switches) and adults (both L1L2 and L2L1 switches).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the consistency of data across measures shows that bilinguals, both at the beginning of development and in maturity, are affected by language switches when listening to the simplest of sentences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Exp_3__Cross-Sentence_Switch  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 was designed to more precisely investigate the locus of the effects observed in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2, and whether bilinguals encounter comprehension challenges for other types of language switches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this experiment, participants heard language switches that occurred intersententially (That one looks fun!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Le chien!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), rather than intrasententially, as in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both intra- and intersentential switches occur in bilingual speech (27, 31, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this experiment, the switch occurred following a small, sentence-final silent pause and before the target words determiner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This slightly increased the temporal distance between the language switch and the target noun (500 ms on average).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected that this manipulation would reduce processing effort associated with a language switch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants were 24 EnglishFrench bilingual 20-mo-old infants, and 24 EnglishFrench bilingual adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimuli and procedure were similar to Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2, with the exception of the auditory stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, auditory stimuli consisted of two utterances separated by a short natural pause: a carrier sentence that drew attention to the objects on the screen, followed by a noundeterminer pair, presented in either the same-language condition (That one looks fun!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dog!)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  or switched-language condition (That one looks fun!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Le chien!).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants completed one block and adults completed two blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An examination of participants accuracy of looking to the target object did not reveal a significant switch cost for either group of participants (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither infants [meansame = 0.56 (0.21), meanswitched = 0.53 (0.14), t(23) = 0.71, P = 0.49, dz = 0.14] nor adults [meansame = 0.84 (0.10), meanswitched = 0.81 (0.12), t(23) = 1.13, P = 0.27, dz = 0.23] showed significantly more looking to the target object during same-language trials than during switched-language trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examining the data by block (L1 vs. L2) did not change this null effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants did not show a significant switch cost in either the dominant language block (L1L2 switch) [meansame = 0.56 (0.20), meanswitched = 0.53 (0.15), t(11) = 0.39, P = 0.70, dz = 0.11] or in the nondominant language block (L2L1 switch) [meansame = 0.57 (0.22), meanswitched = 0.53 (0.13), t(11) = 0.59, P = 0.57, dz = 0.17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, adults did not show a significant switch cost in either the dominant language block (L1L2 switch) [meansame = 0.84 (0.15), meanswitched = 0.81 (0.14), t(23) = 0.96, P = 0.35, dz = 0.20] or in the nondominant language block (L2L1 switch) [meansame = 0.83 (0.12), meanswitched = 0.82 (0.13), t(23) = 0.16, P = 0.87, dz = 0.03].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pupillometry data were examined as in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 from the onset of the target noun (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants did not show any significant difference in pupil size between same-language and switched-language trials for either block type (Ps  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the dominant-language block (L1L2 switch), adults showed significantly larger pupil sizes (P less_than 0.05) during switched-language than single-language trials during a single 200-ms time slice from 1,200 to 1,400 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults did not show differences in pupil size in the nondominant language block (L2L1 switch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, the switch cost observed in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 was not observed to the same degree in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no evidence for different performance on same- and switched-language trials using eye-tracking measures of infants or adults looking, or on measures of infants pupil size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adults, however, did show weak evidence of pupil dilation when they heard a switch from their L1 to their L2, although this effect was considerably less robust than in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that hearing a language switch across a sentence boundary may necessitate some additional effort, but does not affect comprehension at a behavioral level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One explanation is that sentences form natural, compartmentalized processing units for both infants (40) and adults (41), facilitating comprehension of intersentential switches because they occur at an existing boundary for information processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relatedly, language switches in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 occurred after a brief pause, which may have reduced the processing cost relative to the pause-free stimuli in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another explanation is that the switch occurred after the determiner in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3, whereas it occurred before the determiner in Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas bilingual French speakers do produce switches at both locations, they are more common after the determiner than before the determiner (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the switch in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 occurred at the less-frequent location, this explanation would predict a larger switch cost in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 than in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, which is the opposite of what we observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work will be needed to explore how the processing of language switches interacts with particular linguistic structures, such as determiners (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

General_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These experiments confirmed the hypothesis that bilingual infants and adults monitor and control their languages while listening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bilinguals at both ages incurred a processing cost when hearing language switches, indexed by less-accurate word recognition and increased pupil dilation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than indicating language difficulties, we argue that this represents an efficient strategy for bilinguals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sounds and words from a particular language tend to occur in sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By capitalizing on these regularities and preferentially activating the currently heard language, bilinguals can speed language processing overall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a cost for language switching can be seen as a side effect of efficient bilingual processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our results indicate that language switches do not always lead to processing difficulties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Switches that occurred at a natural processing breakpointa sentence boundarydid not impair comprehension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This work provides insight into fundamental questions about the minds ability to cope with complex language environments, exemplified by bilingualism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, these results address a long-standing question about bilingual language acquisition: whether or not bilingual infants early representations distinguish between their languages (4, 5, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have found evidence that bilingual infants preferentially activate the currently heard language, yielding a processing cost for language switches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result would not be possible unless infants had begun to represent words in separable language systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work thus provides experimental evidence of language differentiation in bilingual infants word representations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an ability is likely an important contributor to bilingual infants remarkable ability to navigate bilingual environments, and to learn two languages simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, whereas many theories of bilingualism have pointed to the important role of language monitoring and control during speech production (44, 45), our research demonstrates the operation of similar mechanisms in language comprehension across the lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when listening to the simplest of sentences, bilingual infants and adults preferentially activate the expected language and/or inhibit the other language.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our findings do not preclude some activation of both languages during speech comprehension (21, 32), they do demonstrate stronger activation of the expected language.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that this contributes to efficient and fluent speech comprehension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important future direction will be to investigate whether bilinguals modulate their language control during listening as a function of situation; for example, bilinguals may keep their languages more equally active when functioning in a bilingual mode (21, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, our results provide an additional explanation of why bilinguals show cognitive advantages across the lifespan (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leading theories have attributed these benefits to bilinguals practice in engaging language control during language production (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is evidence for cognitive benefits even in bilingual infants who do not yet produce speech (48, 49), rendering this single explanation impossible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With convergent evidence across ages and methods, our results reveal that bilinguals adapt to their unique language environments by monitoring, controlling, and switching between their two languages during comprehension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Practice doing so, we propose, trains information processing abilities beyond the domain of language.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cognitive benefits enjoyed by bilinguals are likely to accrue over time from everyday listening experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This research was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee at Concordia University and the Institutional Review Board at Princeton University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants (adults) or their parents (infants) provided informed consent before participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stimuli  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants were seated in a quiet testing room 60 cm away from a Tobii T60-XL eye tracker, which gathered eye-gaze and pupil size data at a rate of 60 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimenter controlled the experiment using Tobii Studio software from an adjacent room and was blind to the trial type presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants sat on parents laps, while parents listened to music on headphones and wore darkened sunglasses to avoid influencing the infant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult participants sat on a chair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eye tracker was calibrated to the participants eyes using a five-point infant calibration routine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On each trial, an object pair appeared on the monitor in silence for 3 s. Next, the auditory stimuli were played, which for each experiment consisted of a carrier phrase followed by the target word.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pictures remained on screen after the target word was spoken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each trial lasted 8 s (Exps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2) or 9 s (Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An attention-grabbing animation appeared at the center of the screen between trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants saw a total of 18 trials per block, such that the carrier phrase was in a consistent language (either English or French).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within each block, six trials were same-language trials in which the target word was in the same language as the carrier phrase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six trials were switched-language trials, in which the target word was in a different language from the carrier phrase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were also six same-language filler trials that were not included in analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trial orders were quasi-random, such that the same object pair never appeared on consecutive trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, two switched-language trials never appeared consecutively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants were randomly assigned to either a dominant-language block or a nondominant language block, and adults completed both blocks (order counterbalanced).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants (adults) or parents (infants) completed questionnaires once the experiment was complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infants were given a certificate and a T-shirt, and adults were awarded course credit for their participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_Overview  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data from same-language and switched-language trials were analyzed in a time window of 3602,000 ms after the onset of the target word on each trial, using the R package eyetrackingR (53, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This window of analysis was chosen because 360 ms are necessary for infants to process a word and initiate an eye movement, and eye movements after 2,000 ms are less likely to reflect a response to the target word.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proportion of looking-time data were averaged across trials then trial type for each participant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All t tests were performed with  = 0.05, two-tailed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effect sizes are reported as standardized difference scores, computed as dz = t/sqrt(n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pupil-size analyses were performed by calculating a baseline pupil size per trial in the 200 ms before noun onset, and then subtracting this baseline from pupil size measurements on each trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trials excluded from the accuracy analysis and those without baseline data were excluded (28% of trials for infants in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1; 18% of trials for adults in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2; 32% of trials for infants in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3; 30% of trials for adults in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were excluded from two adults in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and one adult in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 who failed to contribute data from one or more trial types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pupil size changes were averaged across the two eyes, and data were binned into 200-ms slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Additional_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Correlations between processing of language switches, exposure to language switches, and degree of language dominance are detailed in SI Additional Analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Additional_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted two additional analyses to explore relations between language processing and language input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we examined whether bilinguals processing of switches was related to parent-reported (for infants) or self-reported (for adults) experience with language switches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each participant, we computed a switch cost as the difference in looking to the target on same- versus switched-language trials (specifically, same-language accuracy minus switched-language accuracy), both overall and by block type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across experiments, we found no significant Pearsons correlations (Ps  0.05, uncorrected for multiple comparisons) between switch cost and experience with language switches, suggesting that experience with language switches did not predict participants performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, for infants we examined whether processing of switches was related to a continuous measure of language balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we calculated each infants percent exposure to their nondominant language, which ranged from 25 to 50%, with higher scores reflecting greater balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A parallel analysis of language balance was not conducted for adults, as we did not have a continuous measure of language balance for this group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a marginally significant correlation between switch cost and infants language balance in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 [r(22) = 0.39, P = 0.058], which was more pronounced for infants tested in their dominant language [r(10) = 0.58, P = 0.049] than those tested in their nondominant language [r(10) = 0.30, P = 0.34].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the possibility that the switch costand by extension language control abilitiescould be stronger for infants with more balanced exposure to their two languages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No effect of language balance was found for infants in Exp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 (Ps  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
