Controlling of glutamate release by neuregulin3 via inhibiting the assembly of the SNARE complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neuregulin3 (NRG3) is a growth factor of the neuregulin (NRG) family and a risk gene of various severe mental illnesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the physiological function of NRG3 remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that, unlike the prototype Nrg1, the effect of which is mediated by activating ErbB4 in interneurons, Nrg3 acts in a cell-autonomous manner in pyramidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using a combination of genetic, electrophysiological, biochemical, and molecular biological techniques, we uncovered a function of Nrg3to regulate glutamate releaseand identified Nrg3 as a regulator of the assembly of the SNARE complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that increasing Nrg3 expression, mimicking higher levels in mental illness patients, impairs glutamate release, revealing a pathophysiological mechanism of hypofunction of glutamatergic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neuregulin3 (NRG3) is a growth factor of the neuregulin (NRG) family and a risk gene of various severe mental illnesses including schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and major depression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the physiological function of NRG3 remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that loss of Nrg3 in GFAP-Nrg3f/f mice increased glutamatergic transmission, but had no effect on GABAergic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These phenotypes were observed in Nex-Nrg3f/f mice, where Nrg3 was specifically knocked out in pyramidal neurons, indicating that Nrg3 regulates glutamatergic transmission by a cell-autonomous mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, in the absence of Nrg3 in pyramidal neurons, mutant mice displayed various behavioral deficits related to mental illnesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the Nrg3 mutation decreased paired-pulse facilitation, increased decay of NMDAR currents when treated with MK801, and increased minimal stimulation-elicited response, providing evidence that the Nrg3 mutation increases glutamate release probability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Nrg3 is a presynaptic protein that regulates the SNARE-complex assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, increased Nrg3 levels, as observed in patients with severe mental illnesses, suppressed glutamatergic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observations indicate that, unlike the prototype Nrg1, the effect of which is mediated by activating ErbB4 in interneurons, Nrg3 is critical in controlling glutamatergic transmission by regulating the SNARE complex at the presynaptic terminals, identifying a function of Nrg3 and revealing a pathophysiological mechanism for hypofunction of the glutamatergic pathway in Nrg3-related severe mental illnesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increased_sEPSC_Frequency_by_GFAP-Mediated_Nrg3_Mutation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using an antibody against Nrg3s EGF domain, we detected a single band at the predicted molecular weight (75 kDa) in brain homogenates (Fig 1A and Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its intensity was diminished by the Nrg3 mutation, indicating the specificity of the antibody (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nrg3 expression was brain-specific (Fig 1A), in agreement with its mRNA pattern (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the brain, Nrg3 was at higher levels in the hippocampus and cortex and at lower levels in the cerebellum (Fig S1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nrg3 in the cortex and hippocampus increased during development and peaked at postnatal day 10 (P10) (Fig S1 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study the function of Nrg3, we generated a Nrg3-floxed mouse (Nrg3f/f) (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nrg3f/f mice were crossed with hGFAP::Cre mice where Cre is expressed in neural progenitor cells at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) and in all forebrain neurons and astrocytes (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resulting hGFAP::Cre; Nrg3f/f (hereafter referred to as GFAP-Nrg3f/f) mice did not express Nrg3 in the brain (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Nrg3 mRNA was detectable as early as at E14 (16), we determined whether the Nrg3 mutation alters neural development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S3A, GFAP-Nrg3f/f mice displayed a similar brain weight to that of control (Nrg3f/f) mice and showed no global morphologic deficits (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of neurons in different layers of the somatosensory cortex was similar between control and mutant mice (Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutant mice had a similar number of spines in basal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons (Fig S3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the Nrg3 mutation alters neurotransmission in the brain, we first measured sEPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, GFAP-Nrg3f/f slices showed an increase in sEPSC frequency, compared with control slices (Fig 1 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was no change in sEPSC amplitude in GFAP-Nrg3f/f neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we measured spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in CA1 neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1 GI, sIPSC frequency and amplitude were similar between GFAP-Nrg3f/f and control slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that the Nrg3 mutation specifically increases sEPSC frequency, but not amplitude, and has no effect on GABA transmission onto CA1 pyramidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Enhanced_Glutamatergic_Transmission_by_the_Nrg3_Mutation_in_Pyramidal_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the hGFAP promoter is expressed in both neurons and astrocytes (23), it was unclear whether the enhanced glutamatergic transmission is due to the Nrg3 mutation in astrocytes or neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Astrocytes have been shown to regulate glutamatergic transmission (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we cultured neurons and astrocytes from mouse embryonic brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2A, Nrg3 was abundantly expressed in cultured neurons, but almost undetectable in astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that Nrg3s effect is cell-autonomous, that is, that Nrg3 in pyramidal neurons regulates glutamatergic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we crossed Nrg3f/f mice with Nex::Cre mice where Cre is expressed exclusively in pyramidal neurons, not in interneurons or astrocytes (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nrg3 levels in the hippocampus and cortex of Nex::Cre; Nrg3f/f (Nex-Nrg3f/f) mice were reduced to 13% of control (Fig 2 B and C), indicating that Nrg3 is expressed mainly in pyramidal neurons, in agreement with a recent report (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our hypothesis predicts that Nex-Nrg3f/f mice should display similar phenotypes observed in GFAP-Nrg3f/f mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Nex-Nrg3f/f slices showed an increase in sEPSC frequency (Fig 2 DF), but not amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, sIPSC frequency and amplitude were similar between control and Nex-Nrg3f/f mice (Fig 2 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that the Nrg3 mutation specifically in pyramidal neurons has a similar effect on glutamatergic transmission, suggesting a cell-autonomous regulatory mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed in GFAP-Nrg3f/f mice, the Nrg3 mutation by Nex-Cre had no effect on brain weight (Fig S4A) or laminar structure and neuron numbers in the hippocampus and somatosensory cortex (Fig S4 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Deficits_of_Nex-Nrg3f_f_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Abnormal locomotor activity and impaired PPI in rodents are thought to correspond to psychomotor agitations of schizophrenic patients (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, both hyperactivity and impaired PPI have been reported in Nrg3 null mice (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it was unclear in which neurons or cells Nrg3 ablation is sufficient to induce such a phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Nex-Nrg3f/f mice displayed enhanced locomotor activity in the open field test, compared with control mice (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutant mice showed similar startle responses (Fig 3D and Fig 3E, Left), suggesting normal hearing and acoustic startle reflex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PPI was substantially lower in Nex-Nrg3f/f mice than in control mice (Fig 3E, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observations indicate that Nrg3 in pyramidal neurons is necessary for normal locomotor activity and PPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia usually show cognitive deficits including impaired working memory (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a Y-maze test (Fig 3F), Nex-Nrg3f/f mice had more arm entries, compared with control mice, which was consistent with increased locomotor activity (Fig 3G, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the numbers of spontaneous alterations were reduced in Nex-Nrg3f/f mice, compared with controls (Fig 3G, Right), suggesting an impairment of spatial working memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the Nrg3 mutation causes behavioral deficits related to negative symptoms of mental illnesses, we conducted sucrose preference and social interaction tests (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3H, sucrose consumption by Nex-Nrg3f/f mice was reduced, compared with Nrg3f/f mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the social interaction test, Nrg3 mutant mice were able to recognize the initial stranger mouse (S1), but the time spent with it was reduced, compared with control mice (Fig 3 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a second stranger mouse (S2) was introduced, control mice spent more time with the latter (Fig 3K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Nex-Nrg3f/f mice spent relatively equal amounts of time with S1 and S2 mice, indicating an impairment in social interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these behavioral studies demonstrate that Nrg3 in pyramidal neurons is critical for locomotor activity, working memory, and social interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of Nrg3 in pyramidal neurons, mice displayed schizophrenia-related behavioral deficits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Higher_Glutamate_Release_Probability_in_Nex-Nrg3f_f_Mutants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate how the Nrg3 mutation alters glutamatergic transmission, we determined whether Nrg3 alters spine development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed Nrg3f/f mice with Thy1-GFP (GFP-M line) mice (31) and examined GFP-labeled spines of basal dendrites of CA1 neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no difference in spine morphology or number (Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the Nrg3 mutation did not alter the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons such as resting membrane potentials and input resistance (Fig S5 C and D) or firing frequency in response to injected currents (Fig S5 E and F), indicating similar excitability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we performed three sets of experiments to investigate how Nrg3 regulates glutamate release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, when hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons are stimulated with two consecutive stimulations, the second stimulation generates larger evoked EPSC (eEPSC) because of residual calcium concentration of the first eEPSC (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4 A and B, paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) in Nex-Nrg3f/f slices were reduced, compared with those in control slices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, eEPSC amplitudes of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the presence of MK801 are progressively reduced during repetitive stimulation of the Schaffer collateral pathway (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the usage-dependent decay of NMDAR currents was faster in Nex-Nrg3f/f slices than in control slices (Fig 4 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we characterized eEPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons in response to minimal stimulation (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of successful response was higher in Nex-Nrg3f/f mice, compared with control (Fig 4F and Fig 4G, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, Nex-Nrg3f/f mice showed increased synaptic efficacy (amplitudes of failed and successful eEPSCs) (Fig 4G, Middle), but no change in synaptic potency (amplitudes of successful eEPSCs) (Fig 4G, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that sEPSC frequency increase in Nex-Nrg3f/f mice may be due to an increased probability of glutamate release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nrg3_Localization_at_Presynaptic_Terminals_and_Regulation_of_the_SNARE_Complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nrg3 was thought to act by stimulating ErbB4 (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ErbB4 is specifically expressed in GABAergic neurons and is necessary for maintaining GABAergic transmission (3538).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GABA release is reduced in ErbB4 null mice and PV+ interneuron-specific mutant mice (3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the Nrg3 mutation had no effect on sIPSCs (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2), excluding a possible secondary effect of altered GABAergic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we determined the subcellular domain where Nrg3 is expressed by discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nrg3 was enriched in the presynaptic fraction that was labeled by an anti-synaptophysin (SYP) antibody, not in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction that was labeled by anti-PSD95 antibody (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that Nrg3 is specifically localized in presynaptic terminals, consistent with a recent report (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we determined whether the Nrg3 mutation alters the levels of SNARE proteins that are critical for vesicle fusion (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S6 A and B, Nex-Nrg3f/f mice showed comparable levels of v-SNARE protein VAMP2; t-SNARE proteins (syntaxin1 and SNAP25); vesicle protein SYP; the calcium sensor synaptotagmin1 (SYT1); RIM1, a protein critical for vesicle release; Sec1/Munc18-1 protein (Munc18-1 and Munc13-1); and Complexin 1/2 in both hippocampal homogenates and synaptosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that the Nrg3 mutation does not change the levels of proteins key to synaptic vesicle fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the protein levels of APMA receptors (GluA1 and GluA2) and NMDA receptors (GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B) were not changed in both hippocampal homogenates and the PSD fraction between Nex-Nrg3f/f mice and Nrg3f/f mice (Fig S6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We reasoned that, being strategically localized at nerve terminals, Nrg3 may interact with a SNARE protein(s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We precipitated Nrg3 from the presynaptic fraction of hippocampus with the anti-Nrg3 antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, both v-SNARE and t-SNARE proteins were coprecipitated with Nrg3, suggesting a potential interaction (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction was specific because SNARE proteins were not detectable in the complex of control IgG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, SYT1 was not detectable in the Nrg3 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which SNARE protein interacts with Nrg3, HEK293T cells were transfected with Flag-tagged Nrg3 and SNARE proteins (syntaxin1, SNAP25, and VAMP2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5C, Flag-Nrg3 could coprecipitate with syntaxin1, SNAP25, and VAMP2, which further confirmed the in vivo interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experiments with HEK293T cells transfected with individual SNARE proteins demonstrate that Nrg3 was able to coprecipitate syntaxin1 (Fig 5D), but not SNAP25 or VAMP2 (Fig 5 E and F, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Syntaxin1 has three domains: Habc, SNARE, and transmembrane (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S7 A and B, deletion of the SNARE domain prevented syntaxin1 from interacting with Nrg3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that Nrg3 interacts with the SNARE complex in vivo, likely by interacting with the SNARE domain of syntaxin1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNARE-complex assembly is critical for vesicle release (21, 22, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering increased glutamate release in Nrg3 mutant mice, we posit that Nrg3 may regulate the assembly of the SNARE complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we precipitated SNAP25 from hippocampal homogenates and probed for syntaxin1 and VAMP2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5 G and H, the amount of syntaxin1 and VAMP2 coprecipitated with SNAP25 was increased in Nex-Nrg3f/f mice, compared with Nrg3f/f mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result demonstrates an enhanced interaction of SNAP25 with syntaxin1 and VAMP2 in Nex-Nrg3f/f mice and suggests that Nrg3 may maintain the SNARE-complex assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced interaction of SNAP25 with synatxin1 and VAMP2 was further strengthened by treating neurons with KCl, indicating a role of neuronal activity (Fig S7 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Impaired_Glutamate_Release_by_Increasing_Nrg3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nrg3 levels were higher in patients with schizophrenia (13, 14) although Nrg3s pathogenic mechanisms were unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we studied the effects of elevating Nrg3 levels on glutamatergic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were cultured from the hippocampus of mouse embryos and recorded for sEPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, when control (Nrg3f/f) neurons were infected with lentivirus that overexpressed Nrg3, sEPSC frequency was reduced, indicating that elevating Nrg3 suppresses glutamate release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, compared with Nrg3f/f neurons, sEPSC frequency, but not amplitude, was increased in Nex-Nrg3f/f neurons (Fig 6 AC), in agreement with results from slice recordings (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase was diminished in Nex-Nrg3f/f neurons that were infected by lentivirus expressing Nrg3, demonstrating that restoring Nrg3 would rescue the phenotypes of increased glutamate transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with results from slice recordings (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2), these data demonstrate that Nrg3 controls glutamate release, suggesting that it has to be maintained at a proper level at nerve terminals for glutamate transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate mechanisms by which elevated Nrg3 suppresses glutamate release, we assayed the SNARE complex in HEK293T cells in the absence and the presence, respectively, of Nrg3, using a previously developed method (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When homogenates of transfected cells were resolved by SDS/PAGE, the SNARE complex migrated as smear bands above 40 kDa that were detected by the anti-syntaxin1 antibody (Fig 6D, Left, lane 1), in agreement with previous reports (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boiling of the samples disrupted the complex, and the SNARE proteins migrated as individual bands to the predicted molecular weights (Fig 6D, Right, lane 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, coexpression of Nrg3 reduced the complex formation in a dose-dependent manner, without changing levels of individual SNARE proteins (Fig 6D, lanes 24, and Fig 6E; Fig S8 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that increasing Nrg3 inhibits the assembly of the SNARE complex, revealing the pathophysiological mechanism of a high Nrg3 level in inhibiting glutamate release (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The major findings of this study are as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, loss of Nrg3 in GFAP-Nrg3f/f mice specifically increased sEPSC frequency but had no effect on sIPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the same phenotypes were observed in Nex-Nrg3f/f mice, where Nrg3 was specifically knocked out in pyramidal neurons, indicating that Nrg3 regulates glutamatergic transmission by a cell-autonomous mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, Nex-Nrg3f/f mice displayed various behavioral deficits related to schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the Nrg3 mutation decreased the PPR, increased decay of NMDAR currents when treated with MK801, and increased minimal stimulation-elicited response, providing evidence that the Nrg3 mutation increases glutamate release probability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, Nrg3 is a presynaptic protein and regulates the assembly of the SNARE complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we showed that increasing Nrg3 levels in neurons impaired glutamate release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observations indicate that Nrg3 is critical in controlling glutamatergic transmission (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nrg3 is thought to be a ligand that specifically binds ErbB4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the following evidence suggests that Nrg3 regulation of glutamate transmission is independent of ErbB4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the Nrg3 mutation had no effect on GABA transmission (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2), in contrast to the ErbB4 mutation, which impairs GABA transmission (3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Nrg3 mutation also reduces PPR in pyramidal neurons whereas ErbB4 deletion from interneurons has no effect (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, sEPSCs were recorded in the presence of BMI, a GABA antagonist, excluding a possible secondary effect (if any).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the ErbB4 level or phosphorylation was not altered in Nex-Nrg3f/f mutant mice (Fig S9 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, pharmacological inhibition of ErbB4 had no effect on the increase in glutamate release in Nex-Nrg3f/f hippocampal slices, excluding the involvement of ErbB4 (Fig S9 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, our study suggests that Nrg3 regulation of glutamate release is cell-autonomous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, Nex-Cremediated ablation reduced the protein level of Nrg3 by 87%, indicating that Nrg3 is expressed mainly in pyramidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, subcellular Nrg3 is localized in the presynaptic fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we show that Nrg3 overexpression in cultured neurons reduced glutamate release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the molecular level, Nrg3 can interact with syntaxin1 (via the SNARE domain) and thus inhibit SNARE-complex formation and reduce glutamate release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Nrg3 joins a group of proteins that control SNARE-complex formation, including Munc18-1 that binds syntaxin (41), complexin that inserts to the four-helical bundle of the SNARE complex (46), and Synip that binds t-SNARE proteins (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, a parsimonious explanation of these observations is that Nrg3 is a presynaptic protein that controls SNARE-complex assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hypofunction of the glutamatergic pathway is considered an important pathological mechanism of severe mental illnesses including schizophrenia (4850).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phencyclidine (PCP), an NMDAR uncompetitive antagonist, produces psychotic symptoms, thought disorder, blunted affect, and cognitive impairments that resemble those in schizophrenia patients (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In healthy individuals, ketamine, a PCP derivative, produces transient schizophrenia-like (positive and negative) symptoms and impairs prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive function (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In schizophrenic patients, on the other hand, ketamine increases signs and symptoms of the disorder (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms that cause hypoglutamatergic function are beginning to be understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both protein and mRNA levels of GluN1, a subunit of the NMDA receptor, are reduced in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in postmortem subjects with schizophrenia (54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, pharmacological or genetic manipulations of the NMDA receptor in rodents cause behaviors relevant to schizophrenia (56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study reveals an unexpected pathophysiological mechanism for hypofunction of the glutamatergic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increasing Nrg3 level in the medial prefrontal cortex enhances impulsivity (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developmental overexposure of mice to Nrg3 causes an anxiogenic-like phenotype and deficits in social behavior in adulthood (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that an increased level of Nrg3 reduces glutamate release likely by disrupting the assembly of the SNARE complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
