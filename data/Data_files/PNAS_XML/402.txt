Mixing of secondary organic aerosols versus relative humidity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies called into question whether diffusion in glassy atmospheric secondary organic aerosols (SOA) is fast enough for phase partitioning to equilibrate, as commonly assumed in models; however, most of those studies relied on rheological measurements or uptake of small molecules such as water and ammonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we conduct unique SOA mixing experiments using single-particle mass spectrometry to probe the diffusion of semivolatile organics into SOA derived from toluene and -pinene at different relative humidities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results show that, if the SOA systems are representative, equilibrium partitioning likely does have time to occur in the boundary layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work directly probes uptake of semivolatile organics by SOA particles over a wide humidity range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atmospheric aerosols exert a substantial influence on climate, ecosystems, visibility, and human health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although secondary organic aerosols (SOA) dominate fine-particle mass, they comprise myriad compounds with uncertain sources, chemistry, and interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SOA formation involves absorption of vapors into particles, either because gas-phase chemistry produces low-volatility or semivolatile products that partition into particles or because more-volatile organics enter particles and react to form lower-volatility products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, SOA formation involves both production of low-volatility compounds and their diffusion into particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most chemical transport models assume a single well-mixed phase of condensing organics and an instantaneous equilibrium between bulk gas and particle phases; however, direct observations constraining diffusion of semivolatile organics into particles containing SOA are scarce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we perform unique mixing experiments between SOA populations including semivolatile constituents using quantitative, single-particle mass spectrometry to probe any mass-transfer limitations in particles containing SOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that, for several hours, particles containing SOA from toluene oxidation resist exchange of semivolatile constituents at low relative humidity (RH) but start to lose that resistance above 20% RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above 40% RH, the exchange of material remains constant up to 90% RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that dry particles containing SOA from -pinene ozonolysis do not appear to resist exchange of semivolatile compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our interpretation is that in-particle diffusion is not rate-limiting to mass transfer in these systems above 40% RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the extent that these systems are representative of ambient SOA, we conclude that diffusion limitations are likely not common under typical ambient boundary layer conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed experiments probing the vapor exchange of SOA (O:C  0.6, modal mobility diameter between 300 nm and 600 nm) derived from oxidation of H8 toluene (H-toluene SOA) and D8 toluene (D-toluene SOA) at various RH and 22Â° C. We prepared one toluene SOA population in a 10 m3 chamber (the chamber population) and another in a 100-L sampling bag (the probe population), illustrated in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently combined the two populations in the chamber and explored their mixing behavior using a light-scattering single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (LSSP-AMS; Aerodyne Inc.) (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After combination, the chamber particle population had a suspended mass concentration of 100 gm3, and the probe population had a mass concentration of 40 gm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected single-particle data at unit mass resolution and will discuss signals at a given mass to charge ratio, where sx is the raw signal at m/z = x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 shows results from the single-particle mode, and Fig S2 shows time sequence data from bulk measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Toluene_SOA_Mixing_in_a_Dry_Chamber  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first present an experiment conducted under continuously dry conditions (the chamber RH remained less than 7% throughout the experiment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show time sequences from AMS bulk measurements of H-toluene SOA, D-toluene SOA, and their unique fragment signals (s43, mostly C2H3O+, and s46, mostly C2D3O+) in Fig S2A and the SOA mass spectra in Fig S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We produced the H-toluene SOA in the main chamber, and, at time = 0, we transferred D-toluene SOA produced in the sampling bag (the probe population) into the main chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 1A, we show the analysis of each particle in this dry experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2.5 h following combination of the two populations into the same experimental volume, most of the particles have deuterium content near unity or zero, meaning the large majority of particles remain either mostly deuterated or mostly hydrogenated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we describe in Materials and Methods, the approximate deuterium content is fD=s46/(s43+s46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using fD as a numerical filter, we separate the individual particle mass spectra into two groups: particles that were originally pure H-toluene SOA and particles that were originally pure D-toluene SOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then add the spectra in 30-min bins, which gives sufficient signal for quantitative analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this step, we calculate the mass percentage of the probe material (in this case, the D-toluene SOA) in both the chamber and probe populations, which we plot with connected, closed circles in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These aggregated values inform our quantitative assessment (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the dry experiment, we transferred the D-toluene SOA probe particles (a minor constituent) into the main chamber containing H-toluene SOA (particles and vapors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those probe particles sorbed some vapors from the H-toluene SOA, stabilizing at less than 10% H content immediately after being injected into the main chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H-toluene SOA chamber particles remained completely devoid of D-toluene SOA throughout the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, if the small amount of mixing were due to coagulation, we would expect to observe the reverse effect, where relatively high concentrations of the newly introduced D-toluene SOA probe particles could potentially strike some (already highly dilute) H-toluene SOA particles; there is no sign of this, and thus we conclude that a small fraction of H-toluene SOA vapors absorbed or adsorbed onto the D-toluene particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after this small initial uptake, there was no further exchange of vapors between the two populations; they remained chemically distinct from each other with essentially constant composition thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because we generated the two SOA populations from identical precursors (except that one is isotopically labeled), they should be completely miscible thermodynamically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the evident lack of mixing could have two causes: high viscosity (low diffusivity) in the particles or simply a dearth of semivolatile vapors available for exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Robinson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) previously showed, in a procedurally identical mixing experiment of SOA derived from toluene and -pinene (with -pinene SOA as the probe population), that vapors from toluene SOA substantially infiltrated -pinene SOA particles (Fig S4), with those particles reaching a 35% toluene SOA mass fraction promptly after entering the main chamber at RH less than 5% (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the toluene SOA aerosol produced in the main chamber included semivolatile vapors that would have sorbed into the probe particles if possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 10% sorption of semivolatiles to the probe particles in the dry chamber may have been surface adsorption or may reveal limited diffusion into a thin disrupted surface layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at least 3 times more material can sorb into the probe particles at higher RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the lack of mixing is likely due to low diffusivity in particles comprised of toluene SOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Toluene_SOA_Mixing_in_Damp__Moist__and_Wet_Chambers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next we present experiments conducted at elevated RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed exactly the same mixing experiments described in Toluene SOA Mixing in a Dry Chamber, but, shortly after bringing the two SOA populations into contact, we raised the chamber RH to different levels by adding water vapor to the chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show the bulk data in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1 BD, we show single-particle data from experiments in a damp chamber with 20% RH, a moist chamber with 43% RH, and a wet chamber with up to 90% RH, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the dry-chamber case, in the wet-chamber experiment, we used D-toluene SOA particles as the probe population; however, in the damp-chamber and moist-chamber cases, we used H-toluene SOA as the probe particles so that we obtained blank spectra at tless_than0 h for both SOA populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 1B, we see the onset of slow vapor exchange in the damp chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probe population started to progressively absorb vapor from the chamber population at 20% RH, indicating that even a modest amount of water can sufficiently soften particles comprising toluene SOA to reduce diffusion limitations within them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 43% RH, the probe population (H-toluene SOA) reached roughly 30% chamber SOA content (D-toluene SOA) in about 0.5 h. The chamber population, which remained completely pure in the dry experiment, took up 10% of the probe material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the data in Fig 1D, we see similar mixing at 43% and 90% RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large fraction of the D-toluene probe particles gained a significant fraction from H-toluene SOA, reaching roughly 30% H-toluene SOA content after 3 h, and, concurrently, the chamber particles absorbed 10% probe SOA content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 2, we show the extent of mixing in the two populations 2.5 h after water injection as a function of RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pink and gray stars correspond to the stars in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This graph shows that mixing after 2.5 h becomes facile between 20% and 40% RH, reaching asymptotic values above 40% RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Toluene_SOA_Mixing_with_-Pinene_SOA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When Robinson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) added -pinene SOA to a chamber containing D-toluene SOA at low RH, the -pinene SOA probe particles took up a significant fraction of D-toluene SOA; however the D-toluene SOA particles showed no evidence of -pinene products (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapid absorption of toluene SOA into the -pinene SOA probe particles indicates two things.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, even at low RH, the toluene SOA system contains a substantial semivolatile fraction (and thus the reversal of accretion products after condensation is not the principal cause of the RH dependence we observe in the toluene SOA system).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, unlike the toluene-derived SOA, the -pinene-derived SOA does not have a diffusive limitation to uptake of semivolatile organics, even under dry conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the question remains whether the -pinene SOA simply did not contain a significant fraction of semivolatile condensable vapors, or whether diffusion into the toluene SOA was simply slow at low RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we repeated the mixing experiment between -pinene SOA and toluene SOA (21), but we added water vapor to the chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 3, we show the RH effect for this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the toluene SOA system, when RH increased, the toluene SOA particles in the chamber absorbed a substantial fraction of semivolatile vapors, this time from -pinene SOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the lack of absorption of -pinene SOA into toluene SOA particles reported by Robinson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) was evidently due to low diffusivity at low RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 shows that the fraction of toluene SOA in the -pinene SOA particles reached a steady state of 20 to 30% under the same conditions as the experiments with isotopically labeled toluene SOA; this is slightly reduced uptake compared with the pure toluene SOA isotopic exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be that the -pinene and toluene SOA systems form a slightly nonideal solution, or this difference may be due to experimental variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this finding is broadly consistent with toluene-SOA and -pinene SOA forming a nearly ideal solution, in agreement with Hildebrandt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Robinson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) observed a somewhat higher uptake of toluene SOA vapor into particles containing -pinene SOA (Fig S3), but the overall mass loading of SOA was also roughly 3 times higher in those experiments than in ours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown by Ye et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (25), the semivolatile fraction of SOA measured with probe particles (in that case, polyethylene glycol) increases as more precursor is oxidized and the activity of the semivolatile species consequently rises.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, the influence of RH on vapor uptake by particles consisting of toluene-derived SOA is obvious in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Presuming that these systems are completely miscible, the compositions of all particles should converge to a single internal mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our observations clearly show that the populations do not completely mix over hours, even when RH is 90%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of complete mixing could have one of two causes: diffusion limitations within (glassy, viscous) particles or a fraction of the SOA with very low volatility that thus does not have time to move from one population to the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Low measured viscosity of toluene SOA particles at 90% RH almost certainly corresponds to high diffusivity, allowing complete mixing within a fraction of a second (8, 10) Furthermore, the volatility distribution of toluene-derived SOA spans a very wide range (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus conclude that the 30% mixing at elevated RH is due to a preponderance of low-volatility material in the toluene SOA (70% by mass) that does not have time to exchange during these experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe the same extent of mixing between 40% and 90% RH, where viscosity changes by five orders of magnitude (9), and so we conclude that in-particle diffusion for 300- to 600-nm toluene SOA particles is likely not rate limiting for mass exchange above 40% RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the suppressed mixing evident in Fig 2 at lower RH is consistent with decreased diffusivity within the drier, more viscid particles limiting mass transfer to the bulk of the individual particles at low RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Semivolatile organics can partition onto Teflon chamber walls, which can lead to an underestimation of SOA yields (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of semivolatile organics in our smaller 100-L bag could be especially significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If some vapors were denuded from the probe aerosol population by the high surface-area-to-volume ratio of the 100-L preparation bag, this would limit semivolatile vapors from the probe aerosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results at elevated RH show that our probe aerosol population did contain a significant semivolatile fraction, because semivolatile probe material transferred, to a significant extent, into the chamber particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, to the extent that the 100-L sample preparation bag denuded some of the semivolatile constituents from the probe aerosol population, it is likely that this rendered the particles more glassy; the residual material must have been less volatile, and thus some combination of higher molecular weight and more polar, both of which increase the glass transition temperature (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in the presence of potentially absorptive Teflon walls, our results confirm that a significant fraction (30% or more) of the SOA constituents are semivolatile and can move from one particle population to another for several hours in our chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mixing we observe at elevated RH is consistent with the findings of Renbaum-Wolff et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (8), who found that, at elevated RH, the viscosity of -pinene SOA decreased by orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Bateman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (30) observed a transition from bouncy to sticky behavior of both -pinene and toluene SOA at elevated RH, consistent with a state change from a semisolid to liquid phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe the onset of mixing at 20% RH for toluene SOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixing appears to be unimpeded above 43% RH, much lower than the 70% RH viscosity threshold (8, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particles can appear to be solid or semisolid and still have relatively rapid diffusion of semivolatile organics (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also observe a pronounced difference between toluene-derived SOA and -pinene-derived SOA at low RH, consistent with the high viscosity reported by Song et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At elevated RH, in addition to plasticizing particles containing SOA, water could also induce chemistry or change the activity coefficients of semivolatile compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results suggest that the latter two effects play a minor role, because we observed very similar extent of mixing at 43% and 90% RH (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in the mixing experiment between SOA from -pinene and from toluene under dry conditions, the -pinene SOA takes up a substantial fraction of vapors from toluene SOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that diffusion plays the leading role limiting SVOC uptake into toluene-derived particles at low RH in our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a complementary study on similar systems measuring evaporation rates from an oscillating microbalance also shows that evaporation rates from toluene SOA are suppressed at low RH but remain constant for -pinene SOA, which is consistent with our findings and interpretation (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Uptake of small molecules is also related to diffusivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Price et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (14) observed diffusion of D2O into -pinene-derived SOA discs over a wide range of water activities and temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They observed low diffusivity of water only at very low temperature and water activity; their warmest samples at 7 Â°C showed a minimum diffusivity of 1013 m2s1 at a water activity of 0.1, corresponding to equilibration of order 1 s. Li et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (15) observed a relatively sharp transition in NH3 reactive uptake into toluene-derived SOA between 20% and 40% RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also observed a more gradual increase in NH3 uptake into -pinene-derived SOA between dry conditions and 40% RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both experiments suggest that diffusion limitations vanish above roughly 40% RH, and both suggest that diffusion is somewhat slower in toluene-derived SOA than in -pinene-derived SOA when diffusion limitations exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mixing experiments show little evidence for mixing limitations in -pinene-derived SOA under any conditions, whereas the ammonia uptake is sensitive to RH below 30% RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Just as with rheological properties, reactive uptake is also not the same as phase equilibration, and small molecules may behave very differently from larger semivolatile organic compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If anything, we would expect diffusion to be more difficult for the larger semivolatile species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in -pinene-derived SOA, we see no signs of diffusive limitations even under dry conditions, whereas reactive uptake of NH3 is suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The extent of mixing at high RH also constrains the volatility distribution of the SOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Donahue et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (32), the timescale for evaporation of C = 10 gm3 compounds from 500-nm particles is roughly 1 h, so these isotopic mixing experiments constrain the fraction of this SOA with C10 gm3, provided that diffusion within the particles is faster than 1 h. Compounds with C1 gm3 would not exchange in 10 h under any circumstances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these experiments indicate that roughly 30% of toluene SOA is effectively semivolatile, with C10 gm3 when the total SOA loading is roughly 30 gm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates an effective semivolatile activity of 0.30 in both phases (the activity is the fraction in the particles and the saturation ratio in the gas phase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the semivolatile material consisted of a single product with C=30 gm3, that would imply a particle concentration of 9 gm3, a vapor concentration of 9 gm3 (thus the 0.30 activity in each phase), and an equilibrium partitioning fraction of 0.5, consistent with equilibrium partitioning theory when C=COA (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also suggest that the remaining 70% of the toluene SOA had a sufficiently low volatility to show limited exchange in several hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the characteristic evaporation timescales (32), this fraction has a volatility C1 gm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In most of the atmospheric boundary layer worldwide, the relative humidity is usually higher than our damp chamber (20% RH) (34, 35), where diffusion limitations in particles comprising toluene-derived SOA start to subside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe exchange of semivolatile vapors into submicron particles comprising toluene-derived SOA in 30 mins or less for RH of 40% or above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mixing timescale is, in most circumstances, shorter than the timescale for significant meteorological and chemical changes in the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, diffusion limitations within particles comprising SOA species comparable to those we have studied here should not significantly hinder equilibration of semivolatile organic compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this timescale is also similar to or shorter than the time step used in many chemical transport models, in which gasparticle phase equilibration is assumed (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The systems we investigated-pinene SOA and toluene SOAare widely used as SOA surrogates for the monoterpene family from biogenic sources and the alkyl-aromatics family from anthropogenic sources in chemical transport models (36, 3840).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are major SOA sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, diffusion and mixing within SOA particles formed from intermediate volatile organic compounds (IVOC) remains to be tested; as with sesquiterpenes, IVOCs are higher molecular weight precursors that may be important sources of SOA (41, 42), and so there remains the possibility that these species, or mixtures of them, may produce particles with lower diffusivity than those we have studied here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiments we describe here directly test the timescale for mixing of semivolatile compounds into particles containing secondary organic aerosol, over timescales (several hours) relevant to atmospheric transport and diurnal cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work demonstrates how laboratory SOA mixing experiments using single-particle mass spectrometer measurements can effectively probe the mixing behavior of particles containing SOA under realistic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that SOA derived from toluene does indeed resist uptake of semivolatile vapors, but only at very low relative humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in-particle diffusion is not rate-limiting to mass transfer above 40% RH in our system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A major reason for the interest in low diffusivity within atmospheric particles is that this could slow down the equilibration of semivolatile SOA mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments directly probe semivolatile mass exchange over the full range of atmospheric RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also shown that toluene SOA contains about 30% semivolatile material (C10 gm3), whereas the remaining 70% has a volatility C1 gm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these results extend to atmospheric organic aerosols, which are often much more oxidized than the laboratory-generated SOA particles in this study (43), then diffusion limitations are unlikely to prevent relatively rapid equilibration of semivolatile organics in the planetary boundary layer on timescales above an hour or so.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We describe the methods in detail in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, we followed the methods of Robinson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) to prepare SOA populations in separate smog chambers and then combined the populations into one chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used single-particle aerosol mass spectrometry (23) to group the particles based on their original content, aggregated individual particle signals to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise, and analyzed these aggregated spectra to determine the fractions of each original SOA type in the two populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S1 shows the schematic setup of a typical laboratory organic aerosol mixing experiment performed in the Carnegie Mellon University Air Quality Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prepared two aerosol populations separately, and, once they both stabilized, we combined them to form an external mixture, which we subsequently analyzed using single-particle mass spectrometry to separate the populations based on their unique tracers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principal smog chamber for these experiments is a temperature-controlled 10-m3 Teflon chamber held at 22 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the experiments described here, we generated one aerosol population in this chamber and a second population in a 100-L Teflon sampling bag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When both SOA systems stabilized, we transferred the contents of the 100-L sampling bag into the larger chamber via compression to form the external mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we used SOA formed from toluene (99.8% purity; Aldrich) photooxidation (toluene SOA) and -pinene (99% purity; Aldrich) ozonolysis (-pinene SOA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toluene SOA is a well-studied model system representing anthropogenic SOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prepared the toluene SOA by injecting 20 L of toluene (equal to a mixing ratio of 424 ppb in the chamber and 42.4 ppm in the sampling bag) and then generating hydroxyl radicals via photolysis of nitrous acid (HONO) using 360-nm UV black lights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Pinene SOA is an equally well-studied model system representing biogenic SOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prepared the -pinene SOA by injecting 2 L of -pinene (equal to 28 ppb in the chamber and 2.8 ppm in the sampling bag) in the presence of excess ozone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both precursors were injected into the containers through a heated tube that was fitted with an airtight septum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before we transferred the contents of the small bag to the large chamber, we turned off the UV lights to halt any photochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure bulk and single-particle composition, we continuously sampled air from the chamber using an Aerodyne LSSP AMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we draw a sample flow of 1.40 ccs1 through an aerosol lens to form a tightly focused beam of particles between roughly 50 nm and 1,000 nm aerodynamic diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This beam passes through the entrance slit of a particle time of flight (PToF) vacuum chamber and immediately through a rotating mechanical chopper with a small opening equal to 1% of its circumference, ensuring that either zero or one particle traverses the time-of-flight region in each chopper cycle (at the concentrations used here, less than 2% of chopper cycles resulted in more than one particle entering the pToF region during a single chopper cycle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of the PToF chamber, the particles strike a 600 Â°C heater, which vaporizes nonrefractory constituents; the vapors are subjected to 70-eV electron ionization, after which the ions are pulsed into a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A continuous-wave violet laser is mounted perpendicular to the particle beam 2/3 of the way down the pToF region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particles with optical diameters greater than 200 nm generate sufficient light-scattering signal when they intercept the laser beam to trigger data collection of the single-particle mass spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the experiments described here, we alternated the LSSP AMS between bulk V mode and single-particle mode every 60 s. We analyzed the data using the software packages SQUIRREL (for bulk measurement) and SPARROW (for single-particle measurement) written by Aerodyne Research Inc. and University of Colorado, Boulder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To separate the mass spectra of the different SOA populations, in all of the experiments, we formed one of the aerosol populations using an isotopically labeled precursor (D toluene, 99.5% purity; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show the averaged mass spectra derived from single-particle mode of H-toluene SOA and D-toluene SOA in Fig S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fragment at m/z 43, mostly C2H3O+, accounts for about 23%, on average, of the signal for SOA formed from H-toluene but less than 0.5% of the signal from D-toluene SOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the fragment at m/z 46, mostly C2D3O+, accounts for 25% on average of the signal for SOA formed from D-toluene but less than 1% of the signal from H-toluene SOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We carried out all experiments with a particle number concentration of 104 particles per cubic centimeter and a modal diameter of several hundred nanometers, where coagulation was negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, any isotopic mixing is unambiguously due to exchange of vapors between the two aerosol populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signals from individual particles are noisy because each particle produces from 15 to more than 300 ions after ionization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unique mass fractions at m/z 43 and m/z 46 provide a rough indication of the particle deuterium content, which we used for the initial filtering where there is a clear separation between the two populations.fD=s46s43+s46,where sx= raw signal at m/z = x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a threshold of fD0.4 when the probe particles are deuterated and fD0.6 when the chamber particles are deuterated, to separate the probe and the chamber populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This threshold is asymmetrical, because we observe much more uptake of chamber material into the probe particles than vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also adopted the cosine similarity of the mass spectrum of two aerosol populations used by Robinson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21) to represent the degree of chemical similarity of different SOA populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value ranges from 0 (low similarity) to 1 (high similarity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the fD filter is useful for a quick visualization, it does not provide a quantitative measure of the extent of mixing because the small-number counting statistics and variable ions par particle from individual particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, once we have separated the particles into probe and chamber populations, we add the signals over selected time intervals (30 min for Fig 1 and 15 min for Fig 3) to obtain much higher signal-to-noise mass spectra of the two particle populations, which we then normalize by the total aggregated ion signal so that fi at any given m/z is the fraction of the total signal at that mass to charge ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then quantitatively assess the fraction of material in each population associated with the two precursors (thus the extent of any mixing) by deconvolving the resulting normalized mass spectrum for population p (probe or chamber), fp, using the bulk spectra of the SOA from H toluene, fH, and D toluene, fD, shown in Fig S3.fp=aHfH+(1aH)fD.The extent of mixing is thus the relevant coefficient [for example, if the probe population is initially deuterated, the extent of mixing for the probe population is aH, and the extent of mixing for the chamber population is aD=(1aH)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that we add the single-particle signals instead of averaging them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because particles generating fewer ions have much lower signal to noise, and because the bulk AMS signal is fundamentally the sum of many individual particle signals (not their average).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
