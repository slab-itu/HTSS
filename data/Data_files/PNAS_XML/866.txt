TrkB neurotrophic activities are blocked by -synuclein, triggering dopaminergic cell death in Parkinsons disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alpha-synuclein plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Parkinsons disease (PD), however the molecular mechanisms related to -synuclein in neurodegeneration of PD remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that -synuclein specifically inhibits BDNF/TrkB signaling, leading to dopaminergic neuronal death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disruption of this interaction rescues TrkB signaling, preventing -Syninduced dopaminergic neuronal death and restoring motor functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study reveals the mechanism related to -synucleininduced neurotoxicity of PD via regulation of TrkB neurotrophic signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BDNF/TrkB neurotrophic signaling is essential for dopaminergic neuronal survival, and the activities are reduced in the substantial nigra (SN) of Parkinsons disease (PD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether -Syn (alpha-synuclein) aggregation, a hallmark in the remaining SN neurons in PD, accounts for the neurotrophic inhibition remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that -Syn selectively interacts with TrkB receptors and inhibits BDNF/TrkB signaling, leading to dopaminergic neuronal death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Syn binds to the kinase domain on TrkB, which is negatively regulated by BDNF or Fyn tyrosine kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, -Syn represses TrkB lipid raft distribution, decreases its internalization, and reduces its axonal trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, -Syn also reduces TrkB protein levels via up-regulation of TrkB ubiquitination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, dopamines metabolite 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) stimulates the interaction between -Syn and TrkB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline disrupts -Syn/TrkB complex and rescues TrkB neurotrophic signaling, preventing -Syninduced dopaminergic neuronal death and restoring motor functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our findings demonstrate a noble pathological role of -Syn in antagonizing neurotrophic signaling, providing a molecular mechanism that accounts for its neurotoxicity in PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

-Synuclein_Interacts_with_TrkB  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Due to the well-documented correlation between aberrant -Syn accumulation and nigrostriatal degeneration, the association between reduced BDNF signaling and nigrostriatal degeneration, and the numerous studies revealing the cross-talk between -Syn and BDNF (1820), we hypothesized that pathological -Syn might directly impinge on BDNF/TrkB pathway in PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we conducted a coimmunoprecipitation assay and found that -Syn selectively interacted with the TrkB, but not TrkA or TrkC, receptor in cotransfected HEK293 cells (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A truncation assay revealed that the N terminus of -Syn was essential for binding to TrkB (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, mapping studies demonstrated that the TrkB kinase domain on the intracellular motif was necessary for -Syn binding to the TrkB receptor (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore whether the kinase activity is necessary for mediating the interaction between TrkB and -Syn, we pretreated rat primary cortical neurons with the Trk receptor inhibitor K252a, followed by BDNF treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, BDNF completely disrupted the formation of the -Syn/TrkB complex, and inhibition of TrkB barely affected the interactions (Fig 1D, Top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, BDNF-stimulated phosphorylation of TrkB (p-TrkB), and its downstream p-Akt and p-MAPK signals, was strongly blunted by K252a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, BDNF strongly elicited -Syn Y125 phosphorylation regardless of the treatment with K252a (Fig 1D, Bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that -Syn also bound to TrkB in human cortex samples from brains of patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD) but not in control brain tissue samples (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescent staining also verified that TrkB colocalized with -Syn in LBs in PD patients with p-TrkB signals much dimmer than total TrkB levels (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, -Syn interacts with TrkB, which can be inhibited by BDNF treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

-Synuclein_Inhibits_BDNF-Mediated_TrkB_Signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the biological effect of -Syn on BDNF/TrkB signaling, we transfected BR6 cells (SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with the TrkB receptor) with -Syn, followed by BDNF stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDNF-induced phosphorylation of TrkB and its downstream effectors was blocked by -Syn overexpression (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also extended the experiment into primary cortical neurons from SNCA transgenic overexpressing mice or SNCA KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild-type neurons, BDNF elicited prominent p-TrkB/p-Akt/p-MAPK signaling, which was significantly suppressed in SNCA transgenic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SNCA KO neurons, the BDNF-triggered signaling cascade remained intact, though the temporal onset of TrkB activation was delayed (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the key physiological functions of the BDNF/TrkB pathway is to promote neuronal survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we performed a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release cytotoxicity assay to quantify spontaneous cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LDH assay demonstrated that SNCA transgenic neurons exhibited much higher spontaneous cell death compared with wild-type or SNCA KO neurons (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of primary neurons with BDNF significantly repressed neuronal cell death regardless of genotype (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate how -Syn affects BDNF-mediated neuroprotection in the face of PD-associated pathology, we next treated primary neurons with the neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) and analyzed LDH release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MPP+-induced LDH release was strongly reduced in both wild-type and SNCA KO neurons by BDNF treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the neuroprotective effect of BDNF was much weaker in SNCA transgenic neurons (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the biological role of -Syn in BDNF-mediated neuronal survival, we transduced primary cortical neurons with AAV-expressing human -Syn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And neurons underwent BDNF deprivation (by treatment with an anti-BDNF antibody) either in the presence or absence of MPP+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within neurons transduced with the AAV-GFP control vector, depletion of BDNF diminished p-TrkB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MPP+ also reduced p-TrkB, and the combination of both BDNF depletion and MPP+ treatment resulted in an additive effect to further decrease p-TrkB (Fig 2E, second panel, left four lanes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, AAV-mediated overexpression of -Syn strongly repressed BDNF-induced phosphorylation of TrkB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of -Syn overexpression with MPP+ treatment completely abolished p-TrkB levels, and importantly this effect was independent of the presence or absence of BDNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, total TrkB levels were reduced following -Syn overexpression (Fig 2E, top two panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The downstream phosphorylation of Akt followed the p-TrkB pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-MAPK displayed similar effects, except that p-MAPK 42 was not further diminished in the AAV-Syn-infected neurons treated with anti-BDNF (Fig 2E, panels 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblotting of -Syn showed increased -Syn, which was prominently displayed as oligomers in the presence of MPP+ and anti-BDNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of -Syn induced notable oligomerization (Fig 2E, Bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next analyzed cytotoxicity within these treatment groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LDH assay revealed an inverse correlation between levels of p-TrkB/p-Akt and LDH release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons transduced with AAV-Syn exhibited more cell death than those transduced with AAV-GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, BDNF deprivation also significantly increased cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, maximal cytotoxicity was observed following the combination of MPP+ and BDNF deprivation (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that overexpression of -Syn reduces TrkB protein levels as well as p-TrkB signaling, thereby inhibiting the neurotrophic effects of BDNF, resulting in much more robust neuronal death in the face of PD-associated toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

-Synuclein_Blocks_TrkB_Signaling_by_Inhibiting_Its_Internalization_and_Lipid_Raft_Distribution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TrkB receptors reside within lipid rafts, and this localization is mediated by Fyn tyrosine kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disrupting lipid rafts prevents the full activation of TrkB (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether -Syn mediates TrkB cellular localization, we conducted a subcellular fractionation experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prepared primary cortical neuronal cultures and transduced the cells with AAV overexpressing -Syn or a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting endogenous -Syn, followed by BDNF treatment for 0, 15, or 60 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control neurons, BDNF treatment resulted in a TrkB enrichment in fraction #2, where Fyn also eluted (i.e., this fraction also contained lipid rafts, as Fyn is also used as a marker for these; Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, TrkB and -Syn coeluted in fraction #7 and #8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When -Syn was overexpressed, it distributed into fraction #2 as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, TrkB levels in lipid raft fractions were clearly reduced following -Syn overexpression, whereas Fyn levels remained intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following -Syn knockdown, TrkB levels in fraction #2 were increased upon BDNF stimulation, similar to control cells (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NTTrk complex internalization is essential for the signal transduction that initiates the cellular response to target-derived NTs, and this process is regulated through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, leading to the formation of signaling endosomes (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we examined whether -Syn also regulates TrkB internalization in BR6 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDNF strongly stimulated TrkB internalization in control cells and -Syn shRNA-treated cells, associated with robust p-TrkB, p-Akt, and p-MAPK signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, these effects were substantially antagonized by -Syn overexpression (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further assess the effect of -Syn on TrkB endocytosis, we performed immunofluorescent staining to monitor the subcellular localization of TrkB as well as the colocalization of TrkB with EEA1, a marker for early endosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDNF induced the internalization of both TrkB and p-TrkB as indicated by colocalization with EEA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects were reduced in SNCA transgenic neurons (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trafficking of NT/Trk complexes within the endosome plays a critical role in neurotrophic signaling cascade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we performed a live-cell imaging assay using wild-type, SNCA transgenic, and SNCA KO dopaminergic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the mobility of TrkB fluorescent particles within the axon of SNCA overexpressing transgenic neurons was significantly impaired compared with that observed in wild-type or SNCA KO cells (Fig 3C), fitting with previous reports that formation of -Syn LN-like aggregates in axons impedes the transport of distinct endosomes (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

-Synuclein_Blocks_the_Prosurvival_Effects_of_BDNF_TrkB_in_Dopaminergic_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore the biologic effect of -Synmediated blocking of BDNF/TrkB neurotrophic activities in DAergic neuronal survival, we stereotaxically delivered AAV-GFP into the left SNpc and AAV-BDNF into the right SNpc of WT SNCA KO or SNCA transgenic overexpressing mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice then received a daily i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of MPTP (30 mg/kg) treatment for 5 d. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that GFP and BDNF were appropriately expressed in the respective SNpc regions (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDNF expression induced the p-TrkB/p-Akt/p-MAPK signaling cascade in WT and SNCA KO mice, however this effect was suppressed in SNCA transgenic mice (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, MPTP administration induced substantial DAergic neurodegeneration in all of the genotypes, but tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cell loss was significantly greater in SNCA transgenic mice compared with WT or SNCA KO mice (Fig 4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that TH immunoreactivity was reduced in SNCA transgenic mice compared with wild-type or SNCA KO mice, and MPTP treatment almost completely eliminated TH immunoreactivity in SNCA transgenic mice (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, -Syn inhibits TrkB signaling, rendering DAergic neurons more vulnerable to the neurotoxin MPTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Disruption_of_-Syn_TrkB_Association_Promotes_Dopaminergic_Neuronal_Survival  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The DA metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL) induces -Syn binding to TrkB, leading to suppression of TrkB neurotrophic signaling and escalation of DAergic neurodegeneration (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested whether the inhibition of DOPAL by MAO-B inhibitor (rasagiline) could block -Syn/TrkB association, promoting DAergic neuron survival in vivo as well as in BR6 cells (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We injected mice with AAV-GFP or AAV-Syn into the left and right substantial nigra (SN) of the same mice, respectively, followed by rasagiline administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, overexpression of -Syn elicited DAergic neurodegeneration in the SN and nigrostriatal denervation of the striatum compared with the expressing hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was alleviated by rasagiline treatment (Fig 5 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, DA concentrations were significantly elevated in both SN and striatum (Fig 5 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since MAO-B was potently inhibited by rasagiline, its oxidation product DOPAC was substantially reduced (Fig 5 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motor behavioral assays indicated that -Syninduced motor dysfunctions were rescued by rasagiline (Fig 5 HJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that rasagiline strongly inhibited the association between -Syn and TrkB, restoring BDNF/TrkB neurotrophic signaling (Fig 5K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceivably, rasagiline disrupts -Syn/TrkB complex via inhibiting MAO-Bproduced DOPAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the current study, we provide compelling evidence that -Syn directly interacts with the TrkB receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction is in turn negatively regulated by BDNF and Fyn tyrosine kinase activity, resulting in the phosphorylation of -Syn on Y125, causing it to dissociate from TrkB receptors (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, -Syn binds TrkB and completely suppresses its neurotrophic activities, increasing the vulnerability of DA neurons to degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, -Syn potently reduces TrkB protein levels by stimulating TrkB ubiquitination (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data presented herein suggest that -Syn blocks TrkB signaling by diminishing TrkB endocytosis, internalization, and axonal transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though -Syn overexpression in neurons from SNCA overexpressing transgenic mice greatly inhibits BDNF/TrkB neurotrophic signaling, the absence of -Syn in neurons of SNCA KO mice has little effects on these events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we observed that -Syn KO exhibit a slight delay in the kinetics of BDNF-induced phosphorylation of TrkB and its downstream effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This delay did not affect the neurotrophic activity of BDNF, as the effects of BDNF treatment were comparable in both wild-type and SNCA KO DA neurons in the face of MPP+-induced neurotoxicity (Fig 2 CF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicate that SNCA is not required for BDNF/TrkB neurotrophic activities, despite the finding that increased levels of -Syn can inhibit BDNF neurotrophic signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies indicate that BDNF stimulates the association between endogenous TrkB and Fyn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In neurons derived from Fyn knockout mice, the translocation of TrkB to lipid rafts in response to BDNF is compromised, while inhibiting TrkB translocation to lipid rafts prevents the full activation of TrkB and downstream signals (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we replicated the finding that BDNF treatment translocates TrkB to lipid rafts and extended these findings to show that -Syn overexpression diminishes TrkB lipid raft residency, whereas -Syn depletion does not affect TrkB subcellular distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using TrkB stably transfected dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells, we showed that BDNF-triggered TrkB internalization is abolished by -Syn overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with previous reports that BDNF-induced TrkB accumulation at lipid rafts is prevented by blocking the internalization of TrkB (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceivably, BDNF treatment activates Fyn, which subsequently phosphorylates -Syn on Y125, resulting in a dissociation from TrkB, allowing TrkB lipid raft translocation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Syn interacts with complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and interferes with its function, promoting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accumulating evidence suggests that the toxic interaction between DA, DA metabolites, and -Syn might promote an oxidative environment within DAergic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidative modification of -Syn by DA metabolites has been proposed to be responsible for the selective vulnerability to DAergic neurons (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DA-modified -Syn tends to form protofibrillar intermediates but not large fibrils (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such oligomeric -Syn has been suggested to represent the primary toxic species responsible for DAergic neurotoxicity (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these reports, we found that DA and its metabolite, DOPAL, strongly stimulate -Syn binding to TrkB receptors, completely blocking TrkB neurotrophic signaling, a phenomenon which was partially attenuated by BDNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, -Syn overexpression-induced neuronal cell death was further escalated by DOPAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, blocking DA biosynthesis by -methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT), which inhibits TH activity, significantly attenuates -Synelicited neuronal cell death (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevation of DOPAL levels may contribute to the specific vulnerability of DAaergic neurons to complex I inhibition (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOPAL covalently modifies -Syn and stimulates its aggregation and is neurotoxic in vivo (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fitting with in vitro results (Fig S4), we found that rasagiline strongly dissociates the -Syn/TrkB complex in the SNpc of mice injected with AAV-Syn or MPTP, resulting in a subsequent up-regulation of p-TrkB/p-Akt/p-MAPK signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, rasagiline significantly attenuated -Syninduced DAergic neuron death in the SN with the concomitant preservation of DA terminals within the striatum and improvements in motor functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with previous reports that rasagiline promotes regeneration of SN dopaminergic neurons in postMPTP-induced parkinsonism via activation of tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathway (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we show that -Syn binds to, and inhibits, TrkB neurotrophic activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current study provides a pathological function for -Syn in the binding of the TrkB receptor and resultant inhibition of BDNF/TrkB neurotrophic signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction is strongly up-regulated by DAs metabolite DOPAL, resulting in increased dopaminergic neuronal death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discovery provides a model for the underlying molecular etiology of -Synmediated neurotoxicity and DAergic neuronal loss in PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight- to 12-wk-old C57BL/6 were used as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNCA null mice (B6;129 × 1-Sncatm1Rosl, stock no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  003692) or human SNCA overexpressing mice [B6.Cg-Tg(SNCA)OVX37Rwm Sncatm1Rosl/J, stock no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  023837] on pure genetic background were backcrossed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping was performed by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from the tail tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR was performed using mutant primers F (5TCA GCC ACG ATA AAA CTG AGG3), R (5GCC TGA AGA ACG AGA TCA GC3) and transgene primers F (5CCT CCT GTT AGC TGG GCT TT3), R (5ACC ACT CCC TCC TTG GTT TT3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal care and handling were performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Emory Medical School guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigators were blinded to the group allocation during the animal experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocol was reviewed and approved by the Emory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Human_Tissue_Samples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Postmortem brain frozen samples of LBD patients (n = 3) and paraffin-embedded sections of PD patients (n = 3) were provided from the Emory Alzheimers Disease Research Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study was approved by the biospecimen committee at Emory University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LBD and PD cases were clinically diagnosed and neuropathologically confirmed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Informed consent was obtained from all subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plasmid_Clones_and_Viral_Genomes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AAV viral genome contained either the human -syn or the GFP coding sequence controlled by the hybrid chicken beta-actin/cytomegealovirus promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AAV2/5 and LV pseudotyped with VSV-G was produced as described previously (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analysis was performed using either Students t test (two-group comparison) or one-way ANOVA followed by LSD post hoc test (more than two groups), and differences with P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunoprecipitation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mouse brain tissue samples or cultured cells were lysed in lysis buffer and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 g. The supernatant was incubated with anti-synuclein or GFP antibody and protein A/G-agarose overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Primary_Neuron_Cultures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary rat ventral midbrain or cortical neurons in E18 were cultured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons were dissected and suspended by pipetting in DMEM containing 5% FCS and 5% horse serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This operation was repeated again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were seeded into polyethyleneimine-coated 10-cm dishes and 12-well plates, including coated coverslips, and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 3 h, the culture medium was changed to Neurobasal containing a B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), and a half medium was changed to fresh Neurobasal/B-27 every 4 d. Neurons cultured 7 d in vitro (DIV 7) were transduced with AAV-GFP, AAV-syn, or Lenti-Sh-syn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 23 d, cells were treated by MPP (20 µM), AMPT (1 mM), or DOPAL (60 µM) for 24 h. BDNF was pretreated for 15 min before cell lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Western blot experiments, cells were collected, lysed, and denatured with 4× sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neurons were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized, and immunostained with anti-TH antibody and TUNEL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The toxicity was analyzed by counting TUNEL-positive cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transfection_and_Viral_Infection_of_the_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding mGST-, Myc-, HA-, or GFP-tagged alpha-synuclein, point mutant alpha-synuclein, wild-type TrkB, or kinase dead TrkB using polyethylenimine (PEI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AAV-syn, AAV-GFP, or Lenti-ShRNA-syn were used for infection in primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neurotoxicity was analyzed using LDH assay (CytoTox 96 Non-Radio; Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lipid_Rafts_Isolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DIV 911 rat cortical neurons were infected by control, AAV-syn, or Lenti-Sh-syn for 3 d. BDNF was supplied 0, 15, or 60 min before cell lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysates were fractionated by discontinuous Optiprep Density Gradient Medium (sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 35% Optiprep solution (mixture of 750 L of lysates and 850 L of a 70% Optiprep) was overlayed sequentially with 8 mL of 30% Optiprep in lysis buffer and 3.2 mL of lysis buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gradients were centrifuged for 6 h at 36,000 rpm in a Beckman ultracentrifuge, using an SW41 Ti rotor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight fractions of 1.5 mL were then collected from the top, after discarding the first 1.1 mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For lower concentration samples, the samples were concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter tubes (Millipore) to increase the loading concentration of lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Test  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Loss of motor function due to DAergic neurodegeneration was tested 15 wk following the vector injection or 5 d following the MPTP injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behavioral test included the rotarod test, grid performance, cylinder test, and amphetamine-induced rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the rotarod test, mice were trained for 3 sequential days on the rotarod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each daily practice session consisted of placing the subject on the rotarod (San Diego Instruments) at a slow rotational speed (5 rpm) for a maximum of 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were given three test trials on the test day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rotational speed of rotarod was modulated from 0 rpm to a maximum 40 rpm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was gradually increased during the trial at a rate of 0.1 rpm/s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Latency to fall down from the accelerating rotarod as well as the rotational speed were the primary dependent variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the grid performance test, the mice were placed on a horizontal grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grid was inverted, so the mice were hanging upside down by their paws.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were videotaped for up to 60 s, and then a 10-s segment scored for forepaw step distance as defined by the number of grids transversed with each step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the cylinder test, mice were placed individually inside a glass cylinder (12 cm diameter, 22 cm height) and video-recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Video files were examined by an observer blinded to the animals treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 20 and 30 wall touches per animal (contacts with fully extended digits executed with the forelimb ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion) were counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the amphetamine-induced rotation test, d-amphetamine (free base, 2 mg/kg in saline; Sigma) was injected i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of completed ipsilateral or contralateral circles was quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blot_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mouse brain, human tissue samples, or cultured cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium -glycerophosphate, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 g. The supernatant was boiled in SDS loading buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After SDS/PAGE, the samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary antibodies to the following targets were used: GST-HRP, alpha-tubulin, beta-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), HA, myc, GFP, PY99, antialpha-synuclein, S129, TrkB, TrkC14, Ubiquitin P4D1 (Santa Cruz), anti-Y125, His (GE healthcare), pMAPK/MAPK, pAKT S473/AKT, Fyn, PARP, (Cell Signaling), anti-TH (Sigma-Aldrich), alpha-synuclein LB509 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and anti-BDNF (Novus Biologicals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunostaining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paraffin-embedded human brain sections or free-floating mouse brain sections sliced by cryotom were treated with 0.3% H2O2 for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were washed three times in PBS and blocked in 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100, for 30 min, followed by overnight incubation with TH antibody (1:1,000) or antialpha-synuclein LB509 antibody (1:500) at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal was developed using Histostain-SP kit (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunofluorescence, the sections were washed three times in PBS, after primary antibody incubation, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slides were washed three times in PBS and covered with a glass using mounting solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For TrkB localization, primary dopaminergic neurons from WT, SNCA KO, and SNCA TG mice were pretreated by BDNF (50 ng/mL) for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed three times with ice-cold acid-salt solution (0.2 M acetic acid, pH 2.8, 0.5 M sodium chloride) and fixed by 4% formalin for 10 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were permeabilized and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS solution containing 10% goat serum, 1% BSA, and 0.3% Triton-X-100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary antibodies (anti-TrkB, p816 TrkB, or EEA1) were incubated overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing, slides were incubated with the secondary antibodies (anti-mouse Alexa 555 or anti-rabbit Alexa 488) for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slides were washed three times in PBS and then covered with a glass cover using mounting solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For TUNEL staining, slides were incubated at 37 °C using In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image capture and analysis were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HPLC_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DA and DOPAC levels were determined by HPLC with coulometric detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain samples were homogenized in 0.1 N HClO4 solution (containing 0.01% sodium metabisulfite and 25 ng/mL internal standard 3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine HBr) and centrifuged at 13,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aliquots of supernatant fractions were filtered with a 0.2-m HT Tuffryn membrane (Pall); then injected into an Ultrasphere 5 m ODS column, 250 × 4.6-mm (Hichrom Limited); and separated with a mobile phase containing 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.30 mM sodium octyl sulfate, and 5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile, pH 3.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DA and DOPAC amount (ng per sample) was then quantified by comparison with internal standards, with a standard curve generated with 0.15 ng of DA standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein level (mg per sample) was determined with Lowry protein assays with a standard curve generated with 095 g BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cells_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TH immunoreactivity in the SN and striatum was estimated using fluorescence intensity quantified using Image J software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each animal, three consecutive sections of the SN and striatum were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the quantification of TUNEL-positive cells in dopaminergic neuron, three images were taken in each group using a 10× objective lens (Olympus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive cells were counted and calculated for the average from each group (n = 3, each group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conditions of the analysis were blinded to the investigator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fyn-Mediated_Phosphorylation_of_-Synuclein_at_Y125_Disrupts_the_Binding_to_TrkB  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further explore whether the tyrosine kinase activity of TrkB is necessary for the -SynTrkB complex formation, we used a TrkB kinase-dead (KD) K572A mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A coimmunoprecipitation assay indicated that both TrkB wild-type and KD robustly associated with -Syn, which was totally inhibited by BDNF (Fig S5A, Top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-TrkB and the phosphorylation of downstream effectors was completely absent in conditions using the KD TrkB construct (Fig S5A, five bottom panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether -Syn mutations or phosphorylation status influences the interactions, we used various phosphomimetic or nonphosphorylatable mutants and found that the nonphosphorylatable Y125F and PD-associated A53T displayed much stronger binding affinity to TrkB than wild-type -Syn (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that Y125 phosphorylation, which is predominantly mediated by Fyn kinase, might antagonize the binding between -Syn and TrkB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further assess the role of Fyn in this process, we used constitutively active Fyn (Fyn-CA) and kinase-dead Fyn (Fyn-KD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with control or Fyn-KD, Fyn-CA substantially repressed -SynTrkB complex formation (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BDNF-stimulated -Syn Y125 phosphorylation was inversely correlated with the binding affinity between -Syn and TrkB (Fig 1D, Bottom), suggesting that BDNF-induced activation of Fyn might inhibit -SynTrkB complex formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we tested the effects of the Fyn tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 on -SynTrkB complex formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the Fyn inhibitor PP2, but not the inactive analog PP3, blocked the dissociation between -Syn and TrkB by BDNF (Fig S5D), underscoring that Fyn phosphorylation of -Syn inhibits its interaction with TrkB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this, we observed increased binding between -Syn and TrkB in Fyn knockout mouse brain compared with wild-type mouse brains (Fig S5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate that Fyn tyrosine kinase prevents -Syn/TrkB complex formation via phosphorylation of -Syn at Y125.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Alpha-Synuclein_Decreases_TrkB_Protein_Level_via_Ubiquitination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BDNF treatment elicits TrkB receptor ubiquitination and degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the effect of -Syn on TrkB stability, we conducted a Trk immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assay with primary cortical neurons transduced with AAV overexpressing a GFP control or the -Syn transgene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Syn overexpression induced the spontaneous ubiquitination of Trk receptors, which was further enhanced with BDNF treatment (Fig S6A, Top Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrkB levels were reduced following overexpression of -Syn compared with GFP (Fig S6A, top and second panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, p-TrkB/p-Akt signals were diminished when -Syn was overexpressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further test the effect of -Syn on TrkB ubiquitination, we performed a temporal analysis of the effects of BDNF exposure in TrkB-expressing SH-SY5Y (BR6 cells) and cortical neurons (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of -Syn with its shRNA did not affect TrkB levels or p-TrkB/p-Akt signaling cascade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, TrkB protein levels were highly reduced in both BR6 and primary neurons when -Syn was overexpressed (Fig S6 B and C, second panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceivably, -synuclein decreases TrkB protein levels via enhancing its ubiquitination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DOPAL_Induces_Cell_Death_Through_Increasing_-Syn_TrkB_Association  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DA and its oxidized metabolites make the accumulated -Syn selectively toxic to dopaminergic neurons (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOPAL is a metabolic intermediate formed by the oxidative deamination of DA, mainly catalyzed by MAO-B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we examined the effects of DA and its metabolite DOPAL on TrkB/-Syn complex formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We pretreated GFP-Syntransfected BR6 cells with TH inhibitor AMPT to deplete DA, followed by MPP+ stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MPP+-elicited -Syn/TrkB complex was robustly disrupted by inhibition of DA, suggesting that DA might regulate the interaction between -Syn and TrkB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, both -Syn and MPP+-induced cell death was significantly reduced when DA was depleted (Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether DA exerts the neurotoxicity through its oxidative metabolite DOPAL, we conducted binding assay in DAergic BR6 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DOPAL increased -Syn/TrkB association, blocking p-TrkB and its downstream signaling (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next analyzed the cytotoxicity with LDH release assay and found that -Syninduced cell death was escalated by DOPAL, which in turn was inhibited by BDNF treatment, tightly fitting with p-TrkB/p-Akt signals (Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We made similar observations using DAergic neurons, in which apoptotic cells were labeled with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TUNEL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noticeably, depletion of DA with the TH inhibitor AMPT diminished -Syns neurotoxic activity, which was further decreased by BDNF (Fig S3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, DA via its oxidative metabolite DOPAL by MAO-B promotes -Syn to bind TrkB and exerts neurotoxicities in DAergic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further explore DOPALs role in these events, we used the irreversible MAO inhibitor rasagiline (specific to MAO-B) in BR6 cells transfected with GFP-Syn (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfected cells were treated with BDNF with or without MAO inhibitors and in the presence or absence of MPP+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between TrkB/-Syn was reduced in BR6 cells separately treated by BDNF or MAO inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex was completely disrupted when cells were exposed to both BDNF and rasagiline together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MPP+ treatment strongly increased the interactions between -Syn and TrkB, which was inhibited by BDNF or rasagiline alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noticeably, BDNF displayed a more potent effect than rasagiline in disrupting the -Syn/TrkB complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, when -Syn bound to TrkB, it blocked p-TrkB and its downstream signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-TrkB levels were inversely correlated with the binding activities between -Syn and TrkB (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LDH release assay supported the idea that rasagiline inhibited MPP+-induced cell death, which was further inhibited by BDNF, in alignment with the binding patterns between -Syn and TrkB (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neurons of both the central and the peripheral nervous system are critically dependent on neurotrophic signals for their survival and differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been well established that the signal must be retrogradely transported to the cell body to exert its trophic effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following receptor-mediated endocytosis, the NGF/activated TrkA signaling complexes are sorted into a subpopulation of endosomes to give rise to the signaling endosomes (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is believed that the signaling endosome serves as a retrograde vesicular carrier to maintain signal fidelity and to sustain the signaling of the BDNF/activated TrkB complex during their transit from the terminal to the soma via the axon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PD and other synucleinopathies, the axonal accumulation of -Syn into amyloid fibrils of distinct morphology, LNs, is potentially more detrimental to the neuron relative to LBs in the soma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lee and colleagues showed that addition of -Syn preformed fibrils (PFFs), generated from recombinant -Syn protein, to primary neurons seeds the recruitment of normal, endogenously expressed -Syn into pathological aggregates that, similar to LBs and LNs in synucleinopathies, are insoluble, hyperphosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and filamentous by electron microscopy (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using live-cell imaging, they reported that -Syn aggregates perturb the axonal transport of Rab7-positive and TrkB-positive endosomes, as well as autophagosomes, whereas the transport of mitochondria and synaptic vesicle precursors remains relatively unimpeded (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with our observation that axonal transport of TrkB receptors is slowed in SNCA transgenic overexpressing neurons, which aligns with the observation of impaired neurotrophic signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A number of studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are linked to neuronal degeneration in PD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Syn protein has a noncanonical mitochondrial targeting sequence at its N terminus and is indeed translocated to mitochondria in human fetal dopaminergic neuronal culture and postmortem brain tissue from healthy individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accumulation of -Syn in the mitochondria is enhanced in PD brains (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, DOPAL-stimulated binding of -Syn to TrkB inhibits its neurotrophic activities, which may account for the neurotoxicity induced by DOPAL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using the MAO-B inhibitor rasagiline to prevent DOPAL formation, we showed that induction of the -Syn/TrkB complex was suppressed (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When combined with BDNF, rasagiline completely disrupts the -Syn/TrkB complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, MPP+ robustly enhanced the association between -Syn and TrkB, which was alleviated by BDNF or rasagiline or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, MPP+-induced DAergic neuronal death was repressed by rasagiline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
