Predicting the onset of period-doubling bifurcations in noisy cardiac systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Predicting the onset of transitions in the qualitative dynamics of complex systems remains a challenging problem, with relevance in diverse fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study focuses on the development of early warning signals that can predict the onset of alternating cardiac rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treat cardiac cells with a potassium channel blocker, which induces the initiation of alternating rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these experiments, we develop a quantitative measure that can detect how far the system is from the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that it is possible to predict the onset of potentially dangerous alternating rhythms in the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biological, physical, and social systems often display qualitative changes in dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing early warning signals to predict the onset of these transitions is an important goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current work is motivated by transitions of cardiac rhythms, where the appearance of alternating features in the timing of cardiac events is often a precursor to the initiation of serious cardiac arrhythmias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treat embryonic chick cardiac cells with a potassium channel blocker, which leads to the initiation of alternating rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We associate this transition with a mathematical instability, called a period-doubling bifurcation, in a model of the cardiac cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Period-doubling bifurcations have been linked to the onset of abnormal alternating cardiac rhythms, which have been implicated in cardiac arrhythmias such as T-wave alternans and various tachycardias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theory predicts that in the neighborhood of the transition, the systems dynamics slow down, leading to noise amplification and the manifestation of oscillations in the autocorrelation function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examining the aggregates interbeat intervals, we observe the oscillations in the autocorrelation function and noise amplification preceding the bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyze plotstermed return mapsthat relate the current interbeat interval with the following interbeat interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these plots, we develop a quantitative measure using the slope of the return map to assess how close the system is to the bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the slope of the return map and the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient are equal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the slope and the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient represent quantitative measures to predict the onset of abnormal alternating cardiac rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We treated spontaneously beating aggregates of 7-d-old embryonic chick cardiac cells with 0.52.5 mol E4031, a drug that blocks the human Ether-Ã -go-go-Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ovoid-shaped aggregates, with diameters between 100 m and 300 m, beat spontaneously with intrinsic periods between 1 s and 2 s. We monitored the activity of the spontaneously beating aggregates by measuring the variation in light intensity of a pixel on the edge of each aggregate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates of the magnitude of the displacement of the aggregate as a consequence of the beat (or contraction) are on the order of 5 m, which is consistent with previous measurements (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed the beat dynamics of the aggregates by computing interbeat intervals, the time between successive beats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the beat dynamics of multiple aggregates can be tracked in parallel; Fig S1 displays an image of a representative experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Materials and Methods for a full description of the protocol used to generate the aggregates and for further details related to how we imaged the aggregates beat dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following drug treatment, the aggregates maintain their intrinsic beat frequency for roughly 1055 min before a transition in the dynamics takes place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one of the previous papers from our group based on this data set (34), Kim et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  proposedusing a spatially extended ionic model of the spontaneously beating aggregatethat diffusion of the drug within the aggregate represented a possible mechanism underlying the time dependence of the transitions in dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These transitions in qualitative dynamics lead to a spectrum of complex rhythms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we focus on 23 aggregates for which we observe and capture period-doubling bifurcations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1A displays the interbeat intervals from a representative aggregate for which a period-doubling bifurcation takes place following the treatment with 1.5 mol E4031 at t = 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spaces between the sets of interbeat intervals in Fig 1A represent the times when recording was stopped for data storage purposes (23 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four representative time series plotted in Fig 1A correspond with the dynamics in the first (trace i), fourth (trace ii), fifth (trace iii), and tenth (trace iv) sets of interbeat intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mathematics, a period-doubling bifurcation occurs when the slope at the fixed point of a 1D map passes through 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we define a period-doubling bifurcation to have taken place when the slope of a linear regression of a return map composed of a sliding window of interbeat intervals is below 0.98 for five consecutive beatssee Materials and Methods for details related to the computation of the slope from the interbeat intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the above definition, the period-doubling bifurcation takes place near the end of the fifth set of interbeat intervals at approximately t = 45 min in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (There are other methods to identify the precise timing of period-doubling bifurcations, including identifying the time at which a sliding window of values gives rise to a bimodal distribution.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the neighborhood of a period-doubling bifurcation, the system takes longer to recover to equilibrium following a perturbation (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the system reestablishes the steady-state value less rapidly (and in an oscillatory fashion) leading to negative correlation between successive beats, which we observe in Fig 1Ba zoomed-in plot of the fifth set of interbeat intervals from Fig 1A (corresponding with the time series displayed in trace iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of the aggregates we analyzed, 43 out of 104 underwent period-doubling bifurcations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2 displays raw interbeat interval data from eight aggregates for which we observe and capture period-doubling bifurcations following treatment with E4031.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See SI Text for more details related to the observations of period-doubling bifurcations in the aggregates following drug treatment.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 71 out of 104 cases, the aggregates exhibited an alternating rhythm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 19 out of 104 cases, the aggregates interbeat intervals simply decreased, establishing a stable, accelerated rhythm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 14 out of 104 cases, the aggregates dynamics did not undergo a qualitative transition in dynamics, maintaining their intrinsic beat frequency for the duration of the experiment; Fig S3 displays raw interbeat interval data from eight aggregates for which a dynamic transition did not take place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the long time course of the experiments, aggregates could undergo multiple transitions in dynamics throughout the course of a single experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S2, aggregate i, a period-doubling bifurcation takes place at roughly t = 40 min, leading to the onset of an alternating rhythm; then, at approximately t = 100 min, an additional transition takes place, leading to the establishment of a stable, accelerated rhythm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify how the statistical features of the interbeat intervals change as the system approaches the period-doubling bifurcation, we examine the systems noise and autocorrelation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2A, we plot the return maps for the first (trace i), fourth (trace ii), and fifth (trace iii) sets of interbeat intervals from Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the system approaches the period-doubling bifurcation, the variation of the interbeat intervals increases and successive interbeat intervals become negatively correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2B, we plot the histograms of the detrended interbeat intervals (see Materials and Methods for details on detrending) again for the same sets of interbeat intervals examined above in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distributions of interbeat intervals spread out, suggesting an amplification of the noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 2C, we compute the ACF for a set of detrended interbeat intervals (20 beats long) centered at the 150th beat for the same three sets of interbeat intervals we looked at above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Near the beginning of the experiment (t=0), because the system is far from the bifurcation, successive interbeat intervals are uncorrelated, so the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient is approximately equal to zero, as shown in the ACFs computed for trace i (Fig 2C, Left) and trace ii (Fig 2C, Middle) in Fig 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as the system nears the bifurcation, damped oscillations emerge in the ACF, reflecting the effect of longer recovery times following perturbations in the neighborhood of the bifurcation, as shown in Fig 2C, Right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noise amplification and oscillations in the autocorrelation represent early warning signals to anticipate the onset of period-doubling bifurcations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a previous study (31), we modeled the interbeat intervals observed in the experimental data following the treatment with E4031 using an exponential nonlinear 1D map in the absence of noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze the early warning signals, we continuously perturb an exponential nonlinear map as follows:xn+1=e((xn))++n,[1]where xn represents the nth interbeat interval and n is a random variable drawn from a normal distribution with a mean equal to zero and an SD () equal to 0.01, consistent with the fluctuations observed in the interbeat intervals when the system is far from the bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters ,,, and  govern the shape of the exponential map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simulate the experiments, we study the dynamics of the map as we decrease .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The map has a unique fixed point, which, at a critical , destabilizes, giving rise to a period-doubling bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Materials and Methods for a description of the numerical simulations and parameter values.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To derive analytic expressions for both the probability density function (PDF) and the ACF as the system approaches a period-doubling bifurcation, we approximate the dynamics of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 using a continuously perturbed linear 1D map, examining the dynamical features as the slope at the fixed point (x*= 0) approaches 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define the noisy linear map,xn+1=Axn+n,[2]where xn represents the deviation of the nth interbeat interval from the mean and n is a random variable drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and an SD () equal to 0.01, consistent with the system-level noise of the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A represents the slope of the map at the fixed point, x*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analytic expressions for the PDF and the ACF of a noisy linear map are well known (1, 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iterating the map directly leads to the following series: xn=i=0nAini, which gives the PDF as n (1, 38),fn(x;A,)=1A222exp(x2(1A2)22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]The SD of the PDF is (,A)=/1A2 and grows nonlinearly as A approaches 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S4A shows return maps for Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 for three values of A: 0.05, 0.65, and 0.95.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S4B, we superimpose the analytic expressions for the PDFs as defined by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 for the three values of A upon histograms of data generated by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2; the numerical simulations and the analytical expression are in close agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analytic expression for the ACF of a noisy linear map is also well known (39),(k)=Ak,[4]where (k) represents the ACF at lag k. For Aless_than 0, we observe damped oscillations in the ACF as a function of k. Additionally, as A approaches 1, the ACF decays to zero (no correlation) less rapidly and the oscillations in the ACF grow in amplitude, properties consistent with experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S4C, we show that the numerically computed ACF and the analytical expression for the autocorrelation, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, show close agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3A shows the return maps computed from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, the nonlinear map, for three values of : 3.0, 1.75, and 1.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the return maps displayed in Fig 2A, as  decreases, the slope through the fixed point approaches 1, leading to noise amplification and negative correlation between successive beats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 B and C show that the analytic expressions for the PDF and the ACFwhere A represents the linear slope at the fixed pointcapture the noise amplification and the oscillations in the ACF as the system approaches the period-doubling bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As stated earlier, period-doubling bifurcations in 1D maps take place when the slope through the fixed point of a control function goes through 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the slope of a linear regression of a return map composed of a sliding window of detrended interbeat intervals computed directly from the experimental data represents a quantitative measure to assess how close the system is to a period-doubling bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compute the slope measure from the interbeat intervals taken from the 23 aggregates for which we observe and capture period-doubling bifurcations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4, each slope trace is computed based on the interbeat interval trace given in the panel below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 predicts that the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient should be equal to the slope through the fixed point, A, of a 1D map: (1)=A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we plot the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient in Fig 4, showing that the slope and the lag-1 coefficient are consistent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The red hatched lines in Fig 4 represent the time at which the system undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the slope goes below 0.75 for at least five consecutive beatsthe early warning signal threshold, given by the black hatched line in Fig 4the period-doubling bifurcation takes place between 1 and 2,231 beats later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survival analysis using KaplanMeier curves performed for three values of threshold0.9, 0.75, and 0.6shows that 0.75 provides considerably more early warning than 0.9 (see Fig S5 and SI Text for a full explanation of the methods for the survival analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an early warning threshold of 0.9, half of the aggregates had gone through the threshold within 11 beats before the transition; in contrast, for a threshold of 0.75, half of the aggregates had gone through the threshold within 115 beats before the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate how the false positive rate changes as a function of the early warning signal threshold, we analyze data collected from aggregatesn = 14, totaling 17.5 h of recordingfor which a qualitative change in dynamics does not take place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the stops in the recording, we divide the data from the 14 aggregates into 155 segments (1 segment = 409.6 s), and thus consider a false positive to have taken place if the slope measure goes below the given threshold for five consecutive beats at least once in a given segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an early warning threshold of 0.75, the false positive rate is 0.02, meaning there were 3 time segments (out of 155) for which we observed a false positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, an early warning threshold of 0.75 represents a balance between maximizing the amount of early warning and minimizing the number of false positives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Fig S6 and SI Text for a full explanation of how we computed the false positive rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We simulated the period-doubling bifurcation using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 by linearly decreasing the value of  (see Materials and Methods for further details and parameter values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mimic the experiments, we applied both parametric noise to  and system-level noise as given in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 5A, we compute the slope measure, the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient, and the value of the slope at the fixed point given by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 as a function of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the experiments, all three measures approach 1 as the system nears the period-doubling bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black dashed line represents the early warning signal, and the red dashed line represents the period-doubling bifurcation, with the same criteria given abovethe early warning signal predicts the onset of the bifurcation 69 beats in advance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5B gives the values of x for the system with the corresponding values of  given below in Fig 5C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In order for early warning signals to be practically useful, they should provide quantitative information to make predictions (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the slope of a linear regression of a sliding window of detrended interbeat intervals (also equal to the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient) reaches 1, the system undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the slope and lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient represent quantitative early warning signals that can detect oncoming period-doubling bifurcations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the system nears the period-doubling bifurcation, the slope and lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient approach 1 at different rates (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for this diversity, in Fig 5, we apply system-level noise, parametric noise, and the dynamic influence of slowing down to a 1D map undergoing a period-doubling bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interactions of all these dynamic features gives rise to the complex slope and lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient trajectories as the system approaches the bifurcation, consistent with experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Period-doubling bifurcations take place in higher-dimensional models that simulate cardiac systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S7, we analyze a continuously perturbed 2D map of action potential duration in the neighborhood of a period-doubling bifurcation, and observe noise amplification and oscillations in the ACF, consistent with the early warning signals observed and presented for the continuously perturbed 1D map (1, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details related to the 2D map and the analysis of the model are provided in SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A question remains related to the origin of the noise amplification observed in the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies examining the onset of beat-to-beat alternations of the action potential duration have implicated the stochastic nature of calcium release from intracellular stores as influencing whole-cell dynamics near a period-doubling bifurcation (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, individual ion channels open and close in a stochastic manner, and channel noise may influence interbeat interval statistics (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, drug treatment leading to a reduction in the number of functional hERG potassium channels over a long time scale, consistent with what we believe occurs in these experiments, could also account for an amplification in the noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These represent but two possible mechanisms of noise amplification; understanding the mechanistic properties of this process represents a future research direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To date, the study of early warning signals has focused on the nonlinear dynamics near the onset of fold bifurcations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these bifurcations are relevant in many fields, transitions in dynamical systems can take place through a number of different bifurcations (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development and experimental validation of early warning signals for additional bifurcations remains an open research direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The experiments with the embryonic chicks were carried out in accordance with the Health and Safety regulations at McGill University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aggregates were prepared according to the method of DeHaan (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ventricles of 7-d-old White Leghorn chicken embryo hearts were dissected and dissociated into single cells by trypsinization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were added to an Erlenmeyer flask containing a culture medium gassed with 5% (vol/vol) CO2, 10% (vol/vol) O2, 85% (vol/vol) N2 (pH = 7.4), and placed on a gyratory shaker for 2448 h at 37 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments were conducted 26 h after the aggregates were plated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We optically imaged the aggregates motion, recording the light-intensity variation of a pixel on the edge of each aggregate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The edge pixel data were then processed through a band-pass filter (cutoff frequencies: 0.16.5 Hz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system used phase-contrast imaging sampled at 40 Hz and a CCD camera (NeuroCDSM; RedShirtImaging, LLC) at an 80 Ã 80 pixel spatial resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were carried out at 3537 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detrending_the_Aggregates__Interbeat_Intervals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We detrend the interbeat intervals using the detrend function in MATLAB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This function first performs a least-squares linear regression for a sliding window of interbeat intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the linear regression is subtracted from the raw values of the interbeat intervals, which leaves the deviation from the regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compute the histograms of the deviation from the mean in Fig 2B and the ACFs in Fig 2C, we use a detrended sliding window composed of 20 beats in all cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed these analyses for larger and smaller window sizes, and the increase in the SD and the oscillations in the ACF were observed robustly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Numerical_Simulations_of_the_Nonlinear_1D_Exponential_Map  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We simulate Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 with the following parameter values: =  0.804, =  1.115, and = 2.423.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3, we plot the return map, histogram, and ACF for three values of : 3.0 (Fig 3, Left), 1.75 (Fig 3, Middle), and 1.5 (Fig 3, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the return maps in Fig 3, we simulate Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 starting from a random initial condition for 5,000 values of x, and plot the return map for the last 4,000 x values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also apply normally distributed system-level noise with an SD = 0.01, consistent with the fluctuations associated with the interbeat intervals when the system is far away from the bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the histograms, we plot the deviation from the mean x value from the simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculation_of_the_Slope_Measure_and_Autocorrelation_for_the_Interbeat_Intervals_near_the_Bifurcation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first detrend the raw interbeat intervals using the method given above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the detrended data, we plot return maps based on a sliding window composed of the previous 20 beats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we compute a linear regression (least-squares) through each return map, where our slope measure, Fig 4, represents the slope of the linear regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compute the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient using the autocorr function in MATLAB with a sliding window composed of the previous 20 detrended interbeat intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculation_of_the_Slope_Measure_and_Autocorrelation_from_the_Numerical_Simulations_of_a_1D_Map_Undergoing_a_Period-Doubling_Bifurcation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We simulate Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 while linearly decreasing the value of  such that we simulate the system approaching the period-doubling bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We use the same parameter values as given in Materials and Methods describing the numerical simulations.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply system-level, normally distributed noise with an SD = 0.01, consistent with the fluctuations associated with the interbeat intervals when the system is far away from the bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We linearly decrease the value of  along the linear function 1(t)=5.010.012t for the first 300 beats and then the linear function 2(t)=20.002t for the remaining 50 beats, where t represents the beat number from the figure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply parametric, normally distributed noise with an SD equal to 0.05 to the value of , which we calculated by considering a quasi-stationary sequence of the slope measure from the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compute the slope measure and the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient with a sliding window composed of the previous 20 values of x using the same method as given in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fig S1 displays an image of a representative experiment for which the aggregates are treated with 1.7 mol E4031.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aggregates are ovoid-shaped and 100300 m in diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the main advantages of this experimental approach is that a number of experiments can be performed in parallel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the beat dynamics of 15 aggregates are tracked using the changes in light intensity of a side pixel due to the physical motion of the aggregate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S2, we present the raw interbeat interval data for eight aggregates that undergo period-doubling bifurcations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use these eight aggregates to analyze the slope measure and autocorrelation in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eight aggregates in Fig S2 are taken from four different experiments with varying E4031 concentrations (aggregate i: 1 mol; aggregates iiv: 2 mol; aggregate vi: 0.5 mol; aggregates vii and viii: 1.5 mol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are periodic stops in the recording (for 23 min) for aggregates ivi in Fig S2, and data were recorded continuously for aggregates vii and viii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing of the onset of the period-doubling bifurcations was between 10 min and 55 mins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the aggregates we analyzed, 43 out of 104 underwent period-doubling bifurcations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed and captured the period-doubling bifurcations for 23 out of 43 cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 4 out of 43 aggregates, the system transitioned from a steady, accelerated rhythm through a period-doubling bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in 16 out of 43 cases, the aggregates underwent period-doubling bifurcations, but, due to stops in the recording, we did not capture the transition according to our definition of the onset of a period-doubling bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S3, we present eight representative examples of beat dynamics from aggregates that, following the treatment of E4031, did not undergo a transition in qualitative dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These eight control aggregates are taken from two experiments (aggregates ivii: 0.5 mol; aggregate viii: 2 mol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fig_S4__Analysis_of_a_Continuously_Perturbed_Linear_Map  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain mathematical insight into the behavior of the nonlinear 1D map (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) in the neighborhood of a period-doubling bifurcation, we analyze a continuously perturbed linear map (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) as the slope at the fixed point (x*= 0) approaches 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the paper, we derive analytic expressions for the PDF and the ACF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the analytic expressions for the PDF and the ACF are consistent with numerical simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulate the linear map for 5,000 values of x applying normally distributed noise with an SD of = 0.01 for three values of A, the slope at the fixed point: 0.05 (Fig S4, Left), 0.65 (Fig S4, Middle), and 0.95 (Fig S4, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S4A, we plot the return maps from the last 4,001 x values, showing that as A approaches 1, the variation of the system increases and successive values of x become increasingly negatively correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S4B, we plot the histograms of the deviation from the mean for the last 4,000 values of x for the three values of A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also compute the analytic expression for the PDF (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), which is in close agreement with the numerically generated data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, in Fig S4C, we show that the numerically generated ACFsgenerated using the last 4,000 values of x and the autocorr function in MATLABand the analytic expressions for the ACFs (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4) for the three values of A are consistent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fig_S5__Prediction_Quality_Depends_on_Early_Warning_Signal_Threshold  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify how the amount of early warning changes as a function of threshold for the 23 aggregates for which we observe and capture period-doubling bifurcations, we perform a survival analysis using KaplanMeier plots where we compute estimates of the fraction of aggregates that had not gone through the period-doubling bifurcation as a function of beats before the onset of the transition (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could only compute estimates of the number of beats before (amount of early warning) due to stops in the recording for 15 of the aggregates included in this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We added 50 beats to the number of beats before if the slope measure goes through the threshold before a stop in the recording, consistent with the duration of the stop in the recording.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S5, we observed that the thresholds 0.75 and 0.6 provide much more early warning than 0.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the threshold equal to 0.9, half of the aggregates had gone through the early warning threshold within 11 beats before the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for thresholds equal to 0.75 and 0.6, half of the aggregates had gone through the early warning threshold within 115 and 195 beats, respectively, before the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We evaluated predictor quality by assessing how the rate of false positives changes as a function of early warning signal threshold from data collected from aggregates for which a transition in dynamics does not take place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using beat dynamics data from 14 aggregatestotalling 17.5 h of control datawe computed the slope measure, and examined how the false positive rate changed as a function of threshold in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the stops in the recording, data from aggregates are divided into a number of individual segments; in particular, each segment is 409.6 sroughly 7 minin duration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data from the 14 aggregates were composed of 155 segments in total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We considered a false positive to have taken place if the slope measure went below the given threshold for five or more consecutive beats at least once in a given segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if there was exactly one false positive observed in each time segment (out of 155), then the false positive rate would be equal to 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S6, the false positive rate appears to have a sigmoidal shape as a function of threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the threshold value equal to 0.75given by the red hatched line in Fig S6the false positive is 0.02.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, for an early warning signal threshold of 0.75, there are three time segments (out of 155) for which a false positive took place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Recent studies have demonstrated that coupling the action potential duration to a memory variablea variable representing intracellular calcium transients, for exampleprovides a more accurate representation of period-doubling bifurcations observed in cardiac systems (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether noise amplification and oscillations in the ACF emerge in the neighborhood of period-doubling bifurcations in higher-dimensional models, we consider the following continuously perturbed 2D map of the action potential duration in response to periodic stimulation taken from (46, 47):An+1=(1Mn+1)G(Dn)+n1[S1]Mn+1=[1(1Mn)eAn/2]eDn/2+n2[S2]whereG(Dn)=A1+E1+e(DnC)/D[S3]andDn=BAn[S4]where A is the action potential duration, M is the memory variable, and A1 = 88 ms, E = 122 ms, C = 40 ms, D = 28 ms, 2=180 ms, and  = 0.2; 1 and 2 are random variables drawn from normal distributions, and  represents the SD of both random variables, which we set to 0.01 (consistent with the analyses performed on maps throughout the paper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the deterministic system, the system undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation leading to an alternation in the action potential duration as B goes through 200 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S7, we examine how the systems noise and autocorrelation change as B approaches the period-doubling bifurcation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig S7A, we plot A for 200 time stepsthese values were taken following 1,200 iterations to account for transientsfor three values of B: 300 (Fig S7A, Left), 215 (Fig S7A, Middle), and 202 (Fig S7A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze how the systems noise changes in the neighborhood of the period-doubling bifurcation, we plotted histograms of the deviation of A values from the mean (n = 801 values of A) from the corresponding simulations for the three values of B (Fig S7B), showing that, as the system approaches the bifurcation, the noise increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, in Fig S7C, we plot the ACF, generated numerically using the last 801 values of A using the autocorr function in MATLAB, and show that oscillations emerge in the ACF of the system as the bifurcation is approached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, because the dynamics of the 2D map become enslaved to the eigenvalue that is approaching 1 near the period-doubling bifurcation (the slow mode), noise amplification and oscillations in the ACF represent early warning signals for period-doubling bifurcations in higher-dimensional maps as well as 1D maps (as demonstrated in the theoretical analysis given in the paper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
