Development of functional ectopic compound eyes in scarabaeid beetles by knockdown of orthodenticle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From both evolutionary and biomedical perspectives, ectopic organ development is a promising paradigm to investigate the emergence and integration of novel complex structures outside their normal biological context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the best known examples of ectopic organ induction require genetic techniques only available for a few model systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the ectopic induction of complex and functional organs, compound eyes, by down-regulation of a single transcription factor through RNAi, a technique known to work well across a broad taxonomic range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide a remarkable example of the ability of developmental systems to channel massive perturbations toward orderly and functional outcomes and open the use of ectopic eyes as an accessible paradigm of ectopic organ development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Complex traits like limbs, brains, or eyes form through coordinated integration of diverse cell fates across developmental space and time, yet understanding how complexity and integration emerge from uniform, undifferentiated precursor tissues remains limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use ectopic eye formation as a paradigm to investigate the emergence and integration of novel complex structures following massive ontogenetic perturbation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that down-regulation via RNAi of a single head patterning geneorthodenticleinduces ectopic structures externally resembling compound eyes at the middorsal adult head of both basal and derived scarabaeid beetle species (Onthophagini and Oniticellini).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scanning electron microscopy documents ommatidial organization of these induced structures, while immunohistochemistry reveals the presence of rudimentary ommatidial lenses, crystalline cones, and associated neural-like tissue within them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, RNA-sequencing experiments show that after orthodenticle down-regulation, the transcriptional signature of the middorsal headthe location of ectopic eye inductionconverges onto that of regular compound eyes, including up-regulation of several retina-specific genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a light-aversion behavioral assay to assess functionality reveals that ectopic compound eyes can rescue the ability to respond to visual stimuli when wild-type eyes are surgically removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined, our results show that knockdown of a single gene is sufficient for the middorsal head to acquire the competence to ectopically generate a functional compound eye-like structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings highlight the buffering capacity of developmental systems, allowing massive genetic perturbations to be channeled toward orderly and functional developmental outcomes, and render ectopic eye formation a widely accessible paradigm to study the evolution of complex systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Orthodenticle_Down-Regulation_Induces_Ectopic_Structures_Externally_Resembling_Compound_Eyes_in_Onthophagini_and_Oniticellini  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first assessed whether the induction of ectopic compound eyes via down-regulation of orthodenticle may be restricted to the closely related Onthophagus species O. taurus and O. sagittarius or alternatively constitute a more taxonomically widespread phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we cloned orthodenticle orthologs in three additional scarabaeid species (Onthophagus binodis and Digitonthophagus gazella, tribe Onthophagini; and Liatongus militaris, tribe Oniticellini; Fig 1A and Dataset S1), followed by larval otd1RNAi in all species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  otd1RNAi reduced the size of the metasternal plate and pronotal ornaments, caused head midline defects, eliminated or greatly reduced horns and ornaments located along the posterodorsal head, and induced small ectopic horns in the same area in both tribes (Fig 1B and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in all species, we observed formation of ectopic compound eyes at the posterodorsal head (8/20 in O. binodis; 52/74 in D. gazella; 7/92 in L. militaris), which first became evident by the midpupal stage as paired pigmented spots flanking the posterodorsal head midline (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We replicated these results in O. sagittarius (51/139) and O. taurus (where ectopic compound eyes only develop when both Ot-otd1 and Ot-otd2 are knocked down: 5/48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data thus show that the ability to develop ectopic compound eyes through larval otd1 down-regulation is not idiosyncratic to the genus Onthophagus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SEM_Imaging_and_Immunohistochemistry_Reveal_Striking_Parallels_Between_Ectopic_Compound_Eyes_and_Wild-Type_Eye_Morphology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used scanning electron microscopy to image adult ectopic compound eyes and assess their external morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all species, we observed putative ommatidial lenses organized in hexagonal arrays reminiscent of those found in regular lateral compound eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though ectopic compound eyes varied widely in their external expression within and between species (the largest and most complex being found in O. sagittarius), ommatidia-like structures were evident in each case (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using cryosectioning and immunohistochemical staining, we found that compound eye-like external features of ectopic compound eyes were underlain by corresponding internal features, specifically crystalline cones surrounded by putative photoreceptor and accessory cells, albeit arrayed more irregularly (Fig 2 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, some of the sections showed organized neural-like tissue extending from ectopic eyes onto a deeper flask-shaped structure of nonmuscular identity (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, analysis of external and internal morphology supports that ectopic compound eyes share structurally defining traits with regular compound eyes, despite being smaller in size and more irregular in organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Transcriptional_Signature_of_the_Middorsal_Head_Converges_onto_That_of_Regular_Compound_Eyes_Following_Orthodenticle_Down-Regulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although ectopic compound eyes thus appear morphologically similar to compound eyes, their ability to also function alike would critically depend upon the coordinated ectopic expression of the retinal and photoreceptor gene networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we tested whether ectopic compound eyes are transcriptionally closer to regular compound eyes than to the posteromedial head of control animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), we characterized and contrasted the transcriptional repertoire of the posteromedial head (PMH) and wild-type compound eye (EYE) tissues of both control and Dg-otd1RNAi 4-d-old pupae of D. gazella (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose D. gazella due to higher penetrance of the ectopic eye phenotype; furthermore, since ectopic compound eyes in this species appear smaller and simpler than in O. sagittarius, we considered it a conservative choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results showed that the transcriptional profile of EYE tissue for both treatments differs strongly from that of the control PMH tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, three out of four replicates of the Dg-otd1RNAi PMH samples (all of which developed ectopic eyes) clustered more closely with the EYE samples than with control PMH samples (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a Gene Ontology analysis showed significant enrichment for visual, photoreception, signal transduction, and rhabdomere categories of differentially expressed genes in otd1-PMH samples relative to ctrl-PMH samples (Datasets S2S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these genes, including orthologs of ninac, arrestin, chaoptin, and slowpoke-binding protein, were also differentially up-regulated in ctrl-EYE relative to ctrl-PMH samples (Fig 3C, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data show that ectopic compound eyes exhibit a transcriptional profile similar to that of wild-type compound eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ectopic_Compound_Eyes_Partially_Rescue_Visual_Function_in_Blinded_Beetles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combined, our data reveal significant morphological, cellular, neuroanatomical, and transcriptional congruence between ectopic compound eyes induced after otd1 knockdown and wild-type lateral compound eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether ectopic compound eyes are sufficiently complex to support functional integration with the rest of the organism, we assessed whether they could rescue visually cued behavioral responses in individuals deprived of regular compound eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed a behavioral assay where an individual beetle is placed inside a dish in a dark room and allowed to walk; a cold, bright, flickering light is then shone in front of the beetle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild-type individuals (BI) react without exception by stopping, lowering their heads, turning around, and quickly moving away from the light source (11/11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By ablating wild-type larval head tissue fated to form compound eyes (14), we generated eyeless beetles (B+I) that invariably failed to show any reaction to light (0/15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then repeated the ablation in otd1RNAi individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that most individuals possessing ectopic compound eyes but lacking regular lateral compound eyes (B+I+) eventually reacted to the light stimulus by either lowering their head or turning around or a combination thereof (11/12) (Table S1 and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that, despite the impact of the eye ablation treatment on overall vigor, ectopic compound eyes can at least partially rescue the behavioral response to light in an otherwise eyeless beetle (P less_than 0.01) and are thus functionally integrated with the central nervous system of the insect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ectopic_Eye_Formation_Provides_a_Useful_and_Widely_Accessible_Paradigm_to_Study_the_Ontogeny_and_Evolution_of_Complex_Systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Targeted overexpression of eyeless/Pax6 is known to induce development of ectopic eye-like structures in fruit flies and frogs, but evidence of full functional integration of ectopic eyes is lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, our results show that in scarabaeid beetles, RNAi-induced depletion of orthodenticle/OTX homologs results in development of functional ectopic compound eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such our results document the formation of a highly complex and functional organ in a novel location following the down-regulation of a single gene, thereby highlighting the flexibility and modularity of developmental systems to generate complex, well-integrated structures even when confronted with major regulatory perturbations and outside their conventional anatomical context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regulatory mechanisms leading to ectopic compound eye development in beetles remain to be fully investigated, but comparing our RNA-seq dataset to corresponding information on the fly retinal gene network, we find that while the sign of some interactions is conserved, others have reversed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in both Drosophila and Onthophagus, loss of orthodenticle results in increased wingless expression (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, loss of otd expression leads to the loss of hedgehog expression in flies (15) yet to its up-regulation in otd1RNAi beetles (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since hedgehog is required to induce neurogenesis and synapse formation between brain and photoreceptor neurites (16), we speculate that differences between the fly and beetle retinal networks might explain why fly ectopic eyes do not reach functional integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further difference between flies and beetles is that the latter lack ocelli, except for a subset of species in 8 out of 200 beetle families currently recognized (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ocelli are optical sensory structures simpler than compound eyes yet controlled, at least as far as is known in flies, by the same developmental gene network (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since ocelli are believed to be part of the basal insect ground plan and thus assumed to have been lost in beetles (12), it is conceivable that ectopic eye development seen after otd1RNAi in this group is mediated by activation of a vestigial and incomplete ocellar-fate program that eventually defaults into a compound eye fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how a vestigial and incomplete developmental program can ultimately yield a complete and functional developmental product as complex as a compound eye remains entirely unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A wider taxonomic sampling is clearly needed to determine whether lack of ocelli correlates with the propensity to form dorsal ectopic eyes and which retinal network (beetle or fly) more closely reflects the ancestral arthropod arrangement; fortunately, while targeted gene overexpression techniques are currently limited to a few model systems, RNAi-mediated gene down-regulation works remarkably well in a wide variety of arthropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our work opens the possibility of exploring the taxonomic breadth and conservation of ectopic compound eye development induced by orthodenticle knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More generally, our results show that down-regulation of transcription factors that govern the development of entire body regions does not have to result solely in the morphological disruption of their corresponding domains but may also provide opportunities for developmental systems to settle into alternate stable states including, in at least this case, the formation of a complex and functionally integrated trait in a novel location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings thus provide a remarkable example of the buffering capacity of developmental systems, allowing massive genetic perturbations to be channeled toward orderly and functional developmental outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, developmental buffering and guiding toward functional integration as seen here may constitute key factors in promoting both evolutionary as well as technological innovation: On one hand, these developmental features are likely key facilitators of heterotopy, a widespread yet understudied phenomenon whereby the development of an organ or tissue is shifted to a new spatial location (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the modular, reciprocally self-constructing nature of developmental processes is instrumental to the biomedical goal of growing ex situ organoids for research and transplantation (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether used in basic or applied research, our findings render ectopic eye formation a widely accessible paradigm to study the mechanistic basis of the developmental flexibility that enables the evolution and reconstruction of complex systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beetle_Husbandry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beetles were obtained from cow pastures around Bloomington, Indiana; Chapel Hill, North Carolina; and Busselton, Australia (O. taurus); Imbil, Australia (O. sagittarius); Kualoa, Hawaii (O. sagittarius, D. gazella, L. militaris); and Waimea, Hawaii (O. binodis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental animals were generated and maintained as described elsewhere (8, 20) either at 24 °C (O. taurus, O. binodis) or at 28 °C (O. sagittarius, D. gazella, L. militaris).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Orthodenticle_Cloning__Sequencing__and_Phylogenetic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ot-otd1, Ot-otd2, Os-otd1, and Os-otd2 sequences were retrieved and cloned as previously described from genomic and transcriptomic databases (8, 21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fragment of Ob-otd1 was partially cloned using degenerate PCR from cDNA; a fragment of Ob-otd2 was amplified and sequenced from genomic DNA using cross-specific primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dg-otd1, Dg-otd2, and Lm-otd1 sequences were retrieved from transcriptomes assembled de novo from RNA-seq data (Transcriptome Assembly and Annotation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and phylogenetic analyses were made using Geneious 8.1 (23); the MSA was generated using the Translation align tool and the MAFFT method (24), and a gene tree was inferred using RAxML 7.2.8 (25) with the GTR-GAMMA model and default settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

otd1_RNAi  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Targeted gene knockdown was achieved by injection of double-stranded RNA derived from a fragment of each target gene, as detailed previously (8, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Template DNA containing 500-bp orthologous fragments of otd was amplified by PCR from either cloned plasmids (Ot-otd1, Ot-otd2, Os-otd1, Ob-otd1, Dg-otd1) or from cDNA using species-specific primers flanked by T3 and T7 binding sequences (Lm-otd1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The templates were transcribed in vitro using T3 and T7 RNA-polymerases to generate forward and reverse RNA strands using MEGAscript T7 and T3 Kits (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After DNase I treatment, ssRNA was precipitated by lithium chloride or sodium acetate, incubated at 20 °C for 1 h, spun at 4 °C for 20 min, washed with 80% ethanol, and resuspended in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After quantification, forward and reverse strands were mixed at a 1:1 ratio by weight and annealed by heating to 80 °C and then cooling slowly over 5 h to 35 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of the annealed RNA was measured, confirmed by gel electrophoresis, and stored at 80 °C until injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injections into larvae were carried out as described previously (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Doses varying from 0.1 to 5.0 g of dsRNA were diluted in injection buffer (5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaPO4, pH 6.9) to a total of 3 L and injected into larvae during the third instar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We injected a total of 334 O. taurus (Ot-otd1, 251; Ot-otd1+otd2, 83), 312 O. sagittarius, 25 O. binodis, 91 D. gazella, and 138 L. militaris.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotype scoring is reported as number of dsRNA-injected beetles with ectopic eyes/total number of dsRNA-injected beetles that became pupae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sham control injections were made exactly as described above, except that larvae were injected with 1 g nonsense dsRNA from a 167-bp PCR product derived from a pBluescript SK vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcription reactions, DNase I treatment, transcript annealing, and injections were performed as described above (160 O. taurus, 37 O. sagittarius, 23 O. binodis, 47 D. gazella, 60 L. militaris).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Scanning_Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At least three adult individuals of each species and treatment were fixed in 70% ethanol, then incubated in 100% ethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were either critical-point CO2 dehydrated or immersed in hexamethyldisilazane and air-dried, coated with gold-iridium in an argon chamber, and imaged on either a JEOL JSM 5800 LV scanning electron microscope, or on a FEI Quanta 600, at 15 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sectioning__Immunohistochemistry__and_Confocal_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individuals at mid- to late pupal stage were cut between thorax and abdomen and fixed in PEM buffer (27) and then dehydrated by immersion in 100% methanol overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were rehydrated in a decreasing methanol:PBS series and then moved through an increasing sucrose:PBS series until reaching 30% wt/vol sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were kept in sucrose over 12 d and then moved to OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek) and mounted on an aluminum stub at 20 °C inside a Reichert-Jung Cryocut 1800 cryostat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were sliced to obtain sections between 18 and 25 m thick, collected on glass slides, air-dried, and stored at 20 °C until used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For staining, samples were rehydrated in PBS and incubated in anti-acetylated -tubulin antibodies, phalloidin, and DAPI as detailed elsewhere (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stained samples were imaged under a Leica SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope using LAS software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Extraction_and_Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole animals were homogenized in TRIzol using disposable polypropylene RNase-free pellet pestles: For D. gazella, we used three individuals of each sex and late last larval instar, prepupa, first day pupa, and 4-d-old adult stages; for L. militaris, we only sampled a male prepupa and first day pupa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chloroform was added to the homogenates in 1:5 volumes ratio, thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 2 min, and then spun at 13,600 × g. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and incubated at room temperature with an equal volume of isopropanol for 20 min; RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,600 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, washed with 100% ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in RNase-free water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was quality checked using RNA ScreenTape TapeStation System (Agilent) and quantified with a Quant-iT RiboGreen Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA Stranded RNA-seq libraries were constructed using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Libraries were quantified using a Quant-iT DNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher), pooled in equal molar amounts, and single-end sequenced on the NextSeq500 platform (Illumina) using a 75-cycle High Output Kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resulting 75-bp read sequences were cleaned using Trimmomatic version 0.32 (29) to remove adapter sequences and perform quality trimming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trimmomatic was run with the following parameters: 2:20:5 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transcriptome_Assembly_and_Annotation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reference transcriptomes for D. gazella and L. militaris were assembled from 75SE reads using Trinity 2.0.6 (30) using trimmomaticSS_lib_type R parameters on a single 16 CPU node with 128 GB of RAM at the Mason computer cluster at Indiana University, Bloomington.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Candidate coding sequences were predicted using Transdecoder 2.0.1 (transdecoder.github.io/), and the assemblies were annotated using the Trinotate pipeline (31) (https://trinotate.github.io/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The annotations were made based on Blast+ (32) searches against the UniProt database and current O. taurus genome annotations (21), HMMER (33) scans against the Pfam database (34), and predictions for signal peptides (35) and transmembrane domains (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differential_Gene_Expression_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare the transcriptional profile of ectopic eyes to that of control posteromedial head epithelium and regular compound eyes, we dissected both tissues from control and Dg-otd1 dsRNA-injected females of D. gazella (Fig 3A), and extracted total RNA following a previously described protocol (20), except that RNA was extracted directly out of the TRIzol reagent using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Plus spin columns (R2072; Zymo Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was processed using a TruSeq kit and sequenced on a NextSeq500 platform, as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sequenced four biological replicates of each tissue and treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting 75 bp single end reads were cleaned using Trimmomatic version 0.32 (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Read alignment to the D. gazella reference transcriptome and transcript abundance estimation was performed using the align_and_estimate_abundance.pl and abundance_estimates_to_matrix.pl perl scripts included in Trinity r20140717 (30), using Bowtie2 (37) as alignment method and RSEM (38) as abundance estimation method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential expression analysis was performed by the DESeq2 (39) method (that uses a negative binomial model to perform pairwise Wald tests, adjusting for multiple testing using the BenjaminiHochberg method) using Trinity v2.4.0s run_DE_analysis.pl and analyze_diff_expr.pl scripts, including GO enrichment analysis by using theexamine_GO_enrichment parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The default P value cutoff for FDR of 0.001 was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tables of differentially expressed genes for each contrast were merged with the transcriptome annotation table described above using customized R (40) scripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cluster and correlation analyses were run on a log2-transformed matrix with an added pseudo count of one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A correlation matrix was computed with the Pearson method using Rs cor function, an Euclidean distance matrix was computed with the dist function, and hierarchical sample clustering was performed with the hclust function using the complete linkage method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sample-to-sample correlation heatmap and dendrogram was generated using the heatmap.3 function bundled with Trinity v2.4.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scripts and data are available as Datasets S2S11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Testing_of_Ectopic_Eyes_Functionality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Testing of the ability of regular compound eyes and ectopic eyes to trigger a behavioral response took advantage of the aversive conduct toward sudden, strong light, shown by tunneling dung beetles when they are in a tunnel-like environment (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assays were conducted in a dark room and used a standard Petri dish (5.2 cm diameter) as arena to allow beetles to turn around and a cold-light dual gooseneck illuminator as light source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light was blocked using a piece of folded tinfoil placed over the light output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To perform the test, a beetle was introduced into the Petri dish and allowed to acclimate for up to 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the tinfoil plate located in front of the light source was carefully removed, followed by repeated blocking and unblocking of the light beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This generated a strong, strobing light beam directed toward the beetles head.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild-type beetles (BI; see Table S1 and Movie S1) react strongly to such exposure by stopping, lowering their head a few times, and quickly turning around and moving away from the light source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assessed the presence of a phototactic response by scoring whether beetles exhibited one or more of these behaviors: (i) slowing down (if in motion), (ii) stopping (if in motion), (iii) lowering of the head, and (iv) turning around and moving away from the light source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated individuals without lateral compound eyes (B+I) by ablating eye precursor tissues at the late larval stage (14) and individuals without lateral compound eyes but possessing ectopic eyes by replicating ablations in Dg-otd1RNAi larvae (B+I+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light aversion test was performed on 11 BI, 15 B+I, and 12 B+I+ individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All four diagnostic behaviors (slowing down, stopping, head lowering, and moving away from the light source) were always exhibited in concert by wild-type animals and were entirely absent in B+I individuals, whereas B+I+ individuals exhibited a mix of responses (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Percentages of BI, B+I, and B+I+ individuals reacting to light were compared with z tests for the comparison of sampling proportions and HolmBonferroni correction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
