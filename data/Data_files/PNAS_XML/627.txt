Cas9-mediated genome editing in the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Methanogenic archaea play a central role in the global carbon cycle, with profound implications for climate change, yet our knowledge regarding the biology of these important organisms leaves much to be desired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key bottleneck that hinders the study of methanogenic archaea, especially those within the genus Methanosarcina, results from the time-consuming and often cumbersome tools that are currently available for genetic analysis of these microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cas9-mediated genome-editing approach for Methanosarcina acetivorans described in this study addresses this major constraint by streamlining the mutagenic process and enabling simultaneous introduction of multiple mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work also sheds light on the distinct properties of homology-dependent repair and nonhomologous end-joining machinery in Archaea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although Cas9-mediated genome editing has proven to be a powerful genetic tool in eukaryotes, its application in Bacteria has been limited because of inefficient targeting or repair; and its application to Archaea has yet to be reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the development of a Cas9-mediated genome-editing tool that allows facile genetic manipulation of the slow-growing methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introduction of both insertions and deletions by homology-directed repair was remarkably efficient and precise, occurring at a frequency of approximately 20% relative to the transformation efficiency, with the desired mutation being found in essentially all transformants examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Off-target activity was not observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that multiple single-guide RNAs could be expressed in the same transcript, reducing the size of mutagenic plasmids and simultaneously simplifying their design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cas9-mediated genome editing reduces the time needed to construct mutants by more than half (3 vs. 8 wk) and allows simultaneous construction of double mutants with high efficiency, exponentially decreasing the time needed for complex strain constructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, coexpression the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery from the closely related archaeon, Methanocella paludicola, allowed efficient Cas9-mediated genome editing without the need for a repair template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NHEJ-dependent mutations included deletions ranging from 75 to 2.7 kb in length, most of which appear to have occurred at regions of naturally occurring microhomology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of homology-directed repair-dependent and NHEJ-dependent genome-editing tools comprises a powerful genetic system that enables facile insertion and deletion of genes, rational modification of gene expression, and testing of gene essentiality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

An overview of Cas9-mediated genome editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterologous expression of Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (gray) and a chimeric sgRNA, containing a 80-bp scaffold sequence to facilitate Cas9 binding (in pink) and a 20-bp spacer identical to a region on the host chromosome (in blue) flanked by a 3 NGG PAM (in yellow) generates a DSB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Archaea, HDR (in orange) is the prevalent mechanism for DSB repair and can be leveraged for genome editing by providing appropriate repair templates for targeted insertions, deletions, or allelic replacements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Development_of_a_Cas9-Dependent_Genome-Editing_System_for_Methanosarcina_acetivorans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the appropriate components for genome editing from S. pyogenes are functional in M. acetivorans, we constructed a Methanosarcina/Escherichia coli shuttle vector that expresses the S. pyogenes Cas9 ORF from a tetracycline inducible Methanosarcina promoter (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also constructed a derivative of this plasmid that employs a methanol-inducible promoter to express an sgRNA that targets Cas9 to ssuC, a gene required for uptake of the methanogenesis inhibitor bromoethane sulfonic acid (BES) (18) (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. acetivorans was readily transformed with the Cas9-only plasmid pDN206 (78,900 ± 9,940 PurR transformants); however, pDN208, which contains the ssuC-targeting sgRNA in addition to Cas9, produced only 4 ± 3 PurR transformants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in plating efficiency of more than four orders-of-magnitude strongly suggests that Cas9 is not toxic by itself, but that the Cas9sgRNA complex from S. pyogenes is capable of generating a lethal DSB in M. acetivorans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained with and without the inducers methanol and tetracycline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we determined the ability of the native HDR machinery in M. acetivorans to repair the lethal DSB generated by the sgRNACas9 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, repair templates of varying size were added to the ssuC-targeting vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These repair templates generate a 34-bp deletion/frameshift mutation within ssuC that removes the targeting site while simultaneously introducing a diagnostic NotI restriction endonuclease site (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of repair templates with 1-kb homology arms to the plasmids relieved the lethal effect of targeting Cas9 to ssuC, generating nearly 20,000 PurR transformants per 2 g DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar plasmid with 0.5-kbp homology arms generated roughly half as many transformants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, the 103-fold higher transformation efficiency for pDN211 relative to pDN208 indicated that 99.9% of the PurR transformants are likely to be mutants (i.e., only 1 of every 1,000 PurR transformants would still contain the WT locus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate this hypothesis, 20 of these transformants were genotyped by a performing a NotI digest of a PCR amplicon containing the edited ssuC locus: all tested positive for the introduced mutation (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as expected for null mutations in the ssu locus, all 20 transformants were resistant to 0.4 mM BES, a concentration lethal to the parent strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome editing was also observed when plasmids were integrated into the chromosome using a C31 integrase system (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The initial gene-edited strains produced in these experiments retain the targeting machinery; thus, we constructed plasmid derivatives that include a counter selectable marker (hpt) to facilitate curing of gene-editing vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This marker confers sensitivity to the purine analog 8-aza-2,6-diaminopurine (8ADP) in strains that lack the native hpt gene (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the plasmid curing system, which has not previously been attempted in Methanosarcina, we selected 8ADPR clones from three independent PurR transformants constructed using the counter selectable vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All 8ADPR isolates analyzed were PurS and also contain the frameshift mutation at the ssuC locus (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR-based screening with plasmid-specific primers showed that the vector was indeed cured from these strains (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proof-of-principle experiments show that a Cas9-mediated genome editing technique can be used to effectively introduce unmarked mutations in M. acetivorans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Optimization_of_the_Cas9-Dependent_Genome-Editing_Technique_in_M_acetivorans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the optimal expression levels for the genome-editing machinery, we varied the transcription of Cas9 by selecting transformants on media with increasing concentrations of tetracycline, and of the sgRNA by plating on media with either methanol (induced) or trimethylamine (TMA; repressed) as growth substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, no significant difference in genome-editing efficiency was observed (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the basal level of transcription provided by the two promoters in the absence of the inducers was sufficient for effective editing (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A control vector identical to pDN211 but lacking the sgRNA (pDN207) was used to estimate the efficiency of genome editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency of genome editing was measured as the ratio of mutant recovery (i.e., plating efficiency of pDN211) relative to the plating efficiency of the control vector and was estimated on media with either methanol or TMA as growth substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, genome editing in these experiments was particularly efficient, with edited strains being obtained at frequencies of approximately 2025% relative to the control (i.e., one in four cells that receive the plasmid undergo gene conversion) (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the maximum size of deletions that can be reliably generated by a single sgRNA, we tested repair templates with 1-kb homology arms placed at varying distance from the sgRNA-directed DSB (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transformation efficiency remained steady for templates that are 250 bp away from each end of the DSB, but declined precipitously when the distance increased beyond this point (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a single sgRNA can be reliably used to delete up to 0.5 kbp of the chromosome, although larger deletions (up to 1 kbp) can be produced at the expense of efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiplex_Expression_of_sgRNAs_in_M_acetivorans_Enables_Simultaneous_Introduction_of_Multiple_Mutations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore the possibility of using multiple Cas9-mediated DSBs to create larger deletions, or to simultaneously introduce more than one mutation, we tested two alternate arrangements for the expression of multiple sgRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first arrangement, sgRNAs were expressed individually, whereas in the second they were expressed as a single transcript separated by a 30-bp linker sequence (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmids with sgRNAs in either arrangement were equally efficient in generating strains with complete deletions (approximately 2 kbp) of the mtmCB1 and mtmCB2 loci, which are highly homologous genes encoding monomethylamine methyltransferase isozymes (Fig 3B and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to reduce the size of mutagenic plasmids and simultaneously simplify their design, the placement of sgRNAs on a single transcript was preferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we generated a plasmid containing all four sgRNAs and each of the corresponding repair templates to simultaneously delete mtmCB1 and mtmCB2 (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, transformants that simultaneously acquired both the mtmCB1 and mtmCB2 mutation were obtained at the same frequency as transformants that acquired only one of two mutations (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the genomes of two random, independent isolates each for the mtmCB1, mtmCB2, and mtmCB1mtmCB2 mutants were completely sequenced and no off-target activity was detected (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is especially notable given the high levels of homology between the sgRNA target sites in the two genes (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, Cas9-mediated genome editing is remarkably precise in M. acetivorans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Insertion_of_Large_DNA_Segments_via_Cas9-Dependent_Genome_Editing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the efficacy of gene knockins, plasmids designed to insert either a 3.05-kbp fragment containing the mtmCB1 locus or a 2.53-kbp fragment containing the mtmCB2 locus were constructed and used to introduce WT copies of each gene into the ssuC gene of the mtmCB1mtmCB2 double mutant (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although 2060% fewer transformants were observed (relative to the simple 34-bp deletion mutation described above), all transformants screened contain the desired gene insertions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Cas9-Dependent_Genetic_Screen_to_Test_for_Gene_Essentiality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two methods have previously been used to test gene essentiality in Methanosarcina (17, 20); however, both approaches are laborious and time-consuming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore sought to use the efficient repair of the DSB generated by the Cas9sgRNA complex to assay gene essentiality in M. acetivorans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For nonessential genes (ssuC, mtmCB1, mtmCB2), 103- to 104-fold more transformants are consistently observed when a repair template to generate a deletion is provided in addition to the sgRNACas9 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected that this would not be true for essential genes, because HDR-directed repair using a deletion cassette would also be lethal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this idea, we constructed plasmids, with and without a repair template, that target the previously established essential genes mcrA and hdrED (17, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the results with the nonessential ssuC, mtmCB1 and mtmCB2 loci, where we obtained thousands of transformants in the presence of a repair template, plasmids that targeted the essential genes generated fewer than five transformants, regardless of whether a repair template is present (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the ratio of transformants obtained in the presence versus absence of a repair template can be used as a reliable and simple test for gene essentiality in M. acetivorans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Heterologous_Expression_of_NHEJ_Genes_Leads_to_Template-Independent_Repair_in_M_acetivorans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A lethal phenotype for plasmids expressing a Cas9sgRNA complex in the absence of a repair template was uniformly observed across a wide range of sgRNAs tested in this study, suggesting that NHEJ does not occur in M. acetivorans (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with the absence of genes related to Ku and LigD in the completely sequenced genome (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, in some circumstances HDR-independent gene editing would be very useful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we examined whether NHEJ could be established in Methanosarcina for use in conjunction with the Cas9sgRNA complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we chose the NHEJ machinery from the closely related methanogen M. paludicola, which has previously been reconstituted in vitro (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An artificial operon encoding four M. paludicola NHEJ proteins [DNA ligase (Lig), polymerase (Pol), phosphoesterase (PE), and Ku] was synthesized and transcriptionally fused to the moderately expressed serC promoter (25) to allow transcription in M. acetivorans (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cassette was then added to the Cas9 ssuC-targeting vector without a repair template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transformation with this plasmid was approximately 100-fold less efficient than the corresponding HDR vector, but approximately 10-fold higher than with plasmids lacking the NHEJ system (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, expression of the M. paludicola NHEJ machinery overcame the lethal effect of the Cas9 ssuC-targeting vector without a repair template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular analysis of the ssuC locus in these transformants revealed deletions ranging from 75 bp to 2.7 kb in length, often occurring at naturally occurring regions of microhomology 611 bp in length (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the combined Cas9/NHEJ system provides the opportunity to generate a variety of mutations surrounding a single target site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these plasmids are much simpler to construct, requiring only addition of target-specific sgRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested whether addition of two sgRNAs targeting DNA sequences approximately 450 bp apart in conjunction with NHEJ could be used to generate precise deletions without a repair template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, attempts to construct ssuC deletions via this method were not successful: only a handful of colonies were obtained (6 ± 3 per 2 g plasmid) and none had the precise deletion desired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined 20 transformants obtained by this method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two contained a 1.3-kb deletion of the ssuC locus, which occurred at a region of microhomology (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remainder had WT copies of the ssuC gene and, thus, are likely to be so-called escape mutants in which the Cas9 gene or sgRNA has mutated on the targeting plasmid (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Cas9-based tools developed in this study will have a transformative impact on the speed, scope, and scale of research that can be accomplished in the methanogenic archaeon, M. acetivorans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most notably, multiplexed gene-editing plasmids will enable generation of strains with multiple mutations, ranging from SNPs to large indels, in a matter of weeks versus years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tools will enable researchers to swiftly tag genes at their native loci on the host chromosome, allowing the study of context-specific gene expression, pull-down experiments to establish proteinprotein and proteinDNA interaction networks, and purification of proteins that contain unique amino acids (27) or novel posttranslational modifications (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, deleting a gene of interest using the NHEJ-based technique is very cost-effective, as it simply requires the insertion of a commercially synthesized DNA fragment containing the appropriate sgRNAs into pDN243, the vector containing Cas9 and the NHEJ machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, studies that were previously inconceivable, such as constructing a library of strains with single-gene deletions in every nonessential gene on the M. acetivorans chromosome [as described in Wang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (29)], will now become feasible, in terms of both time and cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we expect that minor modifications will enable the application of this approach to a broad range of methanogens and other archaea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Certain features of Cas9-mediated genome editing in M. acetivorans are particularly unique and noteworthy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, unlike eukaryotes (30), targeting of the Cas9sgRNA complex to a particular chromosomal region in M. acetivorans is remarkably precise, as no off-target activity was observed upon resequencing multiple, independent genome-edited mutants (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the M. acetivorans genome (approximately 5.75 Mbp) is 10- to 100-fold smaller in comparison with eukaryotic genomes, it is possible that fewer off-target sites are present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no off-target activity could be detected, despite our intentional choice of highly similar sgRNA targets in the mtmCB isozymes (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is likely that properties of the Cas9sgRNA complex, including target specificity, vary significantly across domains of life, perhaps because of differences in chromosomal organization and DNA repair machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, unlike the Cas9-mediated genome editing in bacteria (79), we observe a high rate of HDR for the Cas9-mediated DSB and a very low frequency of escape mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These key distinctions are likely to stem from evolutionarily distinct HDR machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Archaeal DNA repair involves homologs of the eukaryotic proteins Mre11 and Rad50, and two other unique proteins HerA and NurA, which perform end-resection after a DSB occurs (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the RecA orthologs RadA and RadB, again more closely related to recombination proteins of eukaryotes, mediate strand invasion (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Hjc, unrelated to the RuvABC complex in bacteria (32), is involved in the resolution of the Holliday junction (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is tempting to speculate that coexpression of archaeal HDR machinery along with Cas9 might overcome some of the obstacles that have been reported in recent bacterial work (79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed similar host-specific effects upon heterologous expression of the NHEJ machinery from M. paludicola in M. acetivorans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These archaeal proteins have biochemical activities that are strikingly similar to the well-characterized bacterial Ku and LigD of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we were somewhat surprised by the robust template-independent repair they conferred when coexpressed with the Cas9sgRNA complex in M. acetivorans (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are in sharp contrast to a recent study in which coexpression of Ku and LigD from M. tuberculosis did not rescue the Cas9-mediated DNA break in E. coli (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observed that template-independent DNA repair happens at naturally occurring regions of microhomology (ranging from 6 to 11 bp), which supports a recent hypothesis that the archaeal NHEJ pathway conduct microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) in vivo (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we expect that in addition to its application as a means of generating random site-specific mutations in M. acetivorans, this tool can also be used to dissect the archaeal MMEJ machinery in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, we note that no particular sequence pattern or any distinct signature (GC content, nucleotide frequency) could be inferred from the regions of microhomology at which repair occurred (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, DNA repair mediated by MMEJ is almost completely abolished when two sgRNAs were simultaneously expressed, suggesting that the repair mechanism has the ability to distinguish breaks that occur at discrete loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, one might ask why we chose to use the well-established S. pyogenes Cas9sgRNA complex for genome-editing purposes over the native type I or type III CRISPR/Cas systems that are commonly found in Methanosarcina spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35), as was done in Sulfolobus islandicus (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the CRISPR/Cas subtypes vary significantly across the genus Methanosarcina, even within strains belonging to the same species (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence a genome-editing technique reliant on the native CRISPR/Cas machinery for one strain might not work in other closely related strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies across a wide-range of bacteria have revealed that anti-CRISPR proteins to silence the native CRISPR/Cas system are also often encoded on the chromosome (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although no anti-CRISPR proteins have been detected in Methanosarcina, it is possible that they exist and might potentially complicate use of the native CRISPR/Cas machinery for genome editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, tweaking the native CRISPR/Cas machinery for genome editing purposes is likely to impact organismal physiology in an unpredictable fashion and skew genetic analyses downstream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we chose to deploy the simple, modular Cas9-mediated genome editing machinery on a vector that will be transiently maintained in M. acetivorans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. acetivorans strains were grown in single-cell morphology (38) at 37 °C in bicarbonate-buffered high-salt (HS) liquid medium containing 125 mM methanol or 50 mM TMA hydrochloride in Balch tubes with N2/CO2 (80/20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plating solid medium was conducted in an anaerobic glove chamber (Coy Laboratory Products) as described previously (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid media plates were incubated in an intrachamber anaerobic incubator maintained at 37 °C with N2/CO2/H2S (79.9/20/0.1) in the headspace, as described previously (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Puromycin (CalBiochem), the purine analog 8ADP (R. I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemicals) and BES were added to a final concentration of 2 g/mL, 20 g/mL, 0.4 mM, respectively, from sterile, anaerobic stock solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anaerobic, sterile stocks of tetracycline hydrochloride in deionized water were prepared fresh shortly before use and added to a final concentration as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli strains were grown in LB broth at 37 °C with standard antibiotic concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WM4489, a DH10B derivative engineered to control copy-number of oriV-based plasmids (40), was used as the host strain for all plasmids generated in this study (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmid copy number was increased by adding sterile rhamnose to a final concentration of 10 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

All target sequences used in this study are listed in Table S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Target sequences were designed using the CRISPR site finder tool in Geneious version R9 (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The M. acetivorans chromosome and the plasmid pC2A were used to score off-target binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transformation_of_M_acetivorans  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All M. acetivorans strains used in this study are listed in Table S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liposome-mediated transformation was used for M. acetivorans, as described previously(43), and 10 mL of late-exponential phase culture of M. acetivorans and 2 g of plasmid DNA were used for each transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genome_Sequencing_and_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA from M. acetivorans was extracted using a protocol described previously (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA libraries were prepared with the Hyper Library construction kit (Kapa Biosystems) and quantified using qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All libraries were sequenced on one lane of an Illumina MiSeq v2 (Illumina) at the Roy J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carver Biotechnology Center, University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign using a 500 cycles v2 sequencing kit (Illumina).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trimmed, paired end 250-nt reads were mapped to the M. acetivorans reference genome (NC_003552) using default parameters for breseq v0.25 (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trimmed genome sequencing reads have been deposited in the Sequenced Reads Archive at the National Center for Biotechnology Information under accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PRJNA352863.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
