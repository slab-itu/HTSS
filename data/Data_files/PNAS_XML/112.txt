TMEM110 regulates the maintenance and remodeling of mammalian ERplasma membrane junctions competent for STIMORAI signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Close appositions between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane in mammalian cells have essential roles in cellular lipid metabolism and in cytoplasmic calcium signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although recent investigations have yielded considerable insight into the structural basis for lipid transfer at ERplasma membrane junctions, little is known about the proteins that organize junctions for calcium signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that the ER membrane protein transmembrane protein 110 (TMEM110) supports the maintenance of ERplasma membrane junctions competent for calcium signaling and acts in concert with other proteins in the dynamic remodeling of the junctions during signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stromal interaction molecule (STIM)ORAI calcium release-activated calcium modulator (ORAI) pathway controls store-dependent calcium entry, a major mechanism of physiological calcium signaling in mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core elements of the pathway are the regulatory protein STIM1, located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, the calcium channel ORAI1 in the plasma membrane, and sites of close contact between the ER and the plasma membrane that permit the two proteins to interact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research on calcium signaling has centered on STIM1, ORAI1, and a few proteins that directly modulate STIMORAI function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about proteins that organize ERplasma membrane junctions for STIMORAI-dependent calcium signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that an ER-resident membrane protein identified in a previous genome-wide RNAi screen, transmembrane protein 110 (TMEM110), regulates the long-term maintenance of ERplasma membrane junctions and the short-term physiological remodeling of the junctions during store-dependent calcium signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

TMEM110_Modulates_Cellular_Calcium_Signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the RNAi screen, treatment with a pool of four siRNAs directed to TMEM110 depressed activation of the calcium-sensitive transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) in response to ER calcium store depletion (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deconvolution showed that all four siRNAs in the pool were effective in reducing TMEM110 mRNA and in reducing NFAT nuclear import in response to stimulation (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More complete tests that included unstimulated cells and cyclosporin A (CsA)-treated cells as controls verified that the most effective siRNA, siTMEM110(#2), specifically reduced nuclear NFAT accumulation in stimulated HeLa cells (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This individual siRNA was used for the experiments reported in this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial characterization showed that TMEM110 is an ER-localized membrane protein with cytoplasmic N and C termini (Fig 1A and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compromised NFAT nuclear localization can, in principle, reflect either interference with signaling upstream of calcium entry or interference with NFAT activation despite normal calcium entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To define the cellular role of TMEM110 more precisely, we examined cytoplasmic calcium responses in control and siTMEM110-treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depleting TMEM110 sharply reduced store-dependent calcium entry in HeLa cells (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TMEM110 depletion had a similar effect in Jurkat T cells, whether store-dependent calcium entry was triggered by treatment with the SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca++-ATPase) inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) (Fig S3A) or by stimulation through the T-cell receptor (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct target is STIMORAI signaling, rather than other proteins involved in cellular calcium handling or in setting cell membrane potential, because depletion of TMEM110 reduced the classical calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) current in Jurkat T cells (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crucially, expression of RNAi-resistant TMEM110 restored store-dependent calcium entry in Jurkat T cells (Fig 1D) and restored store-dependent NFAT nuclear import in HeLa cells (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these findings do not rule out a separate effect downstream of calcium entry, the findings collectively establish that a major role of TMEM110 is to modulate the STIMORAI pathway of calcium entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TMEM110_Is_Required_for_Efficient_STIM1_Relocalization_to_ERPlasma_Membrane_Junctions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further experiments implicated TMEM110 in an early step in STIM1 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movement of STIM1 to the total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) layera commonly used measure reflecting STIM1 activation and relocalization to junctionswas impaired by depletion of TMEM110 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, constitutive localization of the calcium binding-deficient, and therefore activated, mutant STIM1(D76A) to the TIRF layer was impaired by the depletion of TMEM110 (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STIMORAI interaction can aid in STIM1 relocalization under certain circumstances (21), but ORAI1 was not overexpressed with STIM1 or STIM1(D76A) proteins in these experiments, implying that TMEM110 has a hand in controlling the relocalization of STIM1 itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is strengthened further by the strong effect of siTMEM110 on STIM1 relocalization in cells depleted of ORAI1 (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TMEM110 and STIM1 are present at the same ERplasma membrane junctions in stimulated cells (Fig 2C and Fig S5), raising the possibilities that TMEM110 could be acting on STIM1 to stabilize its presence at junctions, could be stabilizing the junctions themselves, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TMEM110_Depletion_Results_in_a_Measurable_Loss_of_ERPlasma_Membrane_Junctions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several approaches have been developed to investigate ERplasma membrane junctions in living cells independently of monitoring STIM1 accumulation (20, 22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A useful approach, in our hands, has been to follow DsRed-ER or RFP-ER markers by TIRF microscopy (Fig 2C and see below) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TIRF-layer ER signal does have the limitation of including contributions both from true cortical ER in close contact with the plasma membrane (5, 11, 12, 24, 25) and from adjacent ER that is within the TIRF layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, its unmatched advantage, which came into sharp focus as the experiments progressed, is the ability to monitor near-plasma membrane ER over the entire footprint of a cell, with high spatial resolution and over the time course of a physiological response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HeLa cells depleted of endogenous TMEM110 had less TIRF-layer ER fluorescence as a percentage of total ER fluorescence than did control cells (Fig 3A), both at rest and after store depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expressing RNAi-resistant TMEM110 restored the level of TIRF-layer ER fluorescence (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TMEM110/ HEK293 cells produced by CRISPR-Cas9 targeting (23) also had considerably less TIRF-layer ER fluorescence than the parental HEK293 cells (Fig 3C), and expression of TMEM110 again rescued TIRF-layer ER fluorescence (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in TIRF-layer ER signal in our assay is more pronounced than the decrease in cortical ER previously reported for the same TMEM110/ cells (23), apparently reflecting technical differences between the assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude from our data that reducing the level of TMEM110 below normal cellular levels leads to an appreciable loss of near-plasma membrane ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tellingly, however, we did not see an increased TIRF-layer ER signal in control HeLa cells when GFP-TMEM110 was overexpressed at modest levels (Fig 3A), indicating that cellular proteins other than TMEM110 could be limiting for the formation or maintenance of junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We complemented the TIRF microscopy (TIRFM) experiments with electron microscopy to examine ERplasma membrane junctions specifically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, we scored ERplasma membrane contacts with a spacing less than 20 nm as junctions (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siTMEM110-treated HeLa cells had fewer ERplasma membrane junctions per m plasma membrane than control HeLa cells in both unstimulated and store-depleted conditions (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron microscopy secondarily confirmed a previous report that ERplasma membrane junctions increase in HeLa cells after store depletion (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main conclusion, however, is that HeLa cells require TMEM110 to maintain a normal complement of ERplasma membrane junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Restoring_Junctions_Partially_Reverses_the_Effects_of_TMEM110_Depletion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether loss of junctions in itself contributes to the impairment of calcium signaling, we sought to restore junctions in a way that is neutral with respect to STIMORAI signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ist2 is an ER membrane protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that acts as an ERplasma membrane tether (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yeast lack STIMORAI proteins and ER store-dependent calcium signaling, and the Ist2 homologs in mammalsthe TMEM16 familyare plasma membrane Cl channels or phospholipid scramblases (26) that have lost the long unstructured cytoplasmic region and polybasic C-terminal tail essential to the tethering function in the yeast protein (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there is no reason to expect that Ist2 would interact with STIM, ORAI, or mammalian proteins dedicated to STIMORAI signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We expressed a Clover-labeled fragment of yeast Ist2, consisting of its last two transmembrane segments and its C-terminal cytoplasmic region (Fig 5A), in HeLa cells depleted of TMEM110 or in HEK293 cells entirely lacking the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fragment has been shown previously to increase ERplasma membrane junctional area in mammalian cells (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial experiments confirmed the expected cortical localization of Ist2 expressed in HeLa cells (Fig S6), and expression of the engineered Ist2 supported the formation of extensive cortical ER in siTMEM110-treated HeLa cells as intended (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the critical experiments, Ist2 expression partially rescued STIM1 relocalization in response to store depletion in siTMEM110-treated HeLa cells (Fig 5B) and completely rescued STIM1 movement in TMEM110/ HEK293 cells (Fig 5C), potentially because of a higher level of expression of Ist2 in HEK293 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The restored junctions were functional in STIMORAI signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ist2 expression partially rescued store-dependent calcium entry in TMEM110-depleted HeLa cells (Fig 5D), with the extent of rescue correlating with the level of Ist2 expression (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation suggests that increased junctional area is one factor in restoring STIMORAI signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even in cells with the brightest Clover-Ist2 signal, cytoplasmic calcium did not reach the highest levels observed in control cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter finding might indicate that TMEM110 contributes to signaling by an additional mechanism besides maintaining junctional area, for example by favoring an active conformation of STIM1 (23) or by acting with other proteins at the junction to promote STIMORAI signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TMEM110_Plays_a_Role_in_the_Acute_Rearrangement_of_TIRF-Layer_ER  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Time-series analysis of the response to store depletion in living cells brought out another unexpected aspect of TMEM110 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TIRF-layer ER signal in control HeLa cells or in control parental HEK293 cells increased during the first several minutes after store depletion (Fig 6 A and B) in line with the rearrangement of cortical ER that has been described in the literature (5, 12, 22, 24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in siTMEM110-treated HeLa cells and in TMEM110/ HEK293 cells there was no net increase in TIRF-layer ER fluorescence after store depletion (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of RNAi-resistant TMEM110 in TMEM110-depleted HeLa cells restored the increase (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings reveal an acute rearrangement of cortical ER during store-dependent signaling that is specifically dependent on TMEM110.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An instructive sidelight is that RNAi-resistant TMEM110C lacking cytoplasmic region residues 210294 did not substitute for full-length TMEM110 in restoring the store-dependent rearrangement of cortical ER (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Failure of TMEM110C in this assay correlates with the observations that fluorescent TMEM110C in resting cells localized in the ER with very little signal in the TIRF layer and that store depletion did not increase TIRF-layer TMEM110C fluorescence (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the C-terminal region of TMEM110 is apparently important for its functions at ERplasma membrane junctions, providing a starting point for future detailed exploration of the mechanisms involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

STIM1_and_STIM2_Contribute_Differentially_to_Junctional_Remodeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TMEM110 is unlikely to act alone in the maintenance and reorganization of cortical ER, especially given that modest overexpression of TMEM110 by itself did not increase TIRF-layer ER fluorescence (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BecauseTMEM110 has been shown to interact with STIM1 and favor its active conformation (23), we compared the effects of siTMEM110, siSTIM1, and siSTIM2 treatments on TIRF-layer ER dynamics (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control cells treated with siTMEM110, TIRF-layer ER fluorescence was reduced, and no remodeling of the cortical and near-cortical ER was detected, as expected from the results above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siSTIM1 and siSTIM2 treatments both resulted in some decrease in TIRF-layer ER fluorescence (Fig S8A), and siSTIM1 treatment caused a modest delay and attenuation of remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most striking observation, however, was that the siSTIM1 and siSTIM2 treatments had opposite effects on the dynamics: Exposure to TG still triggered a net increase in TIRF-layer ER fluorescence after STIM1 depletion but resulted in a net decrease after STIM2 depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated whether we could detect a corresponding difference in the dynamic behavior of STIM1 and STIM2 at ERplasma membrane junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an initial analysis, the kinetics of STIM1 and STIM2 movements in the minutes after store depletion were similar when averaged over the entire cell footprint (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We considered, however, that the similar global kinetics might reflect the stability of most ERplasma membrane junctions over the short time frame of these experiments, and thus the kinetics of the overall fluorescence changes might depend mainly on processes other than junctional remodeling, e.g., on the rates of STIM1 and STIM2 diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we concentrated on the small subset of emerging junctions, defined empirically as sites with little or no ER marker fluorescence before stimulation and with a clear signal developing during the period of observation (Fig 7C and Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, ER rearrangement rather than STIM1 and STIM2 diffusion might dominate the kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found a striking difference in the onset of local fluorescence signals at emerging junctions, with STIM2 preceding STIM1 in most cases (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parallel examination of a limited sample of cells coexpressing the fluorescently labeled pairs TMEM110STIM1 and TMEM110STIM2 bore out this finding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STIM2 usually appeared at emerging junctions simultaneously with TMEM110, although the two proteins were not always precisely colocalized (Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, TMEM110 preceded STIM1 at emerging junctions or, less commonly in our sample, TMEM110 and STIM1 appeared simultaneously (Fig S8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations support the conclusion that STIM1 and STIM2 have distinguishable functions in the remodeling of ERplasma membrane junctions and raise the possibility that TMEM110 may cooperate with STIM2 and other unidentified proteins in the early steps of junctional remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Store-dependent calcium signaling has been grafted evolutionarily onto an existing cellular structurethe ERplasma membrane junctionwhose ancestral functions, shared from yeast to mammals, include lipid transfer between the apposed bilayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcium signaling evidently has been integrated seamlessly with lipid transfer, rather than partitioned to a distinct subset of junctions, because STIM1 and TMEM110 are detected after store depletion at nearly all ERplasma membrane contacts identifiable by TIRFM using an ER marker, a genetically encoded junctional marker, or fluorescently labeled E-Syt1 (Fig 2C) (22, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comingling of calcium signaling and lipid transfer reflects a close functional linkage: Lipid transfer supplies the phosphatidylinositol needed for PIP2 resynthesis during sustained calcium signaling, and plasma membrane lipid microdomains are integral to feedback regulation of the ORAI channel by calcium and SARAF (22, 31, 32); conversely, local calcium signals recruit E-Syt1 and thereby either expand ERplasma membrane junctions or strengthen junctional contacts (11, 12, 22, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings reinforce the conclusion that junctions provide more than an unadorned stage for STIM and ORAI to interact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STIM1ORAI1 interaction is the minimum requirement for CRAC channel gating (33, 34), but local membrane organization regulates the efficiency of interaction and gating (20, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A specific requirement for TMEM110 in STIMORAI signaling is evident in the observations that TMEM110 depletion and E-Syt depletion cause a comparable loss of junctional area (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4) (12), but only TMEM110 depletion has a profound effect on the initial amplitude of store-dependent calcium entry (Fig 1 B and C and Fig S3 A and B) (12, 22, 30, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, TMEM110 could act either by contributing to a nanometer-scale compartmentalization of calcium signaling within individual junctions or simply by ensuring the presence of specific protein components in the junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ERplasma membrane junctions are remodeled during physiological signaling by the formation of new junctions, the extension of existing contacts, and a reduction in ERplasma membrane spacing (5, 22, 24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even subtle structural changes in existing junctions can shape calcium signaling both by altering the local landscape for calcium diffusion, and hence the local calcium concentration profile, and by setting constraints on the positioning of calcium-handling proteins such as SERCA and PMCA (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent mechanistic studies have highlighted the dynamic changes attributable to E-Syt proteins and their partners (11, 12, 22, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we establish that TMEM110 and STIM2, proteins dedicated primarily to calcium signaling, also participate in rapid structural rearrangements of junctional contacts (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The processes controlled by E-Syt proteins and by TMEM110 will both be triggered by physiological signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they might tend to target spatially discrete sites within a junction as a result of their differing dependence on calcium influx (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6 and 7) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our observations point to a previously unrecognized aspect of STIM2 functioning in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STIM2 has a well-established role in the maintenance of resting cytoplasmic and ER calcium levels (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STIM2 also contributes to evoked store-operated calcium entry in HeLa cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (36, 37) and supports sustained calcium signaling in other cells, particularly at low physiological stimulus intensities (3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These latter effects are somewhat counterintuitive, given that STIM2 is relatively ineffective in directly activating ORAI channels (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One part of the explanation is that STIM2 can enhance STIM1 recruitment to junctions by a physical interaction with STIM1 (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another part could be the newly discovered involvement of STIM2 in rapid local rearrangements at ERplasma membrane junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rearrangements might enhance calcium signaling by specifying a local environment that favors STIM1 recruitment or STIM1-ORAI1 interaction, by positioning other calcium signaling proteins, or by changing junctional geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The specific message of this work is that the ER membrane protein TMEM110 supports the maintenance of ERplasma membrane junctions competent for calcium signaling and acts in concert with other proteins in the dynamic remodeling of the junctions during signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A broader message is that STIMORAI calcium signaling is critically dependent on modulatory proteins that organize the junctions for calcium signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our characterization of the cellular roles of TMEM110 has begun to define the mechanisms involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiments were carried out with HeLa cells and Jurkat T cells obtained from ATCC; HeLa NFAT1-GFP cells (43, 44); and TMEM110/ HEK293 cell lines and their parental HEK293 cells (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression plasmids encoded STIM1, STIM2, TMEM110, and TMEM110(211-294), tagged as indicated; Clover-Ist2(490946); and the ER markers RFP-ER, DsRed-ER, and blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The siControl, siSTIM1, and siSTIM2 reagents have been characterized (20, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four individual siTMEM110 reagents reduced the level of TMEM110 mRNA (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except in the experiment shown in Fig S1, the most effective siRNA, siTMEM110(#2) with the sequence 5-AGACGUCCGUGGAGGAUAU-3, was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAi-resistant TMEM110 expression constructs were engineered with silent mutations that rendered them insensitive to siTMEM110(#2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assays for NFAT nuclear import, Ca2+ imaging, and electrophysiology were carried out as described (20, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methods for TIRFM and fluorescence microscopy were as described (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative fraction of STIM1 (Fig 2A), STIM1(D76A) (Fig 2B), or ER marker (Fig 3) in the TIRF layer was estimated for a given cell by dividing the STIM1 (or RFP-ER) fluorescence recorded in TIRF mode by the fluorescence recorded in epifluorescence mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditions of illumination and detection were identical for all cells in an experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the efficiency of fluorophore excitation could differ in the two configurations, it seems likely that in our conditions the ratio is a rough approximation of the actual fraction of fluorescent protein present in the TIRF layer, because the ratios obtained for the plasma membrane protein ORAI1 were 4050%, in agreement with the proportion of total plasma membrane expected in the TIRF layer (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emerging junctions were tentatively identified by subtracting, pixel-by-pixel, the first RFP-ER TIRFM image in a series (before stimulation) from the last image (10 min after the addition of TG), then overlaying the subtracted last image (colored green) onto the first image (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each case analyzed was confirmed further by visually following the development of the RFP-ER signal through the entire series of images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cell_Culture_and_Transfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HeLa cells were obtained from the ATCC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HeLa cells stably expressing NFAT1-GFP have been described previously (37, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were cultured at 37 °C under 10% CO2 in DMEM (11995-040; Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, and 10 mM Hepes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parental control and TMEM110/ HEK293 cells (23) were maintained in the same conditions as HeLa cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For siRNA transfections, HeLa cells were transfected with 4060 nM of siRNA using HiPerFect (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were incubated with siRNA complexes for a total of 48 h [for quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)] or 72 h (for functional assays).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For DNA transfection, subconfluent HeLa or HEK293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions and were used 48 h after transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments involving the EF-hand mutant STIM1(D76A) were carried out by transfecting first with siTMEM110 and then, 24 h later, with STIM1(D76A) expression plasmid and imaging the cells after a further 48 h. Jurkat T cells were obtained from the ATCC and were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium (11875-093; Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine, and 10 mM Hepes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For siRNA or DNA transfection, Jurkat cells were transfected using the Neon electroporation system (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Confluent HeLa cell monolayers seeded in black-rimmed, clear-bottomed 96-well microplates (Corning/Costar) were stimulated in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM CaCl2, using 1 µM TG; CsA pretreatments were performed for 30 min at 1 µM CsA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 20 min of TG treatment at 37 °C, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS (Affymetrix USB), permeabilized in PBS and 0.2% Triton-X100 (Sigma), and stained with the DNA-intercalating dye DAPI (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent images were acquired at 10× magnification on an ImageXpress Micro Imaging System (Molecular Devices) and were analyzed using the Translocation module of MetaXpress software v. 6.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear translocation was assessed by calculating the correlation of spatial fluorescence intensity between the NFAT1-GFP and DAPI: Cells were scored positive for nuclear translocation if  greater than 60% of the GFP signal coincided with the DAPI signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each data point represents the average of three separate wells on a plate ( greater than 1,200 cells per well), with error bars reporting SEM between wells; all experiments represent biological duplicates or triplicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For rescue experiments, HeLa cells seeded in 12-well plates were transfected with siRNAs; 24 h later plasmids coding for siRNA-resistant RFP-TMEM110 were transfected, and cells were incubated for an additional 48 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Single-cell Ca2+ measurements were made with fura-2/AMloaded cells as previously reported (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HeLa cells were plated on 18-mm coverslips and loaded with 3 M fura-2/AM for 3045 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing 2.5 mM probenecid and 10 mM Hepes (Sigma), were washed twice with fresh medium, and were analyzed immediately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jurkat T cells were loaded with 1 M fura-2/AM for 3045 min at room temperature with constant shaking, then were washed once with fresh medium, and were plated onto 18-mm coverslips pretreated with poly-l-ornithine [3% (wt/vol)] for 5 min before analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coverslips were assembled into a chamber on the stage of an Olympus IX 71 microscope equipped with a 20× (UplanSApo, NA 0.75) objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were illuminated alternately at 340 and 380 nm with the Polychrome V (TILL Photonics) using ET Fura filter (Chroma Technology Corp., catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  79001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence emissions at   greater than  400 nm (long-pass filter, 400 nm; emitter 510/80 nm) were captured with a CCD camera (SensiCam; TILL Imago) and were digitized and analyzed by TILL Vision software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ratio images were recorded at intervals of 2 s. Ca2+ concentrations were estimated from the relation [Ca2+]i = K(R  Rmin)/(Rmax  R), where the values of K, Rmin, and Rmax were determined from an in situ calibration of fura-2 in HeLa cells as described (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ca2+ Ringers solution contained (in mM) 155 NaCl, 4.5 KCl, 1 CaCl2 (for Jurkat T cells) or 2 CaCl2 (for HeLa cells), 2 MgCl2 (for Jurkat T cells) or 1 MgCl2 (for HeLa cells), 10 d-glucose, and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGTA (1 mM) was substituted for CaCl2 in the 0-Ca2+ Ringers solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TG (1 M) or 5 µg/mL OKT3 antibodies were used to stimulate the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed using TILL Vision (TILL Photonics) and Igor Pro (WaveMetrics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All values are given as mean ± SEM, and the number of cells is stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical comparisons were by Students t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three to five experiments were performed for each experimental condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four parameters were used to quantify store-operated Ca2+ signals at the single-cell level: the initial Ca2+ influx rate, as fitted by linear regression; the maximal increase in [Ca2+]i relative to the basal [Ca2+]i after either Ca2+ release from ER or Ca2+ influx through CRAC/ORAI1 channels, fitted by polynomial regression; and the Ca2+ plateau (averaging five points), at 600 s for Jurkat T cells or 800 s for HeLa cells, based on data from more than 80 single cells in each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrophysiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patch-clamp experiments were performed as described elsewhere (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the whole-cell configuration at 2125 °C was achieved by tight seals with 2.5- to 3.2-M resistance fire-polished micropipettes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce electrode capacitance, pipettes were dipped into Sigmacote (Sigma-Aldrich) immediately before use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane currents were acquired with an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voltage ramps of 200-ms duration spanning a range of 150 mV to +100 mV were delivered from a holding potential of 0 mV at a rate of 0.5 Hz over a period of 400 s. All voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential of 10 mV between internal and bath solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currents were filtered at 2.9 kHz and digitized at a sampling rate of 10 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To display the current recordings, currents were digitally filtered offline at 1 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pipette and cell capacitance were electronically cancelled before each voltage ramp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current amplitudes at 130 mV from individual voltage ramps were used to monitor the temporal development of currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical errors of averaged data are given as means ± SEM with n determinations (cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standard external solution (in mM) was as follows: 120 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 CaCl, 10 TEA-Cl, 10 Hepes, 10 glucose, pH 7.2 with NaOH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standard pipette solution for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings contained (in mM) 0.05 InsP3, 5 × 105 TG, 140 Cs-glutamate, 12 EGTA, 3 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, pH 7.2 with CsOH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TIRFM_and_FRET_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TIRFM was performed using a 60×, 1.45 NA CFI Apo objective (Nikon) mounted on a Ti-Eclipse inverted microscope with Perfect Focus System (PFS; Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging was performed on HeLa cells stably transfected with GFP-STIM1 or transiently transfected with the indicated constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were stimulated with 1 µM TG in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ solution for 1113 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dual-channel or triple-channel time-lapse image sequences from four to seven cells were acquired by sequential, nearly simultaneous acquisition of the individual channels using a CoolSNAP HQ2 Monochrome CCD camera (Photometrics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure times were 300 ms, 100 ms, and 300 ms (for 405-nm, 488-nm, and 561-nm channels, respectively) at frame rates of 0.05/s0.2/s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For FRET experiments, four images were taken as follows: donordonor (FITCFITC filters), acceptoracceptor (TRITCTRITC filters), FRET (donoracceptor, FITCTRITC filters), and anti-FRET (acceptordonor, TRITCFITC filters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For image analyses, ImageJ and NI-Elements software were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative fraction of STIM1, STIM1(D76A), or ER marker in the TIRF layer was estimated for a given cell by dividing the STIM1 (or RFP-ER) fluorescence recorded in TIRF mode by the fluorescence recorded in epifluorescence mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditions of illumination and detection were identical for all cells in an experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emerging junctions were tentatively identified by subtracting, pixel-by-pixel, the first RFP-ER TIRFM image in a series (before stimulation) from the last image (10 min after the addition of TG) and then overlaying the subtracted last image (colored green) onto the first image (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each case analyzed was confirmed further by visually following the development of the RFP-ER signal through the entire series of images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were grown on discs cut from Aclar film (Electron Microscopy Sciences), treated as indicated, and fixed using 2.5% glutaraldehyde (diluted from 8% aqueous solution, EM grade, Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 2% paraformaldehyde (diluted from 16% aqueous solution, EM grade, Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mM calcium chloride, at 37 °C for 5 min followed by 1 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coverslips then were washed three times in cacodylate buffer for 5 min each and were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide/0.3% potassium ferrocyanide in buffer for 1 h on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the coverslips were washed three times in water for 5 min each and en bloc stained with 2% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate for 1 h. Then the samples were washed again in water and were dehydrated in a graded acetone series [50%, 70%, 90%, 100%, and 100% (vol/vol)] for 5 min each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples then were rapidly infiltrated in Spurrs resin using a PELCO BioWave microwave processing unit (Ted Pella), flat embedded, and cured at 60 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions of interest were found via light microscopy, excised from the flat molds, and remounted on blank resin stubs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrathin (70-nm) sections were cut on a Leica UC7 Ultramicrotome (Leica), and entire cells were examined with a STEM detector on a Sigma VP scanning electron microscope (Zeiss) at 27 KeV and 1.2 nm per pixel, with a 30-µm aperture and 1.5-µs dwell time, using the ATLAS scan engine (Fibics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

qRT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was isolated from cells 48 h after siRNA transfection using RNeasy extraction with on-column DNase I digestion (QIAGEN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNA was generated from 200500 ng total RNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT priming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR was performed using FastStart Universal SYBR Green Master Mix reagents (Roche) and was analyzed on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TMEM110 expression in individual samples was normalized to GAPDH expression, and relative gene expression in experimental samples was extrapolated from a standard curve derived from siControl-treated RNA samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fluorescence_Protease_Protection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fluorescence protease protection (FPP) experiment was performed as described elsewhere (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, living cells transfected with plasmid encoding the desired fluorescently tagged protein were exposed to KHM buffer (110 mM potassium acetate, 20 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 2 mM magnesium chloride) containing digitonin (50 µM) to permeabilize the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then cells were washed with KHM buffer containing proteinase K (50 µg/mL) for 2 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epifluorescence images were recorded every 2 s for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data were analyzed using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics), Pulse (HEKA), FitMaster (HEKA), and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All values are given as mean ± SEM, and the number of cells is reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than two independent experiments were performed for each experimental condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical comparisons used Students t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
