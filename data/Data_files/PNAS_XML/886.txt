Single rat muscle Na+ channel mutation confers batrachotoxin autoresistance found in poison-dart frog Phyllobates terribilis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phyllobates terribilis frog is listed as an endangered species, endemic to the Pacific coast of Colombia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through diets, these golden poison frogs sequester lethal amounts of batrachotoxin in their skin for self-defense.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Batrachotoxin activates voltage-gated Na+ channels and keeps them open persistently with deadly consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study addresses how golden poison frogs may avoid poisoning themselves via a naturally occurring substitution at the batrachotoxin receptor within their muscle Na+ channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An equivalent asparagine-to-threonine substitution not only preserved the functional integrity of rat muscle Na+ channels but also rendered them exceptionally resistant to batrachotoxin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a switch could evolve via a single nucleotide mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Poison-dart Phyllobates terribilis frogs sequester lethal amounts of steroidal alkaloid batrachotoxin (BTX) in their skin as a defense mechanism against predators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BTX targets voltage-gated Na+ channels and enables them to open persistently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How BTX autoresistance arises in such frogs remains a mystery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BTX receptor has been delineated along the Na+ channel inner cavity, which is formed jointly by four S6 transmembrane segments from domains D1 to D4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the P. terribilis muscle Na+ channel, five amino acid (AA) substitutions have been identified at D1/S6 and D4/S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated the role of these naturally occurring substitutions in BTX autoresistance by introducing them into rat Nav1.4 muscle Na+ channel, both individually and in combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results showed that combination mutants containing an N1584T substitution all conferred a complete BTX-resistant phenotype when expressed in mammalian HEK293t cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single N1584T mutant also retained its functional integrity and became exceptionally resistant to 5 µM BTX, aside from a small residual BTX effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single and combination mutants with the other four S6 residues (S429A, I433V, A445D, and V1583I) all remained highly BTX sensitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings, along with diverse BTX phenotypes of N1584K/A/D/T mutant channels, led us to conclude that the conserved N1584 residue is indispensable for BTX actions, probably functioning as an integral part of the BTX receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, complete BTX autoresistance found in P. terribilis muscle Na+ channels could emerge primarily from a single AA substitution (asparaginethreonine) via a single nucleotide mutation (AACACC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BTX-Sensitive_rNav14_Na+_Channel  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used wild-type rat Nav1.4 Na+ channels as a model system for this study, since the BTX receptor in this muscle Na+ channel isoform has been mapped (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously for P. terribilis muscle cells (3), we applied BTX at a saturating concentration of 5 M. Under our experimental conditions, wild-type rNav1.4 Na+ channels were activated around 50 mV and rNav1.4 Na+ currents decayed rapidly due to fast inactivation (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 shows the phenotypes regarding BTX modifications of Nav1.4 Na+ channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, most of transient fast-inactivating Na+ currents became noninactivating after 1,500 repetitive pulses of +50 mV for 20 ms at 2 Hz (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At pulse 1 trace, some of the transient Na+ currents were already modified by BTX, which occurred during the 10- to 15-min wait time for whole-cell dialysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, once modified, these noninactivating currents (Fig 2B) were long lasting throughout the 500-ms pulse duration at various voltages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation threshold was also leftward shifted by BTX so that inward Na+ current first appeared at 80 mV (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because BTX eliminates both fast and slow inactivation of Na+ channels (2), BTX-modified Na+ currents can also be conveniently recorded using a 1-s ramp stimulus from 140 mV to +50 mV as shown in Fig 2C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation threshold of these BTX-modified Na+ channels was measured around 90 mV, where inward Na+ currents first appeared from the baseline during a ramp stimulus (Fig 2C, dashed arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activation threshold was much lower than that of the wild-type Na+ channels (approximately 50 mV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inward ramp Na+ currents reached their maximum around 50 mV and then reversed their direction, whereas outward Na+ currents first appeared near 10 mV and increased linearly until the ramp stimulus ended at +50 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) at 1 M blocked most of ramp BTX-modified Na+ currents (Fig 2C, red trace), confirming that rNav1.4 Na+ channels were TTX sensitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the remaining section, we define BTX-sensitive Na+ channels with three criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the ratio of the noninactivating vs. the peak Na+ current is 75% after 1,500 repetitive pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, a 1-s ramp stimulus will generate robust BTX-modified ramp Na+ currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the activation threshold of BTX-modified ramp Na+ currents occurs at 80 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Complete_BTX-Resistant_5AA-Mutant_Na+_Channel  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We created an rNav1.4 mutant with five AA substitutions on D1/S6 and D4/S6 (Fig 1C) and tested whether such a 5AA-rNav1.4 mutant channel is sensitive to BTX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A shows that this 5AA mutant (Nav1.4-S429A/I433V/A445D/V1583I/N1584T) was completely resistant to BTX after 1, 100, 500, 1,000, 1,500, and up to 2,000 repetitive pulses (+50 mV for 20 ms at 2 Hz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual maintained current after 1,500 pulses was relatively small compared with the peak current amplitude (1.1 ± 0.3%, n = 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, this residual current could in part come from the background current at +50 mV as shown in Fig 2C in the presence of 1 M TTX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There appeared a gradual reduction of peak Na+ currents, likely due to cumulative slow inactivation during repetitive pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our result thus revealed clearly that these five naturally occurring substitutions found in P. terribilis frogs could be involved in BTX autoresistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3B shows the conductance vs. voltage relationship of the 5AA-rNav1.4 mutant channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were calculated from peak mutant Na+ currents generated at various voltages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation threshold of 5AA mutant Na+ channels appeared around 40 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 50% conductance (E0.5) occurred at 7.4 ± 1.2 mV with a slope factor (ka) of 15.2 ± 1.0 mV (n = 16) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fitted gating parameters are significantly different (P less_than 0.05) from those of the wild-type counterparts (E0.5 = 32.7 ± 1.4 mV and ka = 10.0 ± 1.2 mV; n = 5) (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3C shows the steady-state fast inactivation (h curve) of five-AA mutant channel at various conditioning pulses for 100 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most mutant Na+ currents were fast inactivated at voltage greater than or equal to 50 mV; there were no noninactivating Na+ currents present above this voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 50% steady-state inactivation (h0.5) corresponded to 83.9 ± 0.2 mV (with a slope factor kh of 6.2 ± 0.1 mV, n = 16); at this voltage, 50% of Na+ channels were fast inactivated (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fitted gating parameters are also significantly different (P less_than 0.01) from those found in the wild-type counterpart (h0.5 = 74.5 ± 0.5 mV and kh = 5.5 ± 0.1 mV; n = 5) (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon about gating alternations in 5AA-mutant channels is not unique, since AA substitutions at S6 regions tend to change Na+ channel gating parameters rather significantly (1214).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With 72% AA sequence identity between rat and amphibian muscle Na+ channels, whether such alternations in rNav1.4 channels are relevant to the muscle Na+ channel function in P. terribilis frogs is uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1,500 repetitive pulses at 5 µM BTX, we did not observe any BTX-modified ramp Na+ currents from this 5AA mutant with a 1-s ramp stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of a noticeable ramp Na+ current is understandable because BTX-resistant mutant Na+ channels are all fast inactivated before the slow ramp depolarization reaches the activation threshold (Fig 3 B vs. C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the remaining section, we define the complete BTX-resistant Na+ channel with the following criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, little or no maintained Na+ currents appear after 1,500 repetitive pulses at 5 µM BTX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the fast decaying phase of the transient Na+ current is little changed by BTX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, little or no BTX-modified ramp Na+ currents emerge during a 1-s ramp stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BTX-Sensitive_and_BTX-Resistant_Mutants_with_a_Single_AA_Substitution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Are all these five naturally occurring substitutions critical for BTX autoresistance in poison-dart P. terribilis frogs?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, we screened five individual mutants each with a single AA substitution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data showed that, except N1584T, all individual mutants were sensitive to BTX (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5) as determined by our BTX-sensitive criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, single mutants (S429A, I433V, A445D, and V1583I) were readily modified by 5 M BTX during repetitive pulses up to 1,500 pulses (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 A and C and 5 A and C) in a manner resembling that of wild-type rNav1.4 Na+ channels (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maintained currents reached 75% of the peak amplitude after 1,500 pulses for all four BTX-sensitive mutant channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, BTX shifted the activation threshold of these mutant channels leftward to around 90 to 100 mV under a 1-s ramp stimulus (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 B and D and 5 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the presence of noninactivating persistent currents and the robust ramp-generated BTX-modified Na+ currents (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5) showed clearly that BTX eliminated both fast and slow inactivation of these mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, the N1584T mutant exhibited a unique BTX-resistant phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like all other mutants, this N1584T mutant preserved its functional integrity of fast inactivation as transient mutant Na+ currents declined rapidly to the baseline after it reached its peak (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curiously, we observed that during repetitive pulses, a small slow-decaying component of Na+ currents became visible at 5 M BTX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the magnitude of this slowing effect was rather limited and transient mutant Na+ currents still decayed to the baseline within a few milliseconds (Fig 6A, dashed arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1,500 repetitive pulses, we also did not detect ramp Na+ currents generated by N1584T mutant channels using a 1-s ramp stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By our definition, the N1584T mutant did not qualify as a complete BTX-resistant mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact nature of this small BTX residual effect on the rNav1.4-N1584T mutant channel (Fig 6A, dashed arrow) is unclear but the magnitude appears too small to have any physiological consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This residual effect was not recorded in the five-AA mutant as shown in Fig 3A, suggesting that four other substitutions (S429A, I433V, A445D, and V1583I) may help remove such effect found in the N1584T mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus categorize this N1584T mutant as an exceptionally BTX-resistant Na+ channel that fails to generate noninactivating late Na+ currents or ramp Na+ currents at 5 M BTX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the data on five single mutants led us to conclude that only one residue, N1584T, plays a critical and dominant role pertaining to BTX autoresistance in P. terribilis frogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Screening_of_Additional_Combination_Mutants_with_More_than_One_AA_Substitution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To substantiate the dominant role of an N1584T substitution in BTX action, we created two additional combination mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both mutants with an inclusion of N1484T (Nav1.4-A445D/V1583I/N1584T and Nav1.4-S429A/I433V/V1583I/N1584T) exhibited a BTX-resistant phenotype as described in the five-AA mutant (Fig 3A) and qualified as complete BTX-resistant mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6B shows the current recordings of Nav1.4-A445D/V1583I/N1584T mutant channels during repetitive pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of 5 M BTX, this mutant remained functional with fast inactivation intact; all transient Na+ currents decayed rapidly with little or no noninactivating late currents during repetitive pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no evidence that a residual BTX effect existed in the Nav1.4-A445D/V1583I/N1584T mutant compared with that found in the N1584T counterpart (Fig 6 A vs. B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a 1-s ramp stimulus, we did not detect any ramp Na+ currents generated by this combination mutant channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next tested whether a combination of two or more AA substitutions without N1584T may together contribute to BTX autoresistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we screened four additional combination mutants (Nav1.4-S429A/I433V, Nav1.4-A445D/V1583I, Nav1.4-S429A/I433V/445D, and Nav1.4-S429A/I433V/A445D/V1583I) for their BTX sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that these combination mutants all qualified as BTX-sensitive mutant channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6C shows the current recordings of the Nav1.4-S429A/I433V/A445D mutant channel, which includes all three AA substitutions at D1/S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1,500 repetitive pulses, most of the transient Na+ currents became noninactivating at 5 M BTX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a 1-s ramp stimulus, ramp Na+ currents were conspicuous and the activation threshold for this mutant channel appeared around 105 mV (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have demonstrated that rNav1.4 combination mutant channels with an N1584T substitution (e.g., Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3A and 6B) all confer complete BTX autoresistance first reported in P. terribilis muscle cells (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other four naturally occurring substitutions play a minimal role in BTX autoresistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, after 1,500 pulses the ratios of the maintained vs. the peak current of all BTX-sensitive mutants are not significantly different from that of the wild-type channels at 5 µM BTX (P  greater than  0.05), whereas those of BTX-resistant mutants are (P less_than 0.0001) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2A6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we have established that a single N1584T substitution abolishes all BTX actions on the rNav1.4 Na+ channel in a nearly complete manner (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This single substitution alone could explain why P. terribilis frogs survive in the wild even though they contain 1.1 mg of BTX per adult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a large BTX quantity would require robust BTX autoresistance in these golden poison frogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This N1584T substitution could occur naturally via a single nucleotide replacement (AACACC) (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unexpectedly, poison-dart Phyllobates aurotaenia frogs do not possess this N1584T substitution (9) despite the fact that these frogs contain 50 g BTX per adult (3, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although none of the five AA substitutions evolved deep in the dendrobatid phylogeny, Tarvin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (9) hypothesized that the V1583I substitution facilitates the evolution of extreme toxicity in P. terribilis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is based on two observations that (i) only this V1583I substitution occurs simultaneously in P. terribilis and P. aurotaenia and (ii) protein-docking analyses indicate a decrease in BTX binding affinity by the V1583I substitution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our data showed that Nav1.4-V1583I mutant channels remained BTX sensitive (Fig 5 C and D), the evolutionary role of this substitution remains unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is feasible that V1583I alone or with additional S6 substitutions (e.g., Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3A and 6B) might play a part to eliminate the small residual BTX effect found in the N1584T mutant (Fig 6A, dashed arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, this V1583I substitution may be important for autoresistance to HTXs and PTXs found in various Phyllobates poison frogs (1, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the cloning of P. aurotaenia muscle Nav1.4 isoform and its expression in Xenopus oocytes revealed that an intermediate BTX-resistant phenotype (15) could exist in the Phyllobates clade as an evolutionary option (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This BTX-resistant phenotype (2050% ratio of maintained to peak currents at +80 mV with 10 µM BTX) may allow P. aurotaenia frog to survive since its skin contains less BTX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How does an N1584T substitution give rise to an exceptionally BTX-resistant phenotype?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown previously that the N1584 residue in the rNav1.4 Na+ channel is critical for BTX action on voltage-gated Na+ channels (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a lysine replacement (N1584K), rNav1.4 Na+ channels became completely resistant to BTX, comparable to that found in N1584T combination mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an alanine (N1584A) or an aspartic acid (N1584D) replacement, intermediate BTX-resistant phenotypes were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, BTX partially inhibited fast and slow inactivation of N1584D mutant channels as their BTX-modified Na+ currents decayed extensively during a prolonged depolarization to +50 mV, a phenotype very different from that of BTX-modified wild-type Na+ channels (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for the N1584A mutant, its BTX-modified phenotype included mainly a slowing effect on the decaying phase of transient Na+ currents during repetitive pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slowing effect manifested in N1584A mutant channels by BTX (10) was somewhat more severe than that found in the N1584T mutant (Fig 6A, dashed arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations illustrate the important role of the N1584 side-chain moiety in BTX actions on Na+ channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that more than 20% of the peak currents carried by N1584K mutant channels were noninactivating during a +50-mV test pulse, indicating that this mutant channel is inherently inactivation deficient (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of small noninactivating late Na+ currents (i.e., gain of function) is known to cause various muscle channelopathies (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With regard to the N1584A mutant, its expression in HEK293 cells was generally poor (less_than1 nA) (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, instead of N1584K or N1584A substitution, P. terribilis poison frogs become BTX resistant via an equivalent N1584T substitution, which keeps Na+ channel fast inactivation nearly intact even in the presence of 5 M BTX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genotypephenotype associations in BTX resistance along with inactivation deficiency and reduced expression among N1584K/A/D/T mutants together support the notion that functional constraint shapes the evolution of the P. terribilis Nav1.4 inner cavity (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, two reports from the Du Bois laboratory described the organic syntheses of various BTX analogs and enantiomeric BTX toxins (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These authors discovered a family of BTX analogs and nonnatural (+)-BTX toxins as reversible channel blockers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, among all S6 substitutions, they found that N1584K had the most destabilizing effect on the binding of BTX analogs and (+)-BTX enantiomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on their site-directed mutagenesis results, they provided a 3D rNav1.4 homology model, which depicted the N1584 residue as a part of the BTX receptor within Na+ channel inner cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cautions should be taken, since their homology structure is derived from bacterial Nav crystallographic data (9, 11, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our results strongly support the conclusion that BTX autoresistance in P. terribilis muscle Na+ channels is primarily due to an equivalent rNav1.4-N1584T substitution, which eliminates nearly all BTX actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This N1584 residue probably functions as an integral part of the BTX receptor in the rNav1.4 Na+ channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we envision that P. terribilis muscle Na+ channels once available will display a complete BTX-resistant phenotype as found in five-AA mutant channels (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether a reverse mutant (T1584N equivalent in such channel) remains partially BTX resistant as predicted by stepwise increases of toxin autoresistance in poison frogs during evolution (9) merits additional studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such stepwise increase of BTX autoresistance, if true, could derive from substitutions in D2S6, D3S6 (15, 20), or elsewhere (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Site-Directed_Mutagenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to create all rNav1.4 mutants within the pcDNA1/Amp vector (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutants with single AA substitutions were created first, which included: rNav1.4-S429A, I433V, A445D, V1583I, and N1584T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutants with a combination of these five amino acids were chosen in two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One group, which included the N1584T substitution, contained the following mutants: 445D/1583I/1584T, S429A/I433V/V1583I/N1584T, and S429A/I433V/A445D/V1583I/N1584T with all five AA substitutions (i.e., 5AA mutant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other group, all without the N1584T substitution, included the following mutants: S429A/I433V, S429A/I433V/A445D, and S429A/I433V/A445D/V1583I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Culture_and_Transient_Transfection_of_HEK_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HEK293t cells were maintained in Ti25 flasks at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator in DMEM (Life Technologies) containing 10% FBS (HyClone) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin solution (Sigma) (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEK293t cells expressing rNav1.4 wild-type and mutant Na+ channels along with 1-subunit and CD8 surface antigen were prepared by transient transfection via a calcium phosphate precipitation method and used within 24 d after transfection (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrophysiology__Data_Acquisition__and_Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transfected HEK293t cells were replated in 30-mm dishes, which were used as recording chambers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells that expressed the CD8 antigen (identifiable by antibody-coated beads) (Dynabeads M-450 CD8, Life Technologies) were selected for patch-clamp experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual cells were superfused with an extracellular solution containing (in millimoles) 65 NaCl, 85 choline-Cl, 2 CaCl2, and 10 Hepes (titrated with tetramethylammonium-OH to pH 7.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pipette (intracellular) solution consisted of (in millimoles) 100 NaF, 30 NaCl, 10 EGTA, and 10 Hepes (titrated with cesium-OH to pH 7.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BTX was a gift from John Daly (NIH, Bethesda) and was dissolved in DMSO at 0.5 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BTX was added into the pipette solution to a final concentration of 5 µM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DMSO (up to 1%) in the bath or in the pipette solution had little effect on Na+ currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TTX was purchased from Calbiochem (EMD Millipore) and was dissolved in distilled water at 1 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A final concentration of 1 M TTX was made by dilution with the extracellular solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The whole-cell configuration of a patch-clamp technique (21) was used to record Na+ currents in HEK293t cells at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrode resistance ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 M. Command voltages were elicited with pCLAMP9 software and delivered by Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were held at 140 mV and dialyzed for 1015 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this time, Na+ currents were monitored infrequently by test pulses (+50 mV/10 ms) at a 30-s interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capacitance and leak currents were cancelled with the patch-clamp device and by P/4 subtraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Access resistance was about 1 M under the whole-cell configuration; series resistance compensation of 95% resulted in voltage errors of 3 mV at +50 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both step and ramp stimuli, the voltage error was negligible around the activation threshold and comparatively small during channel activation, where the inward Na+ current amplitudes were modest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pipettes with larger access resistance ( greater than 1.5 M) were undesirable since it would limit BTX diffusion into the intracellular fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repetitive pulses of +50 mV/20 ms were applied at 2 Hz to facilitate BTX binding with the open Na+ channels and the resulting outward Na+ currents were recorded (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rare cases, repetitive pulses of +30 mV/20 ms were used when the current amplitude at +50 mV reached the limit of the amplifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such recordings allowed us to avoid the complication of series resistance artifacts and also to circumvent inward Na+ ion loading (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extracellular solutions were delivered via narrow-bored capillary tubes positioned within 300 µm from the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Curve fitting was performed using the program Microcal Origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An unpaired Students t test was used to evaluate estimated parameters (mean ± SEM or fitted value ± SE of the fit); P values of less_than0.05 were considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
