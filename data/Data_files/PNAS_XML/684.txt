Confined catalysis under two-dimensional materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Small spaces in nanoreactors may have big implications in chemistry, because the chemical nature of molecules and reactions within the nanospaces can be changed significantly due to the nanoconfinement effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-dimensional (2D) nanoreactor formed under 2D materials can provide a well-defined model system to explore the confined catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate a general tendency for weakened surface adsorption under the confinement of graphene overlayer, illustrating the feasible modulation of surface reactions by placing a 2D cover on top of the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The developed concept catalysis under cover can be applied to reactions between two opposite 2D walls interacting with each other through van der Waals force, which helps to design high-performance nanocatalysts interfacing with 2D material overlayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Confined microenvironments formed in heterogeneous catalysts have recently been recognized as equally important as catalytically active sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the fundamentals of confined catalysis has become an important topic in heterogeneous catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well-defined 2D space between a catalyst surface and a 2D material overlayer provides an ideal microenvironment to explore the confined catalysis experimentally and theoretically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using density functional theory calculations, we reveal that adsorption of atoms and molecules on a Pt(111) surface always has been weakened under monolayer graphene, which is attributed to the geometric constraint and confinement field in the 2D space between the graphene overlayer and the Pt(111) surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar result has been found on Pt(110) and Pt(100) surfaces covered with graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microenvironment created by coating a catalyst surface with 2D material overlayer can be used to modulate surface reactivity, which has been illustrated by optimizing oxygen reduction reaction activity on Pt(111) covered by various 2D materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate a concept of confined catalysis under 2D cover based on a weak van der Waals interaction between 2D material overlayers and underlying catalyst surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Schemes for confined catalysis within various microenvironments including (A) 0D pores of zeolites, (B) 1D channels of CNTs, and (C) 2D space under 2D materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catalytic sites (in green color) and reaction molecules are confined in three dimensions, two dimensions, and one dimension (marked with arrows), respectively, in the above three systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Theoretical_Models_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A 7 × 7 Pt(111) supercell with 3 × 3 graphene overlayer was used for calculations (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adsorption energy (Ead) is characterized by the binding strength of atoms or molecules with the surface,Ead=[EtotalEsurfacen]/n,  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Etotal represents total energies of Gr/Pt(111) or Pt(111) surface with adsorbed atoms or molecules and Esurface represents the total energies of bare Gr/Pt(111) or Pt(111) surfaces;  is chemical potential of free molecules or atoms; and n is number of molecules or atoms adsorbed within one supercell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, n = 1 corresponds to 1/7 monolayer (ML) coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adsorption energies were calculated on a bare Pt(111) surface and the Pt(111) surface with Gr cover, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adsorption energy difference can be used to explain confinement effect inside the 2D nanospace, which is defined as confinement energy (Econ) (19),Econ=Ead(w/Gr)Ead(w/oGr),  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Ead (w/ Gr) and Ead (w/o Gr) are the binding energies of adsorbates on Pt(111) surface with and without graphene cover, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vdW corrections have been introduced to take into consideration the weak interaction between graphene overlayers and metal surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of vdW corrections, including vdW-D2 (34), vdW-D3 (35), and vdW-DF opt-B88 (36, 37), have been attempted (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, vdW-D2 was used for all of the following calculations (for more computational details, see SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Confinement_Energy_Induced_by_2D_Cover  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Take 3/7 ML CO on Pt(111) as an example: The calculated Ead(CO) decreases from 1.94 eV for CO on the bare Pt(111) surface to 1.50 eV in case of CO adsorption between Gr and Pt(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, Econ(CO) is derived to be 0.44 eV (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface science measurements show that CO desorbs from Pt(111) surface around 420 K (38), whereas CO desorption occurs on the Gr/Pt(111) surface at 360 K (22), which is equivalent to an adsorption energy difference of around 0.3 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFT calculations and surface science experiment results are consistent with each other, indicating that the corresponding DFT parameters are reliable in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With CO coverages at 1/7 ML and 2/7 ML, the adsorption energies were calculated in the same way, and Econ(CO) is derived to be 1.41 eV and 0.68 eV, respectively (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the Econ values for all studied cases are positive, suggesting that the Gr overlayer has strongly weakened CO adsorption on the Pt(111) surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weakened CO adsorption has been found on Pt(110) and Pt(100) surfaces with Gr overlayers (SI Appendix, Table S2), indicating that the confinement effect is not dependent on the specific metal facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also examined CO adsorption energies on different sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The confinement energies increase from 1.28 eV, to 1.33 eV, to 1.41 eV for hollow, to bridge, to top sites, suggesting that CO molecules adsorbed at a higher position above the surface are more strongly influenced by the Gr confinement effect (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Geometric_Constraint_in_2D_Microenvironment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate vdW interaction between Gr ML and Pt slab, the total energy differences of the Gr/Pt(111) system at each specific distance between Gr and Pt(111) surface (dGr-Pt) relative to infinity (d) [E = Etotal  Etotal ()] were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2B, dependence of E on dGr-Pt represents a two-body potential, which is similar to the LennardJones (L-J) type (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the Pt slab approaches the Gr layer from infinity, the total energy decreases because of attractive vdW interaction between the slab and the layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equilibrium distance is 3.2 Å, with vdW interaction energy at 0.1 eV/C atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the Pt slab moves much closer to the Gr surface, the strong repulsion results in a sharp increase in the total energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The same studies were conducted on the interaction between the Gr layer and CO molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum total energy difference corresponds to dGr-CO at 3.0 Å (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of CO adsorption on Pt surface, we let the COPt slab ensemble approach the Gr layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a case, the equilibrium dGr-CO has been shortened to 2.7 Å (dGr-Pt = 5.7 Å; Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated by Fig 2C, Inset, attractive vdW interaction between the Gr layer and Pt slab pushes the CO molecule much closer to the Gr surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the interaction between Gr and CO is in the repulsion regime, and CO adsorption is destabilized in the confined space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been recently demonstrated that vdW forces between 2D materials can be so strong on a nanometer scale that huge pressure up to 1 GPa is built therein (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we conclude that the vdW interaction between the opposite walls of the 2D microenvironment has induced strong geometric constraint on trapped interlayer molecules, which contributes to the confinement effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Confinement_Field_in_2D_Microenvironment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further calculated potential distribution in the 2D space between the Gr layer and Pt(111) surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A shows the 1D potential distributions along normal of the Gr and Pt(111) surfaces with dGr-Pt at 3.2 Å, 5.7 Å, and infinity, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that potential energy near the Pt(111) surface has been strongly modified by Gr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D potential distribution images at the Gr/Pt(111) interfaces (Fig 3 B and C) show more clearly that the confined space under Gr cover presents different potential energy compared with the bare Pt(111) surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When choosing the maximum point of the potential distribution curve in the confined space as a descriptor, we find a gradual increase of the potential energy with increasing dGr-Pt (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that d-band states of Pt atoms at the Gr/Pt(111) interface remain intact in comparison with the bare Pt(111) surface (SI Appendix, Fig S3) because the localized d-bands are not susceptible to the weak interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential distribution in the 2D space is more related to decay of delocalized sp electronic states into vacuum that are affected by interaction with the Gr layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the case where an atom or molecule is adsorbed into the 2D space, Gr cover is lifted up away from the surface, which enlarges dGr-Pt, increases the potential energy, and consequently makes the system less stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Placing a graphene cover on the metal surface provides an effective way to modify the surface potential, which can be continuously tuned by dGr-Pt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an effect is similar to applying an external electric field onto a solid electrode surface (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the perspective of quantum effect, the Gr cover acts as a constraint boundary for molecular orbitals of an adsorbate, which cannot relax farther away from the surface sufficiently compared to the case of adsorption on an open surface (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, confining molecule adsorption under Gr implies an increase in energy levels of the molecular orbitals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the confinement effect in 2D microenvironment can be understood as a kind of confinement field imposed by the Gr cover, which destabilizes the surface adsorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generalized_Confinement_Effect_in_2D_Microenvironment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The confinement effect aroused in 2D microenvironments is not limited to the graphene cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this point, a hypothetical experiment was performed by replacing the graphene layer with a layer of inert gas Ne atoms (SI Appendix, Fig S4), and the dimension of 2D space was kept unchanged, i.e., dNe-Pt is the same as dGr-Pt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see that the change of local potential distribution in the Ne-overlayer-confined space is similar to that in the graphene-confined space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Econ(CO) in the 2D microenvironment with dNe-Pt at 5.7 Å is calculated as 1.35 eV at 1/7 ML CO coverage, which is also similar to that under the graphene layer (1.41 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that Ne atoms are almost chemically inert, the similar influence of the Ne layer on CO adsorption suggests that the confinement effects are closely related to the vdW interaction between two opposite walls of the confined space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other noble gas atoms like He and Ar (SI Appendix, Fig S4) have a similar effect on the confinement energy and surface potential distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Econ in the 2D space between Gr and Pt(111) has been calculated for various adsorbates, including nonmetal atoms (H, C, N, O, and S), alkali metal atoms (Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs), and small molecules (CO, NO, H2O, and NH3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the equilibrium dGr-Pt with an adsorbate adsorbed between Gr and Pt was obtained as well (SI Appendix, Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4, all Econ values with the adsorbate coverage at 1/7 ML are positive, which means that adsorption of all these adsorbates on the Pt surface is weakened in the confined space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same tendency was observed at 3/7 ML coverage, but Econ at 1/7 ML coverage is higher than that at 3/7 ML coverage (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the same coverage, Econ increases almost monotonically with dGr-Pt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Econ data of nonmetal atoms and molecules can be fitted by the following equation (red dashed line in Fig 4):Econ=1/(8)(dGr-Pt-d0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the case of 1/7 ML coverage, the fitted  is 1/7.03, d0 is 3.27 Å, and  is 0.49 with the coefficient of determination R2 = 0.97.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fitting of Econ data from 3/7 ML adsorbates on the Gr/Pt(111) surface also produces  around 3/6.89, d0 around 3.48 Å, and  at 0.49 with R2 = 0.99 (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the fitted parameter of  is strongly related to the adsorbate coverage, and d0 corresponds to the equilibrium distance between Gr cover and Pt(111) surface at the Gr/Pt(111) interface (3.2 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This root equation can be used to fit the calculated Econ data from the h-BN/Pt(111) surface as well (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Such a more quantitative analysis of Econ reveals two interesting points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, Econ is dependent on the adsorbate coverage, and is higher at a lower coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coverage-dependent Econ can be understood as that the confinement effect has been averaged by more adsorbed atoms or molecules at the higher coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, Econ is strongly determined by the size of the 2D confined space and, more specifically, the change of dGr-Pt, i.e., dGr-Pt = dGr-Pt  d0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stronger response of the confined microenvironment to the adsorption, the stronger the confinement effect induced, which is similar to the dynamic response of spheroproteins in an enzyme to reactions over the cofactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D confined space under the Gr overlayer provides a flexible microenvironment, in which the space thickness is dynamically adjusted with adsorbates inside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, intercalation of CO at Gr/metal interfaces produces a larger space than the H intercalation (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structural flexibility in the 2D confined system is in contrast to the 0D and 1D confined systems, which cannot adapt their pore sizes and tube diameters to reactions occurring inside (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that Econ values of alkali metals are slightly lower relative to other atoms and molecules (blue dashed line in Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference was understood by analysis of electron density at the interfaces, taking Li and O atoms as examples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown by Fig 4, Insets, electron transfer between Li and Gr cover is much stronger than that of O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong electronic interaction between adsorbate and Gr makes the adsorbate more stable to stay at the interface, which decreases Econ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general tendency, that the 2D confinement effect induces weakened adsorption, relies on a premise that there is a weak interaction between adsorbates and the top cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modulating_Reactions_Under_2D_Cover  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In light of the BrønstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relation, catalytic activity is related to the dissociative adsorption energy (Ediss) of a reactant on a catalyst surface, which presents a volcano curve (1, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A good catalyst should have a moderate Ediss, which is close to the apex of the volcano curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that the BEP relation remains intact, in view of the feasible modulation of surface adsorption in 2D confined spaces, we attempt to take advantage of the confinement effect to modulate Ediss and the reaction activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our calculations show that Ediss values of various molecules at the interface between Gr and Pt(111) are smaller than those on bare Pt(111) surface (SI Appendix, Fig S7), indicating that the dissociation process is more difficult with Gr cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Gr cover can eventually move Ediss toward the right side in the volcano curve such that the overall activity of reactions on the left side of the volcano curve will be improved whereas those on the right side will be suppressed (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The confinement-induced modulation of surface reactivity is illustrated in Fig 5 for Pt-catalyzed ORR under 2D covers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been well known that O binding energy is generally used as a descriptor for the ORR reaction activity (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Pt is regarded as a good catalyst for this reaction, there is still much room to improve its performance, because Pt sits on the left side of the volcano curve (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various routes to weaken the binding of O atoms on the Pt surface have been attempted, to promote the reactions (45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the above-mentioned 2D confined catalysis concept, we suggest that the reactivity of Pt(111) toward ORR can be modulated by placing various 2D covers atop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ML graphene, h-BN, graphane (fully hydrogenated Gr) (47), graphone (half hydrogenated Gr) (48), and graphitic ZnO (g-ZnO) (49) were chosen to tune the surface adsorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding energies of surface oxygen species (EO*) on bare Pt(111) surface and the Pt(111) surface with different 2D covers were calculated, which decrease in the sequence of Pt(111)  Gr/Pt(111)  h-BN/Pt(111)  graphane/Pt(111)  graphone/Pt(111)  g-ZnO/Pt(111).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the calculated binding energies of EO* on different metals with vdW corrections are close to those without vdW corrections (SI Appendix, Fig S9 and Table S6), the same volcano curve proposed by Nørskov et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (42) was used here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted in the volcano plot for the different 2D cover/Pt(111) surfaces (Fig 5), covering the Pt(111) surface with graphene, h-BN, graphane, and graphone MLs all enhance the ORR activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, the graphane cover exhibits the largest enhancement, because EO* has been tuned close to the apex of the volcano curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 2D material layers such as Gr, h-BN, and MoS2 have been prepared on many substrates (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite ultrathin thickness, the 2D material sheets are quite stable under harsh conditions, e.g., there is no oxidation of graphene at 400 °C (50) and oxidation resistance of h-BN up to 850 °C in O2 (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When exposed to gaseous or liquid environments, molecules or solutions can diffuse underneath the 2D covers via an intercalation process, confirming that 2D material/solid interfaces act as stable and practical nanoreactors (see references in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface science experiments confirm that molecule adsorption in the 2D confined space has been significantly weakened (22, 26, 28, 29, 52), which is consistent with the theoretical prediction in the present work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both gas-phase and aqueous phase reactions have been experimentally observed in the 2D spaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More interestingly, the Gr or h-BN covers can promote reactions underneath the 2D overlayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, CO oxidation on Pt(111) has been enhanced by covering the Pt surface with Gr and h-BN layers (22, 28), and metal corrosion has been accelerated in the presence of Gr overlayers (53, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our calculation results for the feasible modulation of reactions under 2D covers can be solidified by recent reaction data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that reactions occurring in the 2D confined spaces may be limited by surface diffusion under the 2D overlayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this issue, we calculated diffusion barriers of CO on Pt(111) with and without Gr overlayer (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that molecule diffusion happens with similar barriers on the two surfaces, and diffusion under 2D covers may not be a limiting step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the confined catalysis under 2D materials can be applied to supported nanocatalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metal nanoparticles may be encapsulated by 2D materials, forming coreshell nanostructures in which the active core structures are well protected by the outer shells and catalyst stability is improved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports confirm that CO oxidation, methanation, and ORR reactions happen on the metal nanocatalysts covered with Gr or h-BN shells (5558).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, enhanced ORR activity has been observed on Pt nanocatalysts with Gr shells (5759), which is consistent with our theory prediction illustrated in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We show that 2D confined microenvironments created between 2D material overlayers and underlying metal surfaces can be used to explore confined catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vdW interaction between the opposite walls of the 2D microenvironment induces the geometric constraint for adsorbed atoms and molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the 2D cover modifies potential distribution at the metal surface, making surface adsorption less energetically stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometric constraint and confinement field aroused in the 2D space result in a general tendency of intercalated species to adsorb on the metal surface weakly, which can be used to modulate surface reactivity and enhance ORR activity on Pt covered with various 2D materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concept can be applied to design novel nanocatalysts interfacing with 2D materials with improved performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
