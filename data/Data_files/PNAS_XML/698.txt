Paper-based plasma sanitizers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conventional plasma-based treatments deactivate microbes in confined, nonatmospheric chambers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the last few decades, new concepts have led to portable, chamberless generators with rigid configurations of electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work explores unique designs and methods of antimicrobial sanitization with flexible plasma generators consisting of laminated assemblies of patterned, metallized paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under oscillating potentials (±1 to ±10 kV from 100 Hz to 8 kHz), the paper-based devices produced plasma that deactivated 99% of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli cells with 30 s of treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future uses of this type of plasma generator might include the sanitization of protective garments, origami- or kirigami-like devices, and humanmachine user interfaces in healthcare and/or contaminated environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This work describes disposable plasma generators made from metallized paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fabricated plasma generators with layered and patterned sheets of paper provide a simple and flexible format for dielectric barrier discharge to create atmospheric plasma without an applied vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The porosity of paper allows gas to permeate its bulk volume and fuel plasma, while plasma-induced forced convection cools the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When electrically driven with oscillating peak-to-peak potentials of ±1 to ±10 kV, the paper-based devices produced both volume and surface plasmas capable of killing microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasma sanitizers deactivated greater than 99% of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and greater than 99.9% of Escherichia coli cells with 30 s of noncontact treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterization of plasma generated from the sanitizers revealed a detectable level of UV-C (1.9 nWcm2nm1), modest surface temperature (60 °C with 60 s of activation), and a high level of ozone (13 ppm with 60 s of activation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results deliver insights into the mechanisms and suitability of paper-based substrates for active antimicrobial sanitization with scalable, flexible sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, this work shows how paper-based generators are conformable to curved surfaces, appropriate for kirigami-like stretchy structures, compatible with user interfaces, and suitable for sanitization of microbes aerosolized onto a surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, these disposable plasma generators represent progress toward biodegradable devices based on flexible renewable materials, which may impact the future design of protective garments, skin-like sensors for robots or prosthetics, and user interfaces in contaminated environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fabrication_of_Plasma-Generating_Devices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each paper-based plasma generator, we prepared two 150-µm sheets of metallized paper (A-550; AR Metallizing) patterned with a laser engraver (VLS 2.3; Universal Laser Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 depicts the laminated structure of the devices and the metallized paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we engraved repeated hexagons (honeycombs) on the devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a pattern uses a minimal amount of total perimeter to cover a surface (39) and permits generation of atmospheric plasma along the edges of the hexagonal grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By tuning the size/spacing of the honeycombs, it is possible to ensure the plasma has coverage over the entirety of a patterned surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As illustrated in Fig 1A, we bonded the nonconductive sides of two sheets of laser-engraved metallized paper with a 30-µm-thick adhesive layer (Ad-Tech 5645; Adhesive Technology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To connect the patterned conductive regions to an external power supply, we bonded wires to the metallized paper with water- and silver-based inks (Conductive Compounds Company) in similar fashion to that described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_of_Plasma  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The paper-based plasma generators in this work rely on the working principle of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first demonstration of DBD-based plasma was in 1857 by Siemens (14), but the first report of DBD for deactivation of microbes was not until the mid-1990s (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasma originates from the discharge between two electrodes separated by a dielectric medium, which, in our work, is a porous matrix of cellulose fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To produce plasma, we first produced sinusoidal signals with frequencies ranging from 1 to 8 kHz and peak-to-peak voltages Vp-p ranging from ±1 to ±5 V using a function generator (4011A; BK Precision).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we amplified this signal using a high-voltage amplifier (model 10/10; TREK) with a gain of 1,000 to output a high oscillating potential Vp-p ranging from ±1 to ±5 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generation of plasma was also frequency dependent, which suggests the existence of an optimal frequency at a given electric potential to generate uniform coverage of plasma (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power consumptions for typical paper-based plasma generators demonstrated in this work were less than 20 W (18 W for RMS 2.2 kV at 8 mA) going into the device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DBD can produce two types of plasma (i.e., volume plasma and surface plasma) depending on the configuration of the device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both configurations consist of one or more dielectric insulators sandwiched by two electrodes, volume plasma usually has a gap of air between the two electrodes, whereas surface plasma does not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasma presented in this work was a combination of both volume plasma and surface plasma because of the porosity of the metallized paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1A illustrates the typical geometry and locations of the volume and surface plasmas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The paper-based plasma generators produced glowing plasma and perceptible ozone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1C shows a flexible, functioning plasma generator in the form of a logotype with an internally etched, honeycomb pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sample was under the excitation of a peak-to-peak voltage of ±3 kV at 1.7 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1D shows another functioning rectangular plasma generator conforming to a cylindrical substrate (diameter of 100 mm) while generating glowing plasma activated with a peak-to-peak voltage Vp-p of ±2 kV at 1 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterization of the plasma (Supporting Information) also showed a detectable level of UV-C (1.9 nWcm2nm1; Fig S1), modest surface temperature (60 °C with 60 s of activation; Fig S2B), and a high level of ozone (13 ppm with 60 s of activation; Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2A and S3 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Noncontact_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the efficacy of paper-based plasma sanitizers, we performed experimental studies with two setups (i.e., a noncontact experiment and a direct-contact experiment for both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In noncontact experiments, we prepared circular plasma sanitizers with metallized paper and measured the ozone levels (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sanitizer had a diameter of 90 mm, matching the inner diameter of the lid of a Petri dish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By attaching the sanitizer to the inner surface of the lid, we avoided touching the sanitizer during experiments, which would have led to unintentional contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When closed, the surface of the paper-based sanitizer was 10 mm away from the surface of the yeast extractpeptonedextrose (YEPD) and LuriaBertani (LB) solid media, on which the S. cerevisiae or E. coli suspension was inoculated aseptically in the Petri dish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 A and B illustrates the setup of the noncontact experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We inoculated 100 L of S. cerevisiae and E. coli cell suspensions on YEPD and LB solid media, respectively, and then covered the Petri dish with the plasma generator attached to the lid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lead of the circular sanitizer ran through the gap between the lid and the Petri dish to an AC input with a frequency of 2 kHz and a peakpeak voltage of ±3.15 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were six groups of experiments with varied times of exposure, each consisting of five repetitive samples for both S. cerevisiae and E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct-Contact_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our noncontact experiments demonstrated the ability to deactivate bacteria on agar a set distance away from the sanitizers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, it is desirable to deactivate microbes that have landed on a substrate itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Keypads, shared user interfaces, clothing, and garments exemplify direct-contact applications involving surface contamination with microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A human sneeze is one method of spreading infectious microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simulate a sneezean abrupt expulsion of secretions, saliva, and microorganisms from the respiratory tractand evaluate the efficacy of paper-based plasma generators in decontaminating themselves, we developed an experimental setup (Fig 3A) with a pneumatic dispensing system (Performus II; Nordson EFD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a gauge pressure of 11 psi and a dispensing time of 50 s, an intranasal drug delivery device (MAD Nasal; LMA) aerosolized a liquid suspension of S. cerevisiae or E.coli onto our paper-based plasma generators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fine mist of generated droplets had diameters ranging from 30 to 100 m. Having a diameter less than 100 m, these droplets are similar in size to 95% of droplets in a sneeze (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Noncontact_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The plasma generators applied treatments for 0 (control), 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 s. Immediately after timed treatment, we incubated each sample at 30 °C for 48 h. Fig 2D shows the resulting quantities of colonies of S. cerevisiae after incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 s of active treatment, the mean number of colonies decreased to 16.14, or an inactivation rate of 91.85%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 20 and 30 s of treatment, the inactivation rate for yeast became 97.89% and 99.34%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2E shows the efficacy of using plasma to kill E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With only 10 s of treatment, the resulting inactivation rate was as high as 99.93%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatments longer than 10 s resulted in an average of less than one remaining colony, representing efficiencies greater than 99.9%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2C shows the comparison between the control group and the 10-s group of E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results for both S. cerevisiae and E. coli indicate efficiencies as high as 99% with plasma treatment for only 30 s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the common measures in microbiology is the decimal reduction time, or D value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, it is the time t required to inactivate 90% of the cells of a given microorganism in a medium at a specified temperature:Dvalue=tlogN0logNt,[1]where N0 is the initial population and Nt is the population at the end of the test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the experimental results, the D values for both S. cerevisiae and E. coli were less than 10 s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct-Contact_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After dispensing suspensions of S. cerevisiae or E. coli directly onto the honeycomb-patterned side of a circular paper-based generator, we activated plasma for 0 (control), 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 s. Then, we transferred the cells attached to the surface of the plasma generator onto a solid media of YEPD or LB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During transfer, we manually applied pressure to the back of the generator for 10 s, and then discarded the generator after use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inoculated media stayed in the oven at a temperature of 30 °C for 48 h. We also adopted a blank control (BC) group, which contained the same type of paper-based plasma generator but was not activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3B shows quantitative results from sanitizing S. cerevisiae in the direct-contact experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With 60 s of plasma treatment, there were no observable cells on the YEPD media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3C shows the quantitative results from sanitizing E. coli in the direct-contact experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With only 10 s of treatment, there were no observable colonies on the LB media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Contamination_and_Self-Sanitization_of_Metallized_Paper  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Metallized paper, generally used for labeling and printed media, is not an inherently sterile product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the metallized paper likely possessed contaminants on its surfaces and within its porous structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When examining the experimental results, we observed nonspecific contaminants/colonies (i.e., microbes not associated with E. coli or S. cerevisiae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By examining the DNA sequence of the unspecified colonies, we identified them as Bacillus, a type of bacteria that can be difficult to irradiate with chemical solvents, such as isopropyl alcohol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, there were two control groups: one with inoculation and one without inoculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both control groups, we found some of the media had Bacillus contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of the samples appeared to be contaminated after 30 s of active plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, experimental results suggest that, by generating volume plasma, the metallized paper also treated itself and removed Bacillus from its fibrous interior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is particularly notable because Bacillus species are generally difficult to kill due to the production of resistant endospores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Paper-Based_Disposable_Garments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After exposure to hazardous microbes, self-sanitizing garments might decontaminate themselves before being transported offsite and reduce the risk of harmful release of contaminated materials during shipping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, low-cost plasma generators may reduce the rate of morbidity and mortality resulting from nosocomial infections (i.e., diseases or infections acquired in a hospital or healthcare facility) (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the outbreak of the highly contagious Ebola virus, there was an increased interest in developing viable, cost-effective techniques for disinfection and enhanced personal protection equipment (4345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have experimentally characterized the effectiveness of paper-based plasma generators for active antimicrobial sanitization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate the potential use of the devices in garment-like systems, we prepared a rectangular, paper-based band with one-half of the surface area covered with a hexagonal, conductive layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no conductive layer on the other half as we removed it with laser ablation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This design produced plasma on only one-half of the surface area and reserved the other half as a control group with Kapton tape attached to its surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 A and D shows the configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the experiments, we first wrapped the paper-based band around a researchers wrist, and then carefully sprayed an aerosolized suspension of E. coli on the surface of the band to ensure approximately equal distribution of the E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of the suspension was 3 × 108 cells/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we removed the band from the wrist and connected the electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 BD depicts these steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After activating the atmospheric plasma, we removed the electrodes and transferred the cells to the surface of a preprepared LB medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we incubated the medium at 37 °C for 48 h. Fig 4E shows the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movie S2 shows the experiment in motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Scalability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within the limits on the size of acquired metallized paper and working area of the laser engraver, we created paper-based, plasma generators with dimensions up to 400 mm × 276 mm, which is 20 times larger than the logotype-based, plasma generator shown in Fig 1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the device shown in Fig 5A, the frequency of excitation (100 Hz at a voltage Vp-p of ±3kV) to generate plasma was much lower than that used with the smaller devices previously described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the electrical resistance scales with the size of the device, especially considering the 10-nm-thick layer of aluminum in the metallized paper (35), this observation agrees with previously reported methods of decreasing the frequency of applied voltage to generate plasma through resistive barrier discharge (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Self-Sanitizing_Capacitive_Touchpad  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on previously developed capacitive touch sensors, we etched traces to fabricate a keypad (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By integrating atmospheric plasma generators with this keypad, these devices can potentially sanitize themselves after being touched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5B shows a sequential operation, including touching the button with two fingers to activate corresponding LEDs, and activating the plasma to sanitize the buttons with a frequency of 500 Hz and a Vp-p of ± 2.5 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth mentioning that the conductive traces on the touchpad were at least 2.5 mm away from each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Narrower gaps resulted in discharges and nonuniform ablation of the conductive layer of aluminum during activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movie S3 shows this demonstration in motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Kirigami-Like_Plasma_Generators  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kirigami uses the cutting of paper to create decorative or functional objects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof-of-concept example, we created a kirigami-based device with an initial geometry of a 2D square as shown in Fig 5C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When stretched, it opened into a 3D structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excitation frequency of this device was 500 Hz while the peak-to-peak voltage was ±2.5 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kirigami-based devices might be useful for building conformable electronics that require stretching or bending about more than one axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this article, we have introduced a concept for antimicrobial sanitization with flexible and disposable plasma generators made of paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design is simple, with back-to-back bonding of two sheets of metallized paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The porosity of paper allows gas to permeate its bulk volume and fuel plasma, while forced convection cools the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mechanisms suggest fibrous, paper-like substrates may be appropriate in the design and fabrication of flexible devices to produce both volume and surface plasmas capable of killing microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With oscillating peak-to-peak potentials ranging from ±1 to ±10 kV, the paper-based plasma generators deactivated greater than 99% of S. cerevisiae and greater than 99.9% of E. coli cells with 30 s of treatment on neighboring substrates with an offset distance of 10 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also demonstrated how paper-based generators are conformable to curved surfaces, suitable for sanitization of aerosolized microbes onto a substrate, appropriate for kirigami-like stretchy structures, and compatible with user interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, paper-based plasma generators may be appropriate as antimicrobial protectors for skin-like sensors, self-sterilizing garments, devices for sterilizing laboratory or biomedical equipment, smart bandages for wound healing, or sacrificial components in manufacturing processes that apply patterned surface treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strains_of_Microbes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 (Clontech Laboratories) and Escherichia coli strain TOP10 (Invitrogen) served as samples of fungus and bacteria in our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. cerevisiae strain AH109 is a yeast strain usually used for two-hybrid screening in biological research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli TOP10 is an ideal bacterial strain for high-efficiency cloning and plasmid propagation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_Media_and_Microbes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We cultured S. cerevisiae strain AH109 and E. coli strain TOP10 with YEPD medium and LB medium, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The YEPD broth contained 1% [mass/volume (m/vol)] yeast extract (Difco; Becton Dickinson), 2% (m/vol) peptone (Sigma-Aldrich), 2% (m/vol) dextrose (VWR International), and the rest was distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The YEPD solid medium consisted of 0.3% (m/vol) yeast extract, 1% (m/vol) peptone, 1% (m/vol) dextrose, 2% (m/vol) agar (Difco; Becton Dickinson), with the rest being distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prepared LB medium with the dehydrated culture media of LB (powder form) (Difco; Becton Dickinson) and proper hydration with distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prepared LB medium contained 2.5% (m/vol) LB powder, and the rest was distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LB solid medium consisted of 2.5% (m/vol) LB powder, 1.5% (m/vol) agar, with the rest being distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autoclavation of all media lasted for 20 min at 121 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the solid media of both YEPD and LB, it contained 25 mL of media in each Petri dish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We cultured S. cerevisiae and E. coli in YEPD broth and LB broth, respectively, at 150 rpm in an orbital incubator shaker (model 3527; Lab-Line Instrumentations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The culturing lasted for 24 h at room temperature (25 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected the microbes by centrifuging (Clinical 100; VWR International) the cultures at 4,000 rpm (1,520 × g) for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both S. cerevisiae and E. coli cells were in suspension with sterilized distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the concentration of S. cerevisiae and E. coli in the suspension, we used a spectrophotometer (Genesys 10s UV-VIS; Thermo Scientific) to measure the value of OD600, which indicated the optical density of samples measured at a wavelength of 600 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured OD600 of S. cerevisiae and E. coli were 1.037 and 0.867, indicating concentrations of 6.22 × 107 and 6.94 × 108 cells per mL, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the concentrations were diluted to 2.07 × 103 and 2.50 × 104 cells per mL, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Image_Acquisition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unless otherwise specified, this work used a Nikon D7100 camera with an 18- to 105-mm lens to acquire images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some still images of the plasma, we used extended exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only digital modification of images was in contrast and brightness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Measurement_of_Absolute_Irradiance_of_Emitted_UV_Light  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize emitted electromagnetic radiation from the plasma generator and the corresponding absolute irradiance, we used a spectroradiometer (USB2000+; Ocean Optics) calibrated for wavelengths ranging from 200 to 850 nm to perform the measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It had a cosine corrector-attached fiber mounted 2 mm away and perpendicular to the surface of the plasma generator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a distance enabled the measurement over a single hexagonal cell on the plasma generator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By multiplying the measurements on a single cell by the total number of hexagonal cells on a plasma generator, we obtained the total irradiance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig S1, the highest peaks occurred for wavelengths between 315 and 400 nm in the UV A (UVA) regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple peaks occurred between 400 and 500 nm, which correspond to the visible blue and violet colors captured in photographs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were also detectable levels of UV B (UVB) and UV C (UVC) from the plasma generator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that UVC is one of the critical factors in disinfection technologies (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_Ozone_Level  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As introduced in previous work (47), when dielectric barrier discharge is in progress, the reaction of free oxygen atoms with oxygen generates a significant amount of ozone based on the following reaction:O+O2+MO3+M,[S1]where M is an involved collision partner, such as O2, O3, and N2 (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly reactive ozone can also react with oxygen atoms created from the electron impact dissociation of O2:O3+O+M2O2+M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experimental setup for characterizing ozone level in atmospheric environment consists of three major components: an enclosed glass chamber (35 cm × 35 cm × 63 cm), a fast response UV-based ozone monitor (model 205; 2B Technologies), and a LabVIEW-based (LabVIEW 2014; National Instruments) high-speed data acquisition system (NI 9215; National Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure the ozone concentration, we placed a circular paper-based plasma sterilizer at one lower corner of the chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intake tubing of the ozone monitor sat in the center of the chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of them sat on the floor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ozone monitor recorded two samples per second with a resolution of 0.1 ppb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S3 depicts the experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measured the profiles of ozone level for 40 min with plasma activated for 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 120 s. The AC input to all of the devices had a frequency of 2 kHz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 6.3 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ozone concentration, with plasma activation for different lengths of time, arrived at peak values within the first 200 s. It then decayed to a much lower level of 50 ppb after 2,000 s (about 33 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S1 shows the peak values of ozone level for each measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although ozone level is dependent on the size of the space over which we conducted the measurements, the experimental results demonstrated that the paper-based plasma sterilizer was able to generate a significant amount of ozone within a short time as shown in Table S1 and Fig S2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these measurements of ozone, we also conducted specific measurements to detect the ozone concentration in a circular Petri dish, which has a diameter of 100 mm and a thickness of 15 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, within such a limited space, the ozone quicklywithin secondsaccumulated to values out of the measurable range (200 ppm) of the ozone monitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_Surface_Temperature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Temperature is one of the controlled parameters in conventional approaches to disinfection, such as pasteurization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we targeted low surface temperatures with plasma-based sanitization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase of surface temperature results mainly from Joule heating in the layer of aluminum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize the changing surface temperature, we used an Arduino-based temperature logging system to track the change of temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A precalibrated noncontact IR thermometer (MLX90614; Melexis Microelectronic Systems) monitored the change of temperature at a distance of 2 cm pointing to the center of the circular plasma sterilizer, which is identical to the ones we used in noncontact experiments, at an ambient temperature of 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S2B shows the surface temperature as a function of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a fixed frequency of 2 kHz and varied voltages VP-P ranging from ±1.5 to ±3 kV, the surface temperature did not exceed 60 °C after a 60-s activation of the plasma generator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Customizable_Paper-Based_Generators  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the advantages of paper-based plasma generators is its capability of sanitizing adjacent objects in addition to itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the use of paper as the substrate for plasma generators enables the customizability of devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate these features, we prepared another paper-based plasma generator with the geometry of the spirit mark of Rutgers, a capitalized letter R. As Fig S4 shows, we adopted the pattern of repeated hexagons to provide coverage with plasma over the entirety of the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To perform these experiments, we first aerosolized a suspension of E. coli onto one side of a sterilized, circular polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film (Mylar 201; DuPont Teijin Films) with a diameter of 135 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we placed it on the top of a sterilized glass plate sitting in a recirculating hood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the surface of the PET film was dry, we placed the R-shaped plasma generator on the surface of the film with the hexagonal pattern facing the film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we gently placed a glass cover on it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purpose of using the glass cover was to ensure the flatness of the R-shaped plasma generator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S4A shows the setup at this step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With an AC source (Vp-p = ±3 kV, f = 1.7 kHz), we activated the plasma for 10, 20, 30, and 60 s. After removing the plasma generator, we transferred E. coli cells by attaching the top surface of the PET film onto the surface of LB medium in a Petri dish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medium went through a 24-h incubation at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S4B shows the distribution of E. coli on the LB medium after a treatment of 10 s. The central area previously covered and sanitized by the R-shaped, paper-based plasma generator exhibited only several colonies of E. coli, whereas the uncovered area yielded numerous colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, even though the plasma generator had a specific geometry that could presumably result in a sanitized, R-shaped region free of E. coli cells, the result did not present such a region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of geometric definition was mainly because of the absence of precise control of the plasma, which is convective and diffusive in fluidic nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movie S1 demonstrates the experiments described in this section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movie S4 demonstrates plasma-based convective flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Disinfection_of_Tools_and_Equipment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed rigorous disinfection on all of the tools, including tweezers, inoculation loops, scissors, etc., by submerging them in ethanol with a concentration of 99%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, they went through a flame for further disinfection before use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circular paper-based plasma generators sat in a UV disinfection cabinet for 5 h before use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed all of the experiments in a recirculating fume hood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_Dielectric_Strength  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the application of high electric fields was capable of leading to dielectric breakdown of the plasma generators, we characterized the dielectric strength of metallized paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S5 AC, there were three types of samples (i.e., single layer, double layers with a top-to-bottom configuration, and double layers with a bottom-to-bottom configuration).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, top refers to the upper, aluminum conductive layer of metallized paper, and bottom refers to the lower, cellulose fiber layer of the metallized paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth mentioning that, in the double-layer configurations, a minimum margin with a width of 3 mm from the edges of one layer to the other is necessary to avoid direct discharge between the two aluminum layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possible discharge is mainly because the dielectric strength of air (3.0 MV/m) is lower than that of the composite of polymers and cellulose fibers in the metallized paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the dielectric strength, we first used a short-time method by placing a sample between two electrodes and by gradually increasing the voltage across both sides of the metallized paper until a breakdown occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we used a slow rate-of-rise method to acquire more accurate breakdown voltages by gradually increasing the voltage from 50% of the breakdown voltage determined in the previous short-time method until breakdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dielectric strength of a single layer had mean values between 10 and 50 MV/m based on five measurements at frequencies ranging from 0.01 to 30 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a two-layer structure with a top-to-bottom configuration, the mean value of dielectric strength was between 40 and 56 MV/m at frequencies ranging from 0.01 to 10 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a two-layer structure with a bottom-to-bottom configuration, the mean value of dielectric strength was between 55 and 82 MV/m at frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 10 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the frequency approached 0.01 kHz, the breakdown voltage for the bottom-to-bottom configuration was higher than the maximum provided voltage (±10 kV) from the power supply system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S5D shows the measured results of the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Self-Sanitization_with_Volume_Plasma  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Volume plasma facilitates the sanitization of contaminants residing in the fibrous interior of paper-based devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the role of volume plasma in self-sanitization, we conducted an additional set of experiments by intentionally contaminating the nonpatterned, paper-based plasma generators (Fig 1 F and G) with dry spores of an airborne Penicillium sp., and then activating plasma for 2 min with a Vp-p of ±2.5 kV at 2 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after the treatment, we split the samples along the centerline and transferred the spores at the edge to potato dextrose agar (Neogen Corporation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S6 AF illustrates the procedure of the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microscopic image in Fig S6A shows the asexual reproductive structures [i.e., conidiophore, asexual spores (conidia)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We stained the sample with 1% aniline blue solution to make it prominent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S6 G and H shows the comparison between an experimental group and a control group after 48 h of incubation at 30 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two edges in the experimental group were free of colonies/spores of the Penicillium sp., whereas the edges in the control group had colonies/spores growing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the specific species of the Penicillium, we extracted DNA from the isolated fungus obtained from the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we conducted PCR with two primers, LR3R (5-GTCTTGAAACACGGACC-3) and LR5 (5-TCCTGAGGGAAACTTCG-3), to amplify a 310-bp conserved region of 5.8S ribosomal RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purified PCR product went to GENWIZE for sequencing, and the results were analyzed with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result showed the 638- to 948-bp 5.8S rRNA region of the isolated fungus matched the same region of many Penicillium citrinum isolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both molecular and morphological results indicate that the fungus is a Penicillium citrinum species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flexibility  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the flexibility of paper-based generators, we used straight tubes with varied radii ranging from R = 9.5 mm to R = 46 mm and attached generators to the surfaces of these tubes (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a peakpeak voltage Vp-p of ±3.15 kV at 2 kHz (the same AC input we applied to generators produced for the biological experiments), the paper-based sanitizers still functioned and produced plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when attached to a tube with R = 3.2 mm, the device was not able to generate plasma because of cracking in the aluminum layer of the paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Durability_of_Paper-Based_Sanitizers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We attached a circular paper-based sanitizer to a segment of a cylindrical, polyethylene piece of foam with a diameter of 75 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we fixed the sample inside a closed desiccator (Nalgene; Thermo Scientific) with an internal volume of 10.2 L. Then, we inserted the gas inlet of an ozone monitor to the container (Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the durability of the paper-based sanitizer, we activated the plasma for 30 s, and then stopped and waited until the level of ozone dropped to lower than 200 ppb over 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed eight repetitive cycles with a Vp-p of ±3.15 kV at 2 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During each trial, the ozone monitor logged data continuously with an averaging time of 2 s over the recorded raw data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S8A shows that there may have been a break-in period for the device, as the first trial produced less ozone than that measured in subsequent trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sanitization_at_Varied_Distances  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 shows the effective deactivation of both S. cerevisiae and E. coli with paper-based sanitizers 10 mm away from the surface of the agar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the effect of varied distances on the effectiveness of sanitization, we performed two additional sets of noncontact experiments with circular, paper-based sanitizers 10 and 20 mm away from the surface of agar (Fig S9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microbes used in the additional experiments were S. cerevisiae with a concentration of 1 × 104 cells per mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both sets of experiments shared the same times of treatment and AC input (Vp-p = ±3.15 kV, f = 2 kHz) to the paper-based sanitizers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the six test groups, there were seven repetitive samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after timed treatment, we incubated each sample at 30 °C for 48 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S9B shows the experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the distance was 20 mm, the effectiveness of sanitization resembled that when the distance was 10 mmin fact, there were slightly higher degrees of deactivation of S. cerevisiae cells within the same amount of time in each group, except the ones with 120-s treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One plausible explanation is that ozone is the dominating factor in sanitization with these paper-based devices at these distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the larger Petri dishes, there were larger initial quantities of air than in the smaller Petri dishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With more fuel available in larger Petri dishes, it is possible that the plasma generators were able to convert the readily available fuel quickly into ozone to create similar concentrations of ozone in the Petri dishes within 10 s of activated treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the experimental results suggest that distance may not affect the effectiveness of sanitization, as long as the enclosed space fills quickly with a high concentration of ozone produced by the plasma generators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Boiling_Versus_Plasma_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an alternative technology for sanitization/sterilization, plasma might avoid potential damage to surfaces/structures of objects under treatment that might occur with conventional technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate this point, we conducted two experimentsone used boiling, and the other used plasmato treat two samples made of a heat-shrinking polyolefin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At elevated temperatures as low as 70 °C, a heat-shrinking polyolefin can experience significant changes in its size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, deactivating microbes on surfaces of polyolefins might not be ideal with heat or boiling water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Fig S10A shows, the sample shrank significantly in boiling water at 100 °C for only 2 s. In contrast, a sample in direct contact with a paper-based plasma generator did not exhibit observable shrinkage when treated for 60 s as shown in Fig S10B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
