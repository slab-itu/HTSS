title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alpha-vcontaining integrins are host receptors for the Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite surface protein, TRAP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Malaria is caused by a parasite that is deposited in the skin through the bite of an infected mosquito.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the skin, parasites navigate through host tissues where they must locate and invade liver cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We know that a parasite surface protein called TRAP is important for this process, making it a leading vaccine candidate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRAP is thought to work by specifically binding a defined host cell surface protein, but its identity has remained a long-standing mystery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our research has identified an integrina class of host cell surface proteinsas a TRAP receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding provides an important piece of the puzzle relating to TRAP function and may help improve the development of an effective malaria vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Malaria-causing Plasmodium sporozoites are deposited in the dermis by the bite of an infected mosquito and move by gliding motility to the liver where they invade and develop within host hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although extracellular interactions between Plasmodium sporozoite ligands and host receptors provide important guidance cues for productive infection and are good vaccine targets, these interactions remain largely uncharacterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (TRAP) is a parasite cell surface ligand that is essential for both gliding motility and invasion because it couples the extracellular binding of host receptors to the parasite cytoplasmic actinomyosin motor; however, the molecular nature of the host TRAP receptors is poorly defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use a systematic extracellular protein interaction screening approach to identify the integrin v3 as a directly interacting host receptor for Plasmodium falciparum TRAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical characterization of the interaction suggests a two-site binding model, requiring contributions from both the von Willebrand factor A domain and the RGD motif of TRAP for integrin binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that TRAP binding to cells is promoted in the presence of integrin-activating proadhesive Mn2+ ions, and that cells genetically targeted so that they lack cell surface expression of the integrin v-subunit are no longer able to bind TRAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. falciparum sporozoites moved with greater speed in the dermis of Itgb3-deficient mice, suggesting that the interaction has a role in sporozoite migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of the integrin v3 as the host receptor for TRAP provides an important demonstration of a sporozoite surface ligand that directly interacts with host receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

P_falciparum_TRAP_Expressed_in_HEK293_Cells_Binds_HepG2_Cells_Independently_of_Cell_Surface_Sulfates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify human host receptors for P. falciparum TRAP, we expressed the entire ectodomain as a soluble recombinant protein in mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because interactions between cell surface receptor proteins are typically weak, we purposefully oligomerized monomeric TRAP around a streptavidinphycoerythrin conjugate to form a fluorescent highly avid binding probe which stained the surface of human HepG2 cells (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if this cell binding was due to cell surface sulfated glycoconjugates, we tested whether the TRAP ectodomain could interact with heparin, chondroitin sulfate A, or heparan sulfate using a sensitive surface plasmon resonance assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even at high concentrations of these glycoconjugates, we observed no detectable binding with TRAP immobilized on the sensor chip (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, preincubating the TRAP binding probe with these molecules before testing binding to HepG2 cells did not affect TRAP binding activity (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to genetically ablate in HepG2 cells the SLC35B2 gene, which encodes a transporter for 3-phosphoadenosine-5-phosphosulfate into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus where sulfotransferases use it as a universal donor for the sulfation of glycocalyx components, including heparan sulfate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that TRAP binding to SLC35B2-targeted cells was largely unaffected (Fig 1D), even though we could show that a significant population of these cells had lost FGFRL1 binding, a known heparan sulfate binding protein (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that recombinant TRAP expressed in mammalian cells interacted with a cell surface receptor expressed on HepG2 cells distinct from cell surface sulfated glycans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Integrin_v3_Is_a_Human_Receptor_for_P_falciparum_TRAP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the molecular identity of the TRAP receptor on HepG2 cells, we selected a panel of 65 proteins from an existing library of human cell surface receptor ectodomains available in the laboratory (16) that were expressed on HepG2 cells (17) (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This array of human receptors was probed for direct interactions with TRAP using the AVEXIS assay, and a clear interaction with integrin v3 was immediately observed (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrins are a family of cell surface receptors consisting of a complex of two noncovalently associated polypeptide chains whose extracellular regions can exist in different ligand affinity states formed by conformational changes induced by intracellular or extracellular signaling events (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that this interaction was independent of the baitprey orientation by clustering the biotinylated v3 integrin around a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate and showing that it interacted robustly with TRAP, but not with a control bait (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next demonstrated that TRAP and v3 interacted directly using surface plasmon resonance, by injecting serial dilutions of purified TRAP over a surface containing immobilized integrin v3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetic analysis showed that the two proteins interacted directly, from which association and dissociation rate constants of 2.95 ± 0.02 × 105 M1s1 and 0.00332 ± 0.00002 s1, were calculated corresponding to an interaction half-life of over 3 min (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This binding affinity was unexpectedly high for an extracellular receptorligand interaction, which often have half-lives in the order of seconds (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that human v3 interacts directly with P. falciparum TRAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_RGD_Motif_in_TRAP_Is_Necessary__but_Not_Sufficient__for_Binding_Integrin_v3  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A well-characterized ligand binding determinant for a subset of mammalian integrins, including v3, is a three-amino acid motif consisting of arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. falciparum TRAP contains an RGD sequence between the TSR domain and the predicted transmembrane-spanning region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the importance of this sequence in integrin binding, we first added a cyclized peptide containing an RGD motif, which is an inhibitor of RGD-dependent v3 interactions (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serial dilutions of the cyclo(RGDfV) peptide showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the interaction (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the importance of this motif, we used site-directed mutagenesis to mutate the RGD sequence in TRAP to RGE, a conservative mutation known to disrupt integrin ligand binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the mutant RGE TRAP was unable to bind human v3 (Fig 3B), confirming that the RGD sequence was necessary for the interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RGD sequence is not a conserved feature of orthologous TRAP protein sequences from other Plasmodium species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if the interaction was conserved across species, the entire extracellular domains of RGD-containing TRAP orthologs from a gorilla parasite (Plasmodium praefalciparum) and a chimpanzee parasite (Plasmodium reichenowi) and non RGD-containing TRAP orthologs from two human parasites (Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi) and a rodent parasite (Plasmodium berghei) were expressed and tested for their ability to interact with human integrin v3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the TRAP orthologs that lacked the RGD motif bound, confirming the importance of this motif in binding v3 (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While P. praefalciparum bound equivalently to P. falciparum, surprisingly, no binding of the RGD-containing P. reichenowi TRAP was observed, suggesting the requirement for additional integrin v3 binding determinants (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, introducing an RGD motif at an equivalent position in P. vivax TRAP did not result in a gain of integrin v3 binding activity (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that while the TRAP RGD motif is necessary, it is not sufficient for the interaction with integrin v3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_VWA_Domain_of_P_falciparum_TRAP_Is_Required_for_Integrin_v3_Binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine which other regions of TRAP are involved in the interaction, we expressed discrete domains of the TRAP ectodomain and tested them for v3 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could again show that the RGD sequence was insufficient for binding, since a protein containing the TSR domain and the RGD-containing repeat region up to the transmembrane region did not interact with v3 (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also suggested that the TSR domain was not involved in the interaction, and this was supported by the fact that the TSR domain alone did not interact (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data implied that the VWA domain might encode the additional binding determinant, and although we were unable to express the VWA domain in isolation, a protein containing both VWA and TSR domains but lacking the RGD sequence showed weak residual binding to v3 (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the role of the VWA domain in the context of the entire extracellular region, we constructed a chimeric TRAP protein in which the VWA domain from the nonbinding but RGD motif-containing P. reichenowi TRAP was replaced with the VWA domain from P. falciparum (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This chimeric TRAP protein was able to interact with v3 in the AVEXIS assay (Fig 4B), suggesting that the minimum requirements for the v3 interaction are the P. falciparum TRAP VWA domain and RGD sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this further, we mutated conserved residues in the MIDAS sequence located within the VWA domain that are required for coordinating divalent cations important for ligand binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A protein containing the double mutation S56A S58A displayed much reduced binding to v3 in the AVEXIS assay (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, titrating the divalent cation chelator EDTA into a TRAP binding assay showed a dose-dependent inhibition of binding (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that TRAP interacts with v3 at two sites, with contributions from both the VWA domain involving the MIDAS, and the RGD sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HepG2_Cells_Targeted_for_ITGAV_Lose_All_TRAP_Binding_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We returned to cell-based assays to investigate the v3TRAP interaction within the context of an intact cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the cell surface binding of TRAP was significantly increased in the presence of manganese ions, which promote the formation of proadhesive active integrin conformations (21), consistent with a role for integrins in their active conformation in TRAP binding (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preincubating cells with an inhibitory v3 monoclonal antibody whose epitope lies within the v-subunit reduced TRAP binding (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this incomplete blocking is consistent with TRAP using more than one contact site on v3, it could also indicate the presence of additional receptors on HepG2 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish this, we again used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to genetically target the genes encoding both the ITGAV and ITGB3 genes in HepG2 cells (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, in ITGAV-targeted cells, all TRAP binding was lost, demonstrating that the v-subunit is the major determinant of TRAP binding (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells in which the ITGB3 gene had been targeted, however, did not show any loss in cell surface TRAP binding (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite repeated attempts, the HepG2 cell lines were refractory to single-cell cloning, so we used a human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line which we knew could be made clonal and had high expression levels of both v- and 3-subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to HepG2, all TRAP binding was lost in ITGAV-targeted HEL cells, whereas targeting of ITGB3 had no effect on TRAP binding (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The v-subunit is a promiscuous integrin -subunit known to form functional integrins with four other -subunits, and the retention of TRAP binding following ablation of the ITGB3 gene could reveal redundancies with other v-subunitcontaining integrins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this, we expressed all five v-subunitcontaining integrins, as well as two other RGD-binding integrins (51 and 81), and tested their ability to bind TRAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that integrins v5 and v6 were also able to bind TRAP, albeit with a lower relative activity compared with integrin v3, while the other RGD-binding integrins showed no TRAP binding activity (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data demonstrate a critical role for the integrin v-subunit in TRAP binding at cell surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_TRAPIntegrin_Interaction_Has_No_Major_Role_in_Hepatocyte_Invasion__but_May_Be_Involved_in_Dermal_Migration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the functional role of the TRAPintegrin interaction, we first used in vitro P. falciparum sporozoite invasion assays of HepG2 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the parental HepG2 cell line, we observed that our ITGAV-targeted HepG2 cells grew in small clusters that adhered poorly to tissue culture plastic; however, precoating the substrate with collagen improved cellular adherence to a degree that sporozoite invasion experiments could be attempted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant difference in the ability of P. falciparum sporozoites to invade ITGAV-targeted compared with parental HepG2 cells was observed (Fig 6A), although we did not consider this conclusive due to the altered adhesive properties of the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To circumvent these difficulties, we added anti-v antibodies (Fig 6B) and soluble integrin ectodomains (Fig 6C) to P. falciparum sporozoite invasion assays and, again, observed no strong effect, suggesting that this interaction has no major role in sporozoite invasion of hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sporozoites interact with many different tissues before invading hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we observed that P. falciparum TRAP was able to interact with the mouse v3 ortholog (SI Appendix, Fig S3A), we genetically replaced P. berghei TRAP with either the P. falciparum ortholog or a nonbinding RGE mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although many functions of P. berghei TRAP were complemented, we repeatedly observed that the transgenic parasites did not glide or develop in a hepatocyte cell line compared with control parental P. berghei parasites, suggesting that some aspects of TRAP function were not fully complemented, precluding confident interpretations of the role of the interaction using this approach (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the requirement of the interaction in the host, we next infected Itgb3-deficient mice with fluorescent transgenic P. falciparum parasites and tracked their motility and behavior in the dermis using intravital microscopy (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that P. falciparum sporozoites glide with greater speed (Fig 6D) and displace over larger distances from the inoculation site in Itgb3-deficient mice compared with wild-type siblings (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that the TRAPintegrin interaction has no major role in P. falciparum hepatocyte invasion but influences the behavior of sporozoites in the dermis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to the detailed descriptions of how sporozoites interact with host cells, remarkably little is known about the molecular interactions involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and TRAP have been demonstrated to interact with highly sulfated proteoglycans displayed on tissues in the liver sinusoids, which may provide a molecular explanation for sporozoite homing to this organ (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other cell surface molecules that have roles in the liver stage of infection include CD81, SR-B1, CD68, and EphA2, but the details of how they interact with the parasite are unclear (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our discovery that TRAP is able to interact with human v-subunitcontaining integrins provides an important precedent demonstrating that sporozoite surface proteins do interact with host cell surface receptor proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we have shown a critical requirement for the integrin v-subunit in TRAP binding at cell surfaces, but because this integrin -subunit is expressed in most tissues, the expression pattern of the -subunit partners may determine cellular binding selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments suggest redundancy in -subunit usage, with v3 exhibiting preferential binding compared with v5 and v6 integrins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both 5 and 6 are broadly distributed, whereas 3 is restricted, with the v3 integrin expressed highly on osteoclasts but also on endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle, and platelets (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these integrins are broadly expressed, we have shown that TRAP binding is promoted in the presence of manganese ions that are proadhesive integrin activators, suggesting that TRAP preferentially binds integrins in their activated ligand binding conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A preference for binding integrins in their active conformation would restrict the number of receptors available and may serve to localize the TRAPintegrin interactions to clusters of integrins in their activated state, as has been suggested for focal adhesions (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sporozoite may exploit these binding preferences as a signal to switch between gliding and cell traversal or invasion behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using in vitro HepG2 sporozoite invasion assays, however, we did not observe any major effect when perturbing the interaction using antibodies, recombinant proteins, or cells lacking the integrin v-subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the possibility that the interaction may occur at a different stage of the sporozoite journey from the dermis to the hepatocytes, we used intravital microscopy to quantify sporozoite behavior in the dermis of transgenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Itgav-deficient mice are embryonic lethal (27), and although functional redundancies within integrin -chain are a possibility, we observed that sporozoites were able to move faster within the dermis of Itgb3-deficient mice, suggesting that the interaction could impede the movement of the parasites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would suggest that TRAP does not use integrin binding as a gliding substrate, but rather as a stop or brake to alter its gliding behavior in response to a localized cellular signal in the host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VWA domain in TRAP is structurally homologous to the I-domain of integrins, and structural studies have shown that both TRAP VWA and the integrin I-domain contain metal ion-dependent adhesion sites whose affinity for ligand can be regulated through conformational changes and thereby regulate integrin adhesiveness and, potentially, the extension of the TRAP ectodomain (11, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the cocrystal structure of the RGD-containing pro-TGF-1 ligand with the v6 integrin has revealed that upon ligand binding, integrins can apply force to and thereby reshape their ligands (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pro-TGF-1 binds its integrin receptor with a high affinity (KD of 50 nM) (30), similar to the affinity of TRAP for its integrin receptor (KD of 10 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that the high affinity of TRAP binding and conformational changes in the integrin results in the application of force through TRAP, which influences parasite motility by locking the extracellular regions of TRAP into its extended conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the demonstration over 20 y ago that TRAP is essential for parasite motility, it has been a focus for malaria vaccines targeting the preerythrocytic stage of Plasmodium infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By identifying v-subunitcontaining integrins as a host receptor for TRAP, we have addressed one of the main outstanding questions relating to the function of TRAP and provide an important example that sporozoite ligands can directly interact with host receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
