Air pollutant emissions from Chinese households: A major and underappreciated ambient pollution source  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
China suffers from severe outdoor air pollution and associated public health impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response, the government has imposed restrictions on major pollution sources such as vehicles and power plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that due to uncontrolled and inefficient combustion of solid fuels in household devices, emission reductions from the residential sector may have greater air quality benefits in the North China Plain, including Beijing than reductions from other sectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These benefits would be largest in the winter heating season when severe air pollution occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Household emissions, mostly from space heating and cooking with solid fuels, are an important and generally unrecognized source of ambient air pollution in China and other developing countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative fuels and other ways of reducing emissions would have large benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As part of the 12th Five-Year Plan, the Chinese government has developed air pollution prevention and control plans for key regions with a focus on the power, transport, and industrial sectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigate the contribution of residential emissions to regional air pollution in highly polluted eastern China during the heating season, and find that dramatic improvements in air quality would also result from reduction in residential emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry to evaluate potential residential emission controls in Beijing and in the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei (BTH) region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In January and February 2010, relative to the base case, eliminating residential emissions in Beijing reduced daily average surface PM2.5 (particulate mater with aerodynamic diameter equal or smaller than 2.5 micrometer) concentrations by 14 ± 7 gm3 (22 ± 6% of a baseline concentration of 67 ± 41 gm3; mean ± SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eliminating residential emissions in the BTH region reduced concentrations by 28 ± 19 gm3 (40 ± 9% of 67 ± 41 gm3), 44 ± 27 gm3 (43 ± 10% of 99 ± 54 gm3), and 25 ± 14 gm3 (35 ± 8% of 70 ± 35 gm3) in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei provinces, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annually, elimination of residential sources in the BTH region reduced emissions of primary PM2.5 by 32%, compared with 5%, 6%, and 58% achieved by eliminating emissions from the transportation, power, and industry sectors, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find air quality in Beijing would benefit substantially from reductions in residential emissions from regional controls in Tianjin and Hebei, indicating the value of policies at the regional level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_Region_and_Scenarios  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study region is the BTH region in the North China Plain (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beijing is Chinas capital, and the city of Tianjin is adjacent to Beijing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hebei is the province surrounding the two megacities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2010, the urban population in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was 86%, 80%, and 45% of the total population in each of the three provinces (12), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BTH region occupies only 2.3% of the total national land area; however, in 2010, it had 8%, 11%, and 12% of the national population, gross domestic product, and energy consumption, respectively (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the contribution of residential emissions to regional air pollution, we designed three scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BASE is the baseline scenario in which a WRF-Chem simulation used the Multiresolution Emission Inventory of China (MEIC; www.meicmodel.org) emission inventory for January and February 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residential emissions were removed in the Beijing (BJR) scenario and in the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei (BTHR) regional scenario, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference between the WRF-Chem BASE and BJR or BTHR scenario simulations provides an estimate of the total contribution of the residential sector from each region to regional outdoor air pollution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, to simulate potential mitigation strategies more realistically, we conducted sensitivity simulations in which residential emissions were reduced by 25%, 50%, and 75% of the BASE emissions in the BTH region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Contributions_of_Emissions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table S1 summarizes coal and biomass combustion by sector in the BTH region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all three provinces, power plants are the largest coal consumer, followed by industry, whereas the residential sector uses the least amount of solid fuel (including biomass).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The picture is different, however, when sectoral contributions to emissions of various air pollutants are compared, with a consistently large proportion of aerosol species found to originate from the residential sector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 shows the relative contributions of the transportation, power, industry, and residential sectors to PM2.5, BC, OC, SO2, and nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions at the provincial scale from the MEIC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2010, the primary PM2.5, BC, OC, SO2, and NOx emissions in the BTH region were 1,100 kilotons (kt), 170 kt, 272 kt, 2,010 kt, and 2,830 kt, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residential sector accounted for 32%, 44%, 71%, 15%, and 4%, respectively, of the total emissions of each pollutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During January and February, more fuel is burned for heating, and the contribution of the residential sector to total emissions is greater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2 presents the spatial distribution of residential emissions and their share of the total anthropogenic emissions in January and February of 2010 in eastern China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest emissions are distributed in the east, covering the southeast of the BTH area, Shandong Province, and the north of Henan Province.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emission hot spots are located over most cities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residential sector contributes more than 50% of the emissions of PM2.5, BC, and OC in northern China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For OC, the residential sector contribution can exceed 95%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Air_Quality_Improvements_in_the_BTH_Area  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before the scenario analysis, meteorological fields (including hourly surface air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and daily precipitation), PM2.5 mass concentration, and the PM2.5 chemical composition in the model were evaluated (Tables S2S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2A shows the distribution of mean PM2.5 surface concentrations over eastern China from January 1 to February 28, 2010 in the BASE simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top of the surface layer is 26 m. In the BTH region, high PM2.5 concentrations were distributed in the southeast, along the Yan and Taihang Mountains, from the north to south.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spatial distribution has a similar pattern to the pattern of primary emissions (Fig S2), except along the coast, where the sea-land breeze transports and dilutes the pollutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding chemical composition of PM2.5 in the BTH region is presented in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, BC, organic matter (OM; OM/OC = 1.5), sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium account for 10%, 33%, 6%, 17%, and 7% of the PM2.5 mass concentration in the region, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OM fraction is dominant, and sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium are also important, accounting for 30% of the PM2.5 mass concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1, during January and February 2010, the residential sector contributed 65% and 85% of the BC and OC emissions in the BTH region, and consequently was responsible for most of the BC and OM in the PM2.5 in the BTH region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2B shows the decreases in the two-month PM2.5 average mass concentration over eastern China with no emissions from the residential sector in Beijing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reductions in PM2.5 concentrations are centered over southeast Beijing, with the largest reduction of over 30 gm3 found in the south.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to reductions in Beijing, PM2.5 in the surrounding areas of Hebei and Tianjin decrease by 36 gm3 due to regional transport of air pollutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical composition of the eliminated PM2.5 concentrations over the BTH region is presented in Fig 2B; the contributions of BC, OM, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium are 24%, 57%, 5%, 8%, and 4%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbonaceous particles are the major component of the reduced PM2.5 mass concentration (81%), whereas the remaining 17% reduced is composed of secondary inorganic particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2C depicts the changes in average PM2.5 concentration between the BTHR and BASE scenarios over eastern China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Setting residential emissions to zero simultaneously in the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei provinces greatly expanded PM2.5 reductions over the entire BTH region with reductions extending over the surrounding provinces with substantially larger reductions than in the BJR scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes in concentration located along the Yan and Taihang Mountains, divide the BTH region into roughly two parts, northwest and southeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest decrease in PM2.5 occurs over southern Hebei, along a line following a series of large cities in the province [i.e., Langfang, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Xingtai, Handan (from north to south)] where residential emissions are the largest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei Province, the average PM2.5 concentration fell by over 60 gm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BTH region is 0.21 million km2, and the mean decrease across the regions over the JanuaryFebruary period varied from 7 to 52% depending on location and by 36% on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although no emissions restrictions were implemented in other neighboring provinces, air quality also improved to the south and east of the BTH region, and the PM2.5 reductions in Shandong Province and Henan Province ranged from 229 gm3 and 235 gm3 depending on location and by 7 gm3 and 8 gm3 on average, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the BJR scenario, the dominant components of the eliminated PM2.5 were OM and BC, accounting for 64% and 17% of the total mass, respectively (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the BTHR scenario, the contribution of OM to the eliminated PM2.5 was larger and the contribution of BC to the eliminated PM2.5 was smaller than in the BJR scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher contribution of OM in the BTHR scenario is because biomass constituted a larger share of the residential energy structure in Hebei and Tianjin than in Beijing (compare Table S1) and OC is mainly from residential biomass use (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Air_Quality_Improvements_at_the_Provincial_Level  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate daily air quality improvements at the provincial level, we derive the area-weighted daily average surface PM2.5 concentrations over the BTH region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 shows the decrease in daily area-based average PM2.5 concentrations for each of the three provinces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each province, the mean and SD of PM2.5 concentration, concentration decrease from the BASE simulation, and percentage of PM2.5 reduced are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the provincial calculation in Fig 3 and Table 1 are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The absolute reduction in PM2.5 concentrations was positively and strongly correlated with the BASE PM2.5 concentration in both the BJR and BTHR scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 shows that on more polluted days, the decrease in PM2.5 concentration is generally larger, indicating that the emission control measures in the residential sector decreased PM2.5 concentrations more when air pollution concentrations were higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the heavy polluted periods in winter, the North China Plain is often dominated by a weak high-pressure system with low surface winds (13), which leads to weak mixing and diffusion; hence, emission reductions during those periods are particularly beneficial to local regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the BJR scenario, the average PM2.5 concentration in Beijing decreased by 14 ± 7 gm3 (mean and SD of 59-d daily average values) and the BASE PM2.5 concentration decreased by 22 ± 6%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on how these values are obtained are included in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the average PM2.5 concentration in Tianjin and Hebei also decreased, but the decreases were less than 5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the emission reductions in Beijing are relatively small compared with the emissions from Tianjin and Hebei, emission reductions in Beijing do not help much to improve the air quality in Beijings surrounding provinces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the BTHR scenario, on the other hand, the residential emission elimination strategies in the BTH region resulted in decreases in PM2.5 concentration of 28 ± 19 gm3, 44 ± 27 gm3, and 25 ± 14 gm3 on average for Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, respectively, which were 40 ± 9%, 43 ± 10%, and 35 ± 8%, respectively, of the BASE PM2.5 concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, reductions of residential emissions in regions surrounding Beijing would also substantially improve Beijings air quality as well as reduce pollutant contributions in downwind regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies have shown that regional transport is an important source of air pollution in Beijing (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the prevailing wind is southerly, air pollutants from Hebei, Shandong, and Henan are transported to Beijing (15, 16), and the contribution of emissions from surrounding regions to PM2.5 in Beijing has been found to be 3439% (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study also finds that regional air quality management is critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although air pollution in Beijing receives considerable attention, we found PM2.5 concentrations to be substantially higher south of the BTH region (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, the elimination of residential emissions in Beijing alone decreased PM2.5 concentrations in the city by 14 ± 7 gm3 (22 ± 6%), whereas the elimination of residential emissions in the BTH region decreased PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing nearly twice as much, by 28 ± 19 gm3 (40 ± 9%) (Table 1 and Fig 3A), as well as reducing PM2.5 concentrations in Tianjin and Hebei by 43 ± 10% and 35 ± 8%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3 DF presents the frequency histograms of the percent decrease in daily PM2.5 concentrations in the BJR and BTHR scenarios for the 59 simulation days in JanuaryFebruary 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average daily PM2.5 decrease was 22%, 5%, and 2% in the BJR scenario and 40%, 43%, and 35% in the BTHR scenario in the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Provinces, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although emission control measures were implemented in the model on all days, the PM2.5 percent decreases varied significantly (e.g., in Beijing, the PM2.5 percent decrease varied from 21 to 55% in the BTHR scenario) due to meteorological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the relatively clean periods, the polluted periods were generally associated with lower boundary layer height and wind speed and higher temperature and relative humidity (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions lead to high PM2.5 concentrations due to weak mixing and diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, percent decreases in PM2.5 concentration due to emission reductions from local sources are generally larger during polluted periods than during clean periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To inform policy initiatives, we also conducted simulations in which we reduced residential emissions by 25%, 50%, and 75% in the BTH region, The results show that the air quality benefits of reducing residential emissions in the BTH region during the heating season are approximately linear, indicating that policies to reduce emissions from the residential sector will likely lead approximately linearly to reductions in ambient PM2.5 concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model_Configuration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the WRF-Chem model, the model physics include the following: microphysics as in Lin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (39), Goddard shortwave radiation (40), rapid radiative transfer model long-wave radiation (41), Yonsei University PBL scheme (42), Noah land surface scheme (43), and Grell-3D cumulus scheme (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gas phase chemistry was carbon-bond mechanism version Z (CBM-Z) (32) and was coupled with the four-bin Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) aerosol module (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fast-j radiation scheme (34) was used to calculate the photolysis rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical boundary conditions were obtained from the Model of Ozone and Related Tracers (MOZART-4) (35) for the year 2010, at 6-h resolution (www.acom.ucar.edu/wrf-chem/mozart.shtml).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulation MOZART-4 was driven by meteorological fields from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, version 5 (GEOS-5) model, using anthropogenic emissions based on David Streets inventory for Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARCTAS) and fire emissions from the Fire Inventory from NCAR version 1.0 (FINN v1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The BASE simulation was carried out for January and February 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WRF model was integrated continuously during the simulation period, with 7 d at the end of December used for model spin-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final Analysis data (horizontal resolution of 1° × 1°) at 6-h intervals were used for meteorological initial and boundary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A series of 84-h simulations were conducted from 12:00 Coordinated Universal Time every 72 h, and for each simulation, the 13th to 84th time step was collected as output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_Evaluation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An evaluation of the meteorological fields was carried out with hourly surface air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and daily precipitation parameters from the National Climate Data Center (www.ncdc.noaa.gov/) dataset (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 91 meteorological stations are located in eastern China (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evaluation parameters include mean bias (MB), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized mean bias (NMB), normalized mean error, and correlation coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 2-m temperature, the MB and RMSE were 0.7 °C and 3.5 °C, respectively, showing close agreement between the simulation and observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated 2-m relative humidity agreed closely with observations; the MB and NMB were 0.8% and 1.3%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulated 10-m wind speed was overestimated, with an MB of 1.5 m/s, and the simulated 10-m wind direction agreed fairly closely with observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The daily precipitation values coincided poorly, with a considerable underestimation of 71.0%, which might lead to an underprediction of the PM2.5 wet deposition process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the WRF-Chem simulation performed reasonably well compared with the observation data, and the results are generally comparable to other WRF (27) and WRF-Chem simulations over China (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PM2.5 observation data from four sites in the BTH region were used to evaluate simulated air pollution levels: two urban sites and two rural sites (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Peking University site (PKU; 39.9°N, 116.3°E) is located in the northwest urban area of Beijing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PKU observation site is about 600 m north of the fourth ring main road and 220 m away from an eastern main road.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed information is provided by Wu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Gucheng site (GCH; 39.13°N, 115.67°E) is an Integrated Ecological-Meteorological Observation and Experiment Station affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, located in Hebei Province.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GCH site is about 110 km to the southwest of Beijing and 130 km to the west of Tianjin municipality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies showed that the GCH site has good regional representativeness of a relatively polluted rural area (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Shangdianzi (SDZ; 40.65°N, 117.12°E) station is one of the regional Global Atmosphere Watch stations (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SDZ station is located in the northern part of the North China Plain and in the Miyun County of Beijing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is about 100 km from the urban area of Beijing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PM2.5 concentration was measured with tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), RP1400a (ThermoScientific) at the PKU and SDZ sites and grimm180 at the GCH site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PM2.5 concentrations published on the web site of the US Embassy in Beijing (EMB; 39.95°N, 116.47°E) were also used (as an urban site in Beijing) for model evaluation, but the measurement method is not described on the web site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulated hourly PM2.5 concentrations in the surface grid cell at the measurement location are used to calculate daily average concentrations for model evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S4 shows the temporal trends of simulated and observed daily PM2.5 concentrations at the PKU, EMB, SDZ, and GCH sites from January 1 to February 28, 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding performance statistics for daily PM2.5 concentration are summarized in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WRF-Chem model was able to capture well the daily trends in PM2.5 concentration, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.71 to 0.83 (Fig S4 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five pollution episodes occurred during the simulation period, and the model performed well in reproducing these episodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the entire simulation period, PM2.5 overestimation occurred at the PKU and SDZ sites, with NMBs of 48% and 24%, respectively, and underestimation occurred at the EMB and GCH sites, with NMBs of 6.3% and 23%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the PKU and SDZ sites, the TEOM method has a greater tendency to underestimate PM2.5 mass concentration due to the loss of semivolatile ammonium nitrate and the organic compounds (48, 49), which may also contribute to overestimation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PKU and EMB sites are in the same grid box, but they overestimate and underestimate, respectively, which indicates there are variations of air pollution on a smaller scale, with the simulated concentration representing, at best, the average pollution status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not compare the simulated PM2.5 concentration with the average observed PM2.5 concentration at the PKU and EMB sites, because the observation instruments might be different between the two sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the model performance for PM2.5 chemical composition in northern China, we extracted the sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, BC, and OC concentrations at the observational sites that were reported in recent publications (5052) for the same time period and compared the average concentration of these PM2.5 species (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding provinces include Beijing, Hebei, Tianjin, and Shandong.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, there is an overall underestimation of sulfate among all of the sites, with underestimation ranging from 39% to 90%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible reason might be the missing pathways of sulfate enhancement by mineral aerosols in the WRF-Chem model, including aqueous oxidation enhancement, catalyzed oxidation enhancement, and SO2 heterogeneous reactions, which are estimated to contribute to 40% of the total sulfate production during the winter in China (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model agreed better with observations for nitrate and ammonium; the average relative differences between simulated and observed values are 2.0% and 0.6% for nitrate and ammonium, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for the Chengde (CD) station, the model had a positive bias for BC, ranging from 36% to 149%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon is consistent with pervious Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model simulations with the MEIC emission inventory, in which a positive bias of 196.2% was found for elemental carbon at an urban site in Beijing (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding may due to the uncertainties in the spatial distribution of emissions: Coal boilers and stoves may have been phased out from the city centers in Beijing, Shijiazhuang, and Tianjin before 2010, whereas the MEIC emission inventory did not take these changes into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Air_Quality_Improvements_at_the_Provincial_Level  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate air quality improvements at the provincial level, we calculate the area-weighted daily average PM2.5 concentrations over Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each province, we extract the WRF-Chem simulated hourly PM2.5 concentrations in grid cells within that province.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For grid cells overlapping more than one province, we split the grid cells along provincial boundaries with a geographic information system program, and using fractional weights of these grid boxes, we derive the provincial area-weighted daily average PM2.5 concentrations for the charts in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the 59-d mean daily PM2.5 concentration, we calculate the JanuaryFebruary 2010 mean and SD of daily average PM2.5 concentrations, concentration decreases, and percent reductions in each scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevant results are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During January and February 2010, in the BTH region, the residential sector contributed 53%, 65%, 85%, 32%, and 9% of primary PM2.5, BC, OC, SO2, and NOx emissions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WRF-Chem simulations indicate that during the residential heating season, the elimination of residential emissions in Beijing alone would decrease surface PM2.5 concentrations by 22 ± 6% in Beijing and the elimination of residential emissions in the BTH region would decrease surface PM2.5 concentrations by 36 ± 7% in the BTH region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the power and industrial sectors, although the residential sector consumed less solid fuel (Table S1), it made larger contributions to emissions of primary particles in winter (Fig 1), owing primarily to the low combustion and thermal efficiencies of cooking and heating stoves and absence of any end-of-pipe controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In China, residential solid fuel combustion results in large emissions of PM, although the emission factor varies with fuel type, fuel properties, and burning conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17) reported mean total suspended particulate emission factors of 8.05, 3.82, and 1.30 gkg1 for crop residues, wood, and coal, respectively, burned in various stoves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in China found that burning bituminous coal briquettes led to a higher PM emission factor than burning of anthracite briquettes, and burning bituminous coal chunks has an even higher emission factor (1820).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these emissions, more than 94% of the PM is below 0.95 m in diameter, whereas only about 1% is above 7.2 m in diameter (18), indicating the dominance of fine particulates (PM2.5) in residential emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zhi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20) reported that emission factors (EFs) of PM (PM2.5 dominant), OC, and elemental carbon (EC) are 7.33, 4.16, and 0.08 gkg1 and 14.8, 5.93, and 3.81 gkg1 for bituminous coal briquettes and chunks, respectively, and that they are 1.21, 0.06, and 0.004 gkg1 and 1.08, 0.10, and 0.007 gkg1 for anthracite briquettes and chunks, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anthracite burns more cleanly and emits less PM and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) than bituminous coal, but is more expensive and harder to light and poses hazards from carbon monoxide poisoning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the national average PM2.5 emission factor in coal-fired power plants was estimated to be 0.53 gkg1 in 2010 (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This emission factor is substantially less than 10% of the PM2.5 emission factor for the residential bituminous coal combustion process (1820).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Field studies have observed comparable annual mean PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter equal or smaller than 10 micrometer) concentrations in urban areas (180 ± 171 gm3) and rural villages (182 ± 154 gm3) at 18 sites across northern China, suggesting that the severe outdoor air pollution in rural areas is partially derived from household solid fuel combustion (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2013, the State Council issued the Action Plan, under which the BTH region is required to achieve a 25% reduction in annual mean PM2.5 concentrations from the 2012 level by 2017.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strategies focusing on emission reductions and changes in energy systems in the power, industry, and transportation sectors have been given considerable attention (3), but air quality would benefit from greater attention on the residential sector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are clear opportunities to reduce ambient PM2.5 concentrations and potentially achieve climate co-benefits via mitigation efforts in households.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With significant pollutant emissions, residential sources are close to dwellings and have near-ground emissions that have a greater impact on surface air pollution levels and result in higher human exposure than is typical for power or industrial sources (22) [i.e., the intake fraction is much higher (23)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid fuel (including biomass and coal) used for household heating and cooking emits air pollutants, short-lived greenhouse pollutants like BC, and a range of greenhouse gases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cleaner stoves, such as advanced fan-stoves using pelletized biomass, and intrinsically clean energies at end use, such as natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and electricity, are potential mitigation strategies in the residential sector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Truly clean-burning coal stoves could have direct indoor and outdoor air quality and human health benefits, but not help significantly in climate mitigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, clean energies with lower climate footprints can be used as interim steps (e.g., LPG) while moving to long-term solutions (natural gas, biogas, electricity, and wind and solar energy), which can completely replace solid fuel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the urban and suburban areas around Beijing, replacing household coal with natural gas has already been implemented, and with increasing import from Russia and development of shale gas reserves in China, there is potential to expand the use of natural gas to many cities and even to large preurban areas around the country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Care will need to be taken to avoid leakage of methane, the primary component of natural gas and a strong greenhouse gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For households in remote regions, LPG, biogas, and electricity generated with wind or solar power are longer term low-emission options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For meeting space-heating needs, to be efficient, these clean fuels need to be accompanied by improved heat retention in households: better insulation and reduced leakage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A number of epidemiological studies have addressed the health effects of household solid fuel use for heating and cooking due to exposures in the household environment (6, 24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to helping address the problem of household air pollution, substitution of solid fuels with low-emission energy sources in the residential sector can improve widespread outdoor air quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The climate benefit of using natural gas and electricity, however, depends on the source of power production and what they are displacing, whereas the use of biogas (with care to prevent leakage) and wind and solar energy can be expected to bring significant climate co-benefits in nearly all situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Widespread adoption of these residential mitigation strategies will substantially help meet the ambient PM2.5 targets in the Action Plan and provide large human health benefits via reductions in both local household and regional outdoor exposure to PM2.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The year 2010 was chosen for this study because a detailed emission inventory is available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the average planetary boundary layer (PBL) height of January and February from 2010 to 2014 using meteorological data derived from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Final Analysis, and found the average boundary layer height over the BTH region in January and February of 2010 to be the highest of the 5-y period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study shows that even with meteorological conditions such as these, which are relatively favorable for pollutant dilution via mixing, the elimination of residential emissions in the BTH region was highly effective at reducing surface PM2.5 concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In periods of more stable synoptic conditions (e.g., winter 2013) with lower surface wind speed and PBL height (13), residential emissions likely made an even larger contribution to haze formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional analysis is needed to characterize better the role of residential emissions in severe air pollution episodes during these periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis examines the heating season, when larger quantities of coal and biomass are burned and the contributions of the residential sector to total emissions are larger than at other times of year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the relative contribution of secondary inorganic aerosols is larger in summer, when high temperatures and humidity and strong atmospheric oxidation favor secondary aerosol formation (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More research is needed to evaluate the contribution of emissions from the residential sector on air pollution during each season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The WRF-Chem simulation introduced uncertainties into the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed in SI Materials and Methods (Fig S4 and Tables S3 and S4), although the mass concentration and daily trends were captured well by the WRF-Chem model, the simulated PM2.5 species differed from observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, BC is overestimated and sulfate is underestimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing our data with field data from recent publications (SI Materials and Methods), we found BC was overestimated by 36149% at various sites, which was also found in a study using Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) Model (27), and the difference may be due to uncertainties in emissions from coal boilers and stoves, as well as diesel trucks in the MEIC emission inventory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During January and February 2010, the residential sector dominated BC emissions, accounting for 77%, 70%, and 62% of the total emissions in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Provinces, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overestimation of BC would result in overestimation of the contributions of residential emissions to PM2.5 concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, sulfate was underestimated by 3990% in the present study, and a possible reason might be the missing pathways of sulfate enhancement by mineral aerosols in the WRF-Chem model, including aqueous oxidation, catalyzed oxidation, and SO2 heterogeneous reactions, which are estimated to contribute 40% of the total sulfate production during winter (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WRF-Chem model results vary with horizontal resolution; hence, model resolution is an additional source of uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the WRF-Chem domain covers mainland China, with a horizontal resolution of 36 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resolution is the same as used in several recent model studies in northern China and the BTH region (27, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of studies apply nested simulations with a horizontal resolution in the innermost domain of 12 km (30) or 9 km (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (30) compared domain-wide PM2.5 predictions at 36-km and 12-km grid resolutions, and found that the use of a finer grid changed PM2.5 performance from a slight underprediction to a moderate overprediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, the 36-km resolution achieved better model performance than the 12-km resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Due to rapid economic development and high levels of solid fuel combustion, China is facing severe air pollution problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve targets in the Action Plan efficiently, it is critical to prioritize the reduction and replacement of high-emitting end-use energy combustion processes with clean energy across a variety of sectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residential emissions from direct combustion of solid fuel in low-efficiency stoves contribute substantially to regional PM2.5 loads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction of emissions from the residential sector via the replacement of solid fuels with other cleaner energy sources could substantially improve air quality in the BTH region of eastern China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On an annual emissions basis, elimination of residential sources in the BTH region would reduce emissions of primary PM2.5 and SO2 by about 32% and 15%, respectively, compared with 5%, 6%, and 58% of primary PM2.5 and 1%, 20%, and 63% of SO2 by eliminating emissions from the transportation, power, and industry sectors, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, residential sources contribute far more to primary PM2.5 emissions annually in Beijing and the surrounding region than the transportation and power sectors combined and, in winter, more than industry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we estimate the implications of reducing residential emissions for ambient concentrations in the BJR scenario and in the BTHR scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eliminating residential emissions in January to February 2010 in Beijing alone produced a decrease of 14 ± 7 gm3 (22 ± 6%) in the PM2.5 concentration in Beijing, whereas removing residential emissions in the whole of the BTH region brought a decrease in the PM2.5 concentrations of 28 ± 19 gm3 (40 ± 9%), 44 ± 27 gm3 (43 ± 10%), and 25 ± 14 gm3 (35 ± 8%) in the three provinces in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The residential sector has been relatively overlooked in ambient air pollution control strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis indicates that air quality in the Beijing region would substantially benefit from reducing residential sector emissions from both within Beijing and within surrounding provinces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate potential health benefits, however, will require additional assessment to determine changes in population exposure resulting from specific mitigation strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A careful assessment of the contribution of residential emissions to annual average regional ambient pollution levels as well as an analysis of the benefits of specific mitigation options would provide valuable guidance to the formation of future air quality policy designed to meet the Action Plan air quality targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found regional air quality management to be of great importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with controlling emissions just in Beijing, controlling residential emissions in the BHT region resulted in twice as large a reduction in PM2.5 concentrations (28 vs. 14 gm3) in Beijing itself, indicating the importance of interregional transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to achieve consistent air quality improvements, it may be necessary not only to develop provincial air quality management plans that address household as well as other sources but to build a long-term regional framework for emission controls among all of the provinces in northern China.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use the WRF-Chem (version 3.6) modeling system to simulate outdoor air quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WRF-Chem is a fully coupled regional meteorology-chemistry model that simulates meteorology and the emission, transport, mixing, and chemical transformation of trace gases and aerosols (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our WRF-Chem domain covers China, Japan, North and South Korea, and parts of other countries (Fig S1), with a horizontal resolution of 36 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vertical grid of 31 levels extends from the surface (the surface layer is 26 m deep) to the model top of 50 hectopascals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbon-bond mechanism version Z (CBM-Z) gas phase chemistry (32) and the four-bin Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) aerosol module (33) were used, and the Fast-j radiation scheme (34) was chosen to calculate the photolysis rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boundary conditions were obtained from the Model of Ozone and Related Tracers (MOZART-4) (35) for the year 2010, at 6-h resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on model configuration are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anthropogenic and biogenic emissions were included in the BASE simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anthropogenic emissions in China for 2010 were derived from the MEIC model developed by Tsinghua University, which has been used in several other studies (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MEIC inventory includes five anthropogenic source sectors: power, industry, transportation, residential, and agriculture (only NH3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Open biomass burning, which usually occurs in summer and autumn (36), was not included in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission inventory considers seasonal variations by monthly emission data, and for the residential sector, the PM2.5, BC, OC, SO2, and NOx emissions are typically highest in winter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anthropogenic emissions from other Asian countries were generated from the INTEX-B emissions inventory (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biogenic emissions were predicted online by WRF-Chem according to the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
