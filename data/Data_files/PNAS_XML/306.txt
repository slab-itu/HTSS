Phosphorylation of CMG helicase and Tof1 is required for programmed fork arrest  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Programmed replication fork arrest (PFA) at specific terminator sites and the proteins that bind to these sites functionally interconnect replication, transcription, and recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PFA prevents collision between replication and transcription that can cause genome instability, promotes intrachromatid recombination at ribosomal (r)DNA that controls replicative life span, and maintains rDNA homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work reveals the mechanism of PFA by showing that the Tof1 protein of budding yeast remains associated with the replication fork only when it is phosphorylated, and uses the CMG helicase that drives the replication fork as a landing pad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tof1Csm3 promotes PFA by preventing the terminator protein Fob1 from getting displaced by other factors such as the Rrm3 helicase by counteracting the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This important mechanism appears to be evolutionarily conserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several important physiological transactions, including control of replicative life span (RLS), prevention of collision between replication and transcription, and cellular differentiation, require programmed replication fork arrest (PFA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a general mechanism of PFA has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously showed that the Tof1Csm3 fork protection complex is essential for PFA by antagonizing the Rrm3 helicase that displaces nonhistone protein barriers that impede fork progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that mutations of Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not other DNA replication factors, greatly reduced PFA at replication fork barriers in the spacer regions of the ribosomal DNA array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key target of DDK is the mini chromosome maintenance (Mcm) 27 complex, which is known to require phosphorylation by DDK to form an active CMG [Cdc45 (cell division cycle gene 45), Mcm27, GINS (Go, Ichi, Ni, and San)] helicase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo experiments showed that mutational inactivation of DDK caused release of Tof1 from the chromatin fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro binding experiments confirmed that CMG and/or Mcm27 had to be phosphorylated for binding to phospho-Tof1Csm3 but not to its dephosphorylated form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppressor mutations that bypass the requirement for Mcm27 phosphorylation by DDK restored PFA in the absence of the kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retention of Tof1 in the chromatin fraction and PFA in vivo was promoted by the suppressor mcm5-bob1, which bypassed DDK requirement, indicating that under this condition a kinase other than DDK catalyzed the phosphorylation of Tof1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that phosphorylation regulates the recruitment and retention of Tof1Csm3 by the replisome and that this complex antagonizes the Rrm3 helicase, thereby promoting PFA, by preserving the integrity of the Fob1Ter complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Inactivation_of_DDK_Caused_Significant_Reduction_of_PFA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Does DDK, besides its roles in replication initiation, limiting replication to once per cell cycle, and checkpoint control, also regulate PFA?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We addressed this question by investigating replication fork arrest at the Ter site of the rDNA of budding yeast in temperature-sensitive mutants of DDK called cdc7-1 and dbf4-1 of its two subunits at the permissive (24 °C) and nonpermissive temperatures (37 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used BrewerFangman 2D gel electrophoresis (55), as modified (23), to follow fork progression in the spacer regions of rDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our stratagem was to let initiation occur at 24 °C and then allow fork progression at 37 °C, which should prevent any new origins from firing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asynchronous cultures were grown at 24 °C to midlog phase and then shifted to 37 °C for various time periods (12 h) and the cells were harvested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach, in our hands, resulted in higher yields of scarce replication intermediates, particularly from the mutant cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control experiments were similarly performed at 24 °C but without a shift to 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FACS analyses of the asynchronous cultures used for the experiments are shown (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that although all of the 2D gels showed Y-shaped arc (Y-arc), the pattern corresponding to bubble arc was not observed because the experiments were not designed to capture and display the early replication intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1A shows the topography of NTS1 containing a single ars and tandem Ter sites present in each rDNA repeat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication fork arrest at the twin Ter sites, as revealed by five independent sets of 2D gels, as expected showed normal fork arrest at Ter in WT cells at both temperatures (Fig 1B), but there was a significant reduction in the relative intensity of the Ter spots at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig 1 C and D) in cdc7-1 and dbf4-1 cells, as determined by quantification of the images using the NIH ImageJ program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We concluded from these experiments that temperature-dependent inactivation of either the cdc7-1 or dbf4-1 component of DDK significantly reduced the magnitude of PFA at the Ter sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Is unhindered fork progression through a protein barrier a general property of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations at the nonpermissive temperature in several replication proteins, or is it specific to DDK?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Is this caused by direct action of DDK on replication termination, or is it an indirect and relatively trivial consequence of changes in the rate of fork progression as a result of loss of DDK activity that might have caused fewer forks to reach the Ter sites?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Was this possibly caused by an increase in the rate of fork progression that somehow overpowered the Fob1Ter barriers?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, could this have been caused by the displacement of Fob1 from Ter sites precipitated by the loss of DDK activity?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These questions have been systematically addressed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abolition_of_PFA_Is_Not_a_General_Property_of_Several_Mutant_Forms_of_Proteins_Known_to_Be_Defective_in_Replication_Initiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated whether the loss of fork arrest upon inactivation of DDK was a specific or general defect caused by reduction in the rates of initiation and ongoing replication by ts mutations in other replication proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-dimensional gel analyses of fork movement using several ts mutants in proteins known to be involved in initiation (e.g., psf1-1, psf2-1, sld2-2, sld5-12, and mcm10-1) showed that PFA at Ter sites in these mutants was not significantly diminished at 37 °C in comparison with that of the WT cells (Fig 2A and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, the psf-1 mutant is known to be nonleaky (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Published 2D gel analyses of its replication intermediates clearly show significant reduction of the bubble arc in 2D gels in comparison with that of the WT, clearly indicative of loss of replication initiation at 37 °C (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, loss of PFA is not an inevitable consequence of a loss of initiation function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_Combing_Showed_No_Correspondence_Between_Replication_Fork_Arrest_and_the_Relative_Differences_in_Fork_Movement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether a relative difference in the rate of fork progression in the two mutants compared with that of WT cells could cause PFA or its abolition, we performed DNA combing experiments with the WT, cdc7-1, and psf1-1 cells at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells of the three genotypes were first grown at 24 °C, shifted to 37 °C, and pulse-labeled with BrdU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA was gently extracted to minimize hydrodynamic shear and spread on silanized coverslips and visualized by antibodies against BrdU (green) and single-stranded DNA (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several hundred molecules were recorded under a fluorescence microscope, tract lengths were measured, statistical analyses were performed (Table 1), and the data were plotted as described in Materials and Methods and the legend to Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative differences in the rates of fork movement were small but consistent, with the magnitudes as follows: psf1-1  greater than  cdc7-1  greater than  WT (Fig 2 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Keeping in mind that fork arrest at Ter occurred in psf1-1 and WT cells but not in cdc7-1 at 37 °C, the data suggested that there was no detectable correlation between the relative rate of fork progression and fork arrest at Ter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the psf1 and WT tracts are longer in the DNA combing profile because initiation was blocked in cdc7-1 and psf1-1 cells, and those that initiated, presumably because of less competition for existing initiation factors, cause somewhat faster fork movement (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Failure_to_Arrest_Forks_in_cdc7-1_Cells_at_37_°C_Was_Not_Due_to_Displacement_and_Loss_of_Fob1_from_the_Ter_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We wished to investigate whether the absence of DDK activity caused Fob1 to dissociate from the Ter sites by measuring the magnitudes of Fob1 occupancy at Ter in the cdc7-1 strains at 24 °C, 30 °C, and 37 °C for 3 h. ChIP analyses of Fob1 binding to Ter in vivo were performed using a segment of DNA from the 35S transcribing region as the control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data showed that Fob1 remained bound to Ter sites in cdc7-1 cells at all temperatures tested (Fig 2 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Key_Role_for_DDK-Catalyzed_Phosphorylation_in_PFA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is known that the requirement for DDK-catalyzed phosphorylation of Mcm27 for cell survival can be bypassed by several different suppressor mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, cdc7-1 or a cdc7 deletion can be suppressed by the mcm5-bob1 suppressor, which maintains cell viability in the absence of DDK (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared and contrasted PFA at the Ter site of rDNA in strains containing cdc7-1 mcm5-bob1 and cdc7 mcm5-bob1 and the WT control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments were repeated twice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images of the 2D gels showed that PFA was restored in cdc7-1 mcm5 bob1 and cdc7 mcm5-bob1 cells at 37 °C (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3A and 4 A, iii) as contrasted with the cdc7-1 single mutant, which failed to arrest forks at Ter at 37 °C (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results were consistent with the conclusion that (i) DDK was dispensable for fork arrest in the presence of mcm5-bob1 and (ii) alteration in the Mcm27 structure caused by the suppressors controlled PFA, probably by assembling CMG independent of DDK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional pathways of suppression of DDK and their effect on fork arrest are described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that although in some of the 2D gels the sizes of the Y-arcs seem to be different, these are caused by image processing and there are no real differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Deletion_of_the_Inhibitory_Domain_in_the_N-Terminal_Region_of_Mcm4_Restored_Fork_Arrest_in_DDK_ts_Mutants_at_37_°C  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The N-terminal region of Mcm4 contains an anchoring domain for Dbf4 recruitment, and residues 2174 of Mcm4 also contain an inhibitory domain (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the main function of Mcm4 phosphorylation by DDK is believed to be neutralization of the inhibitory domain of Mcm4, a ts dbf4-1 mutation, as expected, is suppressed by the N-terminal deletion (2174) of Mcm4 (5153).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If PFA is controlled by DDK through phosphorylation of Mcm4, required to form the CMG complex, it should be manifested in stable fork arrest in a dbf4-1 mcm4 (2274) double mutant at both 24 °C and 37 °C for 3 h. Two-dimensional gel analysis confirmed this prediction by showing that, whereas the single mutant dbf4-1 showed significantly reduced fork arrest at 37 °C (Fig 1D), a dbf4-1 mcm4 (2174) double mutant showed no defect in replication fork arrest at 37 °C (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the results provided additional support for the conclusion that although Mcm27 phosphorylation by DDK was required for stable fork arrest, the N-terminal deletion of Mcm4 facilitated PFA, most likely by permitting formation of active CMG complex in the absence of DDK activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Deletion_of_Rif1_Suppressed_the_cdc7-1_Mutation_at_30_°C_and_Restored_PFA_at_the_Semipermissive_Temperature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It was recently reported that Rif1 can erase Mcm27 phosphorylation by recruiting the protein phosphatase PP1 to the replisome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, rif1 suppressed a cdc7-1 mutation at 30 °C and restored cell growth at that temperature (54, 57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether there was a correspondence between suppression of DDK mutants by rif1 and restoration of PFA, we first performed growth analysis and confirmed that rif1 could suppress a cdc7-1 mutation at 30 °C but not at 37 °C (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took this result to mean that whereas a moderate defect in cdc7-1 observed at 30 °C was suppressible by rif1, a more severe phenotype manifested at 37 °C was not suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed 2D gel analyses of replication intermediates of a rif1 cdc7-1 double mutant and the cdc7-1 single mutant at all three temperatures and observed fork arrest in the double mutant at 24 °C and 30 °C but not at 37 °C for 3 h (Fig 3 FH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, similar analysis using a cdc7-1 single mutant revealed, as expected, a clear reduction in fork arrest at both 30 °C (Fig 3 D and E) and 37 °C (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the data from three separate suppressors of DDK mutants support the conclusion that phosphorylated Mcm27, but not its dephosphorylated form, plays a critical role in promoting PFA, and that the requirement for Mcm27 phosphorylation is dispensable in mutants that can initiate replication in the absence of DDK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DDK-Catalyzed_Phosphorylation_of_the_Mcm27_Complex_Was_Necessary_for_the_Retention_of_Tof1_at_the_Replisome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How does DDK-dependent CMG (Mcm27) phosphorylation control fork arrest at Ter?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously reported that Tof1 and Csm3, but not Mrc1, of the FPC are necessary for stable fork arrest at Ter sites and protein barriers elsewhere in the chromosome and that Tof1Csm3 protects the arrested fork by counteracting the Rrm3 helicase, which evicts Fob1 protein from the Ter sites in the absence of either Tof1 or Csm3 (23, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that a phosphorylated Mcm27 complex was necessary for the recruitment and/or retention of Tof1 at the replisome and that inactivation of DDK by a ts mutation at the nonpermissive temperature was predicted to evict Tof1 from, or fail to recruit it to, the replisome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected this to cause unhindered fork passage not only through the Fob1Ter complexes but also past many other DNAprotein barriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we expected a suppressor such as mcm5-bob1 to restore PFA, presumably by blocking removal of Tof1 from the replisome at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested these predictions as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we wished to determine whether Mcm4 phosphorylation was reduced by inactivation of DDK in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed Western blots (WBs) using FLAG-tagged Mcm4 in cdc7-1 rif1 to monitor dephosphorylation of Mcm4 by gel electrophoresis at 24 °C and 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a rif1 strain to enhance the yield of phosphorylated Mcm4 for easier detection, and the data showed that inactivation of cdc7-1 at 37 °C caused a significant reduction in the ratio of the dephosphorylated to the phosphorylated form of Mcm4 (Fig 4 A, i and ii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To follow the degrees of retention of Tof1 protein in the nuclear vs. cytoplasmic fractions in the presence and absence of active DDK, we synchronized the cells of the different genotypes by growing them at 24 °C until reaching log phase and then arrested the cells in G1 phase with -factor, released the block by proteolyzing the -factor, and allowed the cells to grow for an additional 30 min at either 24 °C or 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spheroplasts were prepared and fractionated into soluble and chromatin fractions, and the presence or absence of Tof1-myc in each fraction was measured by WBs using anti-myc antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurement of Orc3 from the same fractions, using anti-Orc3 antibodies, was used as an internal control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT cells, Tof1 was associated with the chromatin fraction at both 24 °C and 37 °C (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in cdc7-1 cells, we consistently observed, in six replicates of the experiment, that Tof1 remained chromatin-bound at 24 °C but was greatly reduced in the chromatin fractions at 37 °C (Fig 4 C and F, i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar experiments were performed in a cdc7 mcm5-bob1 strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted, Tof1-myc was retained in the chromatin fraction even after incubation at 37 °C (Fig 4 D and F, ii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, in the congenic cdc7-1 strain a myc-tagged Csm3 was retained in the chromatin fraction (Fig 4 E and F, iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that trapping of Csm3 by secondary interactions with other proteins, for example with the replication protein A [single-strand DNA-binding protein (59)], might have prevented its release from the chromatin fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of the mcm5-bob1 suppressor, these cells grew without DDK and also displayed replication fork arrest at Ter at both 24 °C and 37 °C (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3A and 4 A, iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data suggested that direct interaction between DDK and Tof1 was not obligatory for PFA when Mcm27 was activated in the suppressor mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated why Tof1 was not recruited or retained in the chromatin fraction upon inactivation of DDK in the biochemical experiments described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ProteinProtein_Interaction_Between_Tof1_and_the_Replisome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We wished to test the hypothesis that, in addition to the known role of phosphorylation of Mcm27 by DDK for CMG assembly, Mcm27 phosphorylation also contributes to the function of CMG as a landing pad for Tof1 recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed in vitro proteinprotein interaction experiments using phosphorylated and dephosphorylated CMG and Tof1Csm3, and also examined the Mcm27 complex (both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms) and separately Cdc45 and GINS for binding to Tof1Csm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purity of the various proteins used was determined by Coomassie blue-stained SDS/PAGE profiles (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments provided two significant insights into the regulation of PFA: (i) Tof1 bound to the phosphorylated CMG and Mcm27 but not to their dephosphorylated forms or to Cdc45 or GINS, and (ii) only phospho-Tof1 was competent to interact with CMG and Mcm27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence for these conclusions is presented below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We purified the Tof113mycCsm3 complex, taking care to protect the proteins from possible dephosphorylation during purification by using multiple phosphatase inhibitors (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the purified complex to determine its phosphorylated state by Zn2+-Phos-tag PAGE analysis (60), which revealed that 50% of the purified Tof1 was phosphorylated, as indicated by the upward mobility shift of the protein bands and loss of these shifted bands after dephosphorylation (Fig 5A, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A control SDS/PAGE of the same protein without Phos-tag is shown in Fig 5A, Right, with actin as the loading control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tof1 protein, before and after dephosphorylation, had almost the same mobility, commensurate with its molecular mass, by SDS/PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gels were replicated three times with nearly identical results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data suggested that in vitro dephosphorylation did not cause incidental proteolytic degradation of Tof1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure the possible effect of dephosphorylation on binding to phospho-CMG, an aliquot of Tof1-myc was pretreated with -phosphatase and the enzyme was inactivated by a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP) before loading onto a CMG affinity column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We made sure that pretreatment of Tof1-myc with the phosphatase followed by addition of inhibitors was effective in inactivating the enzyme by carrying out standard phosphatase assays, with little or no residual phosphatase activity detectable by standard colorimetric phosphatase assays (SI Materials and Methods and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that Csm3 is also a phosphoprotein (PhosphoGRID, www.phosphogrid.org/), and could also be contributing to Tof1Csm3 interaction(s) with CMG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately equal picomoles of phospho-Tof1 and the dephosphorylated form were applied to the CMG affinity columns, each containing the same amount of the affinity matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control binding to the affinity matrix showed only low background levels of retention of Tof1 (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tof1-myc that bound to the immobilized CMG columns (as measured in seven replicates of WBs using three different protein preparations) was quantified as a percentage of the input protein bound to immobilized CMG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data consistently revealed an approximately eightfold increase in binding of phosphorylated (untreated) Tof1 to the CMG matrix compared with the dephosphorylated Tof1 protein (Fig 5B; see quantification in Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Does Tof1Csm3 in the phosphorylated form bind to the separate components of the CMG complex?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We separately purified Mcm27, Cdc45, and GINS as described in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mcm27 included a FLAG-tagged Mcm5 subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex was immobilized on anti-FLAG affinity beads and challenged with phosphorylated (untreated with -phosphatase) and dephosphorylated (treated with 1 unit -phosphatase at 30 °C for 1 h) Tof1 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WBs of the bound Tof1 protein visualized with anti-Myc antibodies revealed that whereas phosphorylated Tof1Csm3 readily bound to the immobilized phospho-Mcm27, the dephosphorylated form of Tof1 showed significantly reduced binding to the affinity matrix (Fig 5 C and G; - and + indicate no treatment or dephosphorylation with  phosphatase, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar binding experiments using Cdc45 and GINS complex showed 1520% binding by either phospho-Tof1Csm3 or its dephosphorylated form (Fig 5 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude from the data that phospho-Tof1 specifically binds to Mcm27 but not to Cdc45 and GINS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Do CMG and Mcm27 require phosphorylation to bind to phospho-Tof1?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this question, purified CMG was extensively treated with -phosphatase followed by removal of the phosphatase by a gel-filtration step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aliquots of the dephosphorylated CMG and separately the same amounts of the phosphorylated form were immobilized on Ni-NTA columns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal amounts of Tof1-mycCsm3 complex were applied to each affinity column, and the proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS/PAGE, and visualized by WBs using anti-Myc Ab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that CMG, after dephosphorylation, showed a significant reduction in binding to Tof1-GST (Fig 5 D and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a continued phosphorylated state of CMG, even after complex formation, is required for optimal binding to and retention of Tof1Csm3 at the replisome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we determined that immobilized phospho-Mcm27 but not its dephosphorylated form was able to bind to Tof1-mycCsm3 complex (Fig 5 E and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Independent support for the aforementioned conclusion is provided by the expression and purification of Mcm27 subunits in E. coli reconstitution into an Mcm27 complex [that had limited helicase activity (61)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rationale was that Mcm27 expressed in E. coli is not expected to be phosphorylated because of a lack of a DDK or DDK-like kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Mcm27E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coli should not bind to Tof1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed this expectation by attempting to bind phosphorylated Tof1 to immobilized Mcm27E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coli but observed only low background levels of binding with both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated Tof1 (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The proposed mechanism of PFA, supported by these data, is schematically shown in Fig 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scheme takes into consideration our previous discovery that the Tof1Csm3 complex counteracts the Rrm3 sweepase from displacing Fob1 from Ter, thereby maintaining stable fork arrest (Fig 6A) (23, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the model posits that DDK phosphorylates Mcm27, which, along with Cdc45 and GINS, forms the CMG helicase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CMG complex then recruits the phosphorylated but not the dephosphorylated form of Tof1Csm3 to the replisome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Tof1 also requires phosphorylation for its recruitment by CMG, the kinase responsible for Tof1 phosphorylation remains unclear at this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that inactivation of DDK prevents the CMG complex from recruiting or retaining Tof1, thereby allowing Rrm3 to displace Fob1, resulting in unhindered fork progression past Ter (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why does PFA still work in cdc7-1 mcm5-bob1 cells at the nonpermissive temperature?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that in the absence of DDK, CMG assembles in an alternative conformation that, as has been suggested, may be dependent on Cdc28, Clb2, and Clb5 (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Strain_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strain construction was carried out by standard genetic techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epitope tagging was done by using standard PCR-based insertion procedures (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transformation of temperature-sensitive (ts) strains was done with a modification at the heat shock step (37 °C for 9 min), followed by a snap chill on ice for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For phleomycin selection, transformed cells (ts) were incubated at 24 °C overnight in YPD (pH 7.0) and then plated on phleomycin plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retention of the ts phenotype was checked periodically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Myc tagging, a cassette containing 13 copies of Myc epitope was amplified from strain YFL921 and cotransformed with a 1.3-kb phleomycin resistance gene PCR product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers used are 6F, 6R, 7F, 7R, 8F, and 8R, and are listed in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Integrations of BrdU cassettes into the strains were done as described elsewhere using the plasmids p404BrdUInc and p405BrdUInc (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To disrupt the Bar1 locus by URA3 incorporation, the pbar1::Ura3 plasmid was digested with BamHI and BglII and transformed into the appropriate strain and selected on Ura dropout plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Tof1 ORF was cloned as a cassette Tof1-13x Myc in the overexpression vector pBJ842 (a gift from Satya Prakash, University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, Galveston, TX).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primer pair 9F and 9R was used to make the above construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chromatin_Fractionation_and_Western_Blots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chromatin fractionation was done with some modifications as described (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The serial expansion of culture was done in YPD medium at 24 °C and the culture was diluted (1:20) in 600 mL of YPD (OD 0.2) and incubated at 24 °C for 2 h. At OD 0.4, -factor (360 nM; Sigma) was added and the culture was incubated for 2 more hours at 24 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 2 h of growth, the culture was divided into two flasks (300 mL each) and one flask was shifted to a 37-°C water bath for heat shock (swirling movements) for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control culture was grown at 24 °C without a temperature shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both cultures were incubated further for 1 h at 24 °C/37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were pelleted and washed with YPD that was maintained at 24 °C/37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell pellet was resuspended and mixed thoroughly by vortexing and added to YPD media (300 mL, 24 °C/37 °C) containing Pronase E (200 µg/mL; Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incubation was continued at the respective temperature and harvested after 30 min, washed twice with chilled water containing 1 mM PMSF, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cells were processed for chromatin fractionation as described previously (51) with some modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were sonicated on ice at 30% amplitude for 25 s (5-s intervals) and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm (Eppendorf, fixed-angle rotor# F-45-24-11), and the supernatant containing chromatin-bound proteins was recovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aliquots of the soluble and chromatin fractions were mixed with SDS gel loading dye, resolved by SDS/PAGE, and blotted against c-Myc antibody clone 9E10 (Sigma) and ORC3 (SB3) mouse monoclonal antibody (a gift from Bruce Stillman, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 146-kDa band of Tof1-13Myc and an 68-kDa band of Orc3 were visualized by Western blots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Purification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CMG, Mcm27, and Cdc45 were purified by expression in yeast strains containing integrated genes as described (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Mcm27 complex, an N-terminal 3×FLAG tag was cloned in-frame with the Mcm5 gene and integrated into the chromosome along with the other five Mcm genes as described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were grown at 30 °C in 12 flasks of 1 L YP-glycerol and induced for 6 h at OD600 0.7 with 20 g galactose per 1-L culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen cell pellets were ground into powder in a SPEX cryogenic grinding mill (6970 EFM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mcm27 was purified by the same procedure as described for CMG through the FLAG-column step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain Cdc45-FLAG, yeast expressing CMG (His6 and 3×FLAG tags on the N terminus of Mcm5 and C terminus of Cdc45, respectively) was used, which, due to poor assembly of components into CMG, contained a large excess of recombinant Cdc45-FLAG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enabled purification of Cdc45-FLAG in three steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First the FLAG column, then the flow-through of the Ni column of the CMG preparation, and finally Cdc45-FLAG were further purified on a MonoQ column using a 100500 mM KCl gradient in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% (vol/vol) glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Four-subunit GINS with an N-terminal hexahistidine kinase tag on Psf1 was overexpressed in E. coli (Lucigen) from the plasmids pCDF-Duet Psf2, pET Duet Psf3+Sld5, and pLANT/RIL hk/p Psf1 by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, incubated at 15 °C overnight, and purified as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 6-L equivalent of frozen cell pellet was resuspended in buffer L (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol) plus 80 mM NaCl and lysed in a cooled French press.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spermidine was added to the lysed cell extract to a final concentration of 30 mM and the extract was spun 40 min at 12,000 rpm in a Sorvall RC6 centrifuge with an SLA-1500 rotor to pellet insoluble material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soluble cell extract (150 mL) containing overexpressed Psf1, Pfs2, Psf3, and Sld5 was applied to 25 mL Fast Flow Q Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare) on an XK 26 column (Pharmacia Biotech) at 1 mL/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The column was washed with buffer L, 80 mM NaCl and eluted with a 250-mL gradient of 80 mM NaCl to 1 M NaCl in buffer L, 1 M NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak fractions containing four-subunit GINS, which eluted at a conductivity equivalent centered around 300 mM NaCl, were pooled (60 mL) and adjusted to 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole by addition of concentrated stocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pool was loaded onto a 5-mL HiTrap Chelating HP column (GE Healthcare) that had been previously charged with 50 mM nickel sulfate and equilibrated in buffer L with 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The column was washed with 30 mL buffer L containing 500 mM NaCl and 60 mM imidazole to remove nonspecifically bound proteins and eluted with a 50-mL gradient from 60 mM to 500 mM imidazole in buffer L, 500 mM NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak fractions of pure GINS were combined into two separate pools and dialyzed overnight against 1 L 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.9), 500 mM NaCl to remove the imidazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pools were then dialyzed for 6 h against 1 L buffer A, 100 mM NaCl for storage at 80 °C (buffer A consisted of 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM EDTA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total yield of pure GINS was 25.8 mg (pool 1, 4.2 mg/mL in 3.0 mL; pool 2, 2.5 mg/mL in 5.3 mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tof1Csm3 was purified as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tof1 ORF with 13Myc was cloned into the vector pBJ842 (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tof1 was expressed in S. cerevisiae as a GST fusion protein in this vector and purified on a Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) column as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmid pBJ842-Tof1 was transformed into the protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5464, and cells were grown in SD/Leu plates as described for the pBJ842-derived clones (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonies from SD/Leu plates were inoculated in SD/Leu medium containing 2% glucose, 2% glycerol, and 1.8% lactate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overnight cultures were washed and then inoculated into fresh SD/Leu medium containing 2% glycerol and 1.8% lactate with a 1:20 dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An 8-L culture was incubated for 16 h and galactose was added to a final concentration of 2% for the induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of induction, 1% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1 mM Na pyrophosphate were also added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The culture was induced for 6 h and harvested in a Sorvall RC-5C centrifuge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell pellets were washed in breaking buffer [50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM KCl, 0.5 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM PMSF, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, PhosSTOP (Roche Applied Science)], centrifuged, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell pellets were then suspended in breaking buffer with 10% sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed, and lysed by a bead beater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti70 rotor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clear straw-color supernatant was collected and a 70% ammonium sulfate precipitation was done, and a protein pellet was recovered by centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein pellet was resuspended in column buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture, and PhosSTOP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conductivity of this solution was measured and adjusted to the conductivity of the column buffer by dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soluble protein solution was slowly loaded onto a Glutathione Sepharose 4B column preequilibrated with column buffer at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The column was washed with three column volumes (CVs) of wash buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.5 mM benzamidine, 0.5 mM PMSF, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, PhosSTOP) and with three CVs of column buffer containing 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 0.01% Tween 20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GSTTof1-myc protein bound to the beads was eluted with freshly prepared elution buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween 20, 40 mM reduced glutathione) at 4 °C for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eluates were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aliquots were checked by SDS/PAGE and protein was quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDS/PAGE analysis revealed the presence of equimolar amounts of Csm3 that copurified with the Tof1 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The degrees of purification of the proteins and protein complexes used in this work are shown in Fig S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tof1-Myc_Dephosphorylation_Reaction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For a 100-µL reaction mixture, 2 pmol purified protein GSTT of 1 Myc in 2× binding buffer (40 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2), 1× reaction buffer [protein metallo phosphatase (PMP)], 1 mM MnCl2, and 2 units -phosphatase was added and incubated in a 30-°C water bath for 1 h. At the completion of the reaction, 2 µL PhosSTOP stock solution was added to inhibit phosphatase at room temperature for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Binding_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(i) Two picomoles of each protein (CMG complex, Mcm27, and GINS) was immobilized on Ni-NTA affinity beads (40 µL as a slurry) preequilibrated with binding buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl2) and bound at 4 °C for 1 h in Eppendorf tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) For Mcm27, binding buffer was supplemented with 3 mM ATP, 10 µM ZnCl2; MgCl2 was substituted with 10 mM Mg acetate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads were washed and fresh binding buffer was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two picomoles of Tof1-myc with and without dephosphorylation was added to the respective beads in Eppendorf tubes (200 µL) and allowed to interact at 4 °C for 1 h. (iii) For the Cdc45-Tof1 binding assay, 2 pmol GSTTof1-myc with -phosphatasetreated and untreated reaction mixtures (150 µL) was immobilized on Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads and then 2 pmol of Cdc45 was loaded onto the GSTTof1-bound beads (200 µL total reaction volume) at 4 °C for 1 h. After the binding reaction, protein-bound beads were loaded onto microcolumns, which were washed three times with wash buffer (binding buffer + 0.01% Tween 20) and the beads were extracted into Eppendorf tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample buffer was added, boiled at 95 °C, and resolved by 8% SDS/PAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blot_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The resolved protein samples were transferred onto membrane (Bio-Rad), and the blots were blocked with 1% BSA and incubated in the presence of antic-Myc antibody (1:5,000 dilution) and anti-FLAG antibody (1:1,000 dilution) (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary antibody treatment, washing, and detection by chemiluminescence were performed (EMD Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the experiments were done in triplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The image acquisition and quantification was done by ImageJ software (NIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of the controls for the purified protein were done; GST and GSTTof1-myc was immobilized to Glutathione Sepharose 4B, and equimolar CMG complex was allowed to interact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ensured that the CMG complex specifically bound to GSTTof1-myc but not to the GST-only column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another set, GSTTof1-myc protein was loaded onto a Ni-NTA column and there was, as expected, no binding or low levels of nonspecific binding to the beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified E. coli-expressed Mcm27 and GINS, and CMG proteins expressed in yeast were diluted and applied to the Ni-NTA beads, and bound protein Mcm27 was checked by SDS/PAGE and Coomassie blue staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMG and Cdc45 were checked by Western blots probed with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check the effectiveness and efficiency of -phosphatase and PhosSTOP (1 tablet per mL; 1 µL inhibits 4 units -phosphatase in a 50-L reaction mixture), the enzyme reaction was carried out in vitro on an ELISA plate to experimentally determine and standardize the reaction conditions for the subsequent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Zn2+_Phos-Tag_SDS_PAGE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells expressing 13Myc-tagged Tof1 were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, complete protease inhibitor mix) using glass beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lysates were quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and equal amounts were separated by 5% neutral-pH SDS/PAGE containing 50 M Phos-tag (Wako) and 100 M Zn(NO3)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gel consisted of a separating gel [5% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide and 357 mM Bis-TrisHCl, pH 6.8] and staking gel [4.5% (wt/vol) polyacrylamide and 357 mM Bis-TrisHCl, pH 6.8] and run in 1× NuPAGE 3-(N-Morpholino) propanesulfonic (Mops) running buffer [50 mM Mops, 50 mM Tris base, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.8, 5 mM sodium bisulfite (added fresh from a 1-M stock solution)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After electrophoresis, gels were soaked in transfer buffer (25 mM Bicine, 25 mM Tris base, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2, 10% methanol, 5 mM sodium bisulfite) with gentle agitation for 30 min and transferred overnight onto PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of monoclonal antic-Myc antibody (1:5,000; Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary antibody treatment, washing, and detection by chemiluminescence were performed as directed by the suppliers manual (EMD Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dephosphorylation of Tof1 was done by using -protein phosphatase (NEB) at 37 °C for 1 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biochemical mechanism of control of PFA in eukaryotes and its mode of regulation are poorly understood (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is of considerable general interest because of the many important physiological transactions mediated by the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell-cycle kinases CDK and DDK are required for replication initiation, and CDK is involved in limiting replication to only once per cell cycle and in S-phase checkpoint control (37, 39, 40, 49, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work reported here demonstrates that DDK is also required for PFA at a nonhistone protein barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism has been illuminated by our observation that inactivation of cdc7-1 not only caused abolition of PFA at Ter sites of rDNA but that the phosphorylated form of Mcm27, besides its well-known function in the assembly of the CMG complex, was also necessary for binding to Tof1 in vitro and its recruitment in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, phospho-Tof1 but not its dephosphorylated form bound to phospho-CMG and phospho-Mcm27 but not to the dephosphorylated protein complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the in vitro binding data, Tof1 in vivo was retained in the chromatin fraction only in the presence of active DDK in the cell milieu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Which kinase phosphorylates Tof1Csm3?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data in Fig 4 show that Tof1 is still recruited to chromatin in a cdc7-1 mutant in the presence of the mcm5-bob1 suppressor at the nonpermissive temperature, which suggests that DDK-catalyzed Tof1 phosphorylation is not necessary in this genetic background and probably another kinase phosphorylates Tof1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that a phosphorylated Tof1 is not needed in this genetic background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, several lines of evidence support the possibility that DDK is important for Tof1 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog of Tof1, called Swi1, interacts with the homologous DDK complex (Hsk1Dfp1) in the two-hybrid system and the proteins are also shown to form a complex by coimmunoprecipitation (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, Tof1Csm3 and DDK from S. cerevisiae also form a complex, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation, and Tof1Csm3 is believed to recruit DDK to the replication fork during meiotic DNA replication (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The requirement of Tof1Csm3 for subsequent meiotic double-strand-break formation could be bypassed by physically connecting DDK to Cdc45/CMG within the replication fork, indicating that Tof1Csm3 serves as a platform for recruitment of DDK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this interaction also leads to DDK phosphorylation of Tof1 remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that in WT yeast, DDK is recruited by Mcm27 and not only phosphorylates Mcm27 but also Tof1, but that in the absence of DDK the mcm5-bob1 mutant form of Mcm27 is able to recruit another kinase, perhaps Cdc28-Clb5 (62), that helps carry out PFA and replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work is needed to resolve this issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tof1 along with Csm3 plays a critical role in stabilizing stalled replication forks at protein barriers even in the absence of S-phase checkpoint activation, and this is central to its function in PFA, although DDK is not necessary for S-phase checkpoint activations (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike most instances, in which replication forks stall transiently while awaiting resolution of an impediment to fork progression, fork stalling in PFA is physiologically programmed and longer-lasting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the question of how PFA differs mechanistically from transient fork stalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed previously that Tof1 plays an additional role in PFA by counteracting the effects of the Rrm3 helicase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rrm3 is known to act as a sweepase for its function in removing nonhistone DNA-binding proteins, thereby allowing unrestrained replication fork movement through protein-bound DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of Rrm3 in yeast, replication fork stalling is observed at over 1,000 sites that are not observed in wild-type cells (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these sites are known to be densely populated with DNA-binding proteins, including centromeres and tRNA-coding genes, among many others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast with PFA, the data from the rrm3 strain suggest that these DNA-bound proteins are readily removed by the action of the Rrm3 sweepase, so how does Tof1 antagonize the action of Rrm3 in the rDNA array?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, it should be kept in mind that a deletion of rrm3 only partially rescues PFA in cells harboring either tof1 or csm3 (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that besides Rrm3, other factors are also involved in the abolition of PFA in tof1 and csm3 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As with most regulatory functions in biology, the answer appears to lie in a balancing act between positive and negative regulators and also in the evolutionary tradeoff between genome stability and genome adaptability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA at stalled replication forks is subject to breakage followed by recombination that can lead to genome rearrangements, particularly in the case of repeated DNA sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, collisions between DNA replication and DNA transcription can also lead to replication fork collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fob1-mediated DNA replication barrier in the rDNA of S. cerevisiae strikes a balance between these imperatives by preventing collisions between RNA and DNA synthesis and by using the components of the replication fork protection complex to prevent collapse of the replication fork stalled at the barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although other organisms, as well as human cells, appear to use various mechanisms to prevent collisions between replication and transcription in the highly transcribed ribosomal RNA genes, they all use Tof1Csm3 or the homologous human Tim/Tipin components of the fork protection complex to prevent collapse of the paused replication forks in the rDNA locus (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, although it is well-established that DDK-catalyzed phosphorylation of Mcm27 is needed for CMG assembly in WT cells, it is not known whether continued phosphorylation of the CMG complex is necessary for fork progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data showing that even after a CMG complex has been formed its dephosphorylation causes failure to recruit the fork protection complex in vitro indicate that continued maintenance of the phosphorylated state of CMG seems to be necessary for error-free fork progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that under genotoxic stress, in the absence of Tof1 or Mrc1, the helicase and polymerase of yeast dissociate from each other in the replisome, causing fork collapse (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, one would infer that continued maintenance of the phosphorylated state of CMG in the postinitiation step would be critical for genome stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The phosphatase assay was performed as described to not only detect phosphatase activity of -phosphatase at different dilutions but to check the effectiveness of the phosphatase inhibitor (PhosSTOP; Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A stock solution (1 tablet per mL) was prepared and 1 L/50 L reaction mixture was added to stop dephosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the colorimetric assay, 4-nitrophenyl phosphate was used as substrate and color was detected with an ELISA plate reader (76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
