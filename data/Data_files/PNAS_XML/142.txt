Covert digital manipulation of vocal emotion alter speakers emotional states in a congruent direction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We created a digital audio platform to covertly modify the emotional tone of participants voices while they talked toward happiness, sadness, or fear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent listeners perceived the transformations as natural examples of emotional speech, but the participants remained unaware of the manipulation, indicating that we are not continuously monitoring our own emotional signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, as a consequence of listening to their altered voices, the emotional state of the participants changed in congruence with the emotion portrayed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is the first evidence, to our knowledge, of peripheral feedback on emotional experience in the auditory domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is of great significance, because the mechanisms behind the production of vocal emotion are virtually unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Research has shown that people often exert control over their emotions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By modulating expressions, reappraising feelings, and redirecting attention, they can regulate their emotional experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have contributed to a blurring of the traditional boundaries between cognitive and emotional processes, and it has been suggested that emotional signals are produced in a goal-directed way and monitored for errors like other intentional actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this interesting possibility has never been experimentally tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we created a digital audio platform to covertly modify the emotional tone of participants voices while they talked in the direction of happiness, sadness, or fear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result showed that the audio transformations were being perceived as natural examples of the intended emotions, but the great majority of the participants, nevertheless, remained unaware that their own voices were being manipulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that people are not continuously monitoring their own voice to make sure that it meets a predetermined emotional target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, as a consequence of listening to their altered voices, the emotional state of the participants changed in congruence with the emotion portrayed, which was measured by both self-report and skin conductance level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change is the first evidence, to our knowledge, of peripheral feedback effects on emotional experience in the auditory domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, our result reinforces the wider framework of self-perception theory: that we often use the same inferential strategies to understand ourselves as those that we use to understand others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Participants listened to themselves while reading, and the emotional tones of their voices were surreptitiously altered in the direction of happiness, sadness, or fear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the happy condition (shown here), the speakers voice is made to sound energized and positive using subtle variations of pitch (pitch-shifting and inflection), dynamic range (compression), and spectral energy (high-pass filter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes are introduced gradually from t = 2 to t = 7 min, and the feedback latency is kept constant across conditions at 15 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Example audio clips recorded in the experiment are available in Audio Files S5S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Perceived difference in positivity and tension between processed and nonprocessed speech as judged by independent listeners and the post- and prereading changes in positivity and tension in the feedback experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants reading under manipulated feedback reported emotional changes consistent with the emotional characteristics of the voices that they heard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars represent 95% confidence levels on the mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The continuous scale is transformed to increments of 1 from 10 to +10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *Significant differences from zero at P less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Audio_Manipulations_(Definitions)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A cent is the frequency interval corresponding to 100th of a semitone (i.e., the interval between two neighboring keys on a piano is 100 cents).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It corresponds to a frequency ratio of 21/1,200.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pitch-shifting is the process of multiplying the pitch of the original voice by a constant factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was used in emotion-monitoring experiment 1 for the happy manipulation (with a positive shift of +25 cents) and the sad manipulation (with a negative shift of 30 cents) and emotion-monitoring experiment 2 for the tensed manipulation (with a positive shift of +100 cents).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was implemented with the pitch synchronous overlap and add technique (PSOLA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inflection, a nonstandard term, is defined here as the process of rapidly modifying the pitch at the start of each utterance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was used in emotion-monitoring experiment 1 for the happy manipulation (with an initial pitch shift of 50 cents and a linear decrease of 400 ms) and the afraid manipulation (with an initial pitch shift of +120 cents and a duration of 150 ms) and emotion-monitoring experiment 2 for the tensed manipulation (with an initial pitch shift of +150 cents and a duration of 150 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was implemented with the PSOLA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compression is the process of narrowing a signals dynamic range by reducing the level of loud sounds over a certain threshold to make it sound more intense without changing its mean energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was used in emotion-monitoring experiment 1 for the happy manipulation and implemented with a standard feedforward architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High shelf-filtering is the process of increasing the high-frequency portion of the signals distribution of spectral energy, whereas low shelf-filtering is the process of increasing its low-frequency portion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former was used in emotion-monitoring experiment 1 for the happy manipulation and emotion-monitoring experiment 2 for the tensed manipulations, the latter was used in emotion-monitoring experiment 1 for the sad manipulation, and both were implemented as second-order Butterworth filters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Formant shifting is the process of narrowing or broadening the distance between the peaks in the spectral envelope of vowels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was used in emotion-monitoring experiment 1 for the sad manipulation and implemented by combining the PSOLA and resampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vibrato is the process of applying a periodic variation (here, with frequency of 8.5 Hz) to the pitch of a voice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was used in emotion-monitoring experiment 1 for the afraid manipulation and implemented with the PSOLA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discrimination_of_Naturalness_of_Audio_Manipulations_(Pilot_Experiment)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We recorded utterances of the same sentence spoken by 10 different speakers (male: 5) who were all relatively young (M = 25.2) native Japanese speakers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sentence was an extract in the Japanese language from the short story The Second Bakery Attack by writer Haruki Murakami (the same source as the text used for emotion-monitoring experiments 1 and 2): She was probably trying to do both at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I thought I had some idea how she felt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Per speaker, we collected four utterances spoken in an emotionally neutral tone and three utterances spoken with emotion (primed with a selection of pictures representing anger, happiness, fear, etc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All recordings were sampled at 44.1 kHz and normalized at zero mean and a maximum amplitude of 3 dB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then selected at random three of four neutral utterances for each speaker and processed each by one of three audio effects of emotion-monitoring experiment 1 (happy, sad, or afraid).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure resulted in seven stimuli per speaker: one neutral, three natural emotional variations, and three artificial emotional variations obtained by processing three different neutral utterances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then asked n = 18 independent listeners (male: 15) from the same population as the speakers to judge whether these stimuli were natural or artificial (similar to a Turing test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each trial, participants were presented with a reference recording (naturally neutral) and six target recordings (three naturally emotional and three artificially emotional variants of the reference recording from the same speaker).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hit rates were calculated over all trials for each participant; 52% (SD = 14%) of the natural nonmodified recordings were rated as artificial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hit rate was only 42.1% (SD = 22) for happy-, 42.1% (SD = 16) for sad-, and 46.3% (SD = 21) for afraid-modified voices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These distributions did not differ from chance level (50%) for neutral [t(17) = 0.56, P = 0.57], afraid [t(17) = 0.72, P = 0.53], and happy [t(17) = 1.52, P = 0.14] and even approached significance (less detection than chance) for sad [t(17) = 2.09, P = 0.06].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Valence__Arousal__and_Dominance_Ratings_of_Audio_Manipulations_(Pilot_Experiment)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We recorded utterances of the same sentence as above spoken in a neutral tone by 16 (male: 8) relatively young (M = 20.1) native Japanese speakers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All recordings were sampled at 44.1 kHz, were normalized at zero mean and a maximum amplitude of 3 dB, and had a similar duration (M = 6.89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each recording was then processed by each of three audio effects of emotion-monitoring experiment 1 (happy, sad, or afraid), resulting in 16 trials of 4 stimuli per speaker (1 neutral and 3 processed): 64 audio stimuli in total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then asked n = 20 independent listeners (male: 20) from the same population to judge the emotional content of the voices using the SAM test methodology (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each trial, participants were tasked with placing all four stimuli on each of three continuous scales (from one to five) coding for valence, arousal, and dominance (hence, assessing not only their absolute position but also, their relative positions to one another).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were specifically instructed to report their perception of how they thought the speaker feels (John really sounds depressed today) and not how they felt (Im worried that John should sound so depressed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were also instructed to disregard the lexical content of the sentence with which they were presented (If a sad sentence is spoken with a happy voice, please report about the happy emotion, not the sad one).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Valence, arousal, and dominance scores for processed sentences in each trial were normalized by subtracting the scores of the corresponding neutral version.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized scores were then averaged over all trials within each participant (with 19 missing trials because of technical problems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized scores of manipulated speech differed from zero (i.e., from nonmanipulated speech) for happy voices [multivariate T2 = 20.15, F(3,17) = 6.0, P less_than 0.005], which scored with less arousal [M = 0.27, t(19) = 2.89, P = 0.009] and less dominance [M = 0.4, t(19) = 4.35, P = 0.0003] but no less valence [M = 0.02, t(19) = 0.28, P = 0.77] than neutral; sad voices [multivariate T2 = 41.8, F(3,17) = 12.48, P less_than 0.00015], which scored with less valence [M = 0.78, t(19) = 6.44, P = 0.000004], less arousal [M = 0.71, t(19) = 4.97, P = 0.00008], and less dominance [M = 0.85, t(19) = 5.16, P = 0.00005] than neutral; and afraid voices [multivariate T2 = 42.59, F(3,17) = 12.70, P less_than 0.00013], with less valence [M = 1.6, t(19) = 6.2, P = 0.000005] and less dominance [M = 1.14, t(19) = 4.68, P = 0.0001] but no less arousal [M = 0.45, t(19) = 1.39, P = 0.17] than neutral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the manipulations were perceived to be distinct from one another [multivariate F(6,14) = 10.0, Wilks  = 0.189, P = 0.00022) on both normalized valence (sad less_than afraid less_than happy; Fisher LSD, P less_than 0.05 for all pairs) and normalized dominance (afraid less_than sad less_than happy; Fisher LSD, P less_than 0.05 for afraidhappy and sadhappy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On normalized arousal, effects also ranked in the predicted direction (sad less_than afraid less_than happy) but not significantly so (Fisher LSD, P  greater than  0.05 for all pairs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Verbal_Descriptions_of_Audio_Manipulations_(Pilot_Experiment)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a subset of the stimuli used above: the same Japanese sentence spoken by 13 different speakers (seven female) who were all relatively young (M = 19.6) undergraduate students.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each recording was processed by each of three audio effects of emotion-monitoring experiment 1 (happy, sad, or afraid), resulting in four voices per speaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voices were then organized in pairs of stimuli consisting of one neutral and one processed voice from each speaker, leaving 3 pairs per speaker and a total of 39 different pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then asked n = 39 (male: 32) independent listeners from the same population to produce verbal descriptions of how the modified voices sounded compared with the neutral corresponding voice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each participant listened to 13 of 39 constructed pairs, and therefore, they rated each speaker exactly once (in one of three effects randomly).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each pair, participants were tasked to use between zero and three adjectives to describe the emotional difference between the modified and neutral voices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After discarding trials with no answer, in total, 380 words were collected in 143 happy trials (M = 2.6 words per trial), 395 words were collected in 144 sad trials (M = 2.7 words per trial), and 375 words were collected in 148 afraid trials (M = 2.5 words per trial).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voices modified with the happy effect were most commonly described as calmer (25% of trials), more cheerful (16%), childish (16%), happier (12%), darker (10%), and more friendly (8%) compared with neutral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voices modified with the sad effect were most commonly described as darker (28%), calmer (19%), sadder (17%), more dispirited (12%), tired (9%), and adult-like (8%) compared with neutral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voices modified with the afraid effect were most commonly described as sadder (42%), about to cry (31%), more tensed (16%), darker (14%), shivering (11%), and frightened (8%) compared with neutral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Emotion_Monitoring  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participant responses to posttest detection interviews were recorded by audio and written notes and then analyzed by the experimenters to categorize each participant into different detection levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 1 participant (female; condition: afraid) reported complete detection (you manipulated my voice to make it sound emotional), and only 15 (female: 14; happy: 7, sad: 3, and afraid: 5) reported partial detection (you did something to my voice; it sounded strange and it wasnt just the microphone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 93 participants (female: 74; happy: 20, sad: 25, afraid: 21, and control: 27) reported no detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To not bias any potential feedback results, the detecting participants were removed from all additional analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three participants were also excluded because of technical problems with the feedback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent results, therefore, concern a total of 93 participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Feedback_Effect  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the emotional self-rating task, the participants scores on the previously described dimensions of positivity and tension were compared pre- and postreading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scores (two levels: pre and post) were in significant interaction with the type of manipulation (three levels): repeated-measure multivariate analysis of variance (rMANOVA) F(4,124) = 3.30, Wilks  = 0.81, P = 0.013, Bonferroni,2|4 = 0.016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the happy and sad conditions, the general pattern of the emotional changes matched how the manipulations were perceived in the pretest: happy feedback led to more positivity [M = 7.4  greater than  6.9; Fisher least-square difference (LSD), P = 0.037; Cohens d = 0.75] but not significantly less tension (M = 3.0 less_than 3.6; Fisher LSD, P = 0.14); sad feedback led to less positivity (M = 7.0 less_than 7.5; Fisher LSD, P = 0.017; Cohens d = 0.70) and as predicted, no significant change in tension (M = 3.2 less_than 3.5; Fisher LSD, P = 0.29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite being the most salient of the manipulations, we did not see significant emotional changes in the afraid condition for either positivity (M = 6.5 less_than 6.8; Fisher LSD, P = 0.11) or tension (M = 3.8 less_than 4.0; Fisher LSD, P = 0.53) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The evolution of participants tonic SCL from minutes 38 was in significant interaction with the experimental condition [repeated-measure analysis of variance (rANOVA): F(15,425) = 2.29, P = 0.0037, Bonferroni,1|4 = 0.0125] (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SCL decreased the most in the control condition (M = 5.9% at t = 8) and less so in the sad (M = 1.6%) and afraid conditions (M = 2.4%), and it increased moderately in the happy condition (M = +0.6%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SCLs reached at t = 8 were different from control in all three conditions (Fisher LSD, P less_than 0.05; Cohens d: happy = 0.66, sad = 0.56, and afraid=0.47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steady decrease of tonic SCL seen in the control condition is the expected autonomic response associated with predictable and low-arousal control tasks, such as reading aloud (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although reports of systematic SCL dissociation between fear, sadness, and happiness are inconsistent (16), tonic SCL increase is typically associated with activated emotional states (17) as well as the appraisal of emotional speech or images (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Audio_Compensation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is known that speakers reading under any kind of manipulated feedback may remain unaware of the audio alterations but compensate for them by, for example, adapting the pitch of their vocal production (8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If such compensation occurred here, participants could be said to be monitoring their own expressive output, despite their lack of conscious awareness of the manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testing for such eventuality, we found no evidence of acoustical compensation in the participants produced speech: the temporal evolution of the voices fundamental frequencies, amplitudes, or voice qualities was not in significant statistical interaction with the experimental condition (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because participants were reading continuously a varied text of words as opposed to controlled phonemes as is often the case in pitch-altered feedback research, the variability in pitch over the course of speaking would make it difficult to detect compensation for the small pitch shifts used here (a 3-Hz increase in happy and a 3.5-Hz decrease in sad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further examine whether participants compensated for the emotional errors, even if they did not consciously detect them, we, therefore, replicated the first emotion-monitoring experiment with an additional emotional manipulation designed to feature drastically more pitch upshifting than before (+100 cents, a fourfold increase from happy) along with inflection and high-pass filtering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applied to neutral speech, the resulting manipulation gave rise to a stressed, hurried impression (compare Audio File S9 with Audio File S10 and compare Audio File S11 with Audio File S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the same adjective scales as above, we let 14 French speakers rate the emotional quality of processed vs. nonprocessed sample voices and found that this tensed manipulation differed significantly from neutral [multivariate T2 = 23.7, F(2,11) = 10.9, P = 0.0024], with increased tension but no change of positivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using this new manipulation, we then let n = 90 (all female) participants take part in a second emotion-monitoring experiment (neutral: 39, tensed: 38, and technical problems: 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results replicated both the low level of conscious detection and the emotional feedback found in experiment 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, only 2 of 38 tensed participants reported complete detection (5.6%), and 9 (23.6%) reported partial detection, proportions that did not differ from those in experiment 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, scores of the nondetecting participants (tensed: 27 and control: 39) on the previously described dimensions of positivity and tension were compared pre- and postreading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scores (two levels: pre and post) were in significant interaction with the condition [two levels; rMANOVA F(2,42) = 4.10, Wilks  = 0.83, P = 0.023, Bonferroni,1|2 = 0.025] in a direction congruent with the new manipulation: more tension [t(43) = 2.43, P = 0.019; Cohens d = 0.70] and no change of positivity [t(43) = 1.94, P = 0.06].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no interaction of the evolution of SCL with condition [rANOVA: F(6,258) = 1.17, P = 0.32, Bonferroni,2|2 = 0.05].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We extracted phonetical characteristics (mean F0, jitter, shimmer, and breathiness) from the manipulated (whats heard) and nonmanipulated (whats said) speech of nondetecting participants over successive 1-min windows from t = 3 to t = 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we compared the manipulated and nonmanipulated speech of the tensed group and found that all four characteristics differed in line with the manipulation made, with increased pitch [F(6,354) = 5.88, P = 0.0000; +43 cents] and shimmer [F(6,354) = 4.4, P = 0.0003; +0.6%] and decreased jitter [F(6,354) = 8.9, P = 0.0000; 15 Hz] and breathiness [F(6,354) = 8.3, P = 0.0000; 0.3 dB].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result shows that our method of analysis is sensitive enough to detect possible compensatory changes in voice production at least at a magnitude similar to that of the perturbation applied here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we compared the nonmanipulated speech in the tensed group with the speech in the control group and found that the evolution of all four characteristics did not differ with condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we again found no evidence that the participants compensated or otherwise adapted to the alterations (SI Text and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we created a digital audio platform for real-time manipulation of the emotional tone of participants voices in the direction of happiness, sadness, or fear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Classification results from both Japanese and French speakers revealed that the alterations were perceived as natural examples of emotional speech, corresponding to the intended emotions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was robust across several different forms of rating formats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In experiment 1, the great majority of the participants remained unaware that their own voices were being transformed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of listening to their altered voices, they came to react in congruence with the emotion portrayed as reflected in both self-report and skin conductance responses across the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In experiment 2, we replicated key findings from experiment 1 and again, found no evidence that our participants vocally compensated for the altered audio feedback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The low level of conscious detection of the manipulation as well as the absence of evidence of any compensation in the participants production provide no support for the hypothesis that we continuously monitor our own voice to make sure that it meets a predetermined emotional target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is significant because the neural processes underlying the production of emotional speech remain poorly understood (20, 21), and recent commentaries have suggested a central role of forward error-monitoring models in prosodic control (2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings instead give support to dual-pathway models of vocal expression, where an older primate communication system responsible for affective vocalizations, like laughter and crying, penetrates the neocortex-based motor system of spoken language production, offering less opportunity for volitional control and monitoring than its cortical verbal counterpart (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21, p. 542).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results do not rule out the possibility that mismatch was registered below the threshold for conscious detection (25) and that the manipulated feedback overpowered any potential error signals (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26 has a related discussion in the semantic domain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this suggestion would not explain why the nonconscious alarm was not acted on and especially, not compensated for in the participants vocal productions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, it is interesting to speculate about the small minority of participants who actually detected the manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we assume a matrix of conflicting evidence in the task (from interoceptive signals and exteroceptive feedback), it is possible that their performance can be explain by individual differences in emotional sensitivity and awareness (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When participants did not detect the manipulation, they instead attributed the vocal emotion as their own.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feedback result is as striking as the concomitant evidence for nondetection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship between the expression and experience of emotions is a long-standing topic of heated disagreement in the field of psychology (10, 29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Central to this debate, studies on facial feedback have shown that forced induction of a smile or a frown or temporary paralysis of facial muscles by botulinum injection leads to congruent changes in the participants emotional reactions (11, 3133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these experiments support the general notion that emotional expression influences experience, they all suffer from problems of experimental peculiarity and demand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants can never be unaware of the fact that they are asked to bite on a pencil to produce a smile or injected with a paralyzing neurotoxin in the eyebrows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these studies leave the causality of the feedback process largely unresolved: to what extent is it the (involuntary) production of an emotional expression or the afference from the expression itself that is responsible for feedback effects (33)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to all previous studies of feedback effects, we have created a situation where the participants produce a different signal than the feedback that they are receiving (in this case, neutral vs. happy, sad, afraid, or tensed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions allow us to conclude that the feedback is the cause of the directional emotional change observed in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, our result reinforces the wider framework of self-perception theory: that we use our own actions to help infer our beliefs, preferences, and emotions (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we do not necessarily react the same way to emotion observed in ourselves and that observed in others, in both cases, we often use the same inferential strategies to arrive at our attributions (12, 36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In experiment 1, the happy and sad manipulations registered a feedback effect on the self-report measure but not the afraid voice, whereas all three manipulations differed from neutral on the SCL measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unlikely that this outcome stemmed from different qualities of the manipulations, because all of them previously had been classified as the intended emotion (indeed, as can be seen in Fig 2, the transformations to afraid separated most clearly from neutral in the discrimination test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we suggest to explain this unpredicted outcome by looking at the appraisal context of the experiment (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike previous studies, where the intensity of emotions was modulated by feedback, in our experiment, emotions were induced from scratch in relation to the same neutral backdrop in all conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most likely, the atmosphere of the short story that we used was more conducive to an emotional appraisal in terms of general mood changes, such as happy and sad (and later, tensed), compared with a more directional emotion, such as fear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future studies, our aim will be to manipulate both context and feedback to determine the relative importance of each influence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alternatively, it should be noted that, although concordance between different measures, such as self-report and psychophysiology, is often posited by emotion theories, the empirical support for this position is not particularly strong (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a dual-systems view of emotion could, instead, interpret an effect on the SCL profile but not on self-report as unconscious emotional processing (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interpretation might be particularly fitting for an emotion like fear, where evidence indicates the existence of a unconscious subcortical route through which emotional stimuli quickly reach the amygdala (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, this result gives novel support for modular accounts of emotion production and self-perception theory and argues against emotional output monitoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future experiments, we will tie our paradigm closer to particular models of speech production (42, 43) and explore the interesting discrepancies between our results and the compensation typically found in pitch perturbation studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, real-time emotional voice manipulation allows for a number of further paths of inquiry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in the field of decision-making, emotion is often seen as integral to both rapid and deliberate choices (44), and it seems likely that stating preferences and choosing between options using emotionally altered speech might function as somatic markers (45) and influence future choices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More speculatively, emotion transformation might have remedial uses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been estimated that 4075% of all psychiatric disorders are characterized by problems with emotion regulation (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that positive attitude change can be induced from retelling of affective memories or by redescribing emotionally laden stimuli and events in a modified tone of voice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, outside academia, we envisage that our paradigm could be used to enhance the emotionality of live singing performances as well as increase immersion and atmosphere in online gaming, where vocal interactions between players often lack an appropriate emotional edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Experiment_1__Audio_Manipulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The happy effect processed the voice with pitch-shifting, inflection, compression, and a high shelf filter (definitions are in SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pitch-shifting was set to a positive shift of +25 cents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflection had an initial pitch shift of 50 cents and a duration of 400 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compression had a 26-dB threshold, 4:1 soft-knee ratio, and 10 dB/s attack and release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High shelf-filtering had a shelf frequency of 8,000 Hz and a high-band gain of 10 dB per octave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sad effect processed the voice with pitch-shifting, a low shelf filter, and a formant shifter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pitch-shifting had a negative shift of 30 cents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low shelf-filtering had a cutoff frequency 8,000 Hz and a high-band roll off of 10 dB per octave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formant shifting used a tract ratio of 0.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the afraid effect processed the voice with vibrato and inflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrato was sinusoidal with a depth of 15 cents and frequency of 8.5 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflection had an initial pitch shift of +120 cents and a duration of 150 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects were implemented with a programmable hardware platform (VoicePro, TC-Helicon; TC Group Americas) with an in/out latency of exactly 15 ms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experiment_2__Audio_Manipulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tensed manipulation consisted of pitch-shifting (+100 cents; a fourfold increase from happy), inflection (initial pitch shift of +150 cents and a duration of 150 ms), and high shelf-filtering (shelf frequency of 8,000 Hz; +10 dB per octave).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect was implemented with a software platform based on the Max/MSP language designed to reproduce the capacities of the hardware used in experiment 1, and it is available at cream.ircam.fr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
