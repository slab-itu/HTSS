Electrostatic lock in the transport cycle of the multidrug resistance transporter EmrE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EmrE is a small membrane transporter found in Escherichia coli that exports drug-like molecules from the cell, contributing to antibiotic resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In EmrE, as well as in the wider small-multidrug resistance transporter family, a specific anionic amino acid (E14) has been implicated in governing the conformational changes that export drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to sparse structural information, the exact interactions remain unidentified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through interactive molecular dynamics to incorporate existing cryo-electron microscopy data, we create a fully refined atomic model of EmrE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then embed this model in a lipid bilayer and evaluate the interactions within EmrE under different loading states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that E14 makes specific hydrogen bonds to neighboring residues, coupling observed experimental phenomena to interactions at the atomic scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EmrE is a small, homodimeric membrane transporter that exploits the established electrochemical proton gradient across the Escherichia coli inner membrane to export toxic polyaromatic cations, prototypical of the wider small-multidrug resistance transporter family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While prior studies have established many fundamental aspects of the specificity and rate of substrate transport in EmrE, low resolution of available structures has hampered identification of the transport coupling mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a complete, refined atomic structure of EmrE optimized against available cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data to delineate the critical interactions by which EmrE regulates its conformation during the transport process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the model, we conduct molecular dynamics simulations of the transporter in explicit membranes to probe EmrE dynamics under different substrate loading and conformational states, representing different intermediates in the transport cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The refined model is stable under extended simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water dynamics in simulation indicate that the hydrogen-bonding networks around a pair of solvent-exposed glutamate residues (E14) depend on the loading state of EmrE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One specific hydrogen bond from a tyrosine (Y60) on one monomer to a glutamate (E14) on the opposite monomer is especially critical, as it locks the protein conformation when the glutamate is deprotonated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrogen bond provided by Y60 lowers the pKa of one glutamate relative to the other, suggesting both glutamates should be protonated for the hydrogen bond to break and a substrate-free transition to take place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings establish the molecular mechanism for the coupling between proton transfer reactions and protein conformation in this proton-coupled secondary transporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Schematic of the transport cycle of EmrE following the alternating access mechanism with a strict 2:1 H+:TPP+ stoichiometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EmrE monomers (red and blue ellipsoids) swap conformations (schematically indicated by the size and angle of the ellipse relative to the membrane) and thus alternate the substrate/proton accessibility to the inside or outside of the cell when loaded with protons (Left) or substrate (Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the EmrE dimer is in its apo (Center) form, the transition should be forbidden (red dashed arrow) to preserve the coupling of proton and substrate transport and prevent proton leakage across the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apo state is in contrast to both the fully protonated and substrate-bound states (Left and Right columns, respectively), whose transition should be allowed (black solid arrows) for EmrE to fulfill its physiological function as a proton-driven polyaromatic cation transporter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The faRM generated by the refinement approach is a marked improvement over the initial crystal structure, which features only C atoms (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a simple static test of the faRM, metrics to assess the overall quality of the model were determined as a first step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallographers frequently use the molprobity score, which considers features such as rotameric states of side chains and interatomic clashes, as a metric to assess their structures (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The score is scaled such that the score is commensurate with the approximate resolution of the crystal structure (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molprobity score for the faRM was 0.89, a result that would be expected from a subångstrom resolution crystal structure (31), compared with the actual crystal structure resolution of 3.8 Å (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than 95% of side chains, which were all modeled due to their absence in the previously available structures, are in their favored rotameric and Ramachandran regions of conformational space, with only two outliers each in the 220 total amino acids of the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate analysis with PROCHECK (32) shows 93% of residues occupy their most favored region, compared with 73% in a recent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-based model (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through dynamic simulation, additional features of the modeled structure become apparent, as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stability_of_the_faRM_EmrE_Structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the extensive structural remodeling that took place before simulation and the poor resolution of the starting structure, the EmrE faRM might be expected to suffer from instability and fall apart over an extended simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) with respect to the crystal structure can be high relative to other simulated membrane proteins (Fig 2A), the majority of the simulations show rmsds that are comparable to, or below, the crystal structure resolution (3.8 Å), as is generally the case for membrane proteins (34), independent of the reference state (SI Appendix, Fig S5) or the monomers considered (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two notable exceptions are one B+ simulation and one TPP+-bound simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the TPP+-bound case, lipids intercalate into the dimer interface formed between helix 2 of each monomer and directly interact with TPP+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This splits apart the dimer, leading to a large rmsd for this simulation (SI Appendix, Movie S3), but not for the individual monomers themselves (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the B+ case, a helix rotation causes the formation of a continuous water channel, which increases the rmsd relative to the crystal (SI Appendix, Movie S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions were not observed in other simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the per-residue root-mean-square fluctuation (rmsf) measurements conducted over these same trajectories (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Fig S7), no large-scale conformational changes indicative of a concerted transport cycle are observed during these simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rmsfs are comparable to what would be expected for a dynamic and diminutive -helical membrane protein, with small fluctuations in the helical regions and larger fluctuations in the connecting loops and termini (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spontaneous fluctuations lead the protein away from an inverted faRM (ifaRM) state that would reflect an inward- to outward-facing state transition (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding, coupled with the short simulation timescales (500 ns) relative to measured millisecond timescale turnover rates (17, 18), means that biased simulations are required to drive conformational transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An essential feature of membrane proteins is the secondary structure formed by the polypeptide spanning the low-dielectric environment of the membrane (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High rmsd can hide the dissolution of protein secondary structure, including the eight transmembrane -helices of EmrE that collectively span the hydrophobic core of the 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) bilayer into which they were embedded (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By explicitly determining the secondary structure throughout the simulations using Stride (35), we show that the -helical secondary structure is maintained in all four transmembrane helical segments in both monomers (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identity of the residues belonging to each helix differs slightly, depending on the monomer (Fig 3B), likely due to the different structure of the connecting loops between the individual helices pulling on the ends of helical segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since it is plausible that the conformation at the ends of helices might change during the conformational transitions, further experimental restraints, e.g., those derived from future NMR experiments, would be instrumental in further refining the secondary structure assignment of each residue and improve the veracity of the simulated structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One example of an experimental observable that could be applied comes from recently published measurements of interresidue distances measured by EPR spectroscopy (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These EPR distance restraints were not considered during model construction in this work; however, the distances measured through EPR suggest substantial conformational change between different loading states for EmrE (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over our own simulations, large conformational differences were not immediately apparent between different loading states, as the distances between individual side chains correlate strongly across loading states (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since the correlations are not identically unity, and some spread can be observed, these results cannot rule out that subtle loading-dependent conformational changes have occurred, which we investigate more closely through the nonequilibrium transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EPR experiments focused on two loading states for EmrE: a TPP+-bound form for EmrE and EmrE at pH 5, corresponding to our doubly protonated A+B+ state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance between equivalent residues in the two monomers was measured using site-directed spin labeling (33), which we compared against the measured CC distances from our own simulations (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between the EPR spin-label distances and the distance between  carbons (C) is low (SI Appendix, Fig S10A), and the trendline has a slope below unity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in slope can be attributed to spin labels being larger than individual residues, which results in EPR-measured distances that are typically larger than the actual CC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low correlation coefficient comes primarily from residues within loops of the protein with measured distances that are substantially different in each method (SI Appendix, Fig S10B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the cryo-EM densities were weakest between helices, it is not surprising that the loop structures in our model have the weakest agreement with the EPR results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporating spin-label distributions into future EmrE refinements would improve loop structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

State-Dependent_Hydration_of_the_Lumen  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In investigating the different loading states of EmrE, an unexpected event occurred several times within our simulation setthe lumen of the doubly protonated A+B+ state spontaneously dehydrated (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other protonation states show typical behavior for a membrane transporter, with lumen water that can exchange directly with bulk water on one side of the membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the connection from the lumen to bulk water was severed in the A+B+ state, and the transporter spontaneously transitioned to a new state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this state looks occluded because the pocket of water in the lumen is disconnected from bulk solution, no large-scale conformational change has taken place (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, water interactions with the protein appear too weak to maintain a water channel into the lumen once the glutamates are protonated as in the A+B+ state, spontaneously breaking the water pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapid formation of an occluded intermediate is consistent with pH-dependent NMR studies, where low pH facilitates rapid conformational transition (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The TPP+-bound state (Fig 4) appears weakly leaky, with a visible water pathway between both top and bottom bulk water regions to the TPP+-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water leaks have been reported previously for other membrane transporters (40), and thus it is not surprising for a highly dynamic transporter such as EmrE to exhibit transient leaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, water leaks in EmrE are particularly interesting since EmrE transport is driven by a proton gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, any significant water leak could potentially serve as a conduit for protons across the membrane, short circuiting the transport cycle (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leaky states, where a water path exists between the two sides of the membrane, occur only transiently (Table 1), accounting for less than 10% of the total simulation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These leaky states are inhomogeneously distributed across the simulations conducted (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S12 and S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, the leaky states are often not conducive to rapid proton translocation via a water wire, as one or more water molecules within the path orient suboptimally for proton conductance due to interactions with the surrounding residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water orientation disrupts the chain of hydrogen bonds needed to form a conductive water wire, resulting in a minimal proton translocation probability (Table 1) that is consistent with the maintenance of a proton gradient in the absence of substrate (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the transient water wires observed in our simulations likely would not serve as efficient proton pathways (41), thereby maintaining the proton gradient that drives substrate export.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Water dynamics are particularly sensitive to the loading state of EmrE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TPP+-bound or A+B+ states exchange luminal water with bulk solution more slowly than do the other loading states (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the A+B+ case, this delay stems from the irregularity with which the water molecules isolated within the lumen can exchange with bulk water during the sporadic formation of water pathways at the dimer interface, as evidenced by the low number of water molecules in the lumen at any given time (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TPP+ blocks the exchange of water through a different mechanismtrapping it within the lumen by limiting the accessibility of water molecules nearest to the substrate and thereby retarding their exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with the model in Fig 1 since slower water disconnected from the bulk would be the first step in forming an occluded state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, viewed from the perspective of water dynamics, the A+B+ and TPP+-bound states are closer to transitioning than the other loading states tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Residue-Specific_Interactions_in_EmrE_Structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current model provides information about atomic interactions within EmrE, such as how hydrogen-bonding patterns change during the transport cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Table S1 details the interactions that exist throughout the antisymmetric dimeric faRM structure modeled here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many interactions, particularly those involving peripheral residues, remain unchanged under the different loading states for EmrE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other robust interactions include those internal to the structure, such as polar side chains interacting with nearby backbone carbonyl groups like the serine to alanine (S43A10) interaction exemplified in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most significant changes in hydrogen bonding occur in the vicinity of E14 as it responds to different loading states (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, the E14 side chain interacts directly with residues Y40, S43, and W63 of the same monomer and Y60 of the opposite monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T18, rather than interacting with the side chain of E14, instead interacts with the backbone, as in Fig 6B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions are modulated by changing the loading state of EmrE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the proton from W63 interacts with the side chain of E14 from the same monomer if E14 is deprotonated, but stretches across to the backbone or other nearby residues instead if E14 is protonated (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous mutagenesis experiments have identified these E14-interaction partners as important to the function of EmrE (30, 4245).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tryptophan W63, for instance, is highly conserved in the SMR transporter family (SI Appendix, Fig S15), and its mutation changes EmrE into a uniporter of cationic substrates (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations of tyrosine Y40 or serine S43 reduce the effectiveness of EmrE in exporting toxic substrates (30, 43), and S43 has been implicated in the specificity of EmrE to its substrates (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyrosine Y60 is one of the few completely conserved amino acids in the SMR family (SI Appendix, Fig S15), suggesting a role for the hydroxyl of Y60 in regulating the transport cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conservative mutation Y60F renders EmrE nonfunctional (30, 45), while the Y60T mutant remains functional but at a reduced capacity (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is clear that studying these specific interactions is highly relevant to the overall function of EmrE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, measuring direct hydrogen bonds tells only part of the story.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water-mediated hydrogen bonding, in which water molecules bridge the gap between donor and acceptor, also occurs between E14 and the key residues highlighted previously: Y40, W63, and Y60 (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water-mediated hydrogen-bonding pattern observed within a single monomer (Y40 and W63) remained unchanged for equivalent loading states, with similar patterns in both the A and B monomers, indicating that the interactions are retained throughout the transport cycle (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, the interaction between Y60B and E14A (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5A and 6B) is clearly inequivalent to the interaction between the opposite set of monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, this interaction is strongest when E14A is deprotonated (that is, the B+, TPP+, and apo states), suggesting that the protonation of monomer A might unlock the electrostatic lock that couples the monomers together and prevents conformational change when E14A is deprotonated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanistic hypothesis was tested by driven conformational changes, as discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TPP+_Dynamics_and_Membrane_Interaction_Within_EmrE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By including an explicit TPP+ molecule borrowed from the low-resolution crystal structure into the faRM, we are uniquely positioned to investigate the nature of the interactions between TPP+ and its binding site within EmrE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed binding site for TPP+ was consistent across the five independent trajectories, focusing primarily on the adjacent aromatic residues (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TPP+ came into contact with a number of other residues as well, including some on the C-terminal helix of monomer A (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonspecific nature of the observed interaction aligns well with the polyspecific nature of EmrE transport (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EmrE requires only two features of its substrates: (i) The substrate must be a cation so it is attracted to the electrostatic potential created by the two E14 residues and (ii) the substrate should have aromatic groups to satisfy the -stacking requirement of neighboring aromatic residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As mentioned previously, lipids play an active role in the structural dynamics of EmrE and consequently may influence the TPP+-binding pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipids wriggle their tails between helical interfaces and can influence protein structure, as observed in some high-rmsd cases (SI Appendix, Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the portal formed by cracking apart the interface between helices 2 from both monomers opens in a subset of simulations (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose two explanations for this phenomenon: (i) The residue packing along that interface is nonoptimal in the faRM, resulting in lipids wedging the monomers apart, or (ii) these gaps may form in vivo as well and might serve as a conduit for TPP+ binding and unbinding as it arrives via a membrane-derived route (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lipid-binding regions at the interface between the two helices 2 are large enough to accommodate TPP+ entry in some cases (Fig 8 and SI Appendix, Movie S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a hydrophobic cation, TPP+ is enriched in the membrane by a factor of 100 relative to solution (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EmrE may thus increase its substrate accessibility by allowing direct access of the substrate through the gap between the transmembrane helices, similar to other membrane proteins where substrates or ligands arrive via the membrane (48, 50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since the pathway for TPP+ binding is currently unresolved, further study will be required to distinguish between these hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Driving_the_Transition_of_EmrE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lock formed by the interaction between Y60B and E14A would be expected to slow the conformational transition for the apo state relative to the protonated states, similar to how protonation controls conformational change in acrAB-TolC (52), a complementary drug resistance transporter also found in E. coli (1, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis can be tested through driven simulations, where the average nonequilibrium work needed to induce the transition between an initial inward-facing and target outward-facing state can be compared between different loading states to deduce which one has the lowest barrier to conformational transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our initial states are seeded from the final conformation of the equilibrium trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploiting the unique symmetries presented by an antisymmetric homodimer, swapping the conformations of each monomer and exploiting symmetry generate the appropriate target state after conformational transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A biased simulation then drives the initial structure to the target structure by minimizing the rmsd to the target, with an example transition shown in SI Appendix, Movie S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using rmsd as a collective variable is known to generate suboptimal transition pathways (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the particular case of EmrE in the absence of a gradient driving conformational change and in a symmetric membrane, we know that the true free energy change must be zero, as the initial and target structures are related by symmetry to one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we use the nonequilibrium work, acknowledging that it contains a large dissipative component, as an approximate metric to judge the transition barriers, with less work implying lower transition barriers between inward-facing and outward-facing states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The order of the barrier height computed here can be qualitatively compared with measured transition rates from NMR (8, 18) and the prevailing transport cycle (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nonequilibrium work results (Fig 9) contrast with the transport cycle of EmrE (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A forbidden apo transition should have the highest nonequilibrium work of the states tested, signifying a high barrier to the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the TPP+-bound transition requires the most work (Fig 9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher level of work for the TPP+-bound case suggests that the TPP+-bound transition should be forbidden, in contrast with its physiological role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the high barrier for TPP+-bound transition is inconsistent with the simple transport model in Fig 1, it is consistent with measured transition rates from previous NMR studies (8, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protonation of EmrE by lowering the pH experimentally increases the conformational transition rate in the drug-free state from 40 s1 to 220 s1 (18), both of which are much faster than the conformational exchange rate of 5 s1 when TPP+ is bound to EmrE (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trend qualitatively suggests that the transition barrier under the experimental conditions should be A+B+less_than apo less_thanTPP+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise in our simulations, the barrier for the A+B+ state is lowest, followed by the singly protonated A+ and the deprotonated apo or singly protonated B+ states, which are distantly followed by the TPP+-bound state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, these measurements are made in the absence of any electrochemical gradient or applied electric potential, which prevents a direct comparison of our nonequilibrium simulations to the functional state in vivo, where there is a proton gradient as well as an electric potential difference across the bilayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, while we cannot say definitively how the TPP+ results fit into the transport cycle in Fig 1, the protonation results are in line with the concept of the electrostatic lock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If E14A is protonated (the A+B+ and A+ states), the transition is easier since the interaction between E14A and Y60B is disrupted (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, however, E14A remains deprotonated, the transition is made more difficult by retention of the interaction with Y60B, albeit with large uncertainties as a result of the disparate work values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the faRM accurately recapitulates available experimental transition rates and allows us to connect these observed rates to specific interactions induced by the protonation state of E14, as well as dehydration of the lumen upon E14 protonation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The work values can also guide us toward additional insight about the symmetry of the states observed in equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the A+B+ state yields both the highest and the lowest nonequilibrium work value (Fig 9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the low-work case, the initial state was close to being symmetric, with only a small rmsd difference between the initial state and the inverted state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case where the initial state is highly asymmetric, as measured by a much larger rmsd difference between the initial and inverted states, a much higher work value results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is again consistent with our examination of the interactions surrounding E14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most interactions to E14 are intramonomer interactions that are unable to change the relative configurations of the two monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The locking interaction between E14A and Y60B, however, is different, in that it crosses between monomers and breaks the symmetry between the monomeric interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, states where this locking interaction is intact will be more asymmetric, increasing the cost of transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, when the locking interaction is broken, as it is in the four lowest-cost transitions, the dimers are more symmetric, lowering the barrier to transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This intuition is consistent with the recent EPR study discussed previously, which suggested that the doubly protonated A+B+ state undergoes conformational change to become more symmetric than the apo state (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these results indicate that E14AY60B interaction changes in response to protonation control conformational transition in EmrE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Computational_Determination_of_pKa  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As discussed above, the E14 residues form direct and water-mediated interactions with surrounding residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions change with protonation state and, critically, differ between individual monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asymmetry in interactions should cause a noticeable pKa shift between the two E14 residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR studies have previously reported the pKa shift as 1.7±0.2 units in the temperature range we are simulating in the absence of TPP+, with one pKa at 6.8 and the other at 8.5 at 25°C (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, these pKa values suggest that the E14 residue with pKa 8.5 is almost always protonated at physiological pH whereas the lower pKa E14 would be selectively protonated, leaving open the question of which monomer has which pKa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This question is difficult to answer experimentally, as the symmetry of EmrE makes assignment of pKa to a specific E14 challenging, even as drug-bound NMR experiments have placed the proton on E14B (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we leverage our faRM to determine the order of protonation (and thereby assign pKas) in two ways: (i) analysis of structural elements and the interactions observed and (ii) a RETI calculation of the proton transfer reaction interconverting the A+ and B+ states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structural argument for shifted E14 pKa values is that the hydrogen-bonding patterns of E14 to other residues are largely equivalent between monomers A and B, except with respect to the interaction with Y60 from the opposite monomer (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Y60B could in principle donate a proton to E14A along the formed hydrogen bond, but Y60A does not donate a proton to E14B since there is no hydrogen bond between them, E14A should be more willing to lose its own proton (lower pKa) as it already partially shares the proton from Y60B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This general trend of increasing hydrogen bonds leading to lower pKa has been noted previously within many biological contexts (55, 56) Therefore, the free energy change of the proton transfer process from E14B to E14A should be positive, and any singly protonated state should place the proton on the B monomer, creating the B+ state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measure this effect explicitly through the alchemical transition of a proton on E14B transferring to E14A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RETI calculations suggest that the movement of the proton from the E14B to E14A is uphill by 1.53 ± 0.12 kcal/mol, equivalent to a pKa shift of 1.08 ± 0.08 pKa units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positive G is expected based on the asymmetrical interaction between Y60 and E14, confirming that monomer B will be protonated to a greater degree than monomer A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, since the measured 1.7-pKa unit shift at 25°C (27) is equivalent to a 2.4 kcalmol1G at room temperature, the overall accuracy of the RETI calculations performed is to within 1 kcalmol1, approximately the limit of our current classical force fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Connecting this evidence to the nonequilibrium work measurements, favoring the B+ state over the A+ state would raise the barrier to transition and would delay conformational transition until the second proton binds or the proton hops with small probability to A+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of a free-exchange model featuring exchanges of singly protonated EmrE (25), our expectation is that only E14B would be protonated, leading to a transport rate closer to that of the Apo state (40 s1) where the locking interaction is in place rather than the A+B+ state where the locking interaction is broken (220 s1) (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations do not test explicitly whether the Y60BE14A locking interaction would be retained if both TPP+ and a single proton are bound to EmrE, as is required for a free-exchange model (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since the locking interaction is also in place even when TPP+ is bound (Fig 6A), and E14B is the preferred protonation site based on NMR data (25), we hypothesize that the locking Y60BE14A interaction remains when TPP+ is bound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After substantial refinement based on the electron density maps provided by previous cryo-EM experiments (5), we have generated a stable dimeric structure of EmrE that is sequence complete and includes side chains of all residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on traditional crystallographic metrics, the quality of the resulting model improves substantially on the initial low-resolution X-ray structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high structural quality is in large part due to the interactive refinement used to extend the transmembrane helices to span the full membrane bilayer and position side chains such as proline to be consistent with protein population averages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With this model in hand, we provide mechanistic insight into the regulation of the EmrE transport cycle that had been unattainable previously, identifying interactions responsible for changes in observed conformational transition rates (8, 18) and their implications for new transport cycle models (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations indicate that transferring the proton from the B+ state to create A+ requires approximately enough energy (1.5 kcalmol1) to break a single hydrogen bond (57), definitively indicating that E14B protonates first, and that E14A accepts the second proton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This binding sequence is due to the asymmetry of cross-monomer Y60E14 interactions, with Y60B in a position to hydrogen bond with E14A, but not vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonequilibrium work measurements indicate a lower barrier to transition whenever E14A is protonated and the Y60BE14A interaction is broken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This evidence strongly suggests that Y60 is the electrostatic lock that couples protonation to conformational change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanistic importance of Y60 may explain its high conservation across the larger SMR family and suggests that novel drugs that mimic the locking action may improve the efficacy of existing antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the electrostatic lock, the hydration of the EmrE lumen also responds strongly to changes in the protonation state and transitions spontaneously into an occluded state when both E14A and E14B are protonated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with recent studies highlighting similar interactions regulating conformational changes in other drug transporters (52), the evidence presented here suggests that these pH-dependent locking interactions may be a general mechanism by which proton binding can be connected to conformational change in transporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Future experimental datasets, particularly from NMR spectra and recent EPR data (33), could be used in conjunction with the current model for further refinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future successor models that incorporate these additional datasets may shed light on questions that have not been addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include the relevance of the occasionally observed lipid intercalation into the dimer interface, the ingress and egress pathways of the substrate, and under what protonation conditions substrate binding can take place, such as adding TPP+ to singly protonated states (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another open question is how the behavior of substrate and protonation state changes under in vivo conditions, which include a substantial electrical potential (58) opposing the egress of charged substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Answering these questions will be essential to further exploring how drug export is coupled to protonation in EmrE as well as in the broader SMR family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are two primary accomplishments, the creation of the faRM itself and the simulations conducted once the faRM was in hand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both are detailed extensively in SI Appendix and briefly described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
faRM_Creation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The original basis for the faRM is the X-ray structure of a TPP+-bound EmrE dimer (10), which was completed using a combination of psfgen (59) and Modeller (60, 61) software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was further refined based on fitting the intermediate structure into an electron density derived from cryo-EM experiments (5), using the MDFF (22) to steer atoms to areas of high electron density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fitting procedure was carried out interactively (23) with the dimer embedded in an implicit solvent representation (62, 63), leveraging GPU acceleration of the implicit solvent model (64) in NAMD (59) to permit interactivity while the fitting was being carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying interactive forces accelerated structural changes by allowing high-conformational transition barriers to be overcome over a short timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Restraints maintained chirality during interactive fitting and adjustment of the structure (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After refinement, the model was embedded into a bilayer of DMPC lipids, which was created using CHARMM-GUI (66, 67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membrane-embedded structure was simulated again with the MDFF restraints retained to equilibrate the lipids around the inserted EmrE dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final product of this process is the faRM, which was simulated using five different loading states: the apo state, a TPP+-bound state, two singly protonated states (either E14A or E14B protonated), and a doubly protonated state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

faRM_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The simulations carried out all use the CHARMM36 force field for proteins (68), lipids (69), and TIP3 water (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters for the substrate TPP+ were determined using a combination of CGenFF (71) and reoptimization of the charges near the phosphorus center, using the force field toolkit (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TPP+ parameters are available in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each of the five loading states was equilibrated using NAMD (59) for 25 ns under a NPT ensemble to equilibrate the size of the periodic box dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure was then converted into a GROMACS-compatible format using TopoGromacs (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unbiased equilibrium trajectories of the five different loading states were then repeated five times for 500 ns each using GROMACS 5.0.4 (7476) under a NVT ensemble, for an aggregate simulation time of 12.5 s. These simulations were used for much of the analysis, which was carried out with the NumPy (77), SciPy, NetworkX (78), and Matplotlib (79) python packages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The final snapshots from these equilibrium simulations were also used as the starting point for biased simulations to drive the structural transition associated with substrate transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since EmrE is an antisymmetric homodimer (8), the target structure for these steered MD calculations was determined by symmetry from the end state of the equilibrium simulations, effectively driving the individual monomers to swap conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The COLVARS module (80) of NAMD (59) was used to drive the transition by with the rmsd to the target state as the reaction coordinate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional RETI calculations (26) were carried out to determine the relative pKas of E14A and E14B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
