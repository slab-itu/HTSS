FOXC1 maintains the hair follicle stem cell niche and governs stem cell quiescence to preserve long-term tissue-regenerating potential  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Stem cells (SCs) of the hair follicle (HF) undergo cyclical bouts of activity during which hair regeneration occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They reside in a specialized niche, the bulge, which confers upon them extended periods of quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) as a key transcriptional regulator of HFSC activity and bulge maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of FOXC1 reduces the threshold for HFSC activation, causing excessive HFSC usage and dramatically shortening periods between hair growth cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, signs of weakened cellular junctions are seen within the niche, resulting in mechanically induced, premature loss of established hairs along with some SCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consequences of these defects are dire for aging animals, which display diminished HFSC niches and a sparse hair coat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult tissue stem cells (SCs) reside in niches, which orchestrate SC behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SCs are typically used sparingly and exist in quiescence unless activated for tissue growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether parsimonious SC use is essential to conserve long-term tissue-regenerating potential during normal homeostasis remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we examine this issue by conditionally ablating a key transcription factor Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) expressed in hair follicle SCs (HFSCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FOXC1-deficient HFSCs spend less time in quiescence, leading to markedly shortened resting periods between hair cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced hair cycling accelerates HFSC expenditure, and impacts hair regeneration in aging mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, although FOXC1-deficient HFs can still form a new bulge that houses HFSCs for the next hair cycle, the older bulge is left unanchored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the new hair emerges, the entire old bulge, including its reserve HFSCs and SC-inhibitory inner cell layer, is lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We trace this mechanism first, to a marked increase in cell cycle-associated transcripts upon Foxc1 ablation, and second, to a downstream reduction in E-cadherinmediated inter-SC adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that when the old bulge is lost with each hair cycle, overall levels of SC-inhibitory factors are reduced, further lowering the threshold for HFSC activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our findings suggest that HFSCs have restricted potential in vivo, which they conserve by coupling quiescence to adhesion-mediated niche maintenance, thereby achieving long-term tissue homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Expression of FOXC1 and other key HFSC transcription factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Schematic of the adult hair cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HFs undergo cycles of telogen (Tel, rest), anagen (Ana, regeneration), and catagen (Cat, degeneration) throughout the lifetime of the animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each HF generates a new bulge and new club hair with every anagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) FOXC1 expression in anagen and catagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In anagen, FOXC1 colocalized with AE15 and GATA3, which are markers of the inner root sheath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Expression of key HFSC transcription factors in WT vs. Foxc1-cKO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that CD34 expression in Foxc1-cKO bulge tends to be weaker than WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Scale bars, 30 m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Depletion_of_FOXC1_Results_in_Faster_Hair_Cycling_and_Impacts_Long-Term_Hair_Coat_Maintenance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FOXC1 was expressed at all stages of the hair cycle in Bu-HFSCs, K6+ inner bulge layer, isthmus, and sebaceous gland (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In anagen, FOXC1 was also expressed in the differentiated inner root sheath that encases the new hair shaft, whereas in catagen, it was observed in the regressing portion of the HF (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In K14CreTg/WT × Foxc1fl/fl mice, FOXC1 was absent throughout skin epithelia (hereafter referred to as WT vs. Foxc1-cKO), whereas expression of other key HFSC transcription factors and overall skin architecture were intact (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To observe hair cycle progression under native conditions, we shaved the dorsal back of mice after each round of hair cycling, starting from the first hair coat in first telogen at P19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed us to pinpoint the hair cycle stage according to the transition of skin color from pink (telogen) to grey (anagen) (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation of a second hair coat and entry into the second telogen occurred normally, suggesting that anagen and catagen were unperturbed by loss of FOXC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Foxc1-cKO mice entered their next anagen and regenerated their third hair coat dramatically earlier than WT littermates (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, incorporation of BrdU confirmed the precocious proliferation of Foxc1-cKO HFSCs, indicating a shortening of the typically extended second telogen (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In subsequent hair cycles, Foxc1-cKO mice continued to display significantly shortened telogens relative to their WT counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 9 mo of age, many Foxc1-cKO mice were in their seventh telogen, whereas WT mice were still in their fourth telogen (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By these criteria, the major defect arising from loss of FOXC1 appeared to be a failure to maintain extended telogens, resulting in a dramatic increase in the frequency of hair cycling through most of the lifetime of the animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the overall markedly abridged telogens, Foxc1-cKO HFs still experienced a modest age-related extension in telogen length, a feature that is more conspicuous in WT HFs and that has been attributed to a rise in macro-BMP levels in aging skin (10) (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to their WT counterparts, even though young Foxc1-cKO mice generated grossly normal hair coats, their hair coats became sparser and frequently greyed as they aged (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggested that the bulge niche and its residents might be functionally impacted through excessive utilization during frequent hair cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FOXC1_Is_Necessary_to_Establish_a_Multiple-Bulge_HF_Architecture__and_Maintain_HFSC_Numbers_and_Function_with_Age  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore the consequences of FOXC1 loss further, we quantified Bu-HFSC numbers in young (P19, first telogen, and P42, second telogen) and aged (1.5 y) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In first telogen, both WT and Foxc1-cKO HFs had one bulge with no significant differences in Bu-HFSC numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in second telogen, although WT HFs had established a two-bulge architecture, Foxc1-cKO HFs still had only one bulge and failed to expand their Bu-HFSC numbers like WT HFs did (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This one-bulge phenotype persisted in subsequent hair cycles: whereas WT HFs had up to three and four bulges in third and fourth telogen, respectively, Foxc1-cKO HFs continued to maintain only one (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Once an old club hair is shed, the bulge structure disappears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in aged mice, WT HFs continued to maintain a two-to-four bulge architecture, whereas Foxc1-cKO HFs still had only one bulge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, their bulges were frequently smaller and contained dramatically fewer Bu-HFSCs compared with both aged WT HFs and young Foxc1-cKO HFs (Fig 2 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By these criteria, starting from the second telogen, Foxc1-cKO Bu-HFSC numbers appeared to wane with subsequent hair cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the ability of aged Foxc1-cKO HFSCs to regenerate hairs, we depilated the hair coat, which removes the club hair and its associated K6+ inner bulge layer, to stimulate HFSC proliferation and anagen entry (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, both young and aged Foxc1-cKO HFSCs proliferated 1 d earlier than their WT counterparts (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, by 5 d postdepilation, young and aged WT HFs and young Foxc1-cKO HFs had progressed to midanagen, but some aged Foxc1-cKO HFs were still in early anagen, even though their HFSCs in the bulge and upper ORS showed signs of proliferation (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, despite an initial accelerated response, aged Foxc1-cKO HFSCs regenerated a hair coat more slowly than their aged WT and young mutant counterparts, suggesting a functional decline (Fig 2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FOXC1-Deficient_HFs_Can_Make_a_New_Bulge_but_Fail_to_Maintain_the_Older_One  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intrigued by the one-bulge phenotype, we wanted to know how it arises, and if it results in more than just thinning of the hair coat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first determined whether FOXC1-deficient HFs failed to establish their new bulge or precociously lost their old one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the former, we labeled their lower ORS cells by administering BrdU in late anagen, long after the bulge had ceased proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT HFs, some of these BrdU-labeled ORS cells survived the ensuing catagen and made the K6+ inner layer of the new bulge, whereas the old bulge remained unlabeled (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Foxc1-cKO HFs, the single bulge displayed BrdU-retaining K6+ cells, indicating that it was newly formed (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that the old bulge was lost, we traced the old club hair by dyeing it in first telogen and tracking it through first anagen (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In late anagen, the dyed hairs of WT HFs persisted, but many of the hairs in Foxc1-cKO HFs were gradually lost (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence confirmed that in second telogen, WT HFs consisted of an old bulge that anchored a dyed hair and a new bulge that anchored a nondyed hair; in contrast, Foxc1-cKO HFs consisted of a single new bulge anchoring a nondyed hair (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicated that with every hair cycle, Foxc1-cKO HFs were able to generate a new bulge but failed to maintain the old one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preservation_of_the_Old_Bulge_Contributes_to_SC_Quiescence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether the old bulge plays a functional role in regulating hair cycling, we forced WT HFs to lose their old bulge precociously, thereby phenocopying Foxc1-cKO HFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we depilated them in first telogen to remove the club hair and inner K6+ bulge layer, and then allowed them to generate a new bulge and club hair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also shaved the undepilated posterior region to monitor natural hair cycle progression (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both depilated and undepilated halves generated new hairs and entered second telogen by P40 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although the posterior HFs now had two bulges, the anterior HFs had only one (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then shaved the new hairs to continue monitoring the hair cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the posterior two-bulge HFs stayed in second telogen for 6.5 wk, the anterior one-bulge HFs remained in second telogen for only 2.5 wk before regenerating a full hair coat precociously (Fig 3 B and F) (WT 2-Bu vs. WT 1-Bu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anteriorposterior boundary was maintained throughout both hair cycles, indicating that precocious anagen occurred specifically in one-bulge HFs only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The converse experiment was repeated (posterior half, depilated; anterior half, shaved) with analogous results (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the conditions used, HFs were age-, sex-, and strain-matched, thereby providing compelling evidence that the presence of the old bulge contributed to HFSC quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based upon the existing literature, we attribute this to the contribution of inhibitory signals, particularly FGF18 and BMP6, emanating from first, the suprabasal Bu-HFSCs, which arise from the interface between two adjacent bulges (13), and second, the K6+ inner layer of the old bulge (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with this notion and with a prior report that Foxc1 is a downstream target of BMP signaling in proliferative hair progenitors (14), we did not see significant changes in Fgf18 and Bmp6 transcripts on a per K6+ inner bulge cell basis in Foxc1-cKO one-bulge HFs, but we confirmed a reduction of inner bulge cell numbers, in addition to the complete absence of suprabasal Bu-HFSCs (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the microenvironment of the FOXC1-deficient bulge was likely to be reduced over WT for these inhibitory factors, a feature that would allow stimulatory signals to overcome the threshold for HFSC activation more easily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the impact of the old bulge, its loss was not sufficient to fully account for the acutely constrained telogen observed in Foxc1-cKO HFs (Fig 3F) (WT 1-Bu vs. cKO 1-Bu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it was important to determine whether FOXC1 loss alone was sufficient to elicit telogen shortening under conditions where two bulges existed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accomplish this, we used Sox9CreER to induce Foxc1 ablation in two-bulge HFs during second telogen and quantified telogen duration as time taken for at least 50% of dorsal skin to enter anagen (Fig 3E and Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that loss of FOXC1 alone shortened the second telogen of these two-bulge HFs, but to a lesser extent than when coupled with loss of the bulge (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was important to note that these two-bulge Foxc1-mutant HFs maintained their old bulges when they precociously entered anagen, but would lose them later and display a one-bulge phenotype in their next telogen (Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest that loss of FOXC1 influenced HFSC activity in at least two different ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FOXC1_Re-Establishes_and_Maintains_Quiescence_of_HFSCs_After_Their_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore HFSC-intrinsic effects resulting from the loss of FOXC1, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on late anagen and second telogen Bu-HFSC populations purified by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcripts [with fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads (FPKM)  greater than  1] that were significantly up-regulated [P less_than 0.05, false-discovery rate (q-value) less_than 0.05] upon FOXC1 loss were enriched for those encoding cell cycle-associated proteins, be it in anagen or second telogen (Fig 4A, Fig S4, and Datasets S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell cycle profiling performed on late anagen Bu-HFSCs confirmed that although WT Bu-HFSCs had largely returned to quiescence (G0, as judged by DNA content and absence of Ki67) following their proliferative activity in early anagen, an appreciable fraction of FOXC1-deficient Bu-HFSCs remained in the cell cycle (non-G0) (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a similar trend in second telogen, at a time when almost all WT Bu-HFSCs were in quiescence (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, FACS-purified FOXC1-deficient Bu-HFSCs exhibited greater colony formation efficiency in vitro, analogous to that displayed by the more primed HG-HFSCs (16) (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that loss of FOXC1 delayed the return of anagen Bu-HFSCs to quiescence, and also primed telogen Bu-HFSCs to proliferate precociously, our findings pointed to the view that FOXC1 acted to re-establish Bu-HFSC quiescence during anagen and maintain it during telogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, it was shown that absence of the transcription factor NFATc1 causes de-repression of the cell cycle gene Cdk4, precocious HFSC activation, and hair cycling (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when we conditionally ablated Nfatc1 in HFs, we discovered that in addition to their precocious hair cycle entry, HFs also displayed a one-bulge phenotype (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data led us to hypothesize that upon loss of either FOXC1 or NFATc1, the SC-intrinsic proliferative activity itself may contribute to both faster hair cycling and loss of the bulge; the bulge loss in turn couples with this SC-intrinsic proliferative nature to further accelerate future hair cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We revisit this fascinating possibility again later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FOXC1_Ensures_Anchorage_of_Old_Bulge_to_Prevent_Its_Loss_During_Anagen  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before exploring the possible relation between SC quiescence and bulge maintenance, we sought to understand how FOXC1 acts to preserve the old bulge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the old hairs were lost in anagen (Fig S2C), we examined the genes that were significantly down-regulated in Foxc1-cKO anagen Bu-HFSCs before their loss, and found an enrichment of cellcell and cellextracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion transcripts, along with those encoding various intermediate filament components (Fig S5 A and B and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hypothesizing adhesion to be the underlying defect causing the bulge loss, we tracked the fate of the old bulge and club hair using keratin 24 (K24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In first telogen, K24 was expressed specifically by Bu-HFSCs (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In anagen, besides labeling the old Bu-HFSCs, K24 also labeled a region of the newly growing HF that was adjacent to the old bulge, hence marking the site of the future new bulge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout WT anagen, the old bulge resided next to this new bulge site and below the sebaceous gland (Fig 5A, Upper, and Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In striking contrast, the Foxc1-cKO old bulge became separated from the new bulge site as the emerging new hair moved past it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As anagen progressed, the old bulge was seen above the sebaceous gland and sometimes even near the skin surface, being completely excluded from the new bulge region (Fig 5A, Lower, and Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process eventually resulted in the one-bulge HF observed in second telogen (Fig S5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further observed that this process sometimes left a trail of K24+ cells behind the old bulge, suggesting that HFSCs were being lost along with it (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, by flow cytometry, Foxc1-cKO HFs displayed few if any suprabasal Bu-HFSCs (CD34Hi6Lo) and a reduction in the proportion of basal Bu-HFSCs (CD34Hi6Hi) (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, as quantified earlier, Foxc1-cKO Bu-HFSC numbers were lower than WT beginning in their second telogen (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we performed a hair-pull test by applying an adhesive surgical tape and then peeling it off from the hair coat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, many more hairs came out from Foxc1-cKO than WT skin, indicating that Foxc1-cKO hairs were plucked out more easily than WT hairs (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest that FOXC1 functions in part to ensure adequate adhesion of the old bulge to prevent its loss during anagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proliferative_Bu-HFSCs_Display_Reduced_E-Cadherin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because loss of FOXC1 perturbed the transcription of genes encoding cellECM adhesion molecules, we FACS-purified Bu-HFSCs and tested their ability to adhere to different ECM components in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although cellECM adhesion defects could still be rooted in matrix production and organization, we did not observe significant differences in the ability of FOXC1-deficient and WT HFSCs to adhere to these various substrata (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the other hand, our data presented in Fig 4, along with the bulge-loss phenotype, raised the intriguing possibility of a possible link between SC-intrinsic proliferative behavior and a reduction in intercellular adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two cellular events often occur concomitantly in different biological contexts, prompting us to address whether the propensity of FOXC1-deficient Bu-HFSCs to proliferate might impact their intercellular adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We focused on E-cadherin, the central core of adherens junctions that are known to feature prominently in epithelial skin progenitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT telogen HFs (Fig 6A, Left), both basal (Fig 6 A, Inset a) and suprabasal (Fig 6 A, Inset b) CD34+ Bu-HFSCs showed intense junctional E-cadherin immunolabeling, irrespective of whether they were in contact with themselves or with the inner K6+ layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in Foxc1-cKO HFs, junctional E-cadherin immunolabeling was reduced, especially at sites where Bu-HFSCs contacted each other (Fig 6A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was intriguing given that E-cadherins gene, Cdh1, was not affected transcriptionally by loss of FOXC1 (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the Foxc1-cKO bulge often consisted of three layers of disorganized and elongated cells, as opposed to the well-organized bilayer of compacted cells in WT bulge (Fig 6A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We pursued these tantalizing hints at a relation between cell proliferation and intercellular adhesion by monitoring E-cadherin protein levels in WT Bu-HFSCs as they underwent the hair cycle (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Bu-HFSCs displayed their highest levels of E-cadherin during telogen, while they were quiescent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In striking contrast, E-cadherin protein levels plummeted during early anagen as HFSCs became proliferative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels were up-regulated again as HFSCs returned back to quiescence in late anagen (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, E-cadherin protein (but not mRNA) (Fig S6B) expression inversely correlated with cell-cycle gene expression, which was high in early anagen, down-regulated in late anagen, and further reduced in telogen (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although Foxc1-cKO Bu-HFSCs exhibited similar E-cadherin expression dynamics, they exhibited lower levels than WT Bu-HFSCs at each stage throughout the hair cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was especially evident in late anagen and telogen (Fig 6B), a feature that corresponded to their atypical persistence in the cell cycle as revealed by RNA-seq and cell cycle profiling (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking these data together, we find that the failure of Foxc1-cKO Bu-HFSCs to return to quiescence and up-regulate E-cadherin promptly in late anagen could generate a mechanically weakened cellcell adhesion state, which could account for the loss of the old bulge as the newly growing hair pushed passed it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct_Perturbation_to_CellCell_Adhesion_Is_Sufficient_for_Bulge_Loss  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, to functionally test if reduction in E-cadherin was sufficient to cause the bulge loss in Foxc1-cKO HFs, we conditionally ablated Cdh1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Cdh1fl/fl × K14Cre mice exhibit early aberrations in HFs (18), we used Sox9CreER to efficiently induce Cdh1 ablation in second telogen HFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this time, some HFs had begun to display a disorganized bulge with three cell layers, similar to that seen in Foxc1-cKO HFs (Fig 6 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then allowed HFs to progress from second telogen  second anagen  third telogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We checked for timing of second anagen entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike FOXC1 loss mediated by the same Sox9CreER (Fig 3 E and F), E-cadherin loss did not result in precocious anagen, consistent with its putative role downstream of Bu-HFSC proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, like Foxc1-cKO HFs, as Cdh1-cKO HFs were undergoing their second anagen, their bulge was mis-localized relative to the newly specified bulge region (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, as the old bulge moved upward, some K24+ cells moved with it and were excluded from the new bulge region, whereas others were left behind ectopically (Fig 6D, arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subsequently, by third telogen, like Foxc1-cKO HFs (Fig S3 C and D), most Cdh1-cKO HFs displayed single bulges (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, with the exception of the precocious entry into the hair cycle, the bulge-loss phenotype seen with depletion of E-cadherin bore resemblance to that of Foxc1-cKO HFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with the fact that FOXC1-deficient Bu-HFSCs displayed only reduced and not silenced E-cadherin, the full Cdh1 ablation in HFs resulted in a more severe phenotype, evident in their single bulge displaying an aberrant structure (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based upon these collective data, we conclude that the loss of the old bulge in Foxc1-cKO HFs was predicated upon enhanced proliferative activity of Bu-HFSCs, coupled with reduced E-cadherin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability to make tissues is a necessary feature of all SCs, regardless of differences in the dynamics of tissue regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro, many tissue SCs, including epidermal and HFSCs, can be passaged long-term without loss of their tissue-regenerating capability (1923).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, SC markers can lineage-trace progeny that survive in tissues long term (24, 25), although a recent detailed study of hematopoietic SC (HSCs) self-renewal suggests that adult homeostasis may be sustained by multiple short-term SCs that receive rare input from polyclonal long-term HSC (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all of these cases, the outcome is long-term ability to regenerate the tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Less is clear about the multiple facets that are required to balance SC use within the native tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice lacking FOXC1 in their hair coat allowed us to explore this captivating issue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In dissecting their complex phenotype that arises by the loss of a single transcription factor, we unearthed a variety of ways in which HFSCs interact with their environment to govern their proliferation and conserve their tissue-regenerating potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we found that FOXC1 loss in HFs causes the following: (i) Bu-HFSCs become primed to proliferate, as evidenced by their cell cycle status, earlier response to an activating stimuli in vivo, and increased colony forming efficiency in vitro; (ii) Bu-HFSCs express lower E-cadherin levels in part because of their proliferative nature; (iii) HFs lose their old bulge as a result of the compromised cellcell adhesion, and fail to expand their SC numbers and thicken the animals hair coat; (iv) HFs consequently accelerate their hair cycling; (v) When aged, HFs fail to maintain Bu-HFSC numbers and regenerate new hairs promptly, leading to a markedly sparse hair coat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two_Is_Better_Than_One__The_Role_of_the_Older_Bulge  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our work has established an importance for the unique property of mouse pelage HFs to preserve their older bulges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike WT HFs, Foxc1-cKO HFs always lose their prior bulge whenever they make a new one, and thus never advance past their initial starting point of having only one bulge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A critical repercussion is the loss of local inhibitory factors emanating from both K6+ inner bulge (11) and suprabasal Bu-HFSCs that normally form the interface between two bulges (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This becomes manifest in the failure of either FOXC1-deficient Bu-HFSCs or WT Bu-HFSCs in a one-bulge environment to stay in prolonged quiescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although ablation of Foxc1 in a two-bulge HF did shorten the SC quiescence period, indicative of an intrinsic defect, the presence of the second bulge nevertheless delayed the precocious anagen entry of the active bulge compared with that seen in Foxc1-cKO one-bulge HFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are relevant in light of other HFs, such as rodent whiskers, which do not accumulate multiple bulges and, like Foxc1-cKO pelage HFs, also exhibit shorter telogen durations (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, our results provide compelling evidence that prior bulges participate in regulating HFSC quiescence and hair cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, excessive tissue regeneration and SC expenditure have no favorable outcome in FOXC1-deficient mice, as their hair coat remains thin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that furry mammals have acquired a means to generate new bulges and preserve the old ones to maintain tissue-regenerative potential for the lifetime of the animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been demonstrated that HFSCs that have undergone fewer divisions are set aside in the old bulge to participate in wound healing, whereas those with more divisions are recycled into the new bulge and tasked with homeostatic hair regeneration (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A WT HF almost never accommodates more than four bulges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What happens to the older bulges is still unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intriguing idea is that once a bulge sheds its old hair, its HFSCs with their low division history fold into the newer bulges and rejuvenate the HFSC pool to improve its efficiency in hair cycling and wound repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Intercellular adhesion defects are also at the root of another mouse mutant that fails to maintain its hair coat, namely mice lacking the desmosomal glycoprotein, desmoglein 3 (DSG3) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That said, the mechanism of bulge and club hair loss by Foxc1-cKO HFs seems to be distinct from Dsg3-KO mice, which always lose their new hair during telogen, and hence undergo cyclical balding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Foxc1-cKO mice lose only their old hairs (and not the newly generated hair) during anagen, and thus continuously display a new hair coat layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the adhesive defect in Dsg3-KO HFs was attributed to reduced adhesion between the two bulge layers, whereas that in Foxc1-cKO HFs appears to involve inter-HFSC adhesion, resulting in a failure to retain the old bulge HFSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The hair loss process that occurs naturally is known as exogen, in which the club hair is shed from the HF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because it happens infrequently in WT pelage HFs, multiple bulges accumulate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When it does happen, it largely coincides with anagen (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Foxc1-cKO HFs also lose their club hairs in late anagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although exogen is thought to involve the proteolytic shedding of the club hair from the bulge in situ without loss of Bu-HFSCs (31), Foxc1-cKO HFs appear to lose their old bulge (K24+ HFSCs, K6+ inner cells, and club hair) in its entirety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, Foxc1-cKO bulge loss appears to take place only when subjected to a stimulus, which in the hair cycle is the mechanical force imposed by the newly growing hair during anagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, during telogen the single bulge remains in position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As more is learned about the normal process of exogen, the extent to which Foxc1-cKO mice might serve as a model of premature exogen should become more apparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

An_Aged_Phenotype_Not_Normally_Observed_in_WT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse pelage HFs use multiple strategies to keep their SCs quiescent and restrict the number of hair cycles only to what is necessary to maintain a full hair coat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the hair coats of aged and young mice are usually quite similar in appearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when mice are forced by repeated depilation to undergo excessive hair cycling, their hair coat greys, suggesting a deleterious impact on melanocyte SCs that are activated along with Bu-HFSCs during regeneration (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, it is interesting that the Foxc1-cKO hair coat also greyed as mice aged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Foxc1 ablation was restricted to the epithelium, its effects on melanocytes appeared to be a secondary consequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although future studies will be needed to dissect the precise mechanisms, the hair greying could reflect overuse of melanocyte SCs during the more frequent hair cycling, a failure of a smaller bulge to accommodate sufficient melanocyte SCs, or defective cross-talk between FOXC1-deficient HFSCs and WT melanocyte SCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the context of HSCs, their exhaustion is typically determined by their decline in ability to reconstitute the entire hematopoietic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been demonstrated that the less-proliferative HSCs from aged mice of longer-lived strains reconstitute the blood more efficiently than the more proliferative HSCs from aged mice of shorter-lived strains, suggesting a more rapid functional exhaustion in the latter (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we propose a highly analogous case of HFSC exhaustion, in which FOXC1-deficient Bu-HFSCs are able to cope with tissue maintenance in young mice but, having undergone more rounds of cell division and tissue regeneration than WT, find themselves impaired in their ability to maintain their numbers and make new hairs promptly in aged mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially intriguing given that HFs naturally set aside SCs that have divided more frequently for new rounds of hair production (11), and FOXC1 loss further expends their activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intercellular_Adhesion__E-Cadherin__and_SC_Biology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The timing of bulge loss in anagen suggests that the reduction of E-cadherin leads to a weakening of intercellular connections within the bulge that are necessary to withstand the mechanical pressures of hair protrusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, it is notable that adherens junctions are needed to organize actin-myosinbased filament networks across skin epithelial cells and are also important in sensing and activating tension-based signaling (3335).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the precise mechanisms involved in bulge retention remain to be elucidated and could involve more than E-cadherin, these relations provide a plausible working model for how loss of FOXC1 might be linked functionally to the reduced threshold in withstanding the mechanical tension necessary to anchor the reserve SC pool throughout subsequent hair cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our studies suggest that the proliferative nature of Foxc1-cKO Bu-HFSCs can partly account for their reduced E-cadherin protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, as evidenced in WT Bu-HFSCs, E-cadherin levels inversely correlated with cell cycle status throughout the periodic bouts of tissue regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion is further supported by the transcriptional changes that occur in Bu-HFSCs during the hair cycle: when proliferating in early anagen, Bu-HFSCs are enriched for up-regulated genes encoding cell cycle proteins, whereas many down-regulated genes encode for cell-adhesion proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, when Bu-HFSCs cease proliferation in late anagen, cell cycle genes are down-regulated, whereas cell-adhesion genes are up-regulated (Dataset S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our studies show that in late anagen, FOXC1 is necessary to re-establish Bu-HFSC quiescence and restore E-cadherin levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In its absence, cells remain proliferative and cell-adhesion gene expression and E-cadherin levels remain low, ultimately causing the loss of the bulge and its associated consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our findings best fit a model whereby the loss of FOXC1 leads to elevated cell cycle transcripts and enhanced HFSC activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn reduces E-cadherin levels, heightening the sensitivity of the old bulge to mechanical stress induced by hair growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With each prior bulge lost during the subsequent anagen, a shortage of Bu-HFSCs and inner bulge cells arise, further accelerating HFSC activity and use by lowering the threshold for their activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least for the WT pelage HF in the context of its native environment, prudence in conserving stem cell activity appears to be essential to maintain its SC numbers and preserve its tissue-regenerating activity throughout the lifetime of the animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice_and_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Foxc1flox mice were obtained from Tsutomu Kume (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K14-Cre, Sox9-CreER, Nfatc1flox, Cdh1flox and Rosa26Flox-Stop-Flox-YFP mice were described previously (3741).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sox9-CreER was activated by intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen (75-g/g body weight, in corn oil) once a day for 23 d. BrdU (Sigma; 50-g/g body weight) was injected intraperitoneally into mice twice a day before putting mice under anesthesia to obtain a skin biopsy or before lethal administration of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For depilation experiments, molten wax was applied onto the hair coats of anesthetized mice and peeled off after hardening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the tape assay to analyze hair adhesion, a narrow strip of cloth surgical tape of fixed length was attached onto hairs of anesthetized mice and peeled off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the hair-dye experiment, hairs of anesthetized mice were dyed using a glow-in-the-dark red hair color cream for 3040 min before rinsing dye off under warm water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dyed hair coats were visualized by fluorescence under Leica dissection scope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animals were maintained in an animal facility approved by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, and procedures were performed with protocols approved by Rockefeller Universitys Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee members and staff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hair_Cycle_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HFs were staged based on Müller-Röver et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To track hair cycles, full-length telogen hairs were trimmed with electric clippers to reveal back skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HF entry into anagen was determined by darkening of skin and reappearance of hair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Completion of anagen and catagen and re-entry into telogen were determined by appearance of full-length hairs and loss of pigmentation in skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hairs were trimmed again to observe entry into the next anagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were checked in this way twice a week for long-term monitoring of hair cycle status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Progression of first and second hair cycles in Black Swiss and C57BL/6J strains were verified to be largely similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foxc1flox (Black Swiss) × K14-Cre (CD1) mice were back-crossed for  4 generations to pure Black Swiss mice to achieve a background strain of  greater than  90% Black Swiss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foxc1flox (Black Swiss) × Sox9CreER × R26-YFP (C57BL/6J) mice were of mixed background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hair cycle phenotypes were consistently observed in both genders of mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
