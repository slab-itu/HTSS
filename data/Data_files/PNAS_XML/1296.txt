Potassic, high-silica Hadean crust  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand early Earths habitability, we need to know when the continental crust first formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the combined actions of plate tectonics and erosion, most of the evidence of the early crust has been destroyed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To shed light on this debate, we analyzed the strontium isotopic composition of apatite inclusions in zircons from Nuvvuagittuq, Canada, where independent evidence suggests a crust-forming event prior to 4.2 Ga, possibly as early as 4.4 Ga. Our results show that this early crust had a high Rb/Sr ratio and therefore a high silica content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the early Earth was capable of forming continental crust within less_than350 million y of solar system formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding Hadean (4 Ga) Earth requires knowledge of its crust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composition of the crust and volatiles migrating through it directly influence the makeup of the atmosphere, the composition of seawater, and nutrient availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its importance, there is little known and less agreed upon regarding the nature of the Hadean crust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analyzing the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of apatite inclusions in Archean zircons from Nuvvuagittuq, Canada, we show that its protolith had formed a high (1) Rb/Sr ratio reservoir by at least 4.2 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result implies that the early crust had a broad range of igneous rocks, extending from mafic to highly silicic compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The Sm/Nd (Top), Rb/Sr (Middle), and Lu/Hf (Bottom) ratios as a function of SiO2 content for a compilation of Phanerozoic rocks (35), the Spirit Mountain Batholith (36), and the Bishop Tuff (7) show that Sm/Nd and Lu/Hf ratios are not monotonic functions of SiO2 content, and, thus, high-silica magmas can appear similar to mafic ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Rb/Sr ratios are a monotonic function of SiO2 content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Spirit Mountain Batholith was included, because it is a well-sampled pluton that ranges from 52 wt% to 78 wt% SiO2 and shows broadly the same trends as the global rock compilation, especially in Rb/Sr and Lu/Hf ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bishop Tuff was included to show an extreme case of high-silica magmatism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measured 87Sr/86Sr ratios from our 10 apatite inclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The green, brown, and blue lines show the evolution of 4.4-Ga reservoirs with Rb/Sr ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.65, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Rb/Sr ratios are significantly higher than those in mafic rocks and suggest a felsic crust formed by 4.4 Ga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncertainties are 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Zircons were separated from a sample of orthogneiss (NSB14) and a fuchsite-rich quartz unit (NSB11b and NSB11a) (17, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  U-Pb dating of the zircons was performed using the UCLA CAMECA ims1270 secondary ion mass spectrometer, using standard procedures (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because a Pb-Pb age of a discordant zircon is a lower limit on the crystallization age, our inferred Rb/Sr ratios are biased to be too low rather than too high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, because detecting ancient Pb loss by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is difficult due to the flat nature of concordia, we do not use the U-Pb information and interpret only the Pb-Pb ages as the minimum age of the zircon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to the Lu/Hf system, where precise knowledge of concordance is vital for an accurate ingrowth correction; we do not perform an ingrowth correction because of the low Rb/Sr ratios in apatites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three zircons were dated in a different analytical session, and, thus, only Pb-Pb ages are available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inclusion search was conducted using energy-dispersive X-ray detectors on the University of Chicago TESCAN LYRA3 focused ion beam/scanning electron microscope following the procedure of Bell et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxygen isotopes were analyzed for five zircons on the UCLA CAMECA ims1290 SIMS using standard procedures (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strontium isotopes were analyzed on CHILI following the procedures described by Stephan et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (16) and using the resonance ionization scheme of Liu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RIMS is a technique in which atoms are liberated from the sample surface and then resonantly ionized using tunable lasers, before being analyzed in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advantages to this technique are that it is element specific and has very high sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used CHILI (16), which has a 351-nm desorption laser with 0.8 m spatial resolution for sample removal and has achieved precisions of 2 (as determined in this study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When using Durango apatite as a standard for Madagascar apatite, our measured 87Sr/86Sr ratio is 0.7123 ± 0.0015 (1), which agrees within uncertainty with the known value of 0.711798 ± 0.000013 (1) (33) (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The uncertainty propagation includes the contribution from counting statistics, standard reproducibility, and background subtraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncertainties on the reported isotopic ratios of the apatite inclusions are dominated by counting statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since our apatites are included in zircon, we attempted to measure the strontium concentration in the host zircon, but we did not detect any strontium ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This precludes the possibility of 87Rb in the zircon decaying to 87Sr and therefore biasing our result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, zircon does not contain any significant rubidium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are not surprising in light of the low zircon/melt partition coefficients expected for rubidium and strontium, based on their atomic sizes and charges (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
