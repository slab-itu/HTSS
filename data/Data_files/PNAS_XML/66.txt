Medieval warming initiated exceptionally large wildfire outbreaks in the Rocky Mountains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the western United States and other forested regions, climate change may increase both the frequency of wildfires and the amount of area burned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of past climate changes and their effects on wildfires can provide constraints on potential future wildfire risks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we reconstruct the history of wildfire across a representative subalpine forest landscape in northern Colorado over the past two millennia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Warming of 0.5 °C 1,000 years ago increased the percentage of our study sites burned per century by 260% relative to the past 400 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large increase in the number of sites burned by fires highlights the risk that large portions of individual landscapes may burn as climates continue to warm today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many of the largest wildfires in US history burned in recent decades, and climate change explains much of the increase in area burned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of extreme wildfire weather will increase with continued warming, but many uncertainties still exist about future fire regimes, including how the risk of large fires will persist as vegetation changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Past fire-climate relationships provide an opportunity to constrain the related uncertainties, and reveal widespread burning across large regions of western North America during past warm intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether such episodes also burned large portions of individual landscapes has been difficult to determine, however, because uncertainties with the ages of past fires and limited spatial resolution often prohibit specific estimates of past area burned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accounting for these challenges in a subalpine landscape in Colorado, we estimated century-scale fire synchroneity across 12 lake-sediment charcoal records spanning the past 2,000 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of sites burned only deviated from the historic range of variability during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) between 1,200 and 850 y B.P., when temperatures were similar to recent decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 1,130 and 1,030 y B.P., 83% (median estimate) of our sites burned when temperatures increased 0.5 °C relative to the preceding centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lake-based fire rotation during the MCA decreased to an estimated 120 y, representing a 260% higher rate of burning than during the period of dendroecological sampling (360 to 60 y B.P.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased burning, however, did not persist throughout the MCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Burning declined abruptly before temperatures cooled, indicating possible fuel limitations to continued burning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Temperature explains 28.6% of the variance of area burned in a simple linear model (dashed line) (P less_than 0.01 after accounting for temporal autocorrelation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lines between points are connected through time, with the symbols indicating the general direction of points through time [i.e., the red line generally moves from left (past) to right (toward present), the blue line generally moves from right (past) to left (toward present)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different relationship between temperature and the percentage of sites burned when warming (red; 1471,110 y B.P.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and cooling (blue; 10800 y B.P.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  indicates a hysteresis between temperature and the percentage of sites burned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Local_and_Landscape_Fire_Patterns_During_Climate_Change  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies at landscape scales in boreal and subalpine forests have argued that multiple lake records from the same area should show synchronous fire episodes if climate exerted a significant influence (14), but there was little to no dependence among Holocene-length fire frequency records (19, 20, 3234).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, local or stochastic factors, such as topography, vegetation, or lightning strikes, were likely important for influencing fire frequency at individual study sites (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly site-specific fire frequency histories at our sites (Fig 2B) support this inference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our individual records were, at times, out of phase with each other despite being located on the same landscape, and any one record may or may not directly correlate with centennial-scale temperature trends (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2B and 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within this variability, a high probability exists that the majority of our sites burned in a single century at the beginning of the MCA (Fig 3B), but a high density of records across a large landscape (e.g., 0.01 lakes per square kilometer across 1,000 km2 in this study) appears to be required to detect such an effect (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation within any individual record often obscures the relationship between climate and fire (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2B and 3C), and many study areas may be too small to have burned even during years with extreme fire weather.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As records are compared over large study areas, however, the climate signal in the fire history data exceeds the variability found across individual sites and the climatic control on fire becomes apparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at regional scales, climate signals can also exceed the background range of stochastic variability (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, peak biomass burning during the MCA appeared in data from 0.01 lakes per square kilometer across 2,000 km2 in Alaska (13), but not in a high-density study (0.02 lakes per square kilometer) across a small area (200 km2) in Colorado (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If ideal fire conditions during the early MCA generated even just one large fire complex that burned near many of our sites, the additional charcoal peaks may have produced the significant increase in sites burned, but the rarity of such events even under optimal conditions could mean that such an event, and the attendant increase in charcoal deposition, may not have burned or been detected in a smaller study area in the same region (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, both sufficient density and spatial coverage may be needed to detect a significant relationship between stochastically distributed fires and climate at landscape scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the global climate continues to warm, the bottom-up and stochastic influences, such as those influences that generated the local variability in individual lake records, will likely continue to mediate fire responses at landscape scales even as regional-scale fire regimes shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, climate change may increase area burned regionally, but stochastic and local processes may result in fires temporarily decreasing or not increasing for decades at any one site (19, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such dynamics, after 1,080 y B.P., represent one possible explanation for the decline in fire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Controls_of_Large_Wildfire_Outbreaks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Warming 0.5 °C at the beginning of the MCA corresponds with the largest increase in the percentage of sites burned (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mechanism for the increased sites burned could include a lengthened fire season from warmer temperatures (2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1,080 y B.P., the percentage of sites burned decreased abruptly, but because temperatures remained high for another 250 y, other factors must explain the subsequent decline in sites burned (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moisture changes could explain the decline if moisture changes favored reduced wildfires, but long-term and seasonal moisture trends appear inconsistent with the fire history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, moisture reconstructions from our study region and other portions of the western United States indicate severe drought during the MCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reconstructed drought severity increased during or after the percentage of sites burned declined: A regional drought area index achieved its maximum at 1,050650 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (38), whereas fire extent declined between 1,080 and 770 BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most severe decadal drought in the past 1,200 y in our study region lasted between 804 and 795 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (39), but overlapped with the period with the lowest median percentage of sites burned between 2,000 and 270 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotopic records from lake sediments in Colorado also indicate increased summer evaporation after 1,080 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (which would favor fire) (40), but the number of sites burned per century declined during this period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual and decadal drought trends play an important role in the annual extent of burning (7, 15, 41), but the relationship with aridity appears to differ over long ( greater than 100 y) temporal scales (36) and does not explain the decline in the number of fires in our study area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The absence of a well-documented climatic driver for the abrupt decrease in the percentage of sites burned indicates the potential for hysteresis in the fire-climate relationship, meaning that the relationship of fire to temperature differed depending on direction (warming or cooling), possibly mediated by vegetation or stochastic declines in fire (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean charcoal accumulation rates (z-scores in Fig 3) show a similar pattern as charcoal accumulation also peaked during early MCA warming and declined before temperatures cooled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that hysteresis in the fire-climate relationship could be driven by important vegetation-fire feedbacks or a stochastic decline in fires, which would be relevant to modern climate change impacts (1, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first case, multiple vegetation-fire feedbacks potentially contributed to the decline in the number of fires while temperatures were still elevated after 1,080 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, young stand ages may alter postfire fuel cover and limit the spread of subsequent fires for the first few decades after a fire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, MCA fires that burned 80% of our study sites would have required new tree regeneration across much of the forest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such changes in fuel do not typically limit the spread of fire across subalpine forests (despite structural and composition differences among seral stages) (30, 42), but the area burned increases with time since the last fire in spruce-firdominated forests (30, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, high-severity fire can burn in young lodgepole stands, but often only under extreme fire weather (42), and old lodgepole stands ( greater than 300 y) burn more often and at higher severity than young stands (15, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the structure of postfire stands during the MCA could have limited the ignition and spread of subsequent fires in the first few decades after the peak in MCA fires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Legacies of postfire forest structure and regeneration rates that persist over centuries may have further limited fuel accumulation and fire size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limitations on seed sources (e.g., via burning of nonserotinous coniferous populations) may have increased regeneration time if conditions were unfavorable and large burned patches dominated the landscape (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, severe droughts between 1,050 and 650 y BP would have reduced fuel moisture and favored ignition and wildfire spread on scales of days to weeks (45), but droughts after the initial MCA fires may have also reduced postfire germination, killed seedlings susceptible to variations in moisture, and favored the mortality of mature trees either directly or via pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, drought has reduced spruce and fir seedlings and, ultimately, mature tree densities on xeric sites for decades after fire (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subalpine forests are typically not considered fuel-limited, but additional analyses could evaluate whether repeated severe droughts over centuries limit fuel connectivity and fire spread through effects on regeneration and mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, stochastic variation in fire could have influenced the decline in fires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wildfires require multiple factors to burn large portions of the landscape: sufficiently dry fuels, high winds, low humidity, ignition, and sustained severe fire weather from weeks to months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the rarity of large fire outbreaks even under optimal climates, the combination of factors required for high-severity fires may simply not have been met during the later portion of the MCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these hypothesized factors (decreased regeneration and fuels through drought, seed source limitations, and stochastic variation in fire) may have caused or combined to cause fire to decrease while temperatures were still elevated between 1,080 and 850 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Was_Burning_in_the_MCA_Similar_to_Today?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across the western United States, biomass burning increased in the MCA, but regional charcoal production also rose by a similar magnitude at the beginning of the Little Ice Age and with European settlement (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results, however, indicate a significant change in the fraction of landscapes burned during the MCA and at no other period in the 2,000-y record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large fraction of the landscape burned in and around the Mount Zirkel Wilderness during the MCA has few historic equivalents in the Rocky Mountains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, only 15% of our study area burned in the past 80 y (Fig 1A) and only 30% of the area in a 129,600-ha study area in Yellowstone National Park burned from 1890 to 1988 (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using Yellowstone National Park fire history as a baseline for comparison, our minimum estimate of 50% of sites burned within a century at the beginning of the MCA exceeds any century-scale estimate of Yellowstone National Park burning for the past 750 y (15, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparing past fire regimes with fire regimes of the 20th century involves comparing periods with and without large human modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although humans modified low- to mixed-severity fire regimes in the 20th century, little evidence suggests that human activities caused high-severity fire regimes to exceed the historic range of variability in subalpine forests (7, 4851).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The available evidence suggests that stochastic processes combine with weather and climate to determine the first-order patterns of fire variability at the landscape scale and will continue to be the main drivers for the foreseeable future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Historically, few landscapes burned as extensively as the Mount Zirkel Wilderness burned during the MCA, but temperatures have only been comparable to the MCA for the past few decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this short period of recent warmth, temperature increases facilitated a substantial rise in area burned even if wildfire has yet to reach the magnitude observed during the MCA (3, 4) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our reconstructed fire-climate relationships show the sensitivity of subalpine systems to increases in mean annual temperature of only 0.5 °C and indicate a significant risk that, in the absence of fire-mediated vegetation change and counteracting stochastic declines, fires will burn large areas in the coming century if temperatures continue to rise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Area_and_Historic_Fires  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the past 82 y (19302012 C.E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), 13,616 ha burned (nonoverlapping) within our study area in the Routt National Forest (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area burned historically was calculated from class C fires or larger (4.05 ha) as recorded on archived fire maps and more recent (19852012) online fire histories (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2002, the Mount Zirkel Complex fire, the largest fire in our study area since detailed fire maps were maintained staring in the 1930s, burned 12,648 ha (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To extend the record of area burned through the past 2,000 y, we cored 12 lakes within a sampling area of 100,000 ha (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our sampling area was calculated as a single rectangle that included a 3-km perimeter around each of our coring sites (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, based on charcoal transport distances (15), charcoal accumulation peaks at these lakes are derived from an area of 34,000 ha, which is equivalent to sampling 34% of the landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high density of lakes within the area provides a network of charcoal records near previous fire reconstructions that were developed from dendroecological data (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tiago Lake was cored in 1996, and the remaining 11 lakes were cored between 2010 and 2012 (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All lakes were cored in water deeper than 5 m and were chosen to have similar surface areas (16 ha) to limit variation in charcoal records by variations in basin size (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detecting_Past_Fires  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each core was subsampled at 0.5- or 1-cm contiguous intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sediment (14 cm3) was sieved at 125 m and oxidized with household bleach or 6% (wt/wt) hydrogen peroxide (Summit Lake) for 24 h. Charcoal was then counted under a stereomicroscope (with a magnification between 10× and 40×) underlain with a grid pattern to aid counting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peaks in charcoal accumulation (pieces of charcoal per square centimeter per year) represent fires in the sampling interval within 13 km of the lake and were identified using standard methods in the program CharAnalysis (15, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we refer to detected peaks as fires for ease of discussion, even though a small probability exists that two or more fires could be combined into a single detected fire event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In CharAnalysis, charcoal accumulation was first interpolated to the median sampling interval age of all lakes (18 y per subsample; Table S2) as in other multilake charcoal studies (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Background charcoal was then estimated and subtracted from charcoal accumulation with a Lowess smoother robust to outliers, with a smoothing window chosen based on the best separation of charcoal accumulation peaks from the background (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peaks in the residual charcoal accumulation were identified as significant in a two-step process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, peaks were identified if they exceeded the 99th percentile of the noise distribution in a local Gaussian mixture model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the peaks were screened with a minimum-count test, where significant peaks have less_than5% chance of being derived from a Poisson distribution of the raw charcoal counts from the previous 75 y (14, 53) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Age_Models__Estimating_Percentage_of_Sites_Burned__and_Fire_Rotation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the significant peaks identified as fires, we calculated the probability that multiple fires overlapped within 100-y windows to estimate the percentage of sites burned by incorporating the age uncertainties generated from the R package Bchron (22, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bchron models sediment age relationships using a conservative Bayesian framework that constrains sedimentation with the prior information that the sedimentation is monotonic, piecewise linear, and continuous (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between calibrated radiocarbon dates (56), ages are randomly selected from the calibrated distributions; sedimentation is then approximated with a random number of break points in a piecewise linear model, following monotonicity and continuity between the two dates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bchron enables the user to repeat the process thousands of times to generate possible age-sediment models within the prior constraints on sedimentation (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bchron thus assigns thousands of possible ages to a given depth in a core, which enabled us to generate age probability distributions for the depth of each charcoal peak determined to represent a fire (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each depth, we generated 20,000 initial ages, removed the first 2,000 (burn-in), and thinned the record by selecting every eighth age for a total of 2,250 possible ages at a given depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To estimate century-scale burning as a percentage of sites burned, we used the 2,250 possible ages from 118 of the 120 fires to calculate the frequency that randomly drawn ages for each fire overlapped in a given century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two of the 120 fires were excluded because the age uncertainty did not extend into the past 2,000 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the number of records decreases further into the past, we constrained our analyses to the past 2,000 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our century-scale window is greater than the sampling interval of sediment, more than one fire from any given lake core could be included in the total sum for each century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dataset provided 2,250 random combinations of fire ages, which yielded probability distributions (histograms) of the number of fires per century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the 5%, 50%, and 95% percentile values from these distributions for the median and 90% CIs of the percentage of sites burned (Fig 3B); the time series was smoothed with a Lowess smoother at a 100-y window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the percentage of sites burned, we estimated fire rotation by modifying the equation from Baker (49):FR=tC/L[1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where FR is lake-based fire rotation, t is the time window in years, C is the total number of charcoal peaks in the given time window, and L is the total number of lakes recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this modification, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 is the inverse of our percentage of sites burned estimate (Fig 3B) for a 100-y time window (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach considers the charcoal source area (a 1- to 3-km radius around a lake that does not change over time) as a point on the landscape and lake-based fire rotation as an estimate of the time required for L number of fires to be recorded in any number of sampled lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant charcoal accumulation peaks represent fire within 13 km of a lake (15), but charcoal accumulation peaks do not provide information on how much of the area burned, similar to individual fire-scarred trees in a study plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the variation in area burned in a charcoal source were local or stochastic, then the variation over enough time and space would provide an accurate estimate of fire rotation across the landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate this approach, we estimated lake-based fire rotation within the time period (360 to 60 y B.P., 15902010 C.E.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  that Howe and Baker (30) used to estimate fire rotation from fire scars and stand age reconstructions within a portion of our study area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their conservative fire rotation estimate (excluding one stand reconstruction that did not preserve evidence of fire) is 321 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our median estimate for lake-based fire rotation across the entire landscape within this same period was similar at 315 y (90% CI: 252387 y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, given the age uncertainty of individual fires, we calculate a median probability of 16 fires from 12 lakes occurring in the past 420 y and an upper 95% and lower 5% probability of 20 and 13 fires, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Howe and Bakers estimate (30) derived from a single watershed of our study area, and variation of fire rotation estimates between watersheds may be different from the entire landscape (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional fire rotation estimates for the past several centuries for subalpine forests in Wyoming and Colorado fall between 225 and 350 y (36, 49), similar to our uncertainty of 252387 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correspondence between our lake-based fire rotation and tree-ring based fire rotation suggests that our assumption of variation in area burned within the charcoal source area is supported by comparisons to spatially and temporally precise fire scar and stand origin fire rotation estimates and represents a close estimate of fire rotation with multiple lake records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Baker (49) noted, a list of fires from a small plot can instead be treated as simply point data on fire presence or absence, with fire-regime reconstruction done at the landscape scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This modification of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, however, remains largely untested as a measure of true fire rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use lake-based fire rotation in this study to provide a common metric for contrasting rates of burning in the past 420 y to the century of peak burning centered at 1,080 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because records with lower temporal resolution affect detection of discrete charcoal accumulation peaks (57, 58), charcoal records from Hinman Lake, Middle Rainbow Lake, and Teal Lake were truncated to the median age of the last calibrated radiocarbon date before sedimentation slowed at these sites at 1,300 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Hinman Lake and Middle Rainbow Lake records have a significant charcoal accumulation peak (fire) at 1,234 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Hinman Lake) and 1,289 y B.P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Middle Rainbow Lake), close to where the record was truncated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When calculating the percentage of sites burned, these fires at the end of the record proved problematic, because the age uncertainty of the two fires exceeded the end of the calibrated dates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure these fires at the end of the calibrated dates did not inappropriately increase the percentage of sites burned for estimates older than 1,200 y B.P., we resampled the age distributions of the last fire at Hinman Lake and Middle Rainbow Lake from below the 99th percentile of the distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of 2,250 initial possible ages, resampling the age distributions excluded 20 and 23 possible ages from the last fire at Hinman Lake and Middle Rainbow Lake, respectively, and had no meaningful effect on the estimate of the percentage of sites burned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these three lake records start near the onset of the MCA, we also tested whether they influenced our results by excluding the three lakes from our percentage of sites burned calculation shown in Fig 3B, and found that they did not alter the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excluding the records from Hinman Lake, Middle Rainbow Lake, and Teal Lake generated a similar curve to Fig 3B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transformed charcoal z-scores were calculated by rescaling individual charcoal accumulation records in three steps: (i) minimax transformation, (ii) BoxCox transformation, and (iii) dividing by the SD of the data (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The records were then smoothed in a two-step process: the samples were first prebinned with nonoverlapping bins to minimize the effects of records with differing resolutions, and they were then smoothed with a Lowess smoother to minimize outliers similar to the methods of Daniau et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (16) and implemented in the Paleofire R package (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CIs were calculated by bootstrapping the prebinned charcoal series 1,000 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a bin width of 18 y (same interpolation interval for peak analysis above) and a smoothing window of 100 y (Fig 3C) to keep parameters similar to the time scale associated with our estimates of the percentage of sites burned (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Temperature_and_Area_Burned  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mean annual temperature deviations (30-y averages) were obtained from a recent continental pollen-based temperature reconstruction and used as a representative sample of continental temperature change in the MCA (11) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MCA was used as a period of recent warming, but previous periods in the Holocene have been warmer (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the relationship between temperature and the percentage of sites burned at the same resolution as the temperature data (30-y time steps) using the presmoothed median estimate of the percentage of sites burned in a simple linear model (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pearsons correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between temperature and area burned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective degrees of freedom were estimated after accounting for first-order temporal autocorrelation in both temperature and the percentage of sites burned (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear model was fit with the lm function in the base statistics R package, and all calculations were performed in R (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
