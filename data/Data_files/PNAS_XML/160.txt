Lasing in robust cesium lead halide perovskite nanowires  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nanowire lasers are miniaturized light sources with great potential for integration into optoelectronic circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the current nanowire lasers either require extreme conditions for synthesis or suffer from poor operational stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We synthesize nanowires of a promising set of compositions, the cesium lead halides, and accomplish this under near-ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These nanowires act as efficient laser cavities and are capable of lasing with relatively low excitation thresholds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also demonstrate unprecedented stability for a perovskite-based nanowire laser and offer a new nanoscale platform for future study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rapidly growing field of nanoscale lasers can be advanced through the discovery of new, tunable light sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission wavelength tunability demonstrated in perovskite materials is an attractive property for nanoscale lasers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas organicinorganic lead halide perovskite materials are known for their instability, cesium lead halides offer a robust alternative without sacrificing emission tunability or ease of synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the low-temperature, solution-phase growth of cesium lead halide nanowires exhibiting low-threshold lasing and high stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The as-grown nanowires are single crystalline with well-formed facets, and act as high-quality laser cavities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanowires display excellent stability while stored and handled under ambient conditions over the course of weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon optical excitation, FabryPérot lasing occurs in CsPbBr3 nanowires with an onset of 5 J cm2 with the nanowire cavity displaying a maximum quality factor of 1,009 ± 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lasing under constant, pulsed excitation can be maintained for over 1 h, the equivalent of 109 excitation cycles, and lasing persists upon exposure to ambient atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wavelength tunability in the green and blue regions of the spectrum in conjunction with excellent stability makes these nanowire lasers attractive for device fabrication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our initial study focused on CsPbBr3 nanowires, as previous reports suggest this composition is strongly photoluminescent (26, 34) and capable of stimulated emission (2931).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we have already reported the synthesis of colloidal CsPbBr3 nanowires (34), those nanowires are too narrow (20-nm diameter) to efficiently confine the 535-nm emission and are therefore unable to support photonic lasing (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve lasing, nanowires with diameters greater than 180 nm are required, but these are not currently accessible using the colloidal synthesis method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, a low-temperature solution-phase process reported by Zhu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afforded single-crystal hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) nanowires and nanoplates with diameters of a few hundred nanometers (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by this method, we demonstrate a new solution growth process to synthesize single-crystal CsPbX3 (X = Br, Cl) nanowires and nanoplates by dipping a PbI2 thin film into a CsXmethanol solution with mild heating (50 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method represents, to our knowledge, the first reported synthesis of surfactant-free CsPbX3 nanowires and nanoplates through a simple, low-temperature, solution-phase process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed discussion of the nanowire growth method may be found in the Supporting Information (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shown in Fig 1A, a wide range of CsPbBr3 nanoscale morphologies was produced during the 12-h reaction including nanowires, nanocrystals, and nanoplates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanowires range in length from 2 to 40 m and in width from 0.2 to 2.3 m, placing them in an ideal size regime for photonic nanowire lasing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of nanowires were found to have rectangular cross-sections (Fig 1A, Inset) with strongly wire-dependent height-to-width ratios (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanowires were chosen for study based on the presence of clean, well-formed facets, which are critical for efficient emission confinement, and transferred by micromanipulator to a clean, fused silica substrate for all optical experiments (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The elemental composition and atomic structure of the nanowires were quantified to ensure they conformed to the expected, room-temperature orthorhombic phase of CsPbBr3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the CsPbBr3 growth substrate shows strong diffraction peaks which can be assigned to the pure orthorhombic crystal structure (space group Pbnm), and does not contain impurity peaks from either the PbI2 or CsBr starting materials (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clear splitting of the narrow 002 and 110 peaks further indicates that the as-grown CsPbBr3 is of the room-temperature orthorhombic phase and comprises large, crystalline domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanowire composition was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, which indicated the presence of Cs, Pb, and Br in a 1.1:1.0:2.7 ratio, in close agreement with the CsPbBr3 phase (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of the nanowires was determined through selected area electron diffraction (SAED) as shown in Fig 1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SAED pattern shown in Fig 1D (Inset) indicates that the nanowires are single crystalline and may be indexed to the [110] zone axis of the orthorhombic phase of CsPbBr3 in agreement with the XRD pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the SAED pattern, the nanowire growth direction was also indexed to the [002] direction of the orthorhombic phase of CsPbBr3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Photonic lasing arises from the unique ability of a nanowire to act as both gain medium and laser cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forming the nanowire from a stable, highly absorptive, and emissive material allows for stimulated emission to occur upon reaching a sufficient carrier density (11, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanowire geometry defines the laser cavity, which is bounded on either end by the nanowire end facets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in refractive index between the nanowire and its environment (atmosphere, substrate, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  generates significant end facet reflectivity as well as efficient wave guiding along the length of the wire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CsPbBr3 nanowires, lasing was achieved via optical excitation from a femtosecond pulsed laser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At excitation densities below the lasing threshold, spontaneous emission dominates, and the nanowire is uniformly emissive as shown in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon surpassing the threshold, however, stimulated emission takes over and a periodic emission pattern is observed (Fig 2 C and D), which is caused by interference of the coherent emission from the two end facets of the nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dependence of the photoluminescence (PL) spectral response on increasing excitation fluence is shown in Fig 2E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spontaneous emission from a CsPbBr3 nanowire is centered at 516 nm with a 16-nm (74 meV) FWHM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spontaneous emission peak first increases with increasing excitation intensity, then plateaus as narrow, closely spaced lasing peaks (0.5-nm minimum FWHM) emerge on the red edge of the emission spectrum near 532 nm and grow rapidly with excitation intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The narrow peaks correspond to FabryPérot lasing modes as the mode spacing is found to change linearly with the inverse of the nanowire length (Fig 2F, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power-dependent output intensity (Fig 2F) follows the typical S-curve shape and depicts all three PL regimes: spontaneous emission dominates at low excitation intensities until the onset of lasing near 5 J cm2 (Pth), the superlinear PL increase indicative of amplified spontaneous emission follows, and finally gain-pinning and the emergence of lasing occurs past 10 J cm2 (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full set of power-dependent spectra is shown in Fig S5A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the individual peak widths from the spectra in Fig 2E provides information about the nanowire laser cavity quality (Q) factor, or how well the cavity confines and amplifies emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Q factor is mode dependent with stronger modes possessing higher values because this corresponds to more efficient amplification and thus higher emission intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the relationship Q = /, where  is the peak center wavelength and  is the peak width, a maximum, single-mode Q factor of 1,009 ± 5 was determined with an average of 960 ± 60 when considering the four major modes (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Time-resolved PL (TRPL) can be used to measure the carrier population dynamics of the laser cavity above and below the lasing threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below the lasing threshold (Fig 2G, red trace), the nanowire PL signal decays biexponentially with the rapid component (154 ± 2 ps, 81%) contributing much more than the slower component (970 ± 20 ps, 19%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on preliminary TRPL measurements of previously reported, surface-passivated, colloidal CsPbX3 nanowires, which exhibit much longer lifetimes (1 ns), we attribute the rapid component to surface state recombination and the longer component to bulk recombination (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the excitation fluence is increased past the lasing threshold, an additional decay component is observed (less_than30 ps, 87%), which decays more rapidly than the other components (110 ± 2 ps, 11%; 720 ± 20 ps, 2%) as well as the instrument response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rapid decay corresponds to the stimulated emission process depleting carriers that would otherwise undergo spontaneous emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low-lasing threshold and high-Q factor place these nanowires in the upper tier of nanowire lasers and clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of CsPbBr3 as a gain medium (see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10, 19, 31 for detailed lists of nanowire lasers and their performance characteristics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanism for optical gain by stimulated emission in perovskite nanostructures is still under investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CsPbX3 quantum dots, support for both single-exciton and biexciton lasing has been demonstrated (31, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of biexciton-driven stimulated emission, a 50-meV red-shifted emission band was assigned to biexciton recombination, in agreement with expected biexciton binding energies in CsPbX3 quantum dots (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas we observe a similar asymmetric red-shifted emission band at 290 and 6 K (Fig S7), the red shift of 69 meV is an order of magnitude larger than expected for biexciton binding energies in non-quantum confined CsPbBr3 nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we postulate that an electronhole plasma (EHP) mechanism is responsible for stimulated emission, as proposed in well-known compositions such as ZnO (38) and GaN (39) as well as in recent CH3NH3PbX3 nanowires (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An EHP is formed in bulk crystals when the carrier density surpasses the Mott density; here, the carrier density at the lasing threshold was estimated to be 6 × 1017 cm3 by finite-difference time-domain simulation (Supporting Information), a factor of 3 greater than the bulk CsPbBr3 Mott density of 2 × 1017 cm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the formation of an EHP is expected to lead to a blue shift in the cavity modes due to a decrease in the refractive index that arises from exciton absorption saturation (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a blue shift of 2 nm with increasing excitation fluence (Fig S5B), suggesting that an EHP mechanism is responsible for stimulated emission in CsPbX3 nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further study is needed, however, to elucidate the stimulated emission carrier dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cesium lead halide materials have been shown to be stable when exposed to atmospheric water or heat, making them attractive for real-world application (27, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CsPbBr3 nanowires reported here are stable for days under ambient atmosphere and illumination without loss of morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the material composition remains intact over the course of months and does not separate into PbBr2 and other byproducts as has been demonstrated for some hybrid perovskite materials (Fig 3A) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CsPbBr3 nanowires are also stable under constant, pulsed excitation above the lasing threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanowires were excited to 1.2 Pth under either a closed nitrogen atmosphere or ambient atmosphere (26 °C ± 0.5 °C, 50% ± 1% relative humidity) and the integrated emission intensity was monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results shown in Fig 3B indicate significant operating lifetimes even under atmospheric conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under nitrogen, nanowire lasing continues uninterrupted for longer than 1 h or over 109 excitation cycles (Fig 3B, blue trace), with the nanowire undamaged after this time (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under atmospheric conditions, lasing output is observed to decrease over the course of the experiment, but it does not fall below the original output until over 4.4 × 108 excitation cycles (Fig 3B, red trace).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, amplified spontaneous emission from thin films of CsPbBr3 falls to 90% after only 1.6 × 107 excitation cycles (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In hybrid perovskite materials, whispering gallery mode lasing in CH3NH3PbI3 persists for 8 × 106 excitation cycles (40), whereas the long-term lasing stability of CH3NH3PbX3 nanowires lasers has not been reported (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stable, continuous lasing operation observed here is promising for future applications as it suggests both high photo- and thermal stability under ideal or suboptimal environmental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lasing is also possible for other CsPbX3 compositions and geometries besides CsPbBr3 nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-crystal nanowires of CsPbCl3 were successfully synthesized by replacing CsBr with CsCl during the reaction, with the XRD pattern confirming the expected tetragonal phase of the as-grown CsPbCl3 (see Fig S9 for characterization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smooth, rectangular facets of the CsPbCl3 nanowires, as well as the strong PL emission centered at 418 nm, make them ideal for extending the wavelength range of CsPbX3 nanowire lasers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon focused excitation, lasing occurred near 430 nm with the emergence of narrow peaks similar to CsPbBr3 nanowires as shown in Fig 4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lasing threshold was found at 86 J cm2, significantly higher than for CsPbBr3 nanowires, and the Q factor was consequently found to be lower, with a maximum of 690 ± 70 and an average of 580 ± 120.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, interference from end facet emission was observed (Fig 4A, Inset), indicating effective waveguiding and coherent emission from the nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Halide alloying may be pursued in the future to achieve broad wavelength tunability as observed in CsPbX3 quantum dots and CH3NH3PbX3 materials (20, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to nanowires, well-faceted CsPbBr3 nanoplates were found to lase at 38 J cm2 with the power-dependent emission spectra shown in Fig 4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the high mode density, peak fitting yields a mode spacing of 3.9 ± 0.7 meV (Fig S10), which for a 19.3-m-long plate falls within error of the fit line shown in Fig 3E (Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests FabryPérot lasing from multiple transverse modes, which may be easily supported by the broad, rectangular plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assignment is further supported by the stronger emission intensity observed at one pair of end facets indicating a preference for lasing in that direction (Fig 4B, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lasing behavior is in contrast to whispering gallery mode lasing observed in 100-m-sized plates of CsPbBr3, which demonstrated broad peak spacing and a uniform spatial emission profile (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we have reported, to our knowledge, the first successful demonstration of lasing in cesium lead halide nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A facile synthetic procedure was optimized to yield a range of CsPbBr3 nanowires and nanoplates, both of which were found to lase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CsPbBr3 nanowires exhibited low lasing thresholds and relatively high Q factors compared with the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most strikingly, the nanowires were stable under both ambient conditions as well as during continuous lasing, important benchmarks for application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wavelength tunability was also demonstrated through halide substitution, and our ongoing study of anionic alloying indicates the possibility of even greater wavelength tunability across the entire visible spectral range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we have shown that cesium lead halide nanowires are versatile, stable platforms for future nanophotonic exploration and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Synthesis_of_CsPbX3_Nanowires_and_Nanoplates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received unless otherwise stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)-coated glass substrates were prepared by cutting 1 × 1-cm glass substrates and washing sequentially with acetone, isopropanol, and deionized water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cleaned substrates were then O2-plasma-treated for 10 min, followed by spin coating with PEDOT:PSS (Solarmer) at 3,000 rpm for 30 s. Afterward, the coated substrates were annealed at 150 °C for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To grow CsPbX3 nanowires and nanoplates, 460 mg PbI2 (99.999%) was dissolved in 1 mL anhydrous dimethylformamide and stirred at 70 °C overnight before further use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PbI2 solution was spun onto the PEDOT:PSS-coated glass substrates at 1,000 rpm for 120 s, then annealed at 100 °C for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PbI2 film was carefully submerged into a glass vial with 8 mg/mL CsBr (99.999%) solution in methanol (anhydrous, 99.8%), with the PbI2 side facing up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capped reaction vial was heated at 50 °C for 12 h, and the substrate was removed and washed in anhydrous isopropanol for 30 s. The sample was then dried by heating to 50 °C for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the synthesis of CsPbCl3 nanowires, the CsBrmethanol solution was replaced with a 6 mg/mL CsClmethanol solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entire growth process was carried out in a nitrogen-filled glove box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the nanowires were acquired using an Asylum MFP 3D in tapping mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Energy-Dispersive_Spectroscopy_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantification of the elemental ratios in a CsPbBr3 was studied using an FEI Titan microscope operated at 200 kV at the National Center for Electron Microscopy in the Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signal was collected using an FEI Super-X Quad windowless detector based on silicon drift technology controlled by Bruker Esprit software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Low-Temperature_PL_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples were held under vacuum (5 × 106 torr) in a Janis Research Co. ST-500 microscopy cryostat and cooled to 6 K with liquid helium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were excited with the fourth harmonic (266 nm) of a Spectra-Physics Quanta Ray INDI-40 neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser (10-Hz, 8-ns pulse width).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PL emission was collected by a 50×, 0.55-N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  air objective (Nikon CF Plan) and the spectra were measured with the same UV-vis spectrometer as described in Materials and Methods, but using a 150-mm1, 300-nm blaze grating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CsPbBr3_Refractive_Index_Calculations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The calculations were based on density functional theory (42) within the generalized gradient approximation formulated by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (43) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projector augmented wave pseudopotentials were used (45), and the valence wavefunctions were expanded using a plane-wave basis with an energy cutoff of 300 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A primitive cell of CsPbBr3 (20 atoms) in the orthorhombic phase was used (26), and the Brillouin zone was sampled with a 7 × 7 × 5 k-point mesh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate the frequency-dependent dielectric function, 200 empty bands were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated static dielectric constant ( = 0) agrees with the result from the density functional perturbation theory calculation implemented in VASP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency-dependent dielectric function was used to calculate the refractive indices, using the equations (46)n()=12(1()+(1()2+2()2)1/2)1/2,[1]k()=12(1()+(1()2+2()2)1/2)1/2,[2]where n and 1 are the real parts of the refractive index and relative dielectric constant, respectively, k and 2 are the imaginary parts of the refractive index and relative dielectric constant, respectively, and all are a function of the frequency, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting refractive index values were used directly for the finite-difference eigenmode and finite-difference time-domain simulations below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graphs of the real and imaginary refractive indices may be found in Fig S11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Finite-Difference_Eigenmode_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Lumerical MODE Solutions 7.6 software package was used to simulate the waveguide modes of 535-nm light in a CsPbBr3 nanowire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanowire (n = 2.53) was simulated on fused silica (n = 1.46) (47) under vacuum (n = 1.00).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The side length ratio was kept at 2:1 to approximate the rectangular cross-section of the as-grown nanowires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanowire size was incremented by 25 nm (based on width), and the effective refractive index was calculated for all sustainable modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Finite-Difference_Time-Domain_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Lumerical FDTD Solutions 8.12 software package was used to estimate the absorption cross-section of the 483 nm × 265 nm × 11.1-m CsPbBr3 nanowire studied in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the finite-difference eigenmode (FDE) mode simulation, the nanowire was simulated laying horizontal on fused silica surrounded by vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 400-nm total-field scattered-field light source was positioned above the nanowire and the transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations averaged to acquire the absorption cross-section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with the excitation fluence and beam profile, the nanowire carrier density was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion_of_the_Nanowire_and_Nanoplate_Growth_Mechanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the initial stages of the reaction using 610 mg/mL CsBr in methanol, the film color transitioned rapidly to red, then gradually to yellow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that an intermediate CsPbIxBr3x forms initially, then evolves to pure CsPbBr3 as confirmed by XRD patterns at different growth times (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peaks corresponding to PbI2 disappear within the first 2 min, indicating that PbI2 dissolves/reacts rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the intermediate products from 210 min, the (001) peak was shifted 0.2° below that of pure CsPbBr3; this is indicative of lattice expansion caused by the formation of CsPbIxBr3x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the final CsPbBr3 nanowires produced by this method contain a minimal amount of iodide as the iodide content of the nanowires tested by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was found to be below the 1% detection limit of the instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Zhu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  reported intermediate CH3NH3PbI2Br products during the growth of single-crystal CH3NH3PbBr3 nanostructures (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, inorganic perovskite nanowires likely possess similar growth dynamics to hybrid perovskites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
