Computational design of orthogonal membrane receptor-effector switches for rewiring signaling pathways  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Membrane receptors sense and translate extracellular signals into specific intracellular functions and represent powerful molecules for biomedicine and synthetic biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the computational design of receptors with novel signaling functions remains challenging because receptors often couple to multiple intracellular proteins with poorly characterized interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a computational approach to model and rationally engineer orthogonal receptor-intracellular protein pairs that bind and signal with high selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orthogonal receptor-effector systems coupled with high efficiency and triggered the intended cellular functions without interfering with natural systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The designed proteins displayed key, distinct sequence motifs when compared with native proteins, which expanded the alphabet of receptor-effector recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This design approach can be used to reprogram cellular functions in cell-engineering applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Membrane receptors regulate numerous intracellular functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular underpinnings remain poorly understood because most receptors initiate multiple signaling pathways through distinct interaction interfaces that are structurally uncharacterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present an integrated computational and experimental approach to model and rationally engineer membrane receptor-intracellular protein systems signaling with novel pathway selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We targeted the dopamine D2 receptor (D2), a G-proteincoupled receptor (GPCR), which primarily signals through Gi, but triggers also the Gq and beta-arrestin pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we designed orthogonal D2Gi complexes, which coupled with high specificity and triggered exclusively the Gi-dependent signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also engineered an orthogonal chimeric D2Gs/i complex that rewired D2 signaling from a Gi-mediated inhibitory into a Gs-dependent activating pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reinterpreting the evolutionary history of GPCRs in light of the designed proteins, we uncovered an unforeseen hierarchical code of GPCRG-protein coupling selectivity determinants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results demonstrate that membrane receptorcytosolic protein systems can be rationally engineered to regulate mammalian cellular functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method should prove useful for creating orthogonal molecular switches that redirect signals at the cell surface for cell-engineering applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since native GPCRs often display substantial promiscuity and bind several transmitter proteins leading to complex intracellular signaling output (2, 20), we aimed, as a proof of concept, at modeling and designing orthogonal GPCRG-protein pairs that exclusively signal through a selective pathway without interfering with native receptor and cytosolic transmitter protein components (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orthogonal signaling systems can be very useful for cell-engineering applications requiring a higher selectivity and level of control than native systems (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, computational design approaches require high-resolution structural information, and a large majority of GPCRs and interactions with cytosolic transmitter proteins remain structurally uncharacterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this challenge, we developed a general integrated structure prediction, docking and design approach to accurately model and engineer receptortransmitter protein structures and interactions (Fig 1B and SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approach  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main goal of our approach is to engineer GPCRG-protein contacts so that the designed proteins couple only with each other without interfering with their native wild-type (WT) counterpart proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A secondary goal is to also achieve high selectivity against other endogenously expressed GPCRG-protein systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, to be useful in cell-engineering applications, the designed proteins should retain the properties of signaling switches and signal only upon receiving extracellular ligand agonist stimuli (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve these goals, we further developed our homology modeling (23, 24) and design (25, 26) techniques (SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Discussion, and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modeling_and_Design_of_Orthogonal_D2Gi_Complexes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We targeted D2, which primarily activates the G-protein Gi signaling pathway (27) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No structural information is available on D2, Gi, or the D2Gi bound complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The native D2 is promiscuous and, upon sensing dopamine, can also activate the Gq and beta-arrestin signaling pathways (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D2 is central to several neuronal activities involved in sensing, behavioral, and motor functions, as well as severe diseases such as Parkinsons and Alzheimers (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, designed dopamine receptors with fine-tuned signaling properties would provide powerful tools for better studying signaling pathways and for future gene therapies against neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We modeled the ternary dopamine ligandD2Gi active state, starting from the B2AR-Gs and opsin-Gt distant homolog structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D2 inactive state was modeled from the close homolog dopamine D3 receptor structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used the models as templates in design calculations that rapidly scan the binding interface [ greater than 3 × 1019 total possible amino acid combinations (SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods and Fig S2)] for sets of mutations creating highly specific D2Gi orthogonal interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we selected mutations increasing the binding between the two designed proteins while simultaneously decreasing the interactions between the two pairs of WT and designed D2 and Gi proteins (i.e., D2WTGidesign and D2designGiWT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, mutations that stabilize or destabilize the inactive resting state of the receptor, potentially leading to loss of activity or constitutive activity (i.e., lack of ligand-induced signaling control) were automatically discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From more than 3 × 1011 combinations of mutations designed at the predicted D2Gi binding interface, we identified two hot spot motifs (HS1, HS2) predicted to rewire the interactions between D2 and Gi into a highly selective D2ortho and Giortho pair (SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hot spots HS1 and HS2 are deeply buried at the binding interface, involving, respectively, two and three complementary mutations on D2 and Gi (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our predictions for HS1 (Fig 2B), substitutions of Lys204 to Leu on transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) of D2 [HS1L; position 6.29 in Ballesteros-Weinstein (BW) notation] and of Leu293 to Phe on Gi (HS1F) provided stronger binding [0.9 Rosetta Energy Unit (REU)] through better shape complementarity and removal of a partially buried charged residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutations promoted selectivity by decreasing the interactions between D2WT and Giortho through Phe293 (HS1F) (+2.5 REU), predicted to prevent Lys204 from interacting with the stabilizing Asp290 on Gi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our predictions for HS2 (Fig 2C), substitutions of Val100 to Phe on TM3 of D2 (HS2F; position 3.54 in BW notation), of Leu297 to Ala (HS2A), and of Leu302 to Met (HS2M) on Gi provided stronger binding (2.5 REU) through better shape complementarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutations promoted selectivity by decreasing the interactions between D2ortho and GiWT (+3.2 REU) through steric clashes between Phe100 (HS2F) and Leu297.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Orthogonal_D2_Activates_Orthogonal_Gi_with_High_Efficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We validated the designed signaling switch using a cell-based assay reporting Gi-dependent activation of the TrpC4 channel (30) (Fig 2D and SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All assays were performed under conditions where D2 variants were expressed at the same level on the cell surface (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corroborating our predictions, the designed D2ortho and Giortho pair responded strongly to dopamine with similar amplitude to the native D2WTGiWT pair, while the competitor D2orthoGiWT and D2WTGiortho pairs displayed minimal responses to dopamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No signal was detected for the D2orthoGiWT pair, while a small and transient response was observed for the D2WTGiortho pair (less_than20% of that measured for the cognate D2WTGiWT and D2orthoGiortho pairs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these experimental measurements strongly validate our predictions and suggest that the designed proteins function as intended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Designed_Residue_Hot_Spots_Promote_Efficient_Coupling_of_the_Orthogonal_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To stringently assess the accuracy of the D2orthoGiortho-binding predictions and the specific role of each designed motif, we deconstructed the designed interface by backmutating the engineered hot-spot residues predicted to confer high affinity between D2ortho and Giortho to the corresponding native residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led us to model and validate four D2Gi pairs incorporating distinct combinations of WT and designed residues (SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussion and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured activations of designed Gi by designed D2 were in good agreement with the calculated effects of individual designed motifs in all four D2Gi pairs, supporting the accuracy of the modeled D2orthoGiortho-binding interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Designed_Residue_Hot_Spots_Confer_High_Coupling_Specificity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next validated the accuracy of the designed interactions conferring binding selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We backmutated the engineered hot-spot residues predicted to destabilize the binding interface between the WT (D2WT and GiWT) and designed proteins (D2ortho and Giortho) to the corresponding native residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To that end, we modeled and characterized three pairs of designed and WT protein pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for the D2WTGiHSF1- pair, the experimentally measured activations were in good agreement with the calculated effects of the designed residues on the coupling selectivity (SI Appendix, Supplementary Discussion and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, the strong correlation between predicted and measured responses for 9 of the 10 combinations of designed variants support the high coupling efficiency and specificity provided by the designed hot-spot residues and the accuracy of the rational structure-based design approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Orthogonal_D2_Signals_Exclusively_Through_the_Gi_Signaling_Pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon dopamine sensing, the WT D2 receptor is known to signal through both Gi- and Gq-dependent pathways and to couple to beta-arrestins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One major goal in synthetic biology is to engineer molecular systems with a high level of functional precision and selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in addition to being orthogonal, we designed the D2 receptor to exclusively trigger the Gi-dependent signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the selectivity against alternative G-protein signaling pathways, we measured the Gq-pathwaymediated increase in intracellular calcium flux as well as the Gq- and Gs-pathwaymediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Supplementary Methods and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D2 signaling through Gi was prevented using pertussis toxin treatment to selectively measure signaling through the Gq pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous findings, we observed that D2WT promotes small but significant calcium release and phosphorylation of CREB (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, D2ortho did not produce any detectable amount of released calcium or phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) upon stimulation by dopamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, none of the backmutated D2 variants retaining only one of the two designed hot-spot residues (i.e., HS1L-, HS2F-) promoted any measurable pCREB production upon stimulation by dopamine (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that each designed hot spot is sufficient to disrupt the weak coupling of D2 to Gq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the selectivity of the designed D2 on beta-arrestin recruitment, we used enhanced bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (ebBRET) (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon stimulation of the WT receptor with dopamine, beta-arrestinRlucII is recruited to the plasma membrane labeled with the plasma membrane marker rGFP-CAAX, leading to a time- and concentration-dependent increase of the BRET signal (Fig 3C and SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the predictions, no significant recruitment by D2ortho was observed for beta-arrestin 1 or 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coexpression of GRK2 led to phosphorylation of the receptor C-terminal tail and enhanced beta-arrestin recruitment for both D2WT and D2ortho.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while detectable, the dopamine-mediated beta-arrestin recruitment measured for D2ortho was only around 25% of that of D2WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, these results demonstrate the high signaling pathway selectivity of the orthogonal signaling D2Gi switch and suggest that the designed mutations prevent the coupling of D2 to alternative Gq-, Gs-, and beta-arrestinmediated signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Engineering_a_D2Gs-Signaling_Switch  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next attempted to design a GPCRG-protein complex that rewires the receptor signaling into an alternative nonnative pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since D2 primarily signals through Gi, which inhibits the production of cAMP, we decided to engineer a D2Gs complex that would revert D2 signaling into increasing cAMP levels instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because D2 does not display any measurable coupling to Gs, we decided to harness the binding potency and selectivity of Giortho onto the signaling function of Gs by creating a chimeric Gs-iortho protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the structural models of D2Gi- and B2Gs-binding interfaces, we engineered key D2-binding hot-spot residues from the Giortho C-terminal domain onto that of Gs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our predictions, the chimeric Gs-iortho protein redirected D2ortho signaling into substantial Gs-dependent Epac activation and phosphorylation of CREB (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, Gs-iortho was very selective for D2ortho and displayed minimal coupling to D2WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chimeric WT G proteins had been previously engineered by swapping a few residues from the C-terminal helix of distinct G-protein classes (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While functional, these chimeric proteins lacked the binding selectivity provided by our designed orthogonal interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that orthogonal pairs of GPCRs and chimeric G proteins may prove useful for rewiring signaling pathways in cell-engineering applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, these results indicate that the structure-based modeling and engineering approach provides a general versatile platform for reprogramming the intracellular signaling selectivity of GPCRs, even those without solved 3D structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Uncovering_Two_Classes_of_GPCRG-Protein_Recognition_Determinants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The high functional precision of the novel engineered orthogonal protein complexes prompted us to analyze the designed binding selectivity determinants within the context of the evolutionary history of naturally evolved GPCRG-protein interfaces (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, while the only starting information of our approach was the predicted structure of the D2Gi complex, the hot-spot designed motifs included positions on Gi that are universally conserved among naturally evolved G proteins (positions H5.20 and H5.25, Fig 4B and SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, these positions are currently thought to be essential for proper GPCRG-protein coupling and G-protein activation (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this model, any substitutions at these binding sites is predicted to disrupt signaling function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, our findings indicate that alternative binding motifs that perfectly maintain optimal G-protein activation function can be engineered at these sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results imply that, instead of the residue types on G proteins (3), the chemical contacts between GPCRs and G proteins at the conserved positions are critical for both function and selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since optimal contacts can be created from multiple combinations of residue types with high chemical and structural complementarity, this expands the range of binding and signaling selectivity that GPCRG-protein complexes can achieve beyond that explored by nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve high specificity while maintaining high affinity, the computational design approach introduced large keysmall lock residue motifs at hot spots HS1 and HS2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large phenylalanine at each hot spot motif provided the key while small hydrophobic lock residues maintained optimal surface complementarity and interactions on the other side of the binding interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asymmetric design of the engineered hot-spot motifs contrasted with that of native GPCRG-proteins composed of residues of similar sizes (Lys, Leu at HS1 and Val, Leu, Leu at HS2, Fig 2 B and C) and provided the desired specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In light of the designs, we propose a reinterpretation of recent bioinformatics findings (3), leading to a paradigm shift based on the existence of two classes of contact selectivity determinants at GPCRG-protein interfaces (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary class is the major binding affinity and specificity determinant enabling optimal docking of G proteins in the TM6TM7-binding groove of GPCRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical complementarity is key at the primary contact sites, and small structural changes on one side of the interface can disrupt binding, enabling the design of complete selectivity switches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary class of contacts is under strong evolutionary constraints and characterized by a high level of sequence conservation in naturally evolved G proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optimal contact with the primary sites on G proteins is maintained through diverse combinations of residue types in GPCRs (Fig 4B and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), highlighting the multiple possible solutions for satisfying chemical and structural complementarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The secondary class fine-tunes the binding selectivity achieved by the primary sites and has been used by nature to evolve GPCRG-protein systems with a wide range of binding specificity and signaling profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since most naturally evolved G proteins share the same primary sites recognized by all GPCRs, modulation of the secondary sites often results in GPCRs coupling to several G proteins and displaying a significant level of signaling promiscuity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary contacts are highly specific to each G-protein class and GPCR subfamily and encode complex networks of interactions (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This level of binding selectivity fine-tuning remains very challenging to predict from sequence alone and requires high-resolution structural information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we describe a general approach to accurately model and engineer membrane receptorcytosolic transmitter protein systems with diverse binding and signaling pathway selectivity even without protein structure information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We successfully engineered orthogonal dopamine D2 receptorGi protein pairs that couple with high selectivity and, unlike the native D2 receptor, exclusively trigger the Gi-dependent signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also engineered an orthogonal D2Gsi chimeric protein pair that redirected D2 signaling from the inhibitory Gi- to the activating Gs-dependent signaling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, 10 among 11 engineered receptortransmitter protein pairs displayed the relative levels of molecular recognition and function predicted by the calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method is very efficient and requires only distant homolog structural information without restriction on the protein topology, size, and nature of protein-binding interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it can be applied to a wide diversity of membrane receptortransmitter protein-signaling classes beyond the family of GPCRG-protein systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The accurate structural models of the uncharacterized GPCRGi family substantially expanded our knowledge of the GPCRG-protein recognition molecular code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous sequence-based bioinformatics studies identified mainly class-specific binding determinants on the G proteins (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of structural information on GPCRG-protein systems and their complex evolutionary history made similar findings very difficult on GPCRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the structural modeling and design framework, we evolved and identified key 3D contacts between GPCR and G proteins, which inherently define proteinprotein recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through engineered functional receptortransmitter protein pairs not yet identified in nature, we discovered a hierarchical code of contacts determining GPCRG-protein functional coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the identification of tight binding but nonsignaling GPCRG-protein pairs that correlate with nonnative binding modes suggests that conformational constraints are important determinants of G-protein activation in addition to protein contacts defining binding affinity and specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding a conformational dimension to the GPCRG-proteincoupling alphabet will be important to establish a unified code integrating recognition and signaling for predicting function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our findings and approach provide an integrated sequencestructure framework for predicting how distinct GPCR families manage to recognize a small number of G proteins with diverse and precise selectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A hierarchy of contacts where a minority of hot-spot motifs guarantees primary recognition while the others encode second-order fine-tuning of binding selectivity has been widely used by nature for evolving cognate proteins with a large spectrum of binding affinities and specificities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hierarchy of recognition determinants also provides an effective framework for creating orthogonal functionalities through minimal perturbations of the native proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that a large diversity of orthogonal and functional receptortransmitter protein complexes that do not couple with native systems may be designed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, they may be used as plug-in molecular devices for precise manipulation of cellular functions with minimal interference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since many synthetic biology approaches involve the engineering of molecular systems with a high level of functional precision and selectivity, the method paves the road for creating cellular signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rationally engineering orthogonal protein systems with fined-tuned signaling properties at the cell surface will greatly aid in the design of custom signaling networks for better studying of complex disease mechanisms and for advancing cell and gene therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
