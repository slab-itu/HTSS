Estimating the reliability of eyewitness identifications from police lineups  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to prior research, recent studies of simulated crimes have reported that (i) eyewitness confidence can be a strong indicator of accuracy and (ii) traditional simultaneous lineups may be diagnostically superior to sequential lineups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of our study is that these issues were investigated using actual eyewitnesses to a crime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent laboratory trends were confirmed: Eyewitness confidence was strongly related to accuracy, and simultaneous lineups were, if anything, diagnostically superior to sequential lineups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that recent reforms in the legal system, which were based on the results of older research, may need to be reevaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Laboratory-based mock crime studies have often been interpreted to mean that (i) eyewitness confidence in an identification made from a lineup is a weak indicator of accuracy and (ii) sequential lineups are diagnostically superior to traditional simultaneous lineups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Largely as a result, juries are increasingly encouraged to disregard eyewitness confidence, and up to 30% of law enforcement agencies in the United States have adopted the sequential procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted a field study of actual eyewitnesses who were assigned to simultaneous or sequential photo lineups in the Houston Police Department over a 1-y period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifications were made using a three-point confidence scale, and a signal detection model was used to analyze and interpret the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that (i) confidence in an eyewitness identification from a fair lineup is a highly reliable indicator of accuracy and (ii) if there is any difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two lineup formats, it likely favors the simultaneous procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The raw frequency counts and proportions of SIDs and FIDs (broken down by confidence) and no IDs for the blind and blinded simultaneous and sequential conditions are shown in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the blind condition, overall response bias was similar (e.g., the proportion of no IDs was nearly identical for simultaneous and sequential lineups).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the blinded condition, overall response bias appears to be higher for the sequential condition (e.g., the proportion of no IDs was considerably higher for simultaneous lineups than for sequential lineups).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as described in more detail next, this likely reflects the fact that the blinded sequential condition ended up with more guilty suspects (hence more suspect choosing) than the simultaneous procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

High-Threshold_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The derivation of Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and 6 is straightforward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 4 yieldsF=nTP[(1-p)g(5/6)]+nTA[g(5/6)].Setting nTP = nTA = n, where n = N/2 (i.e., assuming equal base rates), we can algebraically solve for p,F=(1-p)[ng(5/6)]+ng(5/6)F=ng(5/6)png(5/6)+ng(5/6)F=2ng(5/6)png(5/6)(6/5)F=2ngpngpng=2ng-(6/5)Fp=[1/(ng)][2ng-(6/5)F]p=2-(6/5)F/(ng)p=2-6F/(5ng).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]Next, we can use Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 to solve for g. Adding Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3 and setting nTP = nTA = n yieldsS=n[p+(1-p)g(1/6)]+n[g(1/6)]S=np+(1-p)ng(1/6)+ng(1/6).Substituting the expression for p given by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 into this expression yields a rather complex equation that is easily simplified,S=n[2-6F/(5ng)]+{1-[2-6F/(5ng)]}ng(1/6)+ng(1/6)S=n[2-6F/(5ng)]+[1-2+6F/(5ng)]ng(1/6)+ng(1/6)S=n2-6F/(5g)+ng(1/6)2ng(1/6)+F/5+ng(1/6)S=n2-6F/(5g)+F/5S=n2+F/5-6F/(5g).This expression can now be solved for g,S-n2-F/5=-6F/(5g)S-n2-F/5=-6F/5(1/g)g=-(6F/5)/(S-n2-F/5).Multiplying the numerator and denominator by 5 yieldsg=(6F)/(10n5S+F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S2]This is Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substituting Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 for g in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 allows us to solve for p,p=2-6F/(5n[(6F)/(10n5S+F)])p=2[6F/(5n)][(10n5S+F)/(6F)]p=2(10n5S+F)/(5n)p=(10n-10n+5S-F)/(5n)p=(5S-F)/(5n).This is Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6 in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Once g and p are known, they can be substituted into Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3 to estimate the number of suspect IDs from target-present and target-absent lineups (nSTP and nSTA, respectively), and these values can be used to estimate suspect ID accuracy, which equals nSTP/(nSTP + nSTA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The equations for g and p (Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and 6, respectively) allow one to compute suspect ID accuracy for all IDs, but one would also like to use the high-threshold model to compute suspect ID accuracy separately for each level of confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, the computational steps involved in computing suspect ID accuracy are identical, except that, now, confidence-specific values for S and F are used to compute g and p from Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and 6 (the value of n in those equations remains unchanged).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, making this move implies additional parameters that allow for different levels of confidence to be expressed when in the above threshold state (which occurs with probability p) or in the guessing state (which occurs with probability g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the probability of a high-confidence guess is given bygcHigh=(6FHigh)/(10n5SHigh+FHigh)[S3a]where cHigh is the probability of expressing high confidence in an ID despite being in the guessing state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of instead expressing medium or low confidence in an ID despite being in the guessing state are cMed and cLow such thatgcMed=(6FMed)/(10n5SMed+FMed)[S3b]gcLow=(6FLow)/(10n5SLow+FLow)[S3c]where cHigh + cMed + cLow = 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar considerations apply to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6 such thatpdHigh=(5SHigh-FHigh)/(5n)[S4a]pdMed=(5SMed-FMed)/(5n)[S4b]pdLow=(5SLow-FLow)/(5n)[S4c]where dHigh, dMed, and dLow represent the probability of expressing high, medium, or low confidence in a guilty suspect ID despite being in the above-threshold (i.e., recognition) state, and dHigh + dMed + dLow = 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that the values on the right side of each of these equations are known, so it is possible to directly compute the six combined parameter values on the left side of these equations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, one can directly compute these six parameters (1 through 6),1=gcHigh2=gcMed,3=gcLow4=pdHigh5=pdMed6=pdLow.There are only 6 degrees of freedom in the data, so this is as far as one can go.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are 6 degrees of freedom in the data because those data fall into seven cells: three confidence-specific suspect ID counts, three confidence-specific filler ID counts, and the number of no IDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, these six combined parameter values are all that are needed to compute confidence-specific estimates of suspect ID accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, to compute high-confidence suspect ID accuracy, g  cHigh is first computed from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were 17 high-confidence filler IDs (FHigh = 17), 71 high-confidence suspect IDs (SHigh = 71), and, assuming equal base rates, 348/2 = 174 target-present lineups and 174 target-absent lineups (n = 174).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, according to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3a, g  cHigh = 0.07.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4a, p  dHigh = 0.39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the number of correct and incorrect suspect IDs made with high confidence, one simply substitutes g  cHigh for g in Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3 and substitutes p  dHigh for p in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With nTP = nTA = n, the estimated correct and incorrect high-confidence suspect IDs come to 68.9 and 2.1, respectively, so estimated suspect ID accuracy = 68.9/(68.9 + 2.1) = 0.97.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Signal_Detection_Model_Fits  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The signal detection model illustrated in Fig 2 uses a simple decision rule according to which an ID is made if the most familiar person in a lineup exceeds the lowest confidence criterion (c1), with confidence (low, medium, or high) being determined by the highest criterion that is exceeded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal detection model was fit to the experimentally controlled field data and the Houston Police Department field data via Monte Carlo simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, initial values were set for each of the model parameters (Target, Target, c1, c2, and c3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of Lure and Lure were always fixed at 0 and 1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, for each of nTP simulated witnesses (where nTP is the number of target-present lineups used in the experiment being fit), a predicted target-present decision was made by randomly drawing five values from the lure distribution, randomly drawing one value from the target distribution, and then applying the decision rule described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once all nTP trials were completed, one set of predicted target-present data had been generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, for each of nTA simulated witnesses (where nTA is the number of target-absent lineups used in the experiment being fit), a predicted target-absent decision was made by randomly drawing six values from the lure distribution, and then applying the decision rule described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once all nTA trials were completed, one set of predicted target-absent data had been generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These predicted target-present and target-absent data constituted results from one simulated experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because the simulation involves stochastic processes, the predicted data from a single simulated experiment are noisy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for each iteration of a fit, predicted values were obtained by running 500 simulated experiments and then averaging the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those averaged results were compared with the observed data (computing a 2 goodness-of-fit statistic), at which point the parameters were adjusted and the next iteration of the fit occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using fminsearch in MATLAB, the fitting process continued until the 2 was minimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lap_1_vs_Lap_2_Choosing_in_the_Blind_Sequential_Condition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When the sequential lineup is used in mock crime laboratory studies, participants are typically permitted to view the photos only once (usually with the first ID being the one that counts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In actual practice, the police permit second viewings if the witness requests it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was also true of the Houston Police Department field study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigators were instructed to allow witnesses to view sequential photo spreads a second time only if the witness requested to view the photos again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, investigators did not give this option up front when giving the instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the witness requested to view the photo spread or they requested to view a single photo again, the investigator showed the entire set of photos a second time, in the same order as the first showing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we can examine the data for witnesses who viewed the photos only once (1 lap) to see how the results compared with witnesses who viewed the photos more than once (2+ laps).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Investigators were asked to complete a survey item that asked how many times the witnesses viewed the photo spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 24 of the 161 blind sequential photo spreads, this information was not recorded, and we assumed that this was because only one viewing occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This counting rule resulted in 96 witnesses viewing the photos once and 65 viewing the photos more than once (59 twice, 5 three times, and 1 four times).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, 40% of the witnesses (65 out of 161) requested more than one viewing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the analyses discussed next, we consider the data separately for those who viewed the photo spread once vs. those who viewed it more than once.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevant frequency counts and proportions are presented in Table S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Responding was considerably more conservative for those who viewed the sequential photo spread only once compared with those who viewed it more than once.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, for the lap 1 witnesses, 45 out of 96 made no ID (0.47), whereas for the lap 2+ witnesses, only 14 out of 65 made no ID (0.22), a difference that was highly significant, 2(1) = 10.72, P = 0.0011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For those who made an ID, lap 1 witnesses identified a suspect 26 times and identified a filler 25 times (0.51 suspect IDs), whereas lap 2+ witnesses identified a suspect 20 times and identified a filler 31 times (0.39 suspect IDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the surface, it appears that the lap 2+ witnesses were less accurate, but the fact that they were also more liberal in their responding means that the two numbers cannot be meaningfully compared to assess relative discriminability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, a measure that is not influenced by response bias (e.g., d) is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We fit the equal variance signal detection model, with pTarget fixed at 0.35 (free parameters are Target, c1, c2, and c3), separately to the lap 1 and lap 2+ sequential Houston field data broken down by confidence (i.e., we fit the model to the frequency data shown in Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With all parameters free to vary, the model fit the data well, 2(4) = 1.50, P = 0.827.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated value of target (i.e., d) was actually higher, not lower, for the lap 2+ sequential witnesses (target = 2.24) compared with the lap 1 sequential witnesses (target = 1.92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the difference was not remotely close to being significant, 2(1) = 0.35, P = 0.56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the large apparent difference in Target is an illusion because the fit is scarcely affected by constraining the parameters to be equal, in which case the estimated value of Target was 2.02.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, with these data, no difference in discriminability was detected between the lap 1 and lap 2+ witnesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the other parameter estimates suggest that the lap 2+ witnesses may have been much more liberal about making an ID in general (i.e., c1 was noticeably lower for the lap 2+ witnesses) while being more conservative about making a high-confidence ID (i.e., c3 was noticeably higher for the lap 2+ witnesses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimates for c1, c2, and c3 were, respectively, 1.43, 1.78, and 2.18 for the lap 1 witnesses and 0.90, 1.62, and 2.52 for the lap 2+ witnesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, when the c1, c2, and c3 parameters were constrained to be equal across the lap 1 and lap 2+ sequential witnesses, the fit was significantly worse, 2(3) = 19.64, P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that the main difference between the lap 1 and lap 2+ witnesses is in their placement of the various decision criteria, not in their ability to discriminate innocent from guilty suspects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also indicates that the trends favoring the simultaneous procedure discussed earlier did not arise merely because the lap 2+ witnesses were included in the sequential analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analyses_of_Blinded_Lineups  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data from the blinded simultaneous and sequential conditions were analyzed in the same way that the data from the blind conditions were analyzed in Results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we first describe the basic empirical trends in the data and then present signal detection analyses of the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of these analyses are all similar to the results from the analyses of the blind lineups, but various complexities involved with this data set (unbalanced corroborating evidence for simultaneous and sequential formats before any IDs being made, unfair lineups, and poor signal detection model fits) warrant caution in interpreting the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present the results for the sake of completeness and to underscore the fact that the results are similar to the results presented above and therefore offer no reason to question the interpretation of the blind lineup data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Recoded_Corroborating_Evidence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the blind and blinded simultaneous and sequential lineups, five independent raters coded information in the fill-in text boxes where the investigating officer listed what the corroborating evidence was whenever it was deemed to be present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this work, the coders included one of the authors (William Wells), two faculty members who have significant experience conducting research with criminal investigators, a Ph.D. student who has research experience working with criminal investigators, and a former Houston Police Department robbery investigator (who has his Ph.D. and has done work with interrater reliability checks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this process, the raters identified situations in which the investigator indicated there was corroborating evidence but the team's coding of the text box information suggested it should not be counted as corroborating evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The raters also identified situations in which investigators included information in the fill-in text box but nevertheless did not check the box to indicate there was corroborating evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the independent coding, we used the coding that was recommended by three or more of the five coders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, if three raters said the text box information should be counted as corroborating evidence, then we counted it as such.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship between corroborating evidence and confidence in a suspect ID is shown in Fig S2G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are similar to the results observed for the blind lineups shown in Fig 1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results for the recoded blinded lineups are shown in Fig S2H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, the relationship remains essentially the same as for the originally coded data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lineup_Fairness  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lineup fairness was examined for a random sample of 30 photo lineups from the blind condition (15 simultaneous and 15 sequential).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis assessed the degree to which the suspect stood out by providing the selected photo lineups to 49 mock witnesses and asking them to try to identify the suspect based only on the suspect's physical description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a fair, six-person lineup, the suspect should be identified by a mock witness only 1/6 (0.17) of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean proportion of suspect IDs made by the mock witnesses (0.18) did not differ significantly from the expected value for a fair lineup, t(29) = 0.76.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Confidence_in_Suspect_IDs_and_Filler_IDs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next analyzed eyewitness identifications collapsed across lineup format (i.e., simultaneous and sequential data combined; see Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suspect IDs, filler IDs, and no IDs (Fig 1A) occurred with approximately equal frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively high frequency of filler IDs (which are IDs of known innocents) could be interpreted to mean that eyewitness memory is unreliable (7), but it is important to keep in mind that there are 5 times as many fillers as suspects in a lineup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, most filler IDs were made with low confidence, whereas most suspect IDs were made with high confidence (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the proportion of IDs that were suspect IDs increased markedly with confidence (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern of results immediately suggests a strong relationship between confidence and accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Corroborating_Evidence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each lineup, the investigating officer indicated whether or not there was independent corroborating evidence of suspect guilt (see Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of lineups associated with such evidence was higher for lineups involving suspect IDs (97 out of 114) than lineups involving no IDs (67 out of 130), 2(1) = 31.02, P less_than 0.0001, suggesting that suspects identified by an eyewitness were more likely to be guilty than suspects who were not identified by an eyewitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, for the suspect IDs, the proportion of cases with corroborating evidence of guilt increased as confidence in the ID increased (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of corroborating evidence was a subjective interpretation made by the investigating officer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the results were virtually unchanged when a five-member research team reviewed and recoded the existence of corroborating evidence in a few instances where a majority of the team members disagreed with what the investigating officer counted as independent evidence (see SI Results, Recoded Corroborating Evidence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the data in Fig 1C imply that suspect ID accuracy increased with confidence, the dependent measure in that figure, namely, suspect IDs/(suspect IDs + filler IDs), includes all suspect IDs (guilty suspect IDs + innocent suspect IDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A measure of greater interest to the legal system is suspect ID accuracy: guilty suspect IDs/(guilty suspect IDs + innocent suspect IDs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measure is of greater interest because, as a general rule, only suspects who are identified from a lineup are placed at risk of prosecution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suspect ID accuracy cannot be directly computed in a police department field study because it is not known which identified suspects are guilty and which are innocent, but it can be estimated using a model of recognition memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two traditional and often competing approaches to modeling recognition memory are the high-threshold modeling approach and the signal detection modeling approach (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our goal here is not to determine which approach is more viable for modeling eyewitness identification performance but is to instead show that, despite being based on completely different assumptions, both approaches provide similar interpretations of the Houston field data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We begin by using a simple version of the high-threshold model to interpret the data and then provide a more detailed interpretation of the same data using a signal detection model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High-Threshold_Estimates_of_Suspect_ID_Accuracy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A virtue of the high-threshold approach is that it provides an algebraic estimate of suspect ID accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to this model, of the witnesses presented with a target-present lineup, some proportion of them, p, will recognize and correctly identify the perpetrator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the remaining proportion of those witnesses, 1  p, some proportion of them, g, will make a random identification from the lineup despite not recognizing the perpetrator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a fair, six-member lineup, these witnesses will, by chance, correctly identify the perpetrator 1/6 of the time, and they will instead identify a filler 5/6 of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the probability of a correct suspect ID from a target-present lineup is equal to the probability that a witness recognizes the perpetrator, p, plus the probability that a witness who does not recognize the perpetrator makes a lucky guess, (1  p)  g  (1/6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiplying the sum of these probabilities by the number of target-present lineups, nTP, yields the predicted number of suspect IDs from target present lineups, nSTP,nSTP=nTP[p+(1p)g(1/6)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]The probability of a filler ID from a target-present lineup is equal to the probability that a witness who does not recognize the perpetrator makes a guess that lands on a filler, (1  p)  g  (5/6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the number of filler IDs from target-present lineups, nFTP, isnFTP=nTP[(1p)g(5/6)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]For witnesses presented with target-absent lineups, the state of recognition theoretically does not occur because the guilty suspect is not there, so innocent suspect IDs and filler IDs are only made by witnesses who make a random guess.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As indicated above, a random guess occurs with probability g. Thus, the probability of an incorrect (i.e., innocent) suspect ID from a fair target-absent lineup is g  (1/6), and the probability of a filler ID from a fair target-absent lineup is g  (5/6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiplying these probabilities by the number of target-absent lineups, nTA, yields the predicted number of suspect IDs and filler IDs from target-absent lineups,nSTA=nTAg(1/6)[3]nFTA=nTAg(5/6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]These equations underscore the important fact that, for fair lineups, incorrect suspect IDs should be relatively rare compared with incorrect filler IDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a study of real police lineups, the information that is known consists of the number of lineups administered, N, the number of suspect IDs, S, the number of filler IDs, F, and the number of no IDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of the model, S is equal to sum of suspect IDs from target-present and target-absent lineups (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 + Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3) and F is equal to sum of filler IDs from target-present and target-absent lineups (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 + Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4),S=nTP[p+(1p)g(1/6)]+nTAg(1/6)F=nTP[(1p)g(5/6)]+nTAg(5/6).If, for the sake of simplicity, we assume equal base rates such that nTP = nTA = n, where n = N/2, then we can algebraically solve for g and p (SI Results, High-Threshold Model), which yieldsg=(6F)/(10n5S+F)[5]p=(5SF)/(5n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6]Note that, using Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and 6, p and g can be directly computed from the data because they are both a function of known values (S, F, and n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With p and g in hand, Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3 can now be used to estimate nSTP and nSTA, which can then be used to compute suspect ID accuracy, Sacc,Sacc=nSTP/(nSTP+nSTA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [7]Sacc is the measure of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, there were 348 blind lineups (n = 348).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, assuming equal base rates, n = N/2 = 174.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were 114 suspect IDs (S = 114) and 104 filler IDs (F = 104).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and 6, g = 0.49 and p = 0.54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these parameters, Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3 indicate that nSTP = 99.8 and nSTA = 14.2, so overall suspect ID accuracy (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7) comes to 99.8/(99.8 + 14.2) = 0.88 (i.e., 88% correct).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A similar high-threshold model can be used to predict suspect ID accuracy separately for each level of confidence by following the same computational steps as before, but, this time, using the number of suspect IDs and filler IDs made with a specific level of confidence in place of the overall S and F values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the computational steps are exactly the same, the implied underlying model now involves additional parameters that allow for different levels of confidence to be expressed when the witness is in the detect state or in the guessing state (see SI Results, High-Threshold Model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This version of the model has as many parameters as there are degrees of freedom in the data, so it cannot be independently validated (e.g., using a goodness-of-fit test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the model can still be used to directly estimate suspect ID accuracy separately for each level of confidence using the same computational steps that were used above for overall suspect IDs and filler IDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When confidence-specific suspect ID and filler ID values are used, the estimated suspect ID accuracy scores come to 0.97, 0.87, and 0.64 for high-, medium-, and low-confidence IDs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, when this theoretical analysis is performed separately on the data from the blind simultaneous and blind sequential conditions collapsed across confidence, p (the probability of successfully identifying the perpetrator from a target-present lineup) is 0.62 for simultaneous lineups and 0.43 for sequential for sequential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of these apparent trends cannot be tested, because the model is saturated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We turn now to a more detailed model-based analysis using signal detection theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model has fewer free parameters, so its interpretation of the data can be statistically evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first fit the model to data from an experimentally controlled study (as a validation test) and then fit the model to the data from the Houston field study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In the context of eyewitness memory, the standard unequal variance signal detection model (Fig 2) (2628) specifies how memory strength is distributed across guilty suspects (targets) vs. innocent suspects and fillers (lures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before applying this model to the Houston field data, we first tested its validity in the context of eyewitness identification by evaluating its performance in relation to data recently collected as part of a large-scale (n = 908) investigation into the relationship between confidence and accuracy under naturalistic conditions (similar to a mock crime study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the experimenters approached participants in parks and shopping malls and asked them to view a target person (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participant memory for the target (the guilty suspect) was subsequently tested using an eight-person simultaneous photo lineup, with half of the participants being tested with a target-present lineup and the other half with a target-absent lineup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in this study, it was known whether a suspect ID was correct or incorrect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed identification decisions (Fig 3A) can be collapsed across target-present and target-absent lineups (Fig 3B), as if this study were a police department field study with unknown lineup type, thereby allowing a comparison with the analogous Houston Police Department field data (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the data are broken down by confidence (Fig 3C), the trends are similar to the trends observed in the Houston field data (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How well does the signal detection model (Fig 2) characterize the experimentally controlled field data (Fig 3C)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ordinarily, the parameters of the model would be adjusted to minimize the 2 goodness of statistic between the predicted target-present and target-absent data vs. the observed target-present and target-absent data in Fig 3A (see SI Results, Signal Detection Model Fits).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if these data had come from a police department field study, that kind of evaluation would not be possible because it would not be known which lineups contain a guilty suspect (target-present) and which contain an innocent suspect (target-absent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore fit the signal detection model to the experimentally controlled field data as if those data had come from a police department field study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each iteration of the fit, the model (Fig 2) generated simulated predicted target-present and target-absent data, which were then collapsed across lineup type to yield predicted suspect IDs and filler IDs (for three levels of confidence in each case), plus predicted no IDs for that iteration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collapsed predicted values were then compared with the collapsed observed values by computing a 2 goodness-of-fit statistic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model assumed equal base rates for target-present and target-absent lineups, which is known to be true of these data (11), and the model parameters were adjusted to minimize the predicted vs. observed 2 statistic, yielding the final predicted values in Fig 3D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An equal variance model turned out to be adequate (i.e., Target did not differ significantly from 1; thus Target = Lure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the observed data (Fig 3C) and predicted data (Fig 3D) were used to compute the observed and predicted proportion of IDs that were suspect IDs, the two functions were nearly identical (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the experimentally controlled field data (11), we can now ask how the observed trend in Fig 3E based on data collapsed across target-present and target-absent lineups relates to suspect ID accuracy (the measure of primary interest), which, unlike in a police department field study, can be directly computed after disaggregating the target-present and target-absent data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actual disaggregated suspect ID accuracy data from this study reflect highly reliable eyewitness ID performance (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the model accurately predicted those data (Fig 3F) despite having only been fit to the collapsed (real-world-like) data (Fig 3C and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having established that the signal detection model can recover suspect ID accuracy from collapsed data, we next fit the model to the Houston Police Department field data (i.e., to the data shown in Fig 1B), for which it is impossible to separate target-present and target-absent lineups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, we made the assumption that the base rate of guilty suspects (i.e., the proportion of target-present lineups) in these real-world data was 50%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The validity of this assumption is unknown, so we repeated the model-fitting exercise assuming a 25% base rate and, then, a 75% base rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all of these fits, we allowed Target and Lure to differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was fit to the simultaneous and sequential data separately and also to the data combined across lineup format (Tables S4 and S5; also see Tables S6 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, we can use the best-fitting model to estimate the accuracy of suspect IDs in the Houston data, just as we did for the data shown in Fig 3F.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the suspect ID accuracy estimates were very similar for the two lineup formats, we present the results of the fit to the data combined across lineup format.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4A shows the estimated suspect ID accuracy (Sacc) for the Houston field datathat is, it shows estimated values of nSTP/(nSTP + nSTA)as a function of confidence for each of the three base rates considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data represent the predicted posterior probability of guilt associated with suspect IDs made with low, medium, or high confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimates for high-confidence suspect IDs remain very accurate regardless of the base rate, whereas the estimated accuracy of low-confidence suspect IDs is always lower but varies considerably depending on the base rate of guilty suspects in police lineups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Model-Based_Estimate_of_the_Target-Present_Base_Rate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the results of the model fit to the experimentally controlled field data (11), we next made the assumption that an equal variance model (Target = Lure) also applies to the Houston field data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removing the unequal variance parameter made it possible to add a base rate parameter (pTarget) to the model to obtain a principled estimate of the real-world base rate of target-present lineups (see SI Results, Signal Detection Model Fits).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again using the experimentally controlled field data (11), we first verified that when target-present and target-absent data are combined in varying proportions and then fit with the equal variance signal detection model, the base rate of target-present lineups can be accurately recovered (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then fit the equal variance model (including the base rate parameter) to the Houston Police Department field data, and the estimated base rate of target-present lineups came to 0.35 for both lineup formats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, assuming the equal variance model is correct, 35% of the photo lineups contained a guilty suspect and 65% contained an innocent suspect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At first glance, this relatively low estimate of the proportion of lineups containing a guilty suspect might be regarded as problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the confidenceaccuracy relationship predicted by this best-fitting model (averaged across the predictions made by separate fits to the simultaneous and sequential data) exhibits a strong relationship between the confidence associated with a suspect ID and the accuracy of that ID (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, high-confidence IDs are accurate despite the low base rate of target-present lineups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simultaneous_vs_Sequential_Lineups  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also analyzed the data separately for simultaneous and sequential lineups (Table S1), focusing first on corroborating evidence of guilt associated with identified suspects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous police department field study conducted in Austin, Texas, expert ratings of corroborating evidence of guilt suggested that innocent suspects were less likely to be identified and guilty suspects were more likely to be identified from simultaneous lineups than sequential lineups (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in the current Houston police department field study, the proportions of suspects identified from simultaneous (SIM) lineups (n = 68) and (SEQ) sequential lineups (n = 46) rated by the investigating officer as having independent evidence of guilt against them were SIM = 0.912 and SEQ = 0.761, 2(1) = 4.92, P = 0.027.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, according to this proxy measure of guilt, more of the suspects identified from simultaneous lineups were likely to be guiltyand fewer innocentthan suspects identified from sequential lineups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, on a post-ID questionnaire, the investigating officer noted that some of these witnesses (n = 65) reported that they (i) encountered a photo of the suspect before being presented with the photo lineup, (ii) were under the influence of alcohol when they witnessed the crime, and/or (iii) were not wearing their prescribed glasses during the crime (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported differences on the three questionnaire measures, if they were true and had any effect, would have worked against the sequential procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these 65 witnesses were excluded from the analysis, the proportions of identified suspects from simultaneous lineups (n = 50) and sequential lineups (n = 38) rated as having independent evidence of guilt against them were virtually unchanged (SIM = 0.920 vs. SEQ = 0.789), 2(1) = 3.12, P = 0.077.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, eliminating these 65 eyewitnesses reduced statistical power without having an appreciable effect on the pattern of results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As indicated earlier, a five-member research team recoded the presence vs. absence of corroborating evidence based on its judgment of what counted as evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the recoded corroborating evidence data from all of the witnesses were analyzed, the results continued to show a trend favoring the simultaneous procedure (SIM = 0.912 vs. SEQ = 0.804), 2(1) = 2.77, P = 0.096.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the reduced recoded data set was analyzed (eliminating 65 witnesses based on their questionnaire responses), the effect, although continuing to favor the simultaneous procedure (SIM = 0.920, SEQ = 0.842), was no longer marginally significant, 2(1) = 1.30, P = 0.244.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not significant, even for this analysis, more suspects identified from simultaneous lineups had independent corroborating evidence of guilt compared with sequential lineups (SIM = 46 vs. SEQ = 32), pointing to possible guilt, and fewer had no evidence of guilt (SIM = 4 vs. SEQ = 6), pointing to possible innocence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It therefore seems fair to conclude that all of these corroborating evidence analyses at least weigh against the notion that sequential lineups are diagnostically superior to simultaneous lineups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the extent that these findings are interpreted as supporting the diagnostic superiority of the simultaneous procedure, they are consistent with the statistically significant corroborating evidence findings from the recent Austin police department field study (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we fit the equal variance signal detection model, with pTarget fixed at 0.35 (free parameters = Target, c1, c2, and c3), separately to the simultaneous and sequential Houston field data broken down by confidence (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the full data set was analyzed, Target was significantly higher for the simultaneous procedure than for the sequential procedure (SIM = 2.87 vs. SEQ = 2.03), 2(1) = 5.01, P = 0.025.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the reduced data set was analyzed (excluding the 65 witnesses discussed above), the difference in the estimated value of Target still favored the simultaneous procedure (SIM = 2.74 vs. SEQ = 2.12), but the effect was no longer significant, 2(1) = 2.06, P = 0.15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar pattern of results held true across a variety of approaches to modeling the data (see SI Results, Signal Detection Model Fits).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it seems fair to conclude that the signal detection analyses weigh against the notion that sequential lineups are diagnostically superior to simultaneous lineups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the extent that these findings are interpreted as supporting the simultaneous procedure, they are consistent with recent laboratory-based ROC analyses (1821).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results suggest that, contrary to a widely held view that confidence and accuracy are only weakly related but in agreement with recent experimentally controlled noncrime studies using a calibration approach (911), eyewitness confidence appears to be a reliable indicator of accuracy when an identification is made from a police lineup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong relationship between confidence and accuracy is indirectly suggested by trends in the raw data (Fig 1B) and is directly implied by model-based estimates (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, and again contrary to a widely held view, the present results reinforce both ROC analyses of laboratory-based data (1821) and another police department field study analysis (22) suggesting that sequential lineups are not diagnostically superior to simultaneous lineups and that the reverse is more likely to be true (although, depending on how the data were analyzed here, the simultaneous advantage was not always significant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Critically, our conclusions apply only to fair lineups initially administered to adults in double-blind fashion, not necessarily to unfair lineups, nonblind lineups, lineups administered to children, or to any ID associated with a subsequent memory test (including the one that occurs much later in a court of law).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well known that memory is malleable such that by the time a witness testifies at trial or pretrial hearings, an initial low-confidence ID can be transformed into a high-confidence ID (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of the recent recommendations made by a committee of the National Academy of Sciences on eyewitness identificationspecifically, that lineups should be administered in double-blind fashion and that initial eyewitness confidence should be recorded (25)it seems likely that the double-blind approach will be increasingly used by law enforcement agencies and that eyewitness confidence statements will be increasingly available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under those conditions, our findings suggest that eyewitness confidence is a highly reliable indicator of accuracy and that simultaneous lineups are, if anything, diagnostically superior to sequential lineups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A more detailed description of the experimental design/methods is provided in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The participants were 45 police investigators in the Robbery Division of the Houston Police Department and 717 eyewitnesses who were presented with photo lineups between January 22 and December 5, 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inclusion criteria were that (i) the robberies involved strangers and (ii) the witnesses had not previously viewed a photo spread with the suspect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Informed_Consent  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study was approved by Protection of Human Subjects Committee in the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs at Sam Houston State University (Protocol 2012-08-202).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the investigators who participated in the study signed an informed consent document, and witnesses were provided with a cover letter that explained risks and their rights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, at the conclusion of the ID procedure, a survey was provided to each witness asking how the photos were shown to them (all at once or one at a time), whether the detective could see which photos they were viewing, whether they picked someone from the photos, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If they completed and returned the survey to the detective, then they were agreeing to participate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Witnesses were pseudorandomly assigned to one of four photo lineup conditions: blind sequential (n = 161), blind simultaneous (n = 187), blinded sequential (n = 175), and blinded simultaneous (n = 194).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lineup contained six photos (one suspect and five fillers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the simultaneous procedure, the eyewitness viewed all six photos at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the sequential procedure, the six photos were viewed one at a time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the blind procedure, an investigator with no knowledge of the suspects identity administered the lineup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the blinded procedure, the primary investigator conducted the viewing but was prevented from knowing which photo the witness was viewing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eyewitnesses who made suspect IDs or filler IDs from these lineups were asked to supply a confidence rating using a three-point scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each case, an investigating officer filled out a questionnaire that addressed a variety of issues pertaining to the case (e.g., where was the lineup conducted, is there independent evidence of suspect guilt, what was the level of confidence expressed by the eyewitness, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiment was conducted in the Houston Police Department (HPD) Robbery Division because the largest volume of photo spread and lineup procedures are conducted by robbery investigators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiment was designed to test the outcomes of four different methods of showing photos and individuals to eyewitnesses: (i) blind sequential, (ii) blind simultaneous, (iii) blinded sequential, and (iv) blinded simultaneous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these procedures was consistent with HPD eyewitness identification procedures at the time of the study and thus did not introduce new procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the simultaneous presentation method, the eyewitness viewed all photos or live lineup members at the same time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the sequential presentation method, photos and live lineup members were viewed one at a time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the blind procedure, the primary investigator who knew the identity of the suspect prepared the photo spread, but an investigator with no knowledge of the suspects identity administered the viewing with the witness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the blinded procedure, the primary investigator conducted the viewing, but a mechanism was used to prevent the investigator from (i) knowing the suspects position in the photo spread or lineup and (ii) knowing which photo or individual the suspect was viewing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the blinded procedures, the primary investigator selected the suspects photo and the five filler photos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A different investigator then randomly ordered the photos and placed them into a folder (or folders) for the investigating officer to administer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the sequential procedure, one photo was placed into each of six folders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stack of folders was then provided to the investigating officer, who then administered the photos one at a time to the witness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the procedure, the investigator was positioned so it was not possible to view the photos while the witness viewed the photos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blinded simultaneous procedure was similar except that the investigator who randomly ordered the photos placed the simultaneous photospread into a single folder before providing it to the investigating officer (who then administered the photos simultaneously to the witness).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In late 2012, all HPD criminal investigators were trained on these procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigators were provided with a user-friendly instruction booklet they could reference throughout the study period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provided investigators with information about the procedures, in the event that questions arose when they were preparing to conduct an identification procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complete description of the blind and blinded procedures used in the experiment can be found in appendix F of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Case_Assignment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All robbery reports made to HPD are routed to the Robbery Division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a case is referred to the Robbery Division it is placed into one of the following categories: work, contact, pending, monitor, office, and transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Work and office cases are assigned to robbery investigators because these cases have investigative leads, including information about suspects, video footage, or license plate numbers of involved vehicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Office cases are those in which the individuals involved are nonstrangers, whereas work cases involve strangers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contact cases do not contain leads, so they are not assigned to an investigator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pending cases do not contain strong investigative leads but are assigned to investigators because leads may develop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monitor robbery cases are assigned to be investigated by another unit, such as the Special Victims Division or the Juvenile Unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfer cases have been referred to the Robbery Division but should be assigned to another investigative division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All work, office, and pending reports received by the Robbery Division were assigned to receive one of the four experimental procedures for showing photo spreads and lineups to eyewitnesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cases were assigned to a treatment condition because they generate investigative activities, such as lineups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characteristics of each determined whether a live lineup or a video lineup would be conducted (e.g., prosecutors may request a live viewing when a suspect is in custody).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a small percentage of cases involved live or video lineups, and they were not included in any of our analyses, which focused solely on the more commonly used photo spread lineup procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When a robbery report is routed to the Robbery Division, it is automatically assigned an HPD case number (referred to as an incident number by HPD personnel) by the computerized information management system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The case number determined which experimental procedure was used in a case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third- and the fourth-from-the-last digit represent sequential numbers that are automatically generated by HPD data systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third-from-the-last digit determined whether a simultaneous or a sequential method was used (simultaneous when even, sequential when odd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth-from-the-last digit determined whether a blinded or a blind method was used (blinded when even, blind when odd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, assignment to condition was a nonsystematic, pseudorandom process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that the study randomly assigned investigations to a treatment condition, not to identification procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that when there were multiple eyewitnesses to a crime, all of the eyewitnesses were tested using the same procedure (to avoid confusing attorneys, judges, and jurors if the case proceeded to trial).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, when several crimes were judged to consist of a connected series of related crimes, the cases were also treated as a single investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, all eyewitnesses in these cases were tested using the same procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This restriction on our research protocol was necessary to avoid any detrimental effects of our study on the judicial process, but it also introduced the risk of the four conditions being unbalanced with respect to key variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we performed a variety of manipulation checks described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis was limited to 717 photo spreads that satisfied the following criteria: (i) the robberies involved strangers, (ii) the witnesses had not previously viewed a photo spread with the suspect, and (iii) the photo spreads followed the experimental protocol that should have been used during the investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of cases in each condition that satisfied these criteria were: blinded simultaneous (n = 194), blinded sequential (n = 175), blind simultaneous (n = 187), and blind sequential (n = 161).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
