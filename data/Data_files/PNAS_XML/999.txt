Causes of ice age intensification across the Mid-Pleistocene Transition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conflicting sets of hypotheses highlight either the role of ice sheets or atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in causing the increase in duration and severity of ice age cycles 1 Mya during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We document early MPT CO2 cycles that were smaller than during recent ice age cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using model simulations, we attribute this to post-MPT increase in glacial-stage dustiness and its effect on Southern Ocean productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed analysis reveals the importance of CO2 climate forcing as a powerful positive feedback that magnified MPT climate change originally triggered by a change in ice sheet dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings offer insights into the close coupling of climate, oceans, and ice sheets within the Earth System.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT; 1,200800 kya), Earths orbitally paced ice age cycles intensified, lengthened from 40,000 (40 ky) to 100 ky, and became distinctly asymmetrical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testing hypotheses that implicate changing atmospheric CO2 levels as a driver of the MPT has proven difficult with available observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use orbitally resolved, boron isotope CO2 data to show that the glacial to interglacial CO2 difference increased from 43 to 75 atm across the MPT, mainly because of lower glacial CO2 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through carbon cycle modeling, we attribute this decline primarily to the initiation of substantive dust-borne iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean during peak glacial stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe a twofold steepening of the relationship between sea level and CO2-related climate forcing that is suggestive of a change in the dynamics that govern ice sheet stability, such as that expected from the removal of subglacial regolith or interhemispheric ice sheet phase-locking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that neither ice sheet dynamics nor CO2 change in isolation can explain the MPT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we infer that the MPT was initiated by a change in ice sheet dynamics and that longer and deeper post-MPT ice ages were sustained by carbon cycle feedbacks related to dust fertilization of the Southern Ocean as a consequence of larger ice sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Climate records across the MPT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) CO2 records are shown as follows: black line, ice core compilation (14); blue, our 11B-based LP260 data; red, our 11B-based eMPT data; and purple squares, low-resolution MPT 11B record of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11 (all with 2 error bars/envelopes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The range of ice core CO2 measurements (17) from stratigraphically disturbed blue ice and their approximate ages are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) SL records, where orange indicates the Red Sea record (21), dark blue represents Mg/Ca-based deconvolution of deep sea benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope data (3), and pink shows a record from the Mediterranean Sea (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Dust mass accumulation rate (MAR) in a sub-Antarctic site ODP 1090 on the southern flank of the Agulhas Ridge (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) LR04 benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope stack (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Warm intervals are highlighted by gray bars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Changing relationship between CO2 climate forcing and ice sheet size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three scenarios (AC) for the MPT intensification of glacial cycles compared with observations (D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reconstructed SL is taken here to reflect continental ice sheet size in relationship to CO2 climate forcing (RCO2) calculated (33) from our orbitally resolved CO2 data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all panels, red and blue represent conditions during our two sampling intervals before and after the MPT (i.e., eMPT and LP260), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The end member scenarios posit (A) a change in ice sheet dynamics, causing ice volume to become more sensitive to unchanged G-IG climate forcing, and (B) an unchanged sensitivity of ice sheet size to forcing, with glacial intensification driven by additional CO2 drawdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither one of these two scenarios adequately describes both observed changes of increased ice sheet sensitivity (greater slope) and additional glacial CO2 drawdown (more negative climate forcing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we argue for a hybrid scenario with a change in ice sheet dynamics (possibly caused by regolith removal of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8 or ice sheet phase-locking of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10), allowing ice sheets to grow larger and to trigger a positive icedustCO2 feedback that promotes additional glacial intensification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In D, the regression confidence intervals account for uncertainty in both SL and RCO2 (SI Forcing to SL Relationship), but to avoid clutter, we only display the regression based on the Mediterranean SL reconstruction (4) and the uncertainty on the slope rather than the individual data points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer the reader to SI Forcing to SL Relationship and Fig S7 for other SL records and full treatment of data uncertainties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reconstructed ice age CO2 cycles before and after MPT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Boron isotope data from ODP 999 (Fig S1) shown in blue (LP260) and red (eMPT) along with the LR04 deep sea benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope stack (black) (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) CO2 levels calculated from boron isotopes (same colors as above) compared with ice core (black) (14) and previous low-resolution boron-derived CO2 data (purple) (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probabilistic assessments are shown as the colored bands, with the probability maximum shown within a dark band that represents its 95% probability envelope (±6 ppm) and a lighter band that represents the full 95% envelope of the sampled distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated by B, Inset, comparison between our (red) eMPT and (blue) LP260 records reveals that glacials on average experienced higher CO2 levels during eMPT than LP260 (eMPT: 241 ± 21 atm vs. LP260: 203 ± 14 atm; 2), whereas interglacial levels were indistinguishable between the two time slices (eMPT: 284 ± 17 atm vs. LP260: 277 ± 18 atm; 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our two datasets span an early portion of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (eMPT) from 1,080 to 1,250 kya (n = 51) and for validation against the ice core CO2 record, the Pleistocene interval from 0 to 260 kya (LP260; n = 59, including 32 recalculated data points from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18), yielding a similar median sampling interval of 3.54.5 ky for both records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our LP260 CO2 dataset has a confidence interval of ±20 atm (2) and is offset by a mean of +7 atm from the ice core CO2 data when accounting for both CO2 and age uncertainties (21) (Fig 3B and SI Methodology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison between our two CO2 records reveals that eMPT glacials on average were associated with higher CO2 levels than LP260 glacials (eMPT: 241 ± 21 atm vs. LP260: 203 ± 14 atm; 2), whereas interglacial levels were indistinguishable (eMPT: 284 ± 17 atm vs. LP260: 277 ± 18 atm; 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis uses highest and lowest 25th percentiles of 18O values to define glacial and interglacial subsets of the data, although this pattern is independent of the thresholds that we define (Fig 4 and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis reproduces the glacial stage-specific decline in CO2 levels found in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11, leading to similar reconstructed increases in the glacial to interglacial CO2 difference since the MPT (40 ± 47 and 32 ± 35 atm based on ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11 and our data, respectively) (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher resolution of these datasets allows this approach to yield useful data about our timespans, despite the relatively large uncertainty on each individual data point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When analyzed in a similar way, recent direct measurements of CO2 from a stratigraphically disturbed section of 1-My-old blue ice (17) offer a fully independent test for the two 11B-based reconstructions and are consistent with these findings (Fig 4 and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, all available evidence suggests that the MPT was associated with a transition in the global carbon cycle characterized mainly by enhanced glacial-stage drawdown of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluate the reconstructed G-IG CO2 change across our study interval with a carbon cycle model inversion of Southern Ocean and Atlantic mechanisms thought to have contributed to the most recent Late Pleistocene G-IG CO2 cycles (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we force the CYCLOPS carbon cycle model (23) with ODP 1090 sedimentary iron mass accumulation rates (24), ODP 1094 Ba/Fe ratios (25), and ODP 982/U1313 (Fig S1) benthic 13C variations (26, 27) to represent, respectively, (i) sub-Antarctic dust-borne iron fertilization; (ii) combined changes in polar Antarctic stratification, nutrient drawdown, and export production; and (iii) transitions in the geometry and depth structure of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mechanisms and their model sensitivities have been documented elsewhere (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we invert the model and the forcing to minimize the mismatch between simulated atmospheric CO2 levels and the ice core CO2 record of the last 800 ky (residual rms error of 12.3 atm) (SI Carbon Cycle Modeling) and then, to predict atmospheric CO2 levels back to 1,500 ky (Fig S5) for comparison with our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find that changes in the periodicity of simulated CO2 levels closely match those in the ice core CO2 record, in the benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope record, and in our 11B-based CO2 reconstruction (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the relative age uncertainty between the model forcing and our 11B record, we find that the model explains more than 60% of the variance observed in our eMPT CO2 reconstruction, in line with model and reconstruction uncertainties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model inversion does not include any secular change in the silicate weathering cycle (11) (SI Carbon Cycle Modeling), so that simulated CO2 change is exclusively related to carbon redistribution within the oceanatmosphere system and associated CaCO3 compensation dynamics (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In good agreement with the 11B-based CO2 reconstructions and the ice core CO2 measurements, the model inversion yields (i) insignificant (1 ± 3 atm; 2) eMPT to LP260 interglacial CO2 change and (ii) a 22 ± 5 atm (2) eMPT to LP260 decline in glacial-stage CO2 levels (Fig 4 and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the model, we can attribute most of the additional glacial CO2 drawdown to MPT intensification of glacial dust-borne iron fertilization of biological productivity and nutrient utilization in the Sub-Antarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean (24, 2830) (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMOC shoaling also seems to have become more prevalent after 1,200 ky but contributes less to simulated CO2 change (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model reproduces relatively low reconstructed interglacial CO2 from 400 to 800 ky, because use of ODP 1094 Ba/Fe in the model inversion results in persistent polar Southern Ocean stratification as suggested previously (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through our eMPT sample interval, the model reproduces the 80-ky CO2 periodicity that is evident in our eMPT 11B data (Fig S6), mainly because of an 80-ky periodicity in eMPT polar Antarctic stratification and nutrient cycling recorded in ODP 1094 Ba/Fe (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While all three forcings (iron fertilization, Atlantic circulation, coupled polar Antarctic changes) contribute to the simulated changes in CO2 periodicities that are highly coherent with the MPT change in rhythm of the climate system, the iron fertilization influence dominates the MPT intensification of ice age CO2 drawdown (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MPT intensification of glacial-stage CO2 drawdown is consistent with stabilization of continental ice sheets during increasing orbital obliquity by reduced greenhouse gas forcing, thereby helping ice sheets to grow larger and for periods longer than one obliquity cycle (scenario 2 in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when we directly compare changes in SL as a measure for ice volume against CO2 climate forcing (RCO2) from our records (Fig 2D), we find that, between eMPT and LP260, ice sheet mass increased progressively more per CO2 lowering, thereby increasing the SLRCO2 slope in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests an increase in ice sheet sensitivity to CO2 forcing across the MPT, with the caveat that eMPT may not fully capture pre-MPT conditions, although it agrees with the longer-term record of Hönisch et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is robust, regardless of which SL reconstruction is used (Fig S7); in all cases, the SL to RCO2 relationships appear to be linear, with increasing slopes from eMPT to LP260.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steepening relationship is also evident when regressing 11B to 18O relationships, with both isotope ratios measured on the same sample material (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the SL record with the best coverage of both intervals, relative SL from the Mediterranean Sea (4), we estimate 25 ± 3 and 45 ± 5 m of SL lowering for each 1-Wm2 reduction in radiative forcing during eMPT and LP260, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a pronounced increase in sensitivity implicates a change in ice sheet dynamics as predicted by the regolith hypothesis (8, 9) or the establishment of marine-based ice sheet margins in East Antarctica (10) (scenario 1 in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observed changes in the SL to RCO2 relationships contain elements of both end member scenarios shown in Fig 2 A and B, in which a greater slope is possibly related to changes internal to the ice sheets (scenario 1) and amplified glacial to interglacial CO2 climate forcing is linked (this study) to increased glacial dustiness that causes enhanced Southern Ocean iron fertilization (scenario 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we propose a hybrid scenario (Fig 2C) that incorporates both heightened ice sheet sensitivity to CO2 forcing and dust-driven ocean sequestration of CO2 to represent the observed climate system change across the MPT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we propose thatindependent of orbital and CO2 forcinga process internal to the climate system yielded greater glacial buildup of ice sheets [e.g., regolith removal (8) or ice sheet phase-locking (10)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we infer that larger ice sheets led to increased glacial atmospheric dustiness (31, 32), either directly through SL lowering or indirectly because of atmospheric cooling, drying, and/or changes in surface winds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, in turn, induced glacial iron fertilization of the Sub-Antarctic Zone of the Southern Ocean, thereby effecting the 20- to 40-atm increase in the amplitude of the G-IG CO2 cycles documented here (Fig 4) (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our hybrid scenario, the positive climatedustCO2 feedback is required to (i) drive additional ice sheet growth and (ii) stabilize those ice sheets during the critical orbital phase of rising obliquity, ensuring the survival of ice sheets beyond single obliquity cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, regardless of the mechanism that served as the initial MPT trigger, our findings further illustrate the exquisite coupling that exists in the Earth System between climate change, ice sheet mass, and the polar ocean mechanisms that regulate G-IG CO2 change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Globigerinoides ruber white sensu stricto (300355 m) were picked from sediments from ODP 999A (Fig S1), and the age model was constructed by benthic oxygen isotopes from the same samples and X-ray fluorescence scanning data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were measured for boron isotope composition using a Thermo Scientific Neptune multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer at the University of Southampton according to methods described elsewhere (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analytical uncertainty is given by the external reproducibility of repeat analyses of Japanese Geological Survey Porites coral standard at the University of Southampton and is typically less_than0.2 (at 95% confidence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metal elementcalcium ratios (Mg, B, Al) were analyzed using Thermo Element 2XR inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer at the University of Southampton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, these data are used to assess adequacy of clay removal (Al/Ca less_than 100 mol/mol) and to generate down core temperature estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CO2 was calculated using a Monte Carlo approach (10,000 replicates) with estimates of salinity and alkalinity using a flat probability spanning a generous range (3437 psu and 2,1002,500 mol/kg, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A normal distribution around proxy data was used for all other input variables (temperature, pH, 11Bsw, 11Bforam) (SI Methodology has full details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CO2 record was then probabilistically assessed using a Monte Carlo approach that considers uncertainties in both age and CO2 values and that preserves the stratigraphy of the record, which minimizes age uncertainty in a relative sense between samples (shown as an envelope in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of 2,000 Monte Carlo iterations involved independent random resampling of each sample within its x and y uncertainty distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stratigraphic constraint prevents age reversals in this resampling procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear interpolation was performed between resampled points, and the distribution of values thus generated was analyzed per time step for the modal value and its 95% probability interval as well as the 95% probability envelope of data in the sampled distribution (using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because uncertainties in both x and y directions are considered, the record of probability maxima (modes) gives a smoothed representation of the record, with quantified uncertainties (SI Forcing to SL Relationship).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inverse carbon cycle modeling was carried out using the CYCLOPS model (23), with the forward model forcing derived from pertinent paleoceanographic records (2527) and the forcing scaling parameters inverted to minimize model misfit with respect to the ice core CO2 record of the last 800 ky.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant linear correlation with and matching spectral content to our boron isotope-based CO2 data confirm the skill of the model inversion (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed statistical analysis is carried out to identify and quantify changes in absolute glacial and interglacial CO2 as well as the G-IG CO2 range from the model inversion results, our high-resolution CO2 data, and some previous datasets (11, 17) that are not well dated or lack the required temporal resolution for comparison in the time and/or frequency domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis is based on estimation of the population means of cumulative probability density of glacial and interglacial subsamples, which were selected based on either available benthic foraminiferal 18O or CO2 rank (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factorial analysis of the validated model allows for the mechanistic attribution to sub-Antarctic iron fertilization of glacial stage-specific CO2 reduction associated with the MPT interval (Fig S5, Bottom), which is the pattern that we identified as common between model and all three empirical datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More detailed descriptions of inverse modeling and model/data cross-validation and statistical quantification of CO2 change can be found in SI Carbon Cycle Modeling and SI Quantification of GCO2, IGCO2, and IG-GCO2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
