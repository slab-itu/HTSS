New inducible genetic method reveals critical roles of GABA in the control of feeding and metabolism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We established a new genetic method for rapidly activating Cre recombinase that is based on suppression of a nonsense codon within Cre by a new generation of aminoglycosides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied this strategy to successfully silence both enzymes responsible for GABA biosynthesis in hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons that control appetite and other behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of GABA signaling in AgRP neurons of young adult mice resulted in severe loss of body weight and abnormal glucose metabolism, whereas older mice only manifested transient appetite deficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This genetic system adds another robust tool that can be used to understand complex neurological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Currently available inducible Cre/loxP systems, despite their considerable utility in gene manipulation, have pitfalls in certain scenarios, such as unsatisfactory recombination rates and deleterious effects on physiology and behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome these limitations, we designed a new, inducible gene-targeting system by introducing an in-frame nonsense mutation into the coding sequence of Cre recombinase (nsCre).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutant mRNAs transcribed from nsCre transgene can be efficiently translated into full-length, functional Cre recombinase in the presence of nonsense suppressors such as aminoglycosides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a proof-of-concept model, GABA signaling from hypothalamic neurons expressing agouti-related peptide (AgRP) was genetically inactivated within 4 d after treatment with a synthetic aminoglycoside.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of GABA synthesis in AgRP neurons in young adult mice led to a dramatic loss of body weight due to reduced food intake and elevated energy expenditure; they also manifested glucose intolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, older mice with genetic inactivation of GABA signaling by AgRP neurons had only transient reduction of feeding and body weight; their energy expenditure and glucose tolerance were unaffected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that GABAergic signaling from AgRP neurons plays a key role in the control of feeding and metabolism through an age-dependent mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new genetic technique will augment current tools used to elucidate mechanisms underlying many physiological and neurological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conceived a new, inducible Cre-expression system by engineering an in-frame nonsense mutation (TGA) into the coding region of the Cre recombinase gene (nsCre) with the expectation that treatment with an aminoglycoside would promote read-through of this nonsense codon, thereby allowing synthesis of functional Cre recombinase that could mediate recombination of loxP-flanked genes to inactivate their expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aminoglycosides lead to mispairing of a near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA with a PTC, so that one of a specific set of amino acids can be incorporated, thus preventing termination (Fig 1A) (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, to produce a functional Cre recombinase, the protein must tolerate the random incorporation of an exogenous amino acid at the PTC site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence from a large-scale, random transposon insertion/deletion analysis revealed that regions preceding -helix A and between -helices J and K in the Cre coding sequence confer significant tolerance to insertional mutagenesis (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based upon these data, we designed a cell-culture recombination assay to validate candidate nsCre transgenes in which a TGA stop codon was inserted into either one of these two regions (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose the TGA codon over the other two stop codons because evidence from previous studies indicated that UGA in mRNA exhibits the highest rate of read-through (1517, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neo-resistant HEK293 cells were cotransfected with CMV-loxP-Neo-loxP-DsRed2, along with Pgk-nsCre plasmids with stop codons inserted into one of the two positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next day, the cells were treated with increasing doses of the aminoglycoside G418 (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four days after drug treatment, DsRed2 fluorescence indicated that nonsense suppression had occurred in a dose-dependent manner when PTC was inserted into the region between -helices J and K (nsCre2), but not ahead of -helix A (nsCre1) (Fig 1 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of nsCre1, functional Cre recombinase was produced without G418 treatment, presumably because translation started at a downstream, in-frame initiation codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were confirmed with an assay in which an HEK293 clone with stable expression of CMV-loxP-Neo-loxP-DsRed2 was transfected with the Pgk-nsCre2 plasmid and treated with various doses of G418.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Short exposure to G418 (2 mg/mL) followed by a recovery period without the aminoglycoside resulted in almost as many fluorescent cells as the transfection with the wild-type Pgk-Cre plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish a proof-of-concept mouse model, an nsCre2-containing transgene was targeted to the Agrp gene locus to generate AgrpnsCre mice, and these mice were subsequently bred with a Cre-dependent fluorescence reporter line (Rosa26tdTomato) (22), in which removal of a loxP-flanked Neo gene allows expression of tdTomato (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After injection of saline into the third ventricle of AgrpnsCre/+::Rosa26tdTomato mice, tdTomato fluorescence was undetectable throughout the whole brain, indicating that nsCre2 was completely silent and that no recombination of the reporter gene had occurred (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, administration of G418 into the third ventricle led to robust, dose-dependent activation of tdTomato in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), where AgRP neurons are located (Fig S1 A and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that G418 allows translational read-through of PTC in nsCre2 transcripts, resulting in functional Cre recombinase activity in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the toxicity of G418 to eukaryotic cells limits its application to proof-of-concept experiments, as shown in several genetic disease models (17, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based upon an idea that the structural elements in aminoglycosides that induce PTC read-through are separable from those that affect toxicity (20), we designed and synthesized a series of G418 derivatives, including NB124, NB127, and NB128 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lead compounds displayed significantly reduced cytotoxicity while retaining equal or better read-through capacity compared with G418 (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based upon toxicological assays, NB124, NB127, and NB128 displayed 30% of the cytotoxicity compared with G148, while maintaining comparable potency in cell-culture assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the read-through capacity in vivo by injection of each of the compounds into the third ventricle of AgrpnsCre/+::Rosa26tdTomato mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these compounds, NB124 displayed superior read-through capacity in vivo as indicated by the number of tdTomato-expressing neurons in the ARC 4 d after drug treatment (Fig S1 BD and FH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, a series of doseresponse experiments resulted in a regimen in which treatment with NB124 resulted in tdTomato fluorescence in 95% of AgRP neurons, suggesting that AgrpnsCre transgene could be expressed in almost all AgRP neurons (Fig 2 CF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best regimen involved injecting 80 g of NB124 twice (2 d apart); higher single doses revealed some toxic effects, including lethargy and dyspnea, and a single 80-g dose did not result in complete recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that this inducible gene targeting system can exhibit high efficiency and fidelity, but careful titration of the drug is necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To demonstrate the usefulness of this new genetic approach in controlling an important physiological process, we set out to disrupt GABA synthesis by AgRP neurons, a small population of neurons in the ARC that is important for the control of feeding and energy metabolism (9, 2427).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated two different lines of mice for the behavioral assays: AgrpnsCre/+::Gad1lox/lox::Gad2lox/lox::Rosa26tdTomato mice, termed the mutant group, and AgrpnsCre/+::Gad1lox/+::Gad2lox/+::Rosa26tdTomato mice, termed the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two groups of mice share identical genetic backgrounds, but carry either heterozygous or homozygous alleles of floxed Gad1 or Gad2, genes encoding the two essential enzymes (GAD67 and GAD65) for GABA biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injection of NB124 into the third ventricle of the control group led to the expression of tdTomato in AgRP neurons, and GABA staining was retained (Fig 3 AD) (25, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, treatment with NB124 in the mutant group abolished GABA immunological detection exclusively in the tdTomato-labeled AgRP neurons (Fig 3 EH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further demonstrate the efficacy of genetic inactivation, we quantitatively examined the expression level of Gad1 and Gad2 mRNA from AgRP neurons that were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real-time PCR results indicated that Gad1 and Gad2 mRNA in AgRP neurons were almost completely depleted in NB124-treated mutant mice compared to NB124-treated control or the AgrpCre::Rosa26tdTomato groups (Fig 3 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, HPLC analysis revealed that the abundance of GABA in the ARC region of the NB124-treated mutant group was reduced to the same extent as displayed by diphtheria toxin (DT)-treated AgrpDTR/+ mice, in which nearly all AgRP neurons were ablated (Fig 3K) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of glutamic acid and Agrp mRNA were unchanged in the ARC of the NB124-treated mutant group compared to wild-type or NB124-treated control mice (Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, strong Fos induction was observed in brain regions that receive afferents from AgRP neurons, including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the parabrachial nucleus (PBN; Fig S4 AF) (25, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of Gad1 and Gad2 from AgRP neurons did not affect GABA levels in other brain regionsincluding the lateral hypothalamic nucleus (LH), dorsal medial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH), and central amygdala (CeA)suggesting high selectivity of the NB124-mediated, gene-knockout strategy (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that treatment with NB124 in the mutant mice leads to sufficient production of functional Cre recombinase to inactivate Gad1 and Gad2 specifically in the AgRP neurons within 4 d, thereby disinhibiting postsynaptic neurons resulting from the loss of GABA signaling from AgRP neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that during those 4 d, the nsCre gene had to be transcribed and translated; the Gad1 and Gad2 alleles needed to recombine; Gad1 and Gad2 mRNAs and the two biosynthetic enzymes needed to decay; and GABA uptake from neighboring neurons had to be insufficient to maintain normal GABA signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We characterized the effects on energy balance of NB124-mediated conditional deletion of GABA from AgRP neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavioral results revealed that injections of NB124 into the 3-mo-old mutant mice reduced food intake and resulted in significant loss of body weight (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six days after initial treatment with NB124, these moribund mice had to be removed from the experiment because they had lost 20% of their initial body weight, and their daily food intake had almost ceased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, three groups of controlsincluding the control mice treated with NB124, control mice treated with vehicle, and mutant mice treated with vehicleshowed normal daily food intake and body weight throughout the testing period (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the potential role of GABA in mediating energy expenditure, we measured metabolic responses in Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System chambers (Columbus Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with the control groups, the mutant group showed significant increases in O2 consumption, CO2 production, and locomotor activity between 2 and 4 d after the first treatment with NB124 (Fig 4 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, loss of GABA from AgRP neurons resulted in glucose intolerance, compared with both the NB124-treated control mice and vehicle-treated mutant mice that were pair-fed to the same degree of weight loss (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with a recent study, these results provide direct evidence that GABA signaling by AgRP neurons normally promotes food intake while simultaneously inhibiting energy expenditure (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More surprisingly, this experiment revealed that GABAergic signaling by AgRP neurons also plays a role in maintaining normal glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also tested the role of GABA signaling from AgRP neurons in the control of feeding and metabolism in 8-mo-old mice because of reports of synaptic remodeling by aging AgRP neurons (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the age-matched control group, i.c.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  delivery of NB124 into 8-mo-old mutant mice activated Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter gene and reduced Gad1 and Gad2 transcript levels by 90% in AgRP neurons within 6 d (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, deletion of GABA synthesis from AgRP neurons in older mice mediated a moderate, but only transient, reduction of food intake and body weight (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, no significant changes were observed in energy metabolism, locomotion, or glucose metabolism (Fig 5 CF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, deletion of GABA from AgRP neurons in 8-mo-old mice resulted in Fos induction in postsynaptic neurons, but to a lesser extent compared with young mice (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that AgRP neurons in older mice are more resistant to the loss of GABA signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we established a new method for inducible Cre-dependent inactivation of loxP-flanked genes and demonstrated its effectiveness by eliminating GABA signaling from AgRP neurons and monitoring biological consequences on behavior and metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abrupt inactivation of GABA biosynthesis genes in adult mice permitted us to interrogate the pathophysiological roles exhibited by this key inhibitory neurotransmitter in AgRP neurons at various ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose this model system because constitutive inactivation of GABA signaling starting when Agrp genes become active during late embryonic development results in a compensatory response, such that there is minimal effect on food intake or body weight of adult mice, a response that is similar to that observed when AgRP neuron are ablated in newborn mice (9, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ablation of AgRP neurons or disruption of GABA signaling in young adult mice leads to anorexia and severe weight loss (29, 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considerable evidence indicates that this starvation phenotype is mediated by hyperactivity of neurons that express calcitonin gene-related protein in the PBN due to loss of GABA signaling from AgRP neurons (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered that chronic infusion of a partial GABAA agonist for 2 wk can prevent starvation after ablation of AgRP neurons, and, importantly, food intake and body weight were maintained even after termination of GABAA agonist infusion (27), suggesting that mice had adapted to loss of AgRP neurons (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice can also adapt if the ablation is performed in moderately obese, leptin-deficient mice (36), presumably because they have sufficient energy reserves to sustain them while adaptation occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that loss of GABA signaling by AgRP neurons in young mice triggers a similar compensatory mechanism that can supersede the physiological function of these neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apparently, NPY and AgRP alone are unable to sustain adequate food intake when only GABA is acutely eliminated from AgRP neurons in young mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, we suggest that ectopic enhancement of GABA input and/or GABAA receptor signaling at postsynaptic targets of AgRP neurons could be critically involved in the compensatory mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, AgRP neuron ablation experiments were performed in relatively young mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we were surprised that the 8-mo-old mice in this study were resistant to the severe consequences of inactivating GABA signaling, suggesting that there is an age-related adaptive mechanism that allows adequate feeding in the absence of AgRP neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that long-term nutritional or environmental conditions favor desensitization of homeostatic feeding mediated by AgRP neurons, while promoting reliance on the brainstem feeding circuit and/or midbrain reward circuit (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ancillary feeding pathways may progressively overtake the physiological role of AgRP neurons under an emergent or age-dependent mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced Fos induction in postsynaptic targets of the older mice further suggests that an age-dependent mechanism promotes the establishment of a novel balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto these brain regions, where GABA from AgRP neurons has less impact upon the excitability of postsynaptic neurons, such as the calcitonin gene-related peptide neurons in the PBN (28, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to the CreER and CrePR systems, we avoided the problem of tethering Cre recombinase with a bulky addition by introducing a single amino acid into a particular locus within Cre recombinasea strategy that prevents gene silencing, at least at the Agrp locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aminoglycoside derivatives, unlike lipid-soluble tamoxifen and RU486, cannot penetrate the bloodbrain barrier or diffuse far from the site of injection (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the nsCre system is particularly useful to distinguish between central and peripheral contributions when the gene of interest is expressed in both periphery and brain, such as the RipCre case (3, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, one might be able to target one brain region with an aminoglycoside without affecting genes in others regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some studies indicated that tamoxifen and RU486 interfere with reproductive and heart physiology, which could affect interpretation of acquired phenotypes (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, emerging evidence indicates that constitutive expression of full-length functional Cre or CreER protein exhibits serious metabolic side effects, such as NestinCre on pituitary functions as well as RipCre or CreER on -cell functions (3, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PTC promotes NMD, a conserved pathway that destroys the majority of nsCre transcripts, thereby leaving only a few mutant mRNAs that are translated into truncated peptides (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, aminoglycosides have not been cited for causing adverse effects on fertility, heart physiology, digestive systems, or central nervous systems (14, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although aminoglycosides generally elicit nonspecific cytotoxicity, the dosage of a new class of G418 derivatives, including NB124, that we used did not reveal noticeable adverse effects on feeding, body weight, locomotion, or energy metabolism in the control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used aminoglycoside activation of nsCre to both activate a reporter gene (Rosa26tdTomato) and inactivate Gad1 and Gad2 genes, thus demonstrating two useful applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This nonsense suppression-based genetic system provides an ideal alternative strategy for regulating expression of Cre-dependent genes in diverse scenarios where other inducible Cre strategies are either nonapplicable or problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Baylor College of Medicine, the University of Iowa, and the University of Washington.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate nsCre transgene, a nonsense codon, UGA, was introduced into P1 phage Cre recombinase coding sequence by a PCR-based replacement method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inducible AgrpnsCre and the conditional Gad2lox/+ transgenic lines were generated by standard cloning and ES cell-based gene targeting protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other mouse strains have been reported (22, 25, 29, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were microinjected with 0.8 µL of G418, NB compounds, or saline vehicle into the third ventricle either once or twice (2 d apart).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements of GABA and glutamate concentrations, immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, and FACS techniques were performed by standard procedures (36, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Food intake, body weight, energy expenditure, and glucose tolerance test (GTT) were measured as described (28, 36, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All statistical analyses were performed by Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refer to SI Materials and Methods for experimental details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Generation_and_Maintenance_of_Transgenic_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Baylor College of Medicine, the University of Iowa, and the University of Washington.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In compliance with our approved protocol, all experiments were terminated if the body weight of mice fell to 80% of their original body weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were group-housed with standard chow diet and water provided ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AgrpDTR and Gad1lox/lox mice were generated and genetically identified by PCR of tail DNA as described (22, 25, 29, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Rosa26tdTomato mice [Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze; also known as Ai14] were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (stock no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  007914).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conditional Gad2 targeting construct (Gad2lox/+) was prepared by flanking the first exon with loxP sites along with an frt-flanked SV-Neo gene in the first intron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The construct was electroporated in G4 ES cells, and correctly targeted clones were identified by Southern blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After removal of the SV-Neo gene by breeding with a mouse expressing FLP recombinase, heterozygotes were bred to generate Gad2lox/lox mice that were used for generation of conditional GABA knockout mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, AgrpnsCre targeting construct were generated by insertion of a fragment containing myc-nls-nsCre2 transgene and frt-flanked SV-Neo gene just 5 of the initiation codon of the Agrp gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All strains of mice were back-crossed onto the C57BL/6 background for at least eight generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental AgrpnsCre/+::Gad1lox/lox::Gad2lox/lox::Rosa26tdTomato mice and the littermate controls AgrpnsCre/+::Gad1lox/+::Gad2lox/+::Rosa26tdTomato were generated by several generations of cross-breeding and inbreeding among the four transgenic lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following pair of primers were used to genotype Gad2lox/+ mice:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following group of primers were used to genotype AgrpnsCre/+ mice:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Generation_and_Validation_of_nsCre_Transgene_in_Vitro  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate nsCre transgene, a nonsense codon, UGA, was introduced to one of the desired loci of wild-type P1 phage Cre coding sequence in a Pgk-myc-nls-Cre plasmid by a PCR-based replacement method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion site of nonsense codon was verified by the DNA sequencing (Genewiz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen), containing 10% (wt/vol) FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), 100 units/mL penicillin G (Corning), and 100 g/mL streptomycin (Corning).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% (vol/vol) CO2-humidified incubator (Thermo Fisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When at 50% confluency, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with three plasmids, including PGK-myc-nls-nsCre, CMV-loxP-Neo-loxP-DsRed2, and Pgk-NeoR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfection was performed by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers suggested protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various doses of G418 (Calbiochem) were added to the culture medium 1 d after the transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After another 4 d, fixed cells were stained by DAPI (Sigma) and visualized under an Axio Observer microscope (Zeiss) to assess the number of DsRed fluorescent cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also generated a stable clone of HEK293 cells expressing CMV-loxP-Neo-loxP-DsRed2 that responds to Cre recombinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these cells were at 20% confluency, they were transfected with Pgk-nsCre2 or wild-type Pgk-Cre by using the calcium phosphate method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G418 was added at varying concentrations for 2 d, and then the cells were split and incubated without G418 for several days before counting the number of fluorescent cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Surgery_and_Drug_Administration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
G418 and the NB series compounds were dissolved in normal saline at a concentration of 100 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under anesthesia, mice were microinjected with 0.8 µL of G418, NB compounds, or saline vehicle into the third ventricle either once or twice (2 d apart) by using the coordinates 0 mm (x axis), 1.6 mm (y axis), and 5.7 mm (z axis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain samples from all groups of mice were collected at the end of each behavioral experiment and were further processed for fluorescent immunohistological analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ablate AgRP neurons, two intramuscular injections of DT (50 g/kg, 2 d apart; List Biological Laboratories) were performed in adult AgrpDTR/+ mice (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_GABA_and_Glutamate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brains were dissected and cut to 1-mm thick slices by using the brain matrix (Zivic Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slices were moved onto an ice-cold metal pad, and the arcuate nuclei were collected under a dissecting microscope (M60; Leica).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissues were rapidly frozen in the liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentrations of GABA and glutamate were measured by a standard HPLC procedure performed at Neurochemistry Core of Vanderbilt University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were normalized to total protein level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunostaining was performed as described with modification (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were killed and perfused transcardially with ice-cold PBS buffer (pH 7.4) containing 3% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (Alfa Aesar) and 1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brains were collected and postfixed overnight under 4 °C in a fixation buffer containing 3% paraformaldehyde.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free-floating sections (20 µm) were cut by a microtome (Thermo Fisher) and then blocked with 5% (wt/vol) normal donkey serum in 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBST buffer, pH 7.2) for overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each different assay, either rabbit anti-AgRP (1:500 dilution; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), rabbit anti-GABA (1:500 dilution; Thermo Fisher), or rabbit anti-Fos (1:1,500 dilution; EMD Millipore) was applied to the sections for overnight incubation under 4 °C, followed by 4 × 15-min rinses in the TBST buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, sections were incubated with Alex Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1,000 dilution; Jackson Immunolab) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by 4 × 15-min rinses in TBST buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mounted sections, fluorescent images were captured by a digital camera mounted on a DMI6000B microscope (Leica).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FACS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TdTomato-positive AgRP neurons were isolated by a standard flow cytometry method as described (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, brain tissues containing the ARC were collected into 0.5 mL of ice-cold HBSS buffer, then transferred to 37 °C warmed dispase buffer (BD Biosciences), and incubated for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the incubation period, tissues were gently pipetted up and down until completely dissociated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, 0.5 mL ice-cold FACS buffer [10% (wt/vol) glucose, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 3 mg/mL BSA] was added to stop the dispase-mediated dissociation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were pelleted by centrifuging for 2 min at 3,000 × g at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellets were resuspended in 0.5 mL of ice-cold FACS buffer and then filtered into polypropylene tubes (Falcon) before the FACS procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Real-Time_qPCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sorted cells were immediately lysed by RLT buffer from the RNeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total mRNA was subsequently extracted and purified based on the manufacturers suggested protocol (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some experiments, total RNA was extracted from fresh arcuate nucleus by TRIzol (Invitrogen) per the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purified RNA was quantified by One-drop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher), and mRNA was reverse-transcribed by using the SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen) per the manufacturers suggested protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR was performed in the Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR system with a set of Taqman probes (IDT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative abundance of Agrp transcripts was determined by using the 2Ct method and normalized to Gapdh, a housekeeping gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Food_Intake_and_Body_Weight  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were individually housed and allowed to acclimate for 3 d before experiments were initiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consumption of chow pellets and body weight were measured at 1600 hours on a daily basis throughout the experimental period (28, 36, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Energy_Expenditure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were acclimatized in the Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS; Columbus Instruments) for 3 d before initiating each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after the second drug injection, energy expenditure parameters, including oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), locomotor activity (in x axis), and respiratory exchange ratio were recorded by indirect calorimetry methods in the CLAMS chambers while mice were supplied with standard chow diet and ad libitum water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values of VO2 and VCO2 were normalized to lean body mass, which was obtained from TD-NMR Whole Body Composition Analyzer (Bruker).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

GTT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The GTT was performed as described (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, mice were fasted overnight for 16 h, a blood sample was taken, and then the mice were injected with d-glucose (1 g/kg, i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), and blood was drawn from the tail vein at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood glucose levels were determined with a FreeStyle Lite glucometer (Abbott Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
