Familial Mediterranean fever mutations lift the obligatory requirement for microtubules in Pyrin inflammasome activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autoinflammatory disease caused by more than 310 mutations in the gene MEFV, which encodes Pyrin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pyrin recently was shown to trigger inflammasome activation in response to Rho GTPase-modifying bacterial toxins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that Clostridium difficile infection and intoxication with its enterotoxin TcdA engage the Pyrin inflammasome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, activation of the Pyrin inflammasome, but not other inflammasomes, was hampered by microtubule-depolymerizing drugs in mouse and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, we found that FMF mutations render Pyrin activation independent of microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our findings provide a conceptual framework for understanding Pyrin signaling and enable functional diagnosis of FMF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is the most common monogenic autoinflammatory disease worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is caused by mutations in the inflammasome adaptor Pyrin, but how FMF mutations alter signaling in FMF patients is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we establish Clostridium difficile and its enterotoxin A (TcdA) as Pyrin-activating agents and show that wild-type and FMF Pyrin are differentially controlled by microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diverse microtubule assembly inhibitors prevented Pyrin-mediated caspase-1 activation and secretion of IL-1 and IL-18 from mouse macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, Pyrin inflammasome activation persisted upon microtubule disassembly in PBMCs of FMF patients but not in cells of patients afflicted with other autoinflammatory diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that microtubules control Pyrin activation downstream of Pyrin dephosphorylation and that FMF mutations enable microtubule-independent assembly of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) micrometer-sized perinuclear structures (specks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery that Pyrin mutations remove the obligatory requirement for microtubules in inflammasome activation provides a conceptual framework for understanding FMF and enables immunological screening of FMF mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

TcdA_Activates_the_Pyrin_Inflammasome_in_Mouse_Macrophages_and_Human_Monocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Pyrin inflammasome responds to infection with Burkholderia cenocepacia (12, 13) and the Rho GTPase-targeting toxins Clostridium botulinum toxin C3 and C. difficile cytotoxin B (TcdB) in mouse macrophages (1315).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the B30.2 domain is absent in the murine Pyrin ortholog, which prompted us to characterize regulation mechanisms of Pyrin activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors in parallel with studies in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported (14, 15), TcdB activated the Pyrin inflammasome in our studies (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. difficile produces a second enterotoxin, C. difficile toxin A (TcdA), which exerts markedly different functions in disease models (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In examining the inflammasome response to TcdA, we found that apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), but not caspase-11, was required for caspase-1 maturation in LPS-primed BMDMs that had been incubated with TcdA (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, proteolytic conversion of proIL-1 into the mature cytokine required ASC and caspase-1 but not caspase-11 (Fig S1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with TcdA activating a canonical inflammasome, extracellular release of IL-1 continued unabated in BMDMs lacking caspase-11 but was blunted in Asc/ macrophages, in caspase-1/caspase-11/ BMDMs, and in macrophages of a newly generated caspase-1deficient mouse strain (Fig S1D and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TcdA paralleled TcdB in engaging the Pyrin inflammasome because TcdA-induced caspase-1 activation and subsequent cleavage of proIL-1 were abolished in Pyrin (Mefv/) BMDMs but not in Nlrp3/ macrophages (Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these findings, TcdA-intoxicated macrophages required Pyrin, but not Nlrp3, for secreting IL-1 (Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that TcdA selectively activates the Pyrin inflammasome in murine BMDMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether this selective activation also occurs in humans, PBMCs from three healthy donors were incubated with the cell-permeable caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-cmk or the Nlrp3 inflammasome-selective inhibitor MCC950/CRID3 (17, 18) before intoxication with TcdA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 significantly reduced TcdA-induced cleavage of proIL-1 and the extracellular release of IL-1 and IL-18 from human PBMCs (Fig S1 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, TcdA-induced inflammasome activation was insensitive to MCC950/CRID3 at drug concentrations that effectively blunted Nlrp3-relayed IL-1 and IL-18 secretion from nigericin-treated PBMCs (Fig S1 GK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results confirm recent findings that purified TcdA selectively engages the Pyrin inflammasome in mouse BMDMs (19) and extend these results to human PBMCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Pyrin_Inflammasome_Is_Engaged_by_C_difficile_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both TcdA and TcdB contribute critically to C. difficile-induced pseudomembranous colitis (16), although the pathogen also activates additional immune mechanisms independently of TcdA and TcdB (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because microbial pathogens may express several virulence factors that engage multiple inflammasomes in parallel (21, 22), and because the mechanisms of inflammasome activation induced by C. difficile infection are unknown, we next studied inflammasome responses in C. difficile-infected macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caspase-1 was activated in wild-type BMDMs infected with C. difficile, and this activation resulted in substantial cleavage and extracellular release of mature IL-1 (Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These responses required live bacteria and the expression of the bacterial toxins TcdA and TcdB because inflammasome-dependent cytokine processing and secretion were blunted when BMDMs were exposed to heat-killed C. difficile or were infected with the TcdA/B-deficient (VP11186) C. difficile strain (Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the purified toxins (Fig S1), C. difficile infection-induced caspase-1 activation required Pyrin and the inflammasome adaptor ASC, whereas Nlrp3 and caspase-11 were dispensable (Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, Mefv/ and Asc/ BMDMs failed to secrete IL-1 in the culture supernatants, whereas the supernatants of C. difficile-infected Nlrp3/ and caspase-11/ macrophages contained significant levels of IL-1 (Fig S3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, caspase-1 was responsible for the gross amount of IL-1 maturation and secretion, but proIL-1 maturation and IL-1 secretion were not fully inhibited in caspase-1/caspase-11/ macrophages (Fig S3 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that additional proteases may, to a limited extent, contribute to Pyrin- and ASC-dependent IL-1 secretion in C. difficile-infected macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, C. difficile-infected PBMCs of healthy individuals also secreted high levels of IL-1 and IL-18, and these responses were inhibited by the cell-permeable caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-cmk (Fig S3 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in murine macrophages, C. difficile-induced inflammasome activation in human PBMCs was elicited by the bacterial toxins because IL-1 and IL-18 secretion was blunted upon infection with the TcdA/TcdB-deficient C. difficile mutant (Fig S3 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate that TcdA and TcdB are fully responsible for C. difficile-induced inflammasome activation in rodents and humans alike.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LPS_Priming_Is_Dispensable_but_Enhances_Pyrin_Inflammasome_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having established that the enterotoxins are required for inflammasome activation induced by C. difficile infection, we next set out to investigate the mechanisms by which the enterotoxins engage the Pyrin inflammasome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first asked whether Pyrin activation required priming, an important hallmark of the Nlrp3 inflammasome (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both TcdA and TcdB triggered caspase-1 maturation in unprimed macrophages, indicating that Toll-like receptor (TLR) priming is not a prerequisite for the Pyrin inflammasome (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ProIL-1 is produced only in response to NF-B cues such as TLR ligands, whereas unprimed BMDMs express a constitutive pool of proIL-18 that is readily available for secretion upon inflammasome activation (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, culture medium of unprimed BMDMs secreted IL-18, but not IL-1, when intoxicated with TcdA or TcdB (Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, LPS priming supported the secretion of mature IL-1 by the two toxins (Fig S4B) and further enhanced IL-18 secretion (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, LPS priming also markedly enhanced the upstream activation of caspase-1 relative to levels seen in unprimed BMDMs (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that LPS may increase Pyrin expression in BMDMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, both a meta-analysis of public (2529) microarray data (Fig S4D) and a longitudinal quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Pyrin expression levels showed that LPS increased Pyrin and Nlrp3 transcript levels by 10-fold in the first hours (Fig S4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 6 h after LPS stimulation, Pyrin levels had increased further to 30-fold over baseline levels, whereas Nlrp3 remained stable (Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings indicate that, although priming is not essential for Pyrin activation, it significantly enhances Pyrin inflammasome activation by TcdA and TcdB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microtubule-Depolymerizing_Drugs_Selectively_Inhibit_the_Pyrin_Inflammasome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ectopically expressed Pyrin partially associates with cytoskeletal structures (30), but how this localization relates to its physiologic role in inflammasome activation is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that neither inhibition of actin polymerization with cytochalasin D nor small-molecule targeting of downstream actin effectors (c-Abl kinase with STI-571, myosin II with myostatin, and Rock1/2 with Y-27632) interfered substantially with Pyrin-induced IL-1 secretion from murine BMDMs and human PBMCs (Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also the microtubule-stabilizing agent paclitaxel (taxol) failed to modulate the secretion of IL-1 and IL-18 from TcdA-treated PBMCs (Fig S5 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast, however, the microtubule polymerization inhibitor colchicine abolished caspase-1 maturation as well as downstream cleavage and secretion of IL-1 from TcdA-treated BMDMs (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lumicolchicine, a structurally related colchicine photoisomer that does not bind tubulin (31), did not affect Pyrin activation (Fig 1 A and B), demonstrating the specificity of these results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colchicine also abolished Pyrin-mediated IL-1 secretion from C. difficile-infected BMDMs (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these results, colchicine, but not lumicolchicine, inhibited Pyrin-induced proIL-1 maturation in human PBMCs (Fig 1D) and thus prevented the secretion of IL-1 and IL-18 from these cells (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, a set of structurally unrelated microtubule polymerization inhibitors (nocodazole, ABT-751, CA4P, and CYT997) also abolished the maturation of caspase-1, thereby hampering the ensuing cleavage and secretion of IL-1 from TcdA-treated BMDMs (Fig 1 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paralleling these results, these tubulin polymerization inhibitors prevented Pyrin-dependent IL-1 maturation in human PBMCs (Fig 1I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, secretion of IL-1 and IL-18 from TcdA-treated PBMCs was significantly reduced (Fig 1 J and K), establishing that microtubules are essential for human and murine Pyrin activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings led us to examine the role of microtubule polymerization in other inflammasomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anthrax lethal toxin engaged Nlrp1b-dependent automaturation of caspase-1 and cleavage of proIL-1 regardless of whether BMDMs had been pretreated with colchicine (Fig 1L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nlrc4-driven caspase-1 activation and intracellular IL-1 cleavage in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium)-infected macrophages also were normal in the presence of colchicine (Fig 1M), as was activation of the AIM2 inflammasome by transfected dsDNA (Fig 1N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, colchicine failed to modulate extracellular IL-1 release by each of these inflammasomes (Fig S6 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nigericin-induced Nlrp3 inflammasome activation in murine BMDMs and human PBMCs was insensitive to colchicine inhibition (Fig 1O and Fig S6 DF), and nigericin-induced caspase-1 activation along with downstream maturation and release of IL-1 continued unabated in the presence of the microtubule polymerization inhibitors nocodazole, ABT-751, CA4P, and CYT997 (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, polymerized tubulin selectively and critically controls activation of the Pyrin inflammasome in humans and rodents alike.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because murine Pyrin lacks the C-terminal B30.2 domain of human Pyrin, these results also imply that this region is dispensable for inflammasome activation and colchicine regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the great majority of FMF mutations in human Pyrin localize to the C-terminal B30.2 domain (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differential_Microtubule_Regulation_of_Pyrin_Inflammasome_Activation_Identifies_FMF_Patients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We therefore sought to determine how microtubules relate to Pyrin inflammasome signaling in FMF PBMCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that if microtubules relay an activating signal upstream of Pyrin, colchicine would halt TcdA-induced inflammasome activation in PBMCs of FMF patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we collected PBMCs from seven healthy controls and two FMF patients with confirmed MEFV mutations in the C-terminal B30.2 domain [Table S1, patients FMF1 (M694V/R761H) and FMF2 (M694I/M694I)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not detect secreted IL-1 in culture supernatants of untreated PBMCs of healthy donors or FMF patients (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. difficile infection triggered a substantial but comparable release of IL-1 in wild-type and FMF PBMCs (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FMF PBMCs that had been intoxicated with TcdA also secreted normal levels of IL-1, a response that was efficiently blocked by the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-cmk (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, IL-1 levels secreted by FMF PBMCs in response to the NLRP3 inflammasome stimulus LPS (32, 33) were comparable to those of healthy donors (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that FMF mutations are not hypermorphic for inflammasome activation relayed by either Pyrin or NLRP3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, they suggest that FMF mutations differ from CAPS-linked mutations in NLRP3 that significantly enhance LPS- and cold-induced Nlrp3 inflammasome activation (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, however, although colchicine pretreatment abolished TcdA-induced IL-1 secretion from PBMCs of healthy individuals (Fig 2D), it augmented the TcdA-induced IL-1 secretion from FMF PBMCs (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microtubule assembly inhibitors nocodazole, ABT-751, CA4P, and CYT997 also had opposite influences on TcdA-induced IL-1 secretion from FMF PBMCs and from PBMCs of healthy donors (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, IL-18 release from TcdA-treated wild-type PBMCs was blunted by colchicine and other microtubule polymerization inhibitors, whereas FMF PBMCs resisted suppression (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate these results further and to test whether resistance to colchicine inhibition was a defining feature of FMF PBMCs, we repeated our studies with PBMCs from a larger group of healthy donors (n = 5) and from an additional cohort of FMF patients with a variety of defined MEFV mutations (n = 9; Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PBMCs from patients afflicted with CAPS disease resulting from heterozygous mutations in NLRP3 (n = 4; Table S1) and from patients diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA, systemic and nonsystemic; n = 7) were tested also.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with PBMCs from healthy donors, colchicine blocked TcdA-induced IL-1 and IL-18 secretion from PBMCs of CAPS and JIA patients, indicating that their Pyrin inflammasome responses were regulated identically to those of healthy individuals (Fig 2 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast, however, all FMF patients continued to secrete significant IL-1 and IL-18 levels after colchicine pretreatment (Fig 2 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified that colchicine efficiently disrupted assembled microtubules in the PBMCs of healthy individuals and FMF patients alike (Fig S9), ruling out the remote possibility that microtubules of FMF PBMCs resisted microtubule disassembly by colchicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest that FMF mutations converge on lifting the critical requirement for microtubules in Pyrin inflammasome activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FMF-Associated_Pyrin_Binds_Tubulin_but_Does_Not_Require_Microtubules_for_ASC_Speck_Assembly  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dephosphorylation of Pyrins intermediate linker domain was recently shown to be required for TcdA- and TcdB-induced inflammasome activation (14, 15, 19), and introduction of FMF mutations in the B30.2 domain of ectopically expressed Pyrin did not interfere with this process (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with these reports, we showed that endogenous Pyrin was not constitutively active in FMF PBMCs but was engaged only after TcdA stimulation or C. difficile infection (Fig 2 and Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize further how FMF mutations alter Pyrin-dependent inflammasome activation, we examined the binding of ectopically expressed Pyrin domains to endogenous tubulin (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flag-fused constructs corresponding respectively to the N-terminal PYD domain, the intermediate linker sequence, the PYD+linker combination, or the C-terminal tripartite motif (TRIM) and B30.2 domains were expressed in 293T cells and were immunoprecipitated with Flag-beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constructs containing either the PYD or the C-terminal regions of wild-type Pyrin coprecipitated endogenous tubulin, but the intermediate linker sequence did not (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that Pyrin interacts with tubulin through both its N and C termini.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, introduction of the FMF-associated M694V mutation did not prevent tubulin binding in either full-length Pyrin (Fig 3C) or in the isolated carboxyl-terminal region (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported (19), TcdA also triggered Pyrin dephosphorylation in wild-type BMDMs that had been pretreated with colchicine (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, colchicine failed to prevent TcdA-induced dephosphorylation of ectopically expressed wild-type Pyrin and the FMF-associated M694V Pyrin mutant in 293T cells (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with our other studies showing that microtubule polymerization inhibitors prevented inflammasome activation selectively in wild-type, but not in FMF, PBMCs, this finding positions microtubules in the pathway downstream of Pyrin dephosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PYD-based inflammasome sensors such as Pyrin nucleate ASC filaments through a biphasic mechanism in which their PYD domain first nucleates ASC PYD to oligomerize into prion-like fibers that then condense into ASC specks through ASCcaspase recruitment domain (CARD) interactions that also enable the recruitment of caspase-1 zymogens (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interference with these first and second stages of ASC speck assembly therefore results in either the complete absence or the formation of atypical filamentous fibers, respectively (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exposed PBMCs of healthy donors to TcdA or nigericin to trigger ASC speck assembly through the Pyrin and NLRP3 inflammasomes, respectively (Fig 3 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colchicine and the unrelated microtubule polymerization inhibitor CYT997 selectively prevented ASC speck formation in response to TcdA but not in nigericin-treated PBMCs (Fig 3 G and H), demonstrating that microtubules were selectively required for nucleation of ASC specks by Pyrin but not by NLRP3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in healthy donors, colchicine abolished TcdA-induced ASC speck assembly in PBMCs of CAPS and JIA patients (Fig 3 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast, however, the assembly of ASC specks by FMF PBMCs was unabated in the presence of colchicine (Fig 3 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained with the unrelated microtubule polymerization inhibitor CYT997 (Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, FMF mutations in Pyrin remove the critical dependency on microtubules for ASC speck assembly and inflammasome activation downstream of Pyrin dephosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observation that Pyrin inflammasome activation by TcdA, TcdB, and live C. difficile infection required intact microtubules in both human PBMCs and murine macrophages implies that the C-terminal B30.2 domain, which harbors most FMF mutations in humans but is absent in mouse Pyrin, is dispensable for inflammasome activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the B30.2 domain is dispensable for Pyrin inflammasome activation, we established here that FMF mutations in this domain nonetheless remove the critical reliance on intact microtubules for Pyrin-based nucleation of ASC specks and inflammasome signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microtubules were recently proposed to control inflammasome activation apically of Pyrin dephosphorylation in response to bacterial RhoA inactivation (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this suggestion is difficult to reconcile with the observation that TcdA-induced Pyrin dephosphorylation continued unhampered in colchicine-pretreated macrophages and 293T cells (Fig 3 E and F and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we showed that FMF mutations render Pyrin activation independent of microtubules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results provide a conceptual framework for understanding FMF based on a mechanistic model of Pyrin signaling in which microtubules control inflammasome activation downstream of Pyrin dephosphorylation (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, microtubules relay an activating signal to dephosphorylated wild-type Pyrin that shifts autorepressed Pyrin into an open conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FMF mutations in the human B30.2 domain may force dephosphorylated Pyrin in an open conformation that readily binds the inflammasome adaptor ASC, effectively replacing microtubule-relayed signals (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paradoxically, although we show here that FMF mutations render Pyrin inflammasome activation insensitive to colchicine, this drug is an effective treatment that suppresses periodic inflammatory attacks in the majority of FMF patients and prevents amyloidosis, a major long-term complication of the disease that may result in renal failure and death (5, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the clinical efficacy of colchicine treatment is likely associated with its ability to decrease leukocyte motility and phagocytosis during inflammation (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies suggested that defects in the mevalonate pathway seen in the hereditary autoinflammatory disease mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), also named hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS), may also trigger unwarranted activation of the Pyrin inflammasome (14, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to FMF patients, however, MKD patients generally do not benefit from colchicine treatment, whereas blockade of IL-1 has shown promising results (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our observations that FMF mutations render Pyrin activation resistant to colchicine blockade, it would be interesting to investigate the role of microtubules in MKD-associated inflammasome activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Akin to colchicine, certain pathogens express toxins that manipulate microtubule dynamics, as exemplified by the CDT toxin of hypervirulent C. difficile strains (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It therefore is tempting to speculate that the high frequency of heterozygous MEFV mutations in endemic FMF regions (42) might be related to their rendering Pyrin activation insensitive to microtubule manipulations by such pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the key role of inflammasomes in antimicrobial host defense (43), the ability to engage the Pyrin inflammasome in the presence of microtubule dynamics blockade is likely to have offered heterozygous individuals a selective advantage in clearing such infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the insight that inflammasome activation by FMF Pyrin resists colchicine blockade enables functional/immunological screening of the disease among clinically overlapping autoinflammatory patients and thus may contribute to timely diagnosis and commencement of therapy in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
