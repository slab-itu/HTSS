Improved color constancy in honey bees enabled by parallel visual projections from dorsal ocelli  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Color sensing requires a capacity to discount the changing color of natural light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present a biologically validated mathematical solution to this classic problem based on honey bee color vision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed spectral tuning of two simple ocellar photoreceptors in the honey bee allows for an optimal color constancy solution to different light environments, including standard CIE (Commission Internationale de lEclairage) illuminations, natural forest light, sunlight, or shade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model is fully supported by a neural pathway potentially allowing for the transfer of spectral information originating from the ocellar photoreceptors to the centralized information processing regions in the brain and explains previously observed behavioral results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This solution to color constancy can be implemented into color imaging systems to enable accurate color interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How can a pollinator, like the honey bee, perceive the same colors on visited flowers, despite continuous and rapid changes in ambient illumination and background color?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hundred years ago, von Kries proposed an elegant solution to this problem, color constancy, which is currently incorporated in many imaging and technological applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, empirical evidence on how this method can operate on animal brains remains tenuous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our mathematical modeling proposes that the observed spectral tuning of simple ocellar photoreceptors in the honey bee allows for the necessary input for an optimal color constancy solution to most natural light environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model is fully supported by our detailed description of a neural pathway allowing for the integration of signals originating from the ocellar photoreceptors to the information processing regions in the bee brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings reveal a neural implementation to the classic color constancy problem that can be easily translated into artificial color imaging systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Example of five ocelli photoreceptor tuning schemes used for the simulations leading to the SSR model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) =0, (B) =80, (C) =160, (D) =260, and (E) =320 nm;  values correspond to the distance between the principal absorption peak ( band) of the short- (magenta lines) and long-wavelength (green lines) photoreceptors present in the ocelli of the honey bee (A. mellifera), and =150 nm corresponds to the spectral tuning measured for dorsal ocelli by means of electrophysiological methods (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modeling_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modeling shows that SSR increases with , having the maximum coverage of ideal SSR near 260 nm (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this , there is minimal receptor overlap (Fig 1), which consistent with existing theory, would improve independent spectral sampling (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this tuning difference (=260 nm) requires a spectral separation involving a long-wavelength sensitivity not ever observed in bees (35), and the Tc values at which resolution is maximum are not the most frequent values observed in diurnal conditions (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, at =140 nm, a tuning close to the actual =150 nm measured for the honey bee (28), the SSR continues to show optimal resolving power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other end, the model predicts a sharp drop in resolution as Tc values diminish and the IL/IS ratio approaches unity (Fig 2C), collapsing at IL/IS=1 and low (4,400 K) Tc values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, the model thus suggests a failure of color discrimination (lower left corner in Fig 2C), consistent with behavioral data for this type of illumination (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We extended the model to include natural illuminations, such as those typically observed in forest environments, for additional validation (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When using the SPDs of forest shade, woodland shade, small gaps, and open cloudy light environments (3) for modeling SSR as a function of , results indicate that, in all cases, SSR increases exponentially with  (Pless_than0.001), closely approaching SSRmax at =140 nm (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in agreement with the model based on daylight illumination, thus suggesting a compromise between high SSR values and a biologically plausible spectral tuning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, considering the high degree of variability that can be found in natural forest lights because of filtering effects (36), there will likely be cases, such as forest shade and open gaps environments, where any model will likely fail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This failure would explain behavioral observations that individual bumblebees show a tendency to prefer foraging within a constant illumination condition when finding colored flowers (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

How_Would_Such_a_System_Operate?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Improvement of color constancy through ocellar input would require neural structures allowing for information integration between ocelli, color signals sensed by the honey bees compound eye trichromatic photoreceptors, and the color processing centers in the bee brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, early attempts using cobalt chloride for tracing the S neurons suggested that ocelli neurons may be involved in color processing, but results were inconclusive (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used fluorescent dye (dextran-conjugated Texas Red) together with confocal microscopy (Materials and Methods) to establish whether information integration pathways do exist in the bee brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstructions (Fig 4A) show the existence of a direct neural pathway between ocelli and color processing centers (19) by means of the S neurons (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells descend their axons posteriorly to the protocerebral bridge, turn outward across the median and lateral protocerebrum, and then, project anteriorly around the lobula and into the inner layer of the medulla, a brain region considered as a key color processing center for adaptation of neural signals to stimulus input (38) (Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the soma of one of the S neurons was found posteriorly to the central body, another brain region related to color signal processing in the honey bee (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuroanatomical observations thus confirm that S neurons do receive inputs from the ventral ocelli retinas (which directly view the sky) and show that neurons can provide information to color processing centers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This input to the higher levels of visual processing in the bee brain allows for implementation of an improved and almost immediate chromatic adaptation as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Color_Constancy_Enabled_by_Ocellar_Input  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Information from the ocellar input may improve color constancy in the honey bee by providing the necessary, instantaneous measurements of the characteristics of the ambient light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information can then be used to enable adaptation mechanisms for attaining color constancy in a classic von Kries sense (i.e., by varying the sensitivity of three photoreceptors in the compound eyes in accordance to the reconstructed ambient light spectrum) (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach would thus require the reconstruction of the spectral characteristics of the ambient light from just two parameters, namely the response of the two photoreceptor classes in the dorsal ocelli (IS and IL in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Empirical characterization of different conditions of daylight in Northern (6) and Southern Hemispheres (32) plus different forests in both hemispheres (3) shows that the spectral profile of daylight can be estimated by linear models with just a few parameters (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the spectral signal from natural surfaces and illuminations tends to be limited; thus, its spectral profile can be recovered from the output of the receptors by assuming linear models and flat surfaces (4043).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is possible to reconstruct an approximation of the spectral profile of ambient illumination from the ocellar response by replacing the continuous spectral function by a linear sum of basic functions (5, 44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the potential advantage of using ocelli input from the skyward-facing retina for improving color constancy under various daylight conditions, we calculated the spectral shift predicted from our model against the shift expected from the implementation of classic von Kries chromatic adaptation (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we initially reconstructed the SPDs of various phases of daylight using Tc values ranging from 4,000 to 10,000 K (Fig 2B) from their respective ocellar responses (IL,IS) and subsequently, used the reconstructed spectra for calculating the chromatic adaptation coefficients following standard methods (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the ecological validity of our model using reflectance spectra corresponding to 111 flowers used by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48 and assumed the same SPDs used for calculating the ocellar SSR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of the perceptual difference expected from a honey bee observing each flower under different daylight conditions, assuming the two chromatic adaptation mechanisms, was measured as the length of the vector of the respective loci representing the photon captures expected for each flower and illumination in two color spaces (49): (i) the Maxwell Triangle (MT) and (ii) the Receptor Noise Model (RN) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the MT makes no assumptions about the underlying sensory or neural processing of the color signals (47, 49), the RN predicts thresholds of chromatic discriminability based on the signal to noise ratio imposed by photon noise and internal receptor noise under photopic conditions (50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of these two color spaces thus allows for comparing the expected perceivable color shift with different assumptions regarding the neural processing of color signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Simulation results show that a mechanism enabled by ocellar inputs improves color constancy by diminishing the magnitude of the chromatic shift (DI), measured as the Euclidean distance between the first and the last points of each locus in the respective color space, expected from changes in illumination compared with the classic von Kries chromatic adaptation model (DvK) in the two color spaces considered (Fig 5 A and B) [MT: D¯vK=4.0±2.7×102;D¯I=8.3±6.5×103; Wilcoxon signed rank test (W)=6,900; Pless_than0.001; RN: D¯vK=1.7±1.1;D¯I=2.8±2.1×101; W=6,900; P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reductions in color shift are predicted to be 79 and 83% by the MT and RN models, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The length (distance) of the locus in a given color space can also be used to establish the minimum color difference (i.e., threshold) required by an observer to accurately identify two color samples as being different from each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of differences in the assumptions underlying the two color spaces, the precise value of the threshold varies for each model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, using psychophysics experiments, Dyer and Neumeyer (24) established a distance of 0.04 distance units in the MT as the minimum difference required for trained bees to discriminate between similar yellow or blue hues presented simultaneously to a honey bee (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, Vorobyev and Osorio (50) and Vorobyev et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (51) defined a distance of 1.0 distance unit in the RN space (S) as being the minimum color dissimilarity required for a bee to reliably identify two colors as different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, honey bees have been trained to discriminate between similar broadband colors stimuli close to this predicted value (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we can use the threshold values of 0.04 and 1.0 in the MT and RN spaces, respectively, to predict the color shift likely perceived by a honey bee for potentially achieving color constancy by the classic von Kries method or the proposed ocellar-mediated color constancy model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, the implementation of the SSR model significantly reduces color shift considering either the MT (Ho: D¯I=0.04; P less_than 0.001) or the RN (Ho: D¯I=1.00; Pless_than0.001) color spaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, such a reduction is biologically relevant, because von Kries adaptation is above the threshold in the RN (Ho: D¯vK=1.00; Pless_than0.001), and SSR is significantly below the threshold in both the MT and RN models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, honey bees would significantly benefit from attaining color constancy by means of a mechanism that uses ocellar inputs, because this method ensures that the potential color shift produced by changes in illumination is smaller than the color discrimination threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism, which may be implemented by top-down information flow from the medullar or central body or local computations at these structures, thus ensures the perception of a flowers color as being constant under the wide range of ambient illuminations more frequently observed in natural conditions (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biologically validated mathematical solution that we reveal can be readily implemented into artificial systems; indeed, we were able to validate model predictions considering common natural lighting environments in which a bee may forage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these scenarios, the mechanism provides SSR values close to the ideal SSR value at the  value measured for the honey bee ocelli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ocelli are common in many insect taxa, our results suggest that the search for analogous mechanisms in other species would be of high value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Ocellar_Photoreceptor_Response  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The light intensity received by a photoreceptor in the dorsal ocelli of Apis mellifera (I) was defined asIi=300650E()Si()d,[1]where E() represents the spectral irradiance of daylight corresponding to a given equivalent color temperature (Tc) (6), and Si() denotes the spectral sensitivity for each one of the i=2 photoreceptors present in the dorsal ocelli of the honey bee (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tc values describe the color sensation produced by a black body radiator with temperature T (Kelvin), such that (4)Tc=[1Tj+11+2(1Tj+11Tj)]1,[2]where Tj and Tj+1 represent two short lines (isolines) crossing the Planckian locus describing the color of a black body as a function of temperature in a CIE (Commission Internationale de lEclairage) uniform chromaticity diagram (30), and 1 and 2 are the angles between the Tj and Tj+1 isolines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spectral sensitivity function for each photoreceptor was reconstructed using the nomogram template by Stavenga et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (52), including the main (), secondary (), and tertiary () absorption bands, and assuming a vitamin A1 visual pigment, common in the order hymenoptera (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The different spectral tuning () instances evaluated by the model were simulated by systematically changing the value of maximum absorption wavelength (max) for the  band of one of the ocellar photoreceptors from 340 to 600 nm at 20-nm intervals, while keeping the max value for the  band of the second photoreceptor constant at 340 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We arbitrarily named the photoreceptor kept constant as short (IS) and the one varying in its maximum absorption peak as long (IL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absorption peak values for the  and  bands for the L and S photoreceptors were kept constant at 340 and 275 nm, respectively, as suggested in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SSR_Modeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SSR was defined as the resolution attainable by the dorsal ocelli of the honey bee for reconstructing the SPD of the overhead ambient illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, SSR corresponds to the slope of the surface described by the function (,Tc) (Fig 2C), which expresses the ratio of the response of the two Ii photoreceptors (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) to a light intensity corresponding to a given Tc value for a  position:(,Tc)=ILIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]SSR (Fig 2) is thus defined asSSR(,Tc)=Tc(,Tc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]We solved for Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 numerically using the routine gradient in Matlab v. 8.0 (R2012b; The Mathworks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Neuron_Tracing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The morphologies of the S neurons were obtained using fluorescent dye filling and confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S neurons were filled with Texas Red (Invitrogen), and their morphologies were imaged using optical sectioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were mounted horizontally (dorsal side up) on a metal holder; the head and thorax were secured with a 3:1 mixture of bee wax and violin resin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To access the ocellar retina, the lens was removed, and a very thin layer of Vaseline was applied to the exposed retinas during dye injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A glass pipette filled with dextran-conjugated Texas Red (Invitrogen) was inserted dorsally close to the ventral retinal area of the lateral ocellus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The glass pipette was inserted into the live animal at room temperature for a minimum of 2 h to allow dye uptake and diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After dye injection, the brain was carefully dissected in fixative (3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS) and then transferred to 3.7% paraformaldehyde in methanol for 45 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was then dehydrated through an ethanol series and mounted in methyl salicylate (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filled neurons were optically sectioned (2-m thickness) on a confocal microscope (LSMPascal; Zeiss) with a 10× objective lens (N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 0.45; Apochromat; Carl Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The image series was processed in the Zeiss LSM image viewer and Fiji to produce 2D projections of the bee brain, whereas the 3D model was reconstructed from an image series of the head together with the filled neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images were processed using AMIRA 5.3.3 (Visage Imaging GmbH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each image was segmented into discrete components by manually tracing outlines of the filled neurons and different brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3D mesh models of each structure were then generated from the segmented images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
