Lifetime dynamics of plasmons in the few-atom limit  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, we study collective electronic excitationsplasmonsin the few-atom limit in charged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These systems are the zero-dimensional limit of graphene, consisting of only a few fused aromatic carbon rings where the perimeter atoms are bonded to hydrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As systems identified as supporting plasmons, established by the transfer of a single electron to or from the neutral PAH molecule, they are perhaps the most optimal examples where a clear distinction between plasmons and single electronhole pair excitations can be rigorously made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we study the lifetime dynamics of charged versus neutral PAH molecules to characterize the relaxation channels in these quantum plasmon systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules are essentially graphene in the subnanometer limit, typically consisting of 50 or fewer atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the addition or removal of a single electron, these molecules can support molecular plasmon (collective) resonances in the visible region of the spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we probe the plasmon dynamics in these quantum systems by measuring the excited-state lifetime of three negatively charged PAH molecules: anthanthrene, benzo[ghi]perylene, and perylene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the molecules in their neutral state, these three systems exhibit far more rapid decay dynamics due to the deexcitation of multiple electronhole pairs through molecular plasmon dephasing and vibrational relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides a look into the distinction between collective and single-electron excitation dynamics in the purely quantum limit and introduces a conceptual framework with which to visualize molecular plasmon decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Overview of the PAH system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular schematic of (A) anion and (B) neutral anthanthrene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transition density plots of the (C) anion excitation (corresponding to  = 576 nm in the experimental spectrum) and the (D) neutral HOMOLUMO excitation (corresponding to  = 432 nm in the experimental spectrum) of anthanthrene, at the TDDFT level of theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy level diagrams and simplified transition schematics of the (E) anion excitation and the (F) neutral excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colors correspond to different single-particle electronhole pair transition contributions to the single-particle component analysis of the excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colored arrows and numbers show the relative weight of each transition with the signs indicating their phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the anion energy level diagram, SOMO stands for singly occupied molecular orbital and SUMO for singly unoccupied molecular orbital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed arrows represent formally occupied energy levels, and the dashed lines denote the nondegenerate split in the energy levels of electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transition components with weights smaller than 0.12 in modulus are not shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Summary of molecular plasmon dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excited-state decay curves of (A) the anion molecular plasmon excitation and (B) the neutral molecular HOMOLUMO excitation of anthanthrene (blue), benzo[ghi]perylene (green), and perylene (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Comparative lifetime dynamics of benzo[ghi]perylene anion (green) and perylene anion (red) for long timescales (note shift in x-axis scale at gap).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Comparative fluorescence emission values between benzo[ghi]perylene anion (green) and perylene anion (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) Proposed photoexcitation and relaxation dynamics of a molecular plasmon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular plasmon mode (illustrated by the transition density) of the charged PAH is excited by light (green arrow), which couples to the vibrational modes of the molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collective transition states of the molecular plasmon dephases roughly less_than6 ps after excitation, by the internal conversion nonradiative decay channel, followed shortly by vibrational relaxation on the order of 7 to 15 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a now uncoupled excited electronhole pair may instead decay to a lower excited state and reach an energy level where radiative decay is possible, on the order of a nanosecond (red arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Electrochromic_Devices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All optical experiments on the anion dynamics of PAHs were performed under ambient conditions on sealed electrochromic devices composed of an ionic liquid and binding copolymer acting as the media for charge transfer to the neutral PAHs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The procedure for the construction of the electrochromic devices and setup for the optical measurements are detailed in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ultrafast_PumpProbe_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A degenerate pumpprobe spectroscopy setup was built to investigate the excited-state dynamics of the molecular plasmon system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light source was a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (Mira 900 + RegA 9000; Coherent) with a repetition rate of 250 kHz and a 150-fs pulse width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ti:sapphire laser pumped an optical parametric amplifier (OPA 9400; Coherent) with tuning parameters throughout the visible (400, 490700 nm), which was subsequently split and the pump beam orthogonally polarized and optically chopped at 2.2 kHz to be paired with a lock-in amplifier (SR850 DSP; Stanford Research) to prevent stimulated emission by the probe in order to measure the recovery of the ground-state electron population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were performed with pulse fluences not exceeding 0.5 mJ/cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the possibility of two-photon absorption is low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time resolution for the measurements was 250 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both beams were focused by a 500-mm lens, leading to a spot size of about 90 m. Due to the long focal length, the amount of geometric distortion of the pulses is small with negligible effect on any measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After excitation, the polarized pump pulse was then filtered from the beam path and used in the absorbance feedback loop mechanism discussed in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emitted light, after filtering, was subsequently collected by a 50-mm lens and dispersed by a monochromator onto a photodiode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For measurements, both the pump and probe were the same wavelength, with the OPA tuned to 574 nm for perylene, 544 nm for benzo[ghi]perylene, and 576 nm for anthanthrene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Theoretical_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All of the quantum-mechanical simulations of the ground-state electronic properties, the transition densities, and the optical absorption and emission spectra of the PAHs taken into consideration in this work, where not otherwise specified, have been performed by means of the Gaussian code (35), and specifically the routines based on TDDFT (34) atomistic first-principles approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B3LYP hybrid scheme (41) was adopted to approximate the exchange-correlation functional and the 6-31+G(d) localized basis set (42) was used throughout all calculations, following previous prescriptions (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometries of the ground state and of the excited states, when needed, have been fully optimized in THF implicit solvent by exploiting a polarizable continuum model (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the GPI analysis (SI Appendix, section S9), we simulated the ground-state and optical absorption properties of the considered PAHs by exploiting the (TD)DFT atomistic first-principles approaches as implemented in a version of the GAMESS code (46), specifically modified by Prof. Stefano Corni, Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, for the simulations performed with GAMESS, we adopted the B3LYP hybrid scheme and the 6-31+G(d) basis set consistent with the Gaussian simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fully optimized the ground-state molecular geometries and simulated their optical absorption and selected transition densities in vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GPI values were then computed by exploiting a postprocessing tool (32), coded as a separate parallel code, which exploits directly the first-principles results obtained from GAMESS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
