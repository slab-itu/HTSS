Marine anoxia and delayed Earth system recovery after the end-Permian extinction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The end-Permian mass extinction not only decimated taxonomic diversity but also disrupted the functioning of global ecosystems and the stability of biogeochemical cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Explaining the 5-million-year delay between the mass extinction and Earth system recovery remains a fundamental challenge in both the Earth and biological sciences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use coupled records of uranium concentrations and isotopic compositions to constrain global marine redox conditions across the end-Permian extinction horizon and through the subsequent 17 million years of Earth system recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that the trajectory of biological and biogeochemical recovery corresponds to variations in an ocean characterized by extensive, shallow marine anoxia provides, to our knowledge, the first unified explanation for these observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Delayed Earth system recovery following the end-Permian mass extinction is often attributed to severe ocean anoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent and duration of Early Triassic anoxia remains poorly constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use paired records of uranium concentrations ([U]) and 238U/235U isotopic compositions (238U) of Upper PermianUpper Triassic marine limestones from China and Turkey to quantify variations in global seafloor redox conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe abrupt decreases in [U] and 238U across the end-Permian extinction horizon, from 3 ppm and 0.15 to 0.3 ppm and 0.77, followed by a gradual return to preextinction values over the subsequent 5 million years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These trends imply a factor of 100 increase in the extent of seafloor anoxia and suggest the presence of a shallow oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) that inhibited the recovery of benthic animal diversity and marine ecosystem function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that in the Early Triassic oceanscharacterized by prolonged shallow anoxia that may have impinged onto continental shelvesglobal biogeochemical cycles and marine ecosystem structure became more sensitive to variation in the position of the OMZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this hypothesis, the Middle Triassic decline in bottom water anoxia, stabilization of biogeochemical cycles, and diversification of marine animals together reflect the development of a deeper and less extensive OMZ, which regulated Earth system recovery following the end-Permian catastrophe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 238U composition of the shallow marine sections averages 0.15 in the Upper Permian and abruptly decreases at the extinction horizon to a minimum value of 0.77 (Fig 1, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2S4, and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synchronously, [U] decreases from 3 ppm to 0.3 ppm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Induan strata, representing the first 0.7 My after the extinction, [U] and 238U values remain low (0.4 ppm and 0.55) in both shallow marine (Dajiang and Takent) and slope (Guandao) environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lowermost Induan 238U data from Dawen have a mean of 0.57 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Olenekian strata, representing the subsequent 4 My, [U] and 238U values gradually increase to 1 ppm and 0.35 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the uppermost Olenekian strata (247.5 Ma), [U] and 238U decrease to 0.6 ppm and 0.65 at Guandao and Takent (Dajiang strata are dolomitized and are not considered).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In limestones above the OlenekianAnisian boundary (247 Ma), [U] and 238U increase to 1.2 ppm and 0.23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three lines of evidence indicate that these general trends in [U] and 238U reflect secular changes in global seawater redox conditions rather than local or diagenetic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, shallow marine uranium records exhibit consistent trends and similar absolute values between China and Turkey, despite vast differences in geographic settings and burial histories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our records, differences in [U] and 238U across time intervals are statistically significant both within individual stratigraphic sections and across the entire dataset, whereas the values between sections are statistically indistinguishable (Table S1 and Statistical Analysis: Interpretation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local or diagenetic controls would likely produce differences among sites rather than differences expressed across time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, our uranium data are not significantly correlated with indicators of diagenetic alteration such as 18O, Mn/Sr, Mg/Ca, or organic carbon content, and do not covary with proxies for detrital contribution (normalization with Al or Th) or indictors of mineralogy (Sr/Ca) (Fig S5 and Diagenetic Alteration and Dolomitization and Statistical Analysis: Interpretation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the trends in [U] from our stratigraphic sections agree with published records from shallow marine carbonates spanning the PermianTriassic boundary interval in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Italy, and China (8, 1113, 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although local and diagenetic processes affect all samples of this age and undoubtedly account for some of the variation in our dataset, the most parsimonious explanation for the statistically supported trends in [U] and 238U is that the dominant signal in the dataset is a primary signature reflecting the uranium composition of seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistically_Significant_Temporal_Trends  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the temporal trends we observe in 238U and [U] are statistically significant, we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) (function aov in R) for our data categorized by general time intervals (Late Permian, Induan, Olenekian, and MiddleLate Triassic) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both [U] and 238U data from shallow marine records differ significantly among time intervals (P values  0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used Dennetts modified TukeyKramer Post-Hoc Test (function DTK.test in R) to run pair-wise comparisons between time intervals for all our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results for the combined dataset show that for both [U] and 238U, the Induan is significantly different from the Late Permian, Olenekian, and MiddleLate Triassic compositions (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, we applied one-way ANOVA and Dennetts modified TukeyKramer Post-Hoc test to the [U] and 238U records for the shallow marine stratigraphic sections (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both Dajiang and Takent, the Induan 238U values are significantly different from the Late Permian and MiddleLate Triassic, whereas [U] values are only significantly different between the Induan and the MiddleLate Triassic for Takent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results from Dawen (combined with data from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11) also indicate a significant difference between the Late Permian and Induan 238U data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the Olenekian [U] and 238U results are not consistent, and differ in whether or not they are significantly distinguishable from the Induan (Takent) or not (Dajiang).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, data from Guandao did not show significant differences between the various time intervals, suggesting that Guandao sediments on the platform slope may have been impacted by local anoxia/suboxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions could result in locally more negative 238U if a greater proportion of 238U relative to seawater was reduced into proximally deposited sediments, which would not be captured in our measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the presence of local anoxia may result in 238U compositions that deviate from global seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From these statistical results, we conclude that the Induan had significantly lower [U] and 238U values than the uppermost Permian and the MiddleUpper Triassic at all sites, whereas the Olenekian is a transitional period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uppermost Permian and MiddleUpper Triassic data are statistically indistinguishable, implying a recovery in [U] and 238U to preextinction values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modeling_Implications_for_Seafloor_Anoxia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A mass balance box model of seawater uranium and its isotopes (Fig 1 and Fig S6) demonstrates that the observed decreases in [U] and 238U require an increase in bottom water anoxia in the global ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scenarios involving a decrease in either [U] or 238U of riverine uranium would account for a decrease in one metric but not both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even simultaneous decreases in riverine [U] and 238U would not reproduce the rapid observed decreases (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, expanding the area of seafloor impacted by anoxia efficiently removes and fractionates U, causing large, rapid, and sustained decreases in [U] and 238U, consistent with the magnitude and rate of change of the negative shifts in [U] and 238U at the extinction horizon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The extent of Early Triassic anoxia implied by our box model calculations is substantial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model predicts an increase in the anoxic sink for uranium from 15% of the total removal flux in the latest Permian to 94% in the Induan, similar to the factor of 6 increase in the flux of U to anoxic facies calculated in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the magnitude and rate of decrease in [U] and 238U also require a factor of 100 increase in the extent of seafloor anoxia (fanox) across the extinction horizon, from 0.2% (28) to 20% of the seafloor during the extinction interval, followed by a 1.5-My interval during which 5% of the seafloor was anoxic (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 3 and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the rest of the Olenekian, 1% of the seafloor may have remained anoxic, still a fivefold increase over preextinction conditions (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings indicate persistent and gradually decreasing anoxia for the 5 million years following the end-Permian mass extinction, followed by a return to preextinction conditions that are more positive than modern seawater composition (Middle Triassic 238U Composition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anoxia_and_Earth_System_Recovery  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the modern ocean, continental shelves comprise 7% of the seafloor area but host a disproportionate share of marine animal diversity, biomass, and the burial of biogeochemically important elements (e.g., carbon and sulfur).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our uranium data, combined with biomarker support for photic-zone euxinia (6) and petrographic, geochemical, and modeling evidence for an expanded oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) rather than deep-ocean anoxia (20, 2931), indicate that anoxic waters may have bathed a large fraction of Early Triassic outer continental shelves and upper slopes in anoxic waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions could explain the limited diversity and ecological complexity of marine ecosystems (3), as well as the reduced maximum and mean body sizes of benthic animals (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the nonlinear hypsometry of the continental margin, fluctuations in the depth of the upper boundary of the OMZ could strongly influence the burial of reduced versus oxidized forms of carbon and sulfur, offering a potential explanation for the biogeochemical anomalies of the Early Triassic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in the presence of a shallow OMZ, the area of seafloor covered by anoxic waters is sensitive to episodic expansion of the OMZ or variations in eustatic sea level (Fig 4A and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, intervals of vertical expansion of the OMZ, or high sea level and extensive continental flooding, would be associated with expanding anoxic bottom waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the extent of seafloor anoxia (fanox) and the rate of organic carbon burial would covary with the depth of the upper boundary of the OMZ relative to the shelfslope break (ZUB), potentially causing large 13C excursions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under this scenario, associated increases in pyrite burial would increase the 34S of carbonate-associated sulfate (34SCAS), reduce the size of the sulfate reservoir, and promote conditions for 34SCAS instability (5, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the potential for variations in ZUB to influence global carbon cycling, we constructed a box model of the geologic carbon cycle, modified from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33 (Modeling the Effect of a Shallow OMZ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the model, the magnitude of 13C response to the same forcing can vary substantially depending upon the depth of the OMZ (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based upon our uranium data, we simulated a scenario in which the upper boundary of the OMZ deepens gradually across Early Triassic time while the frequency of oscillations in ZUB decreases (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By varying these two simple controls, we are able to reproduce the general behavior of the EarlyMiddle Triassic carbon cycle, with large, rapid excursions giving way to smaller and more prolonged variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we are able to produce the 13C excursions without varying the magnitude of the forcing (variation in ZUB) or requiring any large external perturbation to the Earth system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect could account for the magnitude and persistence of Early Triassic 13C and 34S excursions after the initial negative excursion associated with Siberian Traps volcanism (4, 5, 32) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, uranium data confirm a central role for marine redox conditions in modulating Earth system recovery following the end-Permian extinction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The return of marine redox conditions to a preextinction state in the Middle Triassic was concurrent with stabilization of 13C and 34SCAS values and a return to baseline genus richness, ecological diversity, and animal body size (2, 3, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that, as the redox gradient in the upper few hundred meters of the water column diminished due to a deepening of the OMZ and, perhaps, a reduction in total primary productivity (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20), benthic communities recovered, and the sensitivity of organic carbon burial to subsequent variations decreased, stabilizing the global carbon and sulfur cycles (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with the long-term trend of increasing seawater oxygenation during the Phanerozoic, long-term deepening of the OMZ and an associated decrease in the sensitivity of global biogeochemical cycles may also explain the trends toward greater taxonomic diversity and ecological complexity, as well as the reduced frequency of large carbon and sulfur isotope anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Uranium_Box_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the modern ocean, where the extent of anoxia is small (0.2%) (28) relative to conditions over most of Earths history, seawater 238U is invariant at about 0.4 (1517).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If carbonates faithfully record seawater chemistry with no postdepositional effects (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1517 and 34, but see further discussion in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34), then the 238U of carbonates should decrease as regions of anoxic marine bottom waters expand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because uranium has a residence time (3.25.6 × 105 y) (35) significantly longer than ocean mixing time (103 y), global seawater variations in [U] and 238U should be reflected within local sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unique sensitivity of both 238U and uranium concentrations to the extent of bottom water anoxia can be described by differential mass balance equations for the seawater uranium inventory and its isotopic composition, respectively,dNswdt=JrivJanoxJother[1]Nswd238Udt=Jriv*(238Uriv238U)Janox*anoxJother*other[2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Nsw is the oceanic uranium inventory in moles, 238U is the value of seawater, 238Uriv is the value of the riverine source, anox = +0.6 is the effective fractionation factor associated with anoxic sediment deposition (17), and other is the effective fractionation factor associated with the remaining other sinks [+0.03, calculated to maintain isotopic steady state in the modern ocean (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11 and 36)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simplify the inputs to Jriv, the riverine flux [modern value is 0.4 × 108 mol U/y (37)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outputs are assumed to consist of the anoxic sediment sink (Janox) and the sum of the other sinks (Jother), where Janox = 0.06 × 108 mol U/y (37) and Jother is calculated by mass balance to an initial steady-state value of 0.34 × 108 mol U/y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further define the output flux terms Janox and Jother asJanox=Kanox*Nsw*fanox[3]Jother=Kother*Nsw*(1fanox)[4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where fanox is the fraction of seafloor impacted by bottom water anoxia, and Kanox and Kother are rate constants calculated for the modern uranium system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume a constant Kanox, reflecting similar mechanisms of U reduction at the sedimentwater interface (SWI) throughout the studied time intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, Kother is also assumed to be constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of uranium in carbonates is estimated by converting the moles of U in the seawater reservoir, Nsw, and assuming constant seawater calcium concentrations and a distribution coefficient of 1.4 (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity of the model to varying [Ca] is evaluated in Uranium Biogeochemical Cycling and Model Sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was first evaluated with parameters for the modern ocean, and then the 238Uriv term was adjusted to 0.05 to reflect a steady-state baseline value equal to the average Late PermianMiddle/Late Triassic seawater value as inferred from our data (Middle Trassic 238U Composition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed description of the uranium cycle is provided in Uranium Biogeochemical Cycling and Model Sensitivity, and additional box model results are presented in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An evaluation of model sensitivity is presented in Uranium Biogeochemical Cycling and Model Sensitivity and in Fig S9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R code used in our analysis can be accessed at https://purl.stanford.edu/mr858ss1453.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the [U] and 238U relationships with fanox shown in Fig 3, we assume steady-state behavior and solve Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 for Nsw and 238U, respectively, as a function of fanox,Nsw=JrivKanox*fanox+Kother*(1fanox)[5]238U=238UrivNsw*[Kother*other+fanox*(Kanox*anoxKother*other)]Jriv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [6]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Geologic_Setting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our sample set includes three stratigraphic sections from the GBG, south China, and one stratigraphic section from the Aladag Nappe, Turkey (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of these sections were so shallow as to be oxygenated even if deeper waters (100 m) were anoxic, and thus are less likely to have been impacted by diagenesis resulting from local redox conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the GBG, we analyzed a suite of 86 samples for [U] and 55 samples for 238U from Dajiang and 32 samples for [U] and 238U from Guandao.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also analyzed three samples from the Dawen section, allowing us to compare our measured values across the PermianTriassic boundary interval to those reported previously in a high-resolution 238U and Th/U record for the 15 m spanning the extinction horizon at the same site (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether variations in [U] and 238U are globally reproducible, we also analyzed a suite of 36 samples for [U] and 31 samples from Takent, the Aladag Nappe, Turkey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We correlate the Takent section to the GBG using lithostratigraphy, conodont and foraminiferan biostratigraphy, and 13C chemostratigraphy (4, 20, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed description of the stratigraphic sections is provided in SI Materials and Methods (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Uranium_Isotopic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At least 4 g of sample powder was digested using 0.25 N Optima HCl, determined to be the optimal dissolution procedure (see SI Materials and Methods and Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 238U:236U sample to spike ratio of 10:1 was used to maximize both the internal precision and the external reproducibility of the 238U measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uranium was purified by a two-step ion exchange chromatography procedure using UTEVA resin (Eichrom), following procedures adapted from refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16, 43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Uranium isotopic compositions were measured in the ICP-MS/TIMS Facility at Stanford University on a Nu Plasma multicollector-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 238U/235U ratios were corrected using an exponential law for mass bias assuming the certified spike 233U/236U ratio of 1.01906 (44), followed by correction for contribution of 238U from the spike.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 238U/235U ratios are reported relative to reference standard CRM-145 in standard delta notation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Internal precision (2 SE) of measurements of standards was typically 0.07.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average measurement reproducibility (2), assessed by replicate measurements of the same sample solution, is 0.11 (n = 83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we processed four samples twice to evaluate external reproducibility, where one limestone sample had a reproducibility of less_than0.01 and three dolomitic samples had an average reproducibility of 0.4 (Dataset S1; discussed in Diagenetic Alteration and Dolomitization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated reference materials BCR-2 (Columbia River Basalt), HU-1 (Harwell Uraninite), CRM-129a, and an internal carbonate standard to track reproducibility and agreement with previously published values; a summary is provided in Supporting Information and Fig S11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A full description of analytical methods is included in Supporting Information, and the data from this study are presented in Dataset S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The uranium isotopic data presented in this study were measured from limestone samples collected from two sites located on opposite sides of the Tethys ocean: three stratigraphic sections from the GBG, an isolated carbonate platform in South China; and a stratigraphic section through a shallow mixed carbonateclastic platform or ramp in Turkey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A summary of the geologic setting is described in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The uranium concentration of seawater is controlled by variations in the major inputs and output fluxes into the ocean; specifically, the concentration reflects the balance between changes in the riverine delivery of weathered U and removal via microbial reduction in marine sediments (Uranium Biogeochemical Cycling and Model Sensitivity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uranium isotopic composition of seawater provides an additional constraint to differentiate between these controls on seawater [U], which have different consequences for seawater 238U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate our model framework and thus the interpretations of the observed records, we analyze the sensitivity of the model to different parameter values (Uranium Biogeochemical Cycling and Model Sensitivity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the analysis supports the overarching interpretations of our data: An expansion of bottom water anoxia best explains the protracted low values in [U] and 238U during the Early Triassic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also evaluate indicators for diagenetic alteration in the measured limestone samples, including petrographic observations and statistical analyses of associated geochemical data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this discussion (Diagenetic Alteration and Dolomitization and Statistical Analysis: Interpretation), we conclude that the general trends reconstructed from limestone samples, screened to exclude those with significant diagenetic alteration, represent fluctuations in global seawater uranium composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the dolomitized samples do not appear to be reliable recorders of seawater uranium isotopic composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Middle Trassic 238U Composition, we discuss explanations for the Late Permian and MiddleLate Triassic 238U values that are more positive than observed in the modern ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we describe the framework, results, and implications of the model linking sea level and the carbon cycle in Modeling the Effect of a Shallow OMZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Middle_Triassic_238U_Composition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The U isotopic composition of the uppermost Permian and the MiddleUpper Triassic limestones is more positive (mean = 0.23, Fig 3) than modern seawater [0.4 (1517, 39, 40, 58)], and this composition exists for at least 6 million years, suggesting that the steady-state seawater 238U value in the past varied from the modern value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A higher proportion of shales and other organic-rich lithologies than the modern are estimated to have been exposed during the PermianTriassic (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because organic-rich black shales and low-temperature reduced U ore deposits typically have 238U values of 0.13 to +0.43 (15) and 0.21 to +0.59 (79), respectively, greater input of these materials into the riverine flux could have resulted in a more positive weathered U isotopic composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compiled the mean of published values for 238U compositions of the range of possible exposed lithologies: carbonates [0.4 (15, 16, 34)], sandstones [0.3 (15)], shales [0.2 (15)], and volcanics [0.3 (15)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the U isotopic compositions of evaporites and cherts are unknown and make up a small fraction of lithologies (3% in the modern and 5% in PermianTriassic time), we consider the influence of the weathering of these lithologies to be negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using reconstructions of exposed lithologies through time (65), our calculations suggest that the modern riverine flux should have a 238U value of 0.21, comparable to the measurements of modern rivers that have a mean of 0.24 ± 0.28 (2) (16, 3941).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PermianTriassic time, we estimate that the weathered U flux could have a significantly more positive 238U composition, with an estimated maximum value of 0.07.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our mass balance estimate of 238Uriv = 0.05 used to parameterize our uranium box model appears reasonable; although better constraints on the variability of modern rivers is needed, this estimate falls within the range of measurements of modern rivers, which have 238U compositions that range from 0.72 to 0.06 (3941) and are thought to reflect bedrock lithology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In combination with a more positive 238U input value, we suggest that the [U] value of the MiddleLate Triassic riverine flux was likely greater than the modern value because of enhanced continental weathering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A rapid rise in 87Sr/86Sr observed during the Early Triassic is best explained by increased erosion and weathering of the continents (80, 81).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, megamonsoons, which frequently impacted Pangaea in the later Triassic (79), may have increased the riverine flux due to a more vigorous hydrologic cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, during regressive events, exposure of continental shelves that contain Early Triassic sediments impacted by widespread anoxia could themselves simultaneously increase the [U] and 238U of the input flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a change in exposed lithology may explain such a shift in input composition and, coupled with a larger flux, could explain the more positive Middle Triassic 238U value relative to modern seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alternatively, because adsorption of U to Fe oxides and Mn oxides causes a negative fractionation (15, 16, 53, 61), a higher prevalence of these minerals could result in a more positive seawater 238U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low 87Sr/86Sr values (80, 81) in the Late Permian can be explained by a proportionally higher hydrothermal flux, which would have increased seawater [Fe] and [Mn] and thereby increased the prevalence of Fe oxides and Mn oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the 238U composition of hydrothermally altered basalt is variable but has a small net positive fractionation of 0.2 (39), which would partially offset any effect from adsorption to Fe oxides and Mn oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
