title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Repair of adjacent single-strand breaks is often accompanied by the formation of tandem sequence duplications in plant genomes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A major principle in genome evolution is the duplication of existing sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various mechanisms linked to DNA replication, homologous recombination, or double-strand break repair have been elucidated over the years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the single-strand break (SSB)-inducing nickase variant of the CRISPR/Cas system, we examined genomic alterations following the occurrence of two adjacent SSBs in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to deletions, tandem duplications were found regularly, with both outcomes indicating partial involvement of microhomologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that the repair of adjacent SSBs plays a surprising and important role in shaping plant genomes during evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Duplication of existing sequences is a major mechanism of genome evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been previously shown that duplications can occur by replication slippage, unequal sister chromatid exchange, homologous recombination, and aberrant double-strand break-induced synthesis-dependent strand annealing reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent study, the abundant presence of short direct repeats was documented by comparative bioinformatics analysis of different rice genomes, and the hypothesis was put forward that such duplications might arise due to the concerted repair of adjacent single-strand breaks (SSBs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we were able to test this hypothesis experimentally in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a Cas9 nickase to induce adjacent genomic SSBs in different regions of the genome (genic, intergenic, and heterochromatic) and at different distances (20, 50, and 100 bps), we analyzed the repair outcomes by deep sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to deletions, we regularly detected the formation of direct repeats close to the break sites, independent of the genomic context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of these duplications as well as deletions may be associated with the presence of microhomologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most interestingly, we found that even the induction of two SSBs on the same DNA strand can cause genome alterations, albeit at a much lower level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because such a scenario reflects a natural step during nucleotide excision repair, and given that the germline is set aside only late during development in plants, the repair of adjacent SSBs indeed seems to have an important influence on the shaping of plant genomes during evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess genomic changes caused by the induction of adjacent SSBs, we chose three different genomic loci on three different chromosomes of A. thaliana (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected the ADH1 gene (alcohol dehydrogenase 1; AT1G77120) on chromosome 1 to represent a constitutively expressed coding sequence, a long intergenic region of almost 8 kb between the genes AT2G22620 (Rhamnogalacturonate lyase family protein) and AT2G22630 (Agamous-like 17) on chromosome 2 and a locus closely adjacent to the centromere of chromosome 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter can be considered a heterochromatic region owing to its high degree of C methylation and its enrichment of H3.1, H3K9me2, and H3K27me1 as indicated by respective genome-wide mapping data (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paired Cas9-D10A nickase constructs were designed and cloned for all three loci as described previously (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These constructs enabled the paired induction of SSBs at distances of 20, 50, and 100 bps on each strand of the DNA, all creating 5 overhangs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, for every distance, constructs of paired SSBs on the same DNA strand were cloned as well (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The constructs were transformed stably into wild type A. thaliana plants using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary transformed plants were grown on selection media, and for each construct, DNA was extracted from a batch of 2-wk-old seedlings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The respective sgRNA target sites were amplified by PCR, and the pooled amplicons were subjected to NGS to detect the outcomes of the repair of induced breaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The datasets were mapped to their respective reference sequence, and the differences from the reference, indicated by deletions, insertions, or substitutions, were calculated either by their position in the reference or by the length of the alteration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DSB_Induction_by_Paired_SSBs_on_Opposite_DNA_Strands  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the foregoing experimental setup, we first looked at overall mutation frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our surprise, we found only very low frequencies for all three genomic sites at the distance of 20 bps, with 2.2% of reads exhibiting mutations for the genic locus, 6.1% exhibiting mutations for the intergenic locus, and 1.3% exhibiting mutations for the heterochromatic locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding stands in contrast to the results of previous studies in mammalian cells, in which even shorter distances of paired SSBs produced considerable amounts of mutagenesis (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a distance of 50 bp, we found frequencies of 63.1% for the genic locus, 30.4% for the intergenic locus, and 27.7% for the heterochromatic locus, values consistent with those reported in our earlier study on the use of paired Cas9 nickases in plants (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When SSBs were introduced at a distance of 100 bps, the frequencies of detected mutations remained somewhat constant for the intergenic locus (26.6%) and the heterochromatic locus (30.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the genic locus, we found a surprisingly high frequency of 77%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was due mainly to the presence of a certain kind of deletion of 105 bps, which alone represented 17.6% of all reads in this respective dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of this deletion will be discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generally, for all three loci and independent of the distance between SSBs, deletions were more frequent than insertions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A general overview of the size of the deletions and insertions is presented in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sizes of deletions correlate with the SSB distance; that is, deletions of 50 bps are scarce for the 50-bps SSB distance and become more frequent at the 100-bps SSB distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest numbers of insertions are found for the 50-bps distance, with length typically ranging from 20 to 50 bps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of mutations based on their position along the reference sequence is shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of deletions shows two maximums at the sgRNA target sites, but insertions are roughly equally distributed around the target sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In-Depth_Analysis_of_Individual_Insertions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To define the origin of insertions, we took a closer look at respective individual events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads with insertions were chosen and sorted by the length of the inserted sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the longest insertions, the origin of the inserted sequence was investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A corresponding representation for the genic locus is shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data for the intergenic and heterochromatic loci are provided in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that along with the very low overall frequency of mutagenesis, there were no long insertions (10 bps) when SSBs were induced at a distance of 20 bps; however, at the longer distances, we found insertions of up to 100 bps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the inserted sequences were aligned, they always matched the sequence that was directly adjacent to the position of the insertion, thus forming a tandem duplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, for the 100-bps SSB distance, the duplications are formed by a single insertion of a long sequence segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 50-bps SSB distance, however, although the overall insertion length is comparable, the insertions are mostly formed by three similar repeats of shorter individual length that align to the same position adjacent to the insertion site, thus forming a total of four repeats that may differ slightly from one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This likely indicates repeated rounds of duplication formation by several consecutive rounds of paired SSB induction, given that the sgRNA recognition sites are not altered by such repair events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Mutagenesis_Events_After_Paired_Induction_of_SSBs_on_the_Same_DNA_Strand  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The induction of paired SSBs on one strand of DNA was conducted to resemble a situation during nucleotide excision repair (NER), exhibiting a segment of single-stranded DNA between SSBs on the same strand (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, the amplicon NGS data were mapped to the respective reference sequence, and the frequencies of mutated reads were assessed (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this approach does not directly involve the formation of a DSB, the mutagenic potential is expectedly low; in most cases, the detected frequencies of both insertions and deletions are below 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the investigation of individual reads can clearly reveal the presence of deletions that correlate with the position of SSB induction and also affect longer sequence segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we detected insertions resembling the situation found for SSBs on opposing DNA strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the frequencies for long insertions (10 bps) were extremely low for all of the different experimental situations investigated, we found the origin of longer insertions again to be in the vicinity of the site of insertions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike for SSBs on both DNA strands, the observed insertions did not always originate from the directly adjacent sequence, but did always originate in close proximity, within 2050 bps (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Implications_for_Using_the_Cas9_Paired_Nickase_Approach_for_Genome_Engineering_in_Plants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the data obtained in our experiments, we were able to provide refined recommendations for the use of Cas9 paired nickases for the production of mutant plant lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paired nickase approach is especially desirable if off-target effects are expected as, for example, when targeting duplicated or otherwise highly homologous genes, because individual off-target binding of the sgRNAs will lead only to SSBs and thus not to the formation of mutations (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that paired Cas9 nickases can efficiently generate heritable mutations in a desired gene in plants when the SSBs are placed at a distance of 50 bps and in an orientation that leads to the formation of 5 overhangs (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented in the present study indicate that a distance of 20 bps between the individual SSBs is insufficient to introduce efficient gene disruption in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is in line with a previous study applying paired Cas9 nickases in human cell cultures (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In principle, there are two possible reasons why we see such an effect: either two SSBs at such a distance are not induced efficiently owing to binding constraints of neighboring sgRNA-Cas9-D10A complexes, or two SSBs at a closer distance are not as mutagenic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We favor the former hypothesis, considering the lack of indications for a specific distance-dependent error-free repair mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis shows that this effect is not locus-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the distance of 100 bps between the SSBs did not detectably reduce the mutation frequency compared with 50 bps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our results, we conclude that any spacing of 50100 bps between SSBs should induce efficient mutagenesis in plants in a paired nickase approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we demonstrate that cytosine methylation seems not to influence the cleavage by Cas9 in plants, with no reduction in mutagenesis detected for the methylated, heterochromatic locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is in accordance with previous experiments on the target specificity and binding efficiency of Cas9 (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Role_of_Paired_SSBs_on_Opposite_Strands_in_the_Formation_of_Genomic_Alterations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the last 3 y, multiple studies have been published describing the use of the CRISPR/Cas system for precise genome engineering approaches in various eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used Cas9 as a tool to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of genomic changes that might play an important role in plant genome evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to other synthetic nucleases, such as ZFNs and TALENs, the CRISPR/Cas system offers the unique possibility to induce site-specific SSBs by converting the Cas9 nuclease into a nickase by exchanging a single amino acid (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous study using deep sequencing, we found no indication that the induction of a unique SSB is mutagenic in Arabidopsis (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we applied Cas9-D10A nickase to determine the mutagenic potential of two SSBs occurring in close proximity to each other, and found that the occurrence of two SSBs at distances of 50100 bps is highly mutagenic if they are induced in opposing strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found no noticeable differences in the mutation patterns among the three genomic loci investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot draw any general conclusions based on this limited number of loci, our experiments can be taken as a hint that the same kind of repair mechanisms might operate in genic, intergenic, and heterochromatic regions of Arabidopsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The induction of paired SSBs on opposing strands of DNA leads to deletions as the most abundant type of mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that their generation is based on the transformation of a double-stranded DNA with two SSBs in opposing strands to two pieces of broken DNA with free single-stranded overhangs (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the positioning of the SSBs was chosen to create 5 overhangs, the free, single-stranded DNA is prone to processing by endonucleases (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If resection of both 5 ends exceeds the limit in which there is still complementarity between the two strands, the result is ultimately a sequence deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthesis of new DNA starting from the 3 ends occurs simultaneously to the processing of the 5 ends, finally forming a blunt-ended DSB, once synthesis reaches the ends of the matrix strands on both sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sealing of the gap can then be accomplished by a simple ligation mechanism, resembling the situation for classical NHEJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find strong indications for the involvement of microhomology-based alternative end-joining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a specific deletion for the genic locus at an SSB distance of 100 bps, which accounts for 17% of all reads in this dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to microhomologies of 4 bps that are exposed directly adjacent to the cutting sites of the Cas9 nickase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here a direct hybridization of the two 3 ends can be envisaged, followed by cleavage of the overhanging 5 single strands (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis of insertions revealed an important source for tandem duplications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our results, we conclude that these sequence duplications are indeed formed as suggested by the model of Vaughn and Bennetzen (23), which can be further refined and extended (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyzing our data, we come to the conclusion that two related pathways exist that differ by whether or not microhomologies are involved in the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the microhomology-independent pathway, both 5 ends are set free to be resected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, starting from the 3 ends, new DNA synthesis can commence until the protruding strands ends are reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a blunt-ended DSB is formed, which can be sealed by classical NHEJ-mediated ligation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concerted DNA synthesis on both sides can lead to the formation of sequence duplications of variable length, depending on the extent of the 5-end resection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found evidence of the utilization of microhomologies in the formation of sequence duplications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is indicated by the presence of short homologous sequence motifs on either the 5 or 3 side of the insertion as well as in the parental sequence directly downstream or upstream of the insertion site, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, we assume that the single-stranded protruding 5 ends can hybridize to each other via regions of microhomology, forming a more or less stable intermediate structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonpairing 5 flaps are removed at the same time as internal gaps are repaired by fill-in synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the two arising staggered nicks in the filled up double-stranded intermediate are ligated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data indicate that paired nicks in opposing strands are highly mutagenic, so they might be relevant for plant genome evolution even if they occur at a lower frequency in natural situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Naturally, SSBs in opposing strands at short distances might occur during base excision repair, especially if there is a high incidence of incorporation of uracils into DNA (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, nicking errors on the complementary strand by NER might lead to paired SSBs in opposite strands (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it must be noted that nicks induced from DNA damage are obviously induced only once in the natural environment, whereas the Cas9 protein can cleave multiple times until the target is destroyed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also documented by the fact that we found both the presence of single repeats, but also the formation of multiple repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our experimental data strongly suggest that SSBs in opposing strands are responsible for tandem duplications also under natural conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Adjacent_SSBs_in_the_Same_Strand_Can_Also_Result_in_Genomic_Alterations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, also the induction of adjacent SSBs on the same DNA strand led to the formation of mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that formation of both deletions and insertions is based on the initial release of the single-stranded DNA patch in between the two SSBs (Fig 6), either spontaneously or driven by DNA helicases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting single-stranded gap might be prone to breakage, resulting in a DSB with protruding ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After processing of the ends by resection and fill-in, the resulting DSB is repaired by NHEJ, leaving behind a larger deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the formation of insertions, the synthesis of new DNA has to begin, starting from the 3 end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility for an insertion from the vicinity of the break sites may be given by replication slippage, either back to an already synthesized segment or back to a more distant site, yet still in close proximity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the initial situation of neighboring SSBs resembles a step within NER, we assume that although the mutagenic potential of SSBs in the same strand in contrast to opposing strands is, according to our data, less severe by at least two to three orders of magnitude, it nevertheless might have important consequences for genome evolution, especially in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Owing to their sessile and autotrophic nature, plants, and especially their genetic information, are under constant threat from harmful UV irradiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dimerization of pyrimidine bases is a major DNA damage induced by UV light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with photolyases (31) and translesion synthesis (32), excision repair (33, 34) is the main pathway for the repair of such UV-induced DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, by the sheer number of events, a process that itself is hardly mutagenic might become a significant cause for genome alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a recent study performed with mammalian cells indicates that, most likely due to delayed damage recognition, NER is slow in heterochromatic regions and leads to the accumulation of a significant number of mutations (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this sense, paired SSBs, whether they occur at high frequency in the same strand or at low frequency in opposite strands in close proximity, might be a major threat to genome stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially relevant for genome evolution in plants, given that their germline is set aside only late in development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of multiple short direct repeats in plant genomes (23) is a strong indication that this is indeed the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
T-DNA_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Constructs for paired nickases were cloned as described previously (10, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression cassettes for sgRNAs were assembled by cloning respective oligonucleotides into linearized pEn-C1.1, with subsequent transformation into Escherichia coli strain NEB5, and were then transferred into pDe-CAS9-D10A by conventional and Gateway cloning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure resulted in the final T-DNA constructs, each harboring a constitutive expression system for Cas9-D10A and two sgRNA sequences for respective induction of paired SSBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primers used in this study are listed in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plant_Transformation_and_Selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant lines of A. thaliana with a Columbia-0 background were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arabidopsis plants were transformed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation as described previously (36), using A. tumefaciens strain GV3101.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection of the primary transformant plants was done on agar plates with germination medium (4.9 g/L Murashige and Skoog medium, 10 g/L sucrose, and 8 g/L agar, pH 5.7) containing 30 mg/L kanamycin and 0.5 g/L cefotaxime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Amplicon_Deep_Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Batches of 30 primary transformants for each construct were used for DNA extraction, which was performed as described previously (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a proofreading polymerase, MID-labeled amplicons for deep-sequencing analysis were generated by PCR and purified using the peqGOLD Cycle-Pure Kit (Peqlab Biotechnologie).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NGS was performed on a Roche 454 FLX+ System by Eurofins Genomics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data analysis was performed with the module lastz of the Galaxy web server (3739) to obtain an overall sequence mapping and for individual variant detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculations of differences by position were done with the CRISPResso program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads taken into the calculations covered at least 70% of the reference sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total read numbers used for analysis are given in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
