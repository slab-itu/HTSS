pH homeostasis during coral calcification in a free ocean CO2 enrichment (FOCE) experiment, Heron Island reef flat, Great Barrier Reef  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In situ free ocean CO2 enrichment (FOCE) experiments and geochemical analyses (11B, Sr/Ca) conducted on corals (Porites cylindrica) from the highly dynamic Heron Island reef flat of the Great Barrier Reef show that this species exerts strong physiological controls on the pH of their calcifying fluid (pHcf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over an 6-mo period, from mid-winter to early summer, we show that these corals maintained their pHcf at near constant elevated levels independent of the highly variable temperatures and FOCE-controlled carbonate chemistries to which they were exposed, implying they have a high degree of tolerance to ocean acidification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Geochemical analyses (11B and Sr/Ca) are reported for the coral Porites cylindrica grown within a free ocean carbon enrichment (FOCE) experiment, conducted on the Heron Island reef flat (Great Barrier Reef) for a 6-mo period from June to early December 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FOCE experiment was designed to simulate the effects of CO2-driven acidification predicted to occur by the end of this century (scenario RCP4.5) while simultaneously maintaining the exposure of corals to natural variations in their environment under in situ conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of skeletal growth (measured from extension rates and skeletal density) showed no systematic differences between low-pH FOCE treatments (pH = 0.05 to 0.25 units below ambient) and present day controls (pH = 0) for calcification rates or the pH of the calcifying fluid (pHcf); the latter was derived from boron isotopic compositions (11B) of the coral skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, individual nubbins exhibited near constant 11B compositions along their primary apical growth axes (±0.02 pHcf units) regardless of the season or treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, under the highly dynamic conditions of the Heron Island reef flat, P. cylindrica up-regulated the pH of its calcifying fluid (pHcf 8.48.6), with each nubbin having near-constant pHcf values independent of the large natural seasonal fluctuations of the reef flat waters (pH 7.7 to 8.3) or the superimposed FOCE treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This newly discovered phenomenon of pH homeostasis during calcification indicates that coral living in highly dynamic environments exert strong physiological controls on the carbonate chemistry of their calcifying fluid, implying a high degree of resilience to ocean acidification within the investigated ranges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Heron_Island_Reef_Flat  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Heron Island (23.442°S, 151.914°E) is a subtropical coral cay situated in the southern area of GBR located 80 km off the coast of Queensland (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dominant substrate of the inner and midreef flat are carbonate sands that are sporadically populated by coral patches several meters across which typically comprise species of Acropora and Porites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tides at Heron Island are semidiurnal, and reef flat waters are separated from the open ocean for a few hours each day at low tide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shallow depth of the reef flat and periodic isolation at low tide combined with the active metabolism of its benthic communities result in strong diel and seasonal variations in the chemistry of the reef waters (9) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Water temperatures offshore of Heron Island range from around 22 °C in winter to around 27 °C during summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seasonal temperature pattern is mirrored by the Heron Island reef flat (20 °C to 28 °C, respectively), albeit with slightly larger seasonal amplitudes (6.5 °C vs. 5.5 °C) and stronger diel variations (34 °C; Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variability is due to the shallow reef flat waters being more susceptible to local atmospheric heating and cooling, especially during low tides (9, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly seasonal changes in net benthic metabolism (26) result in interseasonal variation in the pH (9) of reef flat waters (8.24 in June to 8.04 in December) that are much greater than in offshore waters (Fig 1 B and C), the latter having relatively constant pH throughout the year (pH 8.08.1) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reef flat waters on Heron Island are also subject to strong diel variations that can change by up to 0.75 pH units within a 24-h period (Fig S2) (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The FOCE system was constructed on the Heron Island reef flat with four submerged flumes (two controls and two treatments) oriented parallel to the shore, each flume open to the environment at both ends and on the bottom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five living parent colonies of the branching coral P. cylindrica were harvested from the Heron Island reef flat and transplanted into both treatment and control flumes, such that each flume contained a representative selection of each colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FOCE flumes were deployed for more than 6 mo, from the end of May to mid-December 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_FOCE_Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Colonies of P. cylindrica collected from Heron Island reef flat were first acclimatized for 4 wk before the experiment which commenced in the winter of 2010 (June).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first phase of the experiment (June to July), all flumes were initially set to follow the same ambient pH conditions of the reef flat waters (mean winter pH 8.24) to allow colonies to acclimatize further and recover from transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second phase of the experiment (July to September), the pH of the FOCE treatment flumes were progressively offset relative to the ambient reef flat water by 0.05 in July, then by 0.15 in August, and finally by 0.25 pH units in September (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatment flumes were maintained at this reduced pH offset (0.25) until early October when the experiment was interrupted by a strong tropical storm that led to a temporary cessation of the pH offset in the FOCE treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment then resumed in late November when treatment flumes were again subjected to pH offsets of around 0.25 relative to the ambient seawater pH, which continued until the end of the experiment in mid-December (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted above, both the controls and treatments were subject to strong natural diel and seasonal forcing independent of the FOCE experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strong combined diel and seasonal variation in reef flat pH allowed us to simultaneously examine the response of each corals internal chemistry to both high levels of natural variability in ambient pH together with systemic shifts in pH expected to occur over this century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 11B compositions (Dataset S1) were measured from a series of subsamples collected along the major growth axis of the skeletons of the P. cylindrica nubbins from each of the four FOCE flumes (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution profiles of strontium to calcium ratios (Sr/Ca; Materials and Methods) were used to determine seasonally resolved chronologies and extension rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcification rates along the primary growth axis were calculated from the product of extension rates and density, with the latter determined using the buoyant weight method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the Sr/Ca chronology, the 11B compositions were determined for four distinct periods of growth: June, August, late September, and late November 2010 (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The August and especially the late September periods were representative of particularly low pH regimes within the treatment flumes (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples analyzed for 11B represent 3 wk of growth and hence incorporate the shorter-term variations in calcification driven by, for example, diel cycles in the supply of metabolic carbon from photosynthesis and respiration (18, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the initial phase of the experiment in midwinter, when the reef flat waters were characterized by relatively high pH (8.3 units; Fig 2), the coral nubbins exhibited a wide range of 11B values (22 to 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the early spring phase (i.e., late September) of the experiment, coral nubbins again exhibited the same range in 11B (22 to 26) despite the significant reduction in pH within the FOCE treatments and in the ambient reef flat pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, individual nubbins exhibited near constant 11B compositions along their major growth axis over each of the four growth periods measured, regardless of whether they were grown under treatment or control conditions (Fig 2A and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These near constant 11B compositions equate to near constant internal pHcf (Fig 2B and Fig S4B), irrespective of treatment and season and declined by less than 0.1 units per unit decrease in external pHsw (pHcf/pHsw= 0.067, P = 0.078, df = 36; Table S2 and Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result reflects the capacity of these coral to homeostatically maintain a pHcf of 8.48.6 at the site of calcification (Fig 3) and thus near constant up-regulation of pHcf during the calcification process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, these findings are in marked contrast to earlier laboratory studies in which corals grown under stable and constant pH conditions exhibited a stronger sensitivity to ambient seawater pH, whereby pHcf decreased by up to 0.5 units for each unit decrease in ambient seawater pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, under the naturally and highly dynamic pH conditions within the Heron Island reef flat, corals seemingly exert a much stronger physiological control of pHcf, which overrides the seasonal ambient depression in seawater pH, as well as the superimposed FOCE induced decrease in seawater pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reinterpretation (11) of previous laboratory work using P. cylindrica colonies under depressed pCO2 conditions (29) indicates that pH up-regulation was taking place at the site of calcification in this species; these previous experiments, however, kept CO2 constant throughout the experiment and therefore did not capture the dynamic nature of many natural reef environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the finding from our study of strong pH homeostasis as exhibited along the major growth axis of the coral skeletons occurs despite the large range in 11B for intercolonial (Fig 2) and off-axis intracolony specimens (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of higher 11B values for off-axis compared with the primary growth axis of the nubbins (Fig S5) is unexpected because growth is higher along the primary growth axis, so we can only speculate that factor(s) other than direct pHcf controls on CO32, such as the internal transport of carbon and energy to sites of calcification (30) are driving faster axial growth rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extension rates of P. cylindrica nubbins used in both the treatment and control flumes were similar to P. cylindrica from elsewhere in the GBR (31); however, this is not entirely surprising given that coral can maintain similar rates of extension under low-pH conditions at the cost of reduced skeletal density and hence rates of calcification (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we find that the skeletal densities in the low pH FOCE corals differed by less than 3% from the densities of control corals (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the calcification rates that we measured were comparable to or higher than rates reported in prior studies (33, 34), which further demonstrates the capacity of P. cylindrica from Heron Island reef flat to calcify and grow at normal rates despite the highly variable and disparate thermal and chemical conditions in the controls and in the FOCE treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better understand how extension and calcification rates varied within and between colonies, we used a bio-inorganic model of calcification based on the model of internal pH regulation abiotic calcification (IpHRAC) (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, the rates of calcification depend primarily on the saturation state of the calcifying fluid (cf) according to known abiotic rate kinetics (24), which are in turn dependent on elevated levels of pH and DICcf in the calcifying fluid relative to ambient seawater conditions (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no significant relationship between rates of extension and estimated saturation state inside the calcifying fluid (Fig 4A), thus providing further evidence that physical rates of coral extension are not strictly dependent on the chemical conditions driving rates of biomineralization within the calcifying fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, rates of coral calcification were positively correlated with cf (r2 = 0.41, P = 0.05, n = 10; Fig 4B), albeit modestly, due to both uncertainties in derived calcification rates (20%) and the very narrow dynamic range of internal saturation states over which this dependency could be determined (cf = 13.516.4 or a relative variation of just 19%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limited range in cf among experimental colonies was, of course, the direct result of the maintenance of near-constant internal pHcf across treatments and seasons (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although coral calcification is a biologically mediated process influenced by both external (e.g., light, temperature, food abundance) (35) and internal [e.g., production of organic matrices as templates (36) for skeletal formation] processes, our simple bio-inorganic model nonetheless explains the first-order functional dependence of calcification rates on internal cf (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study now provides a process-based mechanism (up-regulation and/or homeostasis of pHcf) that can account for the increased tolerance of corals growing under ranges of ambient seawater pH in highly dynamic reef systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How sensitive the growth of marine calcifiers is to ocean acidification thus depends on the particular strategies (or lack thereof) for controlling pH at the site of calcification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our findings, we propose three types of strategies: (i) the passive strategy whereby pH up-regulation does not occur and rates of calcification follow an abiotic mineral precipitation curve that is highly dependent on ambient pH and pCO2, and growth in these organisms will be highly sensitive (12) to ocean acidification (e.g., some species of foraminifera); (ii) the partial regulation strategy, whereby some up-regulation occurs but the calcifying fluid pHcf is still partially modulated by the external environment (11, 12) and rates of calcification are only partially dependent on ambient pH and pCO2, and growth in these organisms will be only moderately sensitive to ocean acidification; and (iii) the highly resilient or homeostatic strategy, as identified in this study, where a near constant internal (extracellular) pHcf of the calcifying fluid is maintained at a fixed level to optimize calcification rates independent of external conditions, and growth in these organisms will be the least sensitive to ocean acidification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This homeostasis strategy was also observed in the massive corals Porites lutea and P. lobata during microcosm experiments (37), where the synergetic effects of increased temperature and low pH showed no net effect on calcification rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most likely or realistic scenario is that most reef-building corals fall somewhere within the second and third categories; that is, being weaker or stronger partial regulators of internal pHcf depending on their taxonomy, habitat, and/or symbiont composition (11, 12, 22, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Porites appears to be a genus whose adult colonies are highly resilient to ocean acidification, as also shown from their occurrence around CO2 seeps (39), yet their skeletal densities and calcification rates can nevertheless decline when exposed to particularly caustic seawater chemistries (sw less_than 2) (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation between and within coral species to maintain robust rates of calcification in low pH (or low arg) conditions may also be a function of their ability to access additional sources of metabolic energy via particle feeding (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, naturally occurring acidified reefs (sw less_than 3) can still support reasonable levels of coral diversity and growth (42), despite any taxa-dependent differences in pH sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The capacity of corals to adapt to a changing environment is also expected to vary among species depending on their ability to isolate their growth and metabolism from changes in ambient conditions (12, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented herein shows that P. cylindrica corals from the Heron Island reef flat maintained elevated extracellular pHcf at the levels necessary to support rates of skeletal growth similar to those recorded in other Porites species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this capacity for pHcf homeostasis appears to be strongest for P. cylindrica colonies growing in more extreme and highly dynamic chemical environments, it is still uncertain how well these coral can maintain this level of pHcf homeostasis with the additional stress of increased temperature (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand how future reefs may change under high-pCO2 environments, it is further necessary to assess this potential biological resistance in a range of coral species from environments with different chemical and thermal regimes (5), as well as assess the metabolic cost associated with persistently high pH up-regulation when ambient pH is very low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, the ability of pH-homeostatic coral to survive and grow in these extreme pH environments may provide them with a greater resilience to the increased levels of ocean acidification expected to occur over the coming decades and centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

CP-FOCE_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In May 2010, five colonies of P. cylindrica were collected from the Heron Island reef flat and divided into subsamples that were allowed to recover on the reef flat for 4 wk before commencing the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In June 2010, the subsamples from each colony were transplanted to each flume to maximize the diversity of the fragments within the flumes and allowed to acclimatize in situ within all four FOCE chambers for a further 4 wk before lowering pH within the flume systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pH levels within treatment flumes were then incrementally lowered relative to ambient reef flat water in July (0.05 pH units), August (0.15 pH units), and September (0.25 pH units).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pH within the treatment flumes were then maintained at a constant offset of 0.25 units relative to the controls until early October, when a passing tropical storm interrupted the CO2 injections and the acquisition of water quality data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatments were reinitiated in late November and ran until the end of the experiment (December 2010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Discrete water samples were collected daily over the course of the experiment for the analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH, total alkalinity (AT), and dissolved oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous measurements of pH were made with MBARI digital pH sensors (Nido Instruments), and conductivity, temperature, and depth were measured with a Seabird SBE-16plusV2 SEACAT (Sea-Bird Electronics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a full description of the FOCE systems, environmental data monitoring, and instrument models/specifications, see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6, 7, and 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sampling_Protocol_and_Geochemical_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Coral nubbins were first bleached and then sliced in half to expose the central growth (extension) axis of the coral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One half was used for the analysis of trace elements (to constrain growth chronology), whereas the other half was used for boron isotope analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples for trace elements were extracted by milling along the major growth axis at 0.5-mm intervals to a depth of 1 mm (see Fig S3 for diagram) using a video microscope mounted micromill (New Wave Research MicroMill Sampling System; Western Australia Department of Fisheries).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Powdered samples (0.51 mg) were processed in the ultra-clean laboratory of the Advanced Geochemical Facility for Indian Ocean Research [AGFIOR, University of Western Australia (UWA)] for dissolution and dilution to 10-ppm Ca solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trace element ratios were determined using the Thermo X-series-2 quadropole-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Q-ICPMS) housed in the UWA AGFIOR facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trace element ratios were corrected against an in-house (Davis Reef, NEP) and interlaboratory (JCp-1) coral standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Constraining_Growth_Chronology_with_Sr_Ca_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sr/Ca ratios from each coral nubbins (samples of 0.51 mg) were measured to provide high resolution (24 wk) sampling of ambient seawater temperatures over a roughly 1-y period that began well before commencement of the experiment (Fig S3 and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like many other coral, seasonal changes in the Sr/Ca ratios of P. cylindrical nubbins were inversely proportional to average monthly reef flat temperatures (45) (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low Sr/Ca ratios at the apex below the tissue zone of the nubbin (01 mm) coincided with higher spring temperatures compared with high Sr/Ca ratios measured between 5 and 7 mm from the apex that coincided with lower winter temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. cylindrica is reportedly a relatively slow growing species, which is consistent with our trace element data that indicates extension rates of 11.5 mm/mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate Sr/Ca analyses on 5-mg samples conducted during preliminary work also revealed seasonal timing in reef flat temperature minima and maxima that were consistent with the higher-resolution Sr/Ca sampling (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trace element analysis confirmed the seasonal timing of our boron isotope samples and our ability to follow the primary growth axis back in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extension_and_Calcification_Rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Linear extension rates were estimated from the physical distance between two points along the primary growth axis identified as occurring in midwinter and early summer according to the Sr/Ca sea surface temperature proxies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Density was calculated using the buoyant weight technique (46), where corals were weighed dry in air before being vacuum sealed in plastic to minimize the effect of air and then submerged and weighed in distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcification rates along the primary growth axis were estimated for individual nubbins from multiplying linear extension rates by skeletal densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Boron_Isotope-pH_Proxy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Carbonate samples for boron isotope analysis were extracted along the primary growth axis (Fig S3) using a small hand held dental drill (Saeshin Strong 206/103L), fitted with diamond burs, at the UWA AGFIOR facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample sizes of 2.5 mg were drilled at the last growth period, representing November (just under the tissue zone), September, August, and the beginning of the experiment (June) as determined from the higher-resolution Sr/Ca data (0.5- to 1-mg samples), from which the time series of seasonal temperatures were derived (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples for 11B determinations were dissolved in 0.58 N HNO3, and the boron was quantitatively separated on ion-exchange columns according to McCulloch et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boron isotope analyses were measured using the Thermo Neptune Plus Multi Collector-ICPMS and NU Plasma II MC-ICP-MS (AGFIOR, UWA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotope data are reported in the permil notation relative to the NIST SRM 951 boron isotopic standard where11B=[(B11/Bsample10/B11/Bstd10)1]×1,000().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pH of the calcifying fluid were derived from measured skeletal 11Bcarb values according to the following equation (48):pHcf=pKBlog{[11Bsw11Bcarb][B3B4×11Bcarb11Bsw]+1,000(B3B41)},[2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where pKB is the dissociation constant dependent on temperature and salinity, 11Bsw = 39.61 (49), and B3-B4 is the boron fractionation factor for the pH-dependent equilibrium of B(OH)4 and B(OH)3 in seawater equal to 1.0272 (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Off-axis sampling (Fig S5A) yielded significant differences in 11B compositions of up to 2.65 (Fig S5B) or up to 0.17 pH units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These significant fine scale spatial controls on 11B compositions (18) are also indicative of strong physiological controls on pHcf at the corallite level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure the repeatability of our results and the absence of such sampling artifacts, the initial 5-mg coral nubbin samples (Fig S7) were replicated by resampling at a higher spatial resolution using 2.5-mg samples (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11B derived from both the 2.5- and 5-mg samples are in close agreement (Fig 2 and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Modeling_cf_and_Coral_Calcification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following the IpHRAC model of McCulloch et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (12), the pHcf of the calcifying fluid was derived from the 11B of the nubbin material (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) with the DIC of the calcifying fluid (DICcf ) assumed to be twice that of the treatment and control seawater DIC as calculated from the treatment and control pH, as well as the ambient seawater TA (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cf for each individual colony were then calculated from pHcf and DICcf, as well as ambient temperature and salinity (9) using CO2SYS (51) and averaged over the entire growth period considered (July to December).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothetical rates of abiotic calcification (G) were calculated over a domain of cf encompassing the average cf of all colonies (cf = 1018; Fig 4B) and range of temperatures encompassing the experimental period (T = 2027 °C) according to G = k(cf  1)n, where k is the rate law constant, cf is the saturation state within the calcifying fluid, and n is the order of the reaction (k and n being temperature dependent) (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the absolute amount of biomineral surface area during calcification is not known at present (38), relative calcification rates were calculated by dividing all modeled calcification rates by the calcification rate achieved when the internal saturation state cf was equal to 18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a linear mixed effects model to examine the general dependency of skeletal 11B and internal pHcf in P. cylindrica on changes in ambient seawater pH (Fig 2B), where each colony was treated as an individual group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All statistical results were generated using the function nlmefit.m in Matlab v8.3.0 (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
