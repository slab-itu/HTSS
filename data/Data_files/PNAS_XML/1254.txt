Biochemically altered myelin triggers autoimmune demyelination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Caprariello et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  demonstrate that subtle biochemical pathology to axon-ensheathing myelin, in the absence of overt demyelination, is sufficient to elicit severe secondary demyelinating inflammatory reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting lesions bear radiological and histological resemblance to inflammatory demyelinating lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), raising the possibility that subtle myelin degeneration in the MS brain may be a proximal event in the evolution of inflammation and consequent myelin loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with an inside-out model of MS pathogenesis, these findings provide a rationale for investigating myelin as a target for early preventive therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although immune attack against central nervous system (CNS) myelin is a central feature of multiple sclerosis (MS), its root cause is unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this report, we provide direct evidence that subtle biochemical modifications to brain myelin elicit pathological immune responses with radiological and histological properties similar to MS lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subtle myelinopathy induced by abbreviated cuprizone treatment, coupled with subsequent immune stimulation, resulted in lesions of inflammatory demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of myelin injury dictated the resulting immune response; biochemical damage that was too limited or too extensive failed to trigger overt pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An inhibitor of peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADs), enzymes that alter myelin structure and correlate with MS lesion severity, mitigated pathology even when administered only during the myelin-altering phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, cultured splenocytes were reactive against donor myelin isolates, a response that was substantially muted when splenocytes were exposed to myelin from donors treated with PAD inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By showing that a primary biochemical myelinopathy can trigger secondary pathological inflammation, cuprizone autoimmune encephalitis potentially reconciles conflicting theories about MS pathogenesis and provides a strong rationale for investigating myelin as a primary target for early, preventative therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Subtle_Myelinopathy_Triggers_Inflammatory_Demyelination_in_Immune-Dysregulated_Hosts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To interrogate the immunogenicity of endogenously degraded myelin, we designed an animal model (Fig 1A) to test whether biochemical myelin modifications could trigger lesions of inflammatory demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reasoning that subdemyelinating changes to CNS myelin were key to its potential immunogenicity, we first administered an abbreviated 2-wk treatment of the demyelinating compound cuprizone (CPZ), a period sufficiently brief so as to perturb myelin ultrastructure without causing overt demyelination (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an abbreviated CPZ induction phase was then followed by an artificial immune boost (IB) of complete Freunds adjuvant and pertussis toxin (PTx), an immune stimulus routinely used in EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike EAE, critically, exogenous myelin peptides were deliberately excluded from the adjuvant in our experiments so that the immunogenicity of endogenous, CPZ-altered myelin (19) could be directly tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two weeks of CPZ and then IB were followed by a 2-wk incubation phase to allow time for a potential immune response to be mounted and for immunosuppressive effects of CPZ (20, 21) to dissipate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a noninvasive surrogate marker of inflammation, gadolinium (Gd)-contrast qT1 MRI sequences were acquired halfway into the 2-wk incubation phase (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional MRI imaging was performed at various times during the study to complement standard histological and biochemical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One week after IB, there was minimal Gd enhancement in three separate control groups: naive untreated, IB only (i.e., no CPZ), and CPZ only (i.e., no IB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the combination of abbreviated, 2-wk CPZ then IB resulted in brains that were strongly Gd enhancing, indicating a breakdown of the bloodbrain barrier, a feature associated with the pathological infiltration of immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Periventricular enhancement suggested a possible breach also of the barrier separating the brain from the cerebrospinal fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to periventricular enhancement, white matter tracts such as corpus callosum also exhibited significant enhancement (CPZ then IB; Fig 1 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two weeks after abbreviated CPZ without intervening IB (CPZ no IB), radiological and histological abnormalities were absent in 20 of the 24 control animals examined (Fig 1D); the four outlier controls were inflamed and demyelinated, but interestingly at the time of harvest, two of the four had severe traumatic fight wounds and therefore likely elevated systemic inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the effects of CPZ are delayed, myelin was examined 3 wk after an abbreviated, 2-wk CPZ course (without IB); no significant demyelination (SI Appendix, Fig S1A) nor inflammatory hypercellularity were detected (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In striking contrast, a combination of abbreviated CPZ followed by IB resulted in white matter T2 hyperintensites in all 24 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the worst cases, significant radiological abnormalities spanned nearly 60% of the anteriorposterior extent of the corpus callosum (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard myelin histopathology revealed overt demyelination and dense infiltration of neutral red-positive cells in the splenium of the corpus callosum (Fig 1D, far Right Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, only the combination of abbreviated CPZ together with IB resulted in severe inflammatory demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extent_of_Myelin_Modification_Modulates_the_Resulting_Immune_Response  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine whether the degree of myelin pathology influenced the resulting inflammatory responses, separate cohorts were exposed to shorter or longer CPZ inductions (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent IB plus 2-wk incubation period depicted in Fig 1A remained unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If myelin injury were the driving force for a pathological immune response, then a shorter, 1-wk CPZ induction paradigm might not trigger inflammatory demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, similar to IB-only controls (0+IB+1), there was no significant Gd enhancement in the 1-wk CPZ induction group (1+IB+1; Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If presence of particular myelin antigens was necessary for the pathological inflammation, then a longer 3-wk CPZ induction phase, sufficient to cause noninflammatory demyelination (22), might also fail to trigger an inflammatory response due to debris clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to strong Gd enhancement following a 2-wk CPZ induction (2+IB+1; Fig 2D), a 3-wk induction (3+IB+1) generated minimal Gd enhancement (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all induction paradigms, brains were harvested 2 wk after IB for histopathological analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In IB-only controls, immune activity was relatively quiescent as indicated by immunostaining with CD45 and Iba1, and myelin remained fully intact (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar immune quiescence was observed in the 1-wk CPZ induction group (Fig 2G) where, in striking contrast to 2-wk CPZ induction (Fig 2H), neither demyelination, microglial activation, nor leukocyte infiltration were apparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three weeks of CPZ+IB, showing predictable demyelination, did not promote significant cellular infiltration after IB (Fig 2I); in fact, after 3-wk CPZ, IB altered neither the extent of demyelination nor the amount of cellular infiltration (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that not only the extent of myelin pathology but also its sustained presence profoundly influenced subsequent inflammatory responses (Fig 2 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the extent and timing of myelin alteration/clearance critically determined the extent of demyelination (Fig 2L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We concluded that an optimal state of biochemical myelin modification was required to elicit secondary inflammatory demyelination: very short CPZ exposure before IB likely generated insufficient myelin immunogens, whereas more prolonged treatment resulted in excessive demyelination and clearance of immunogenic myelin debris.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having established the optimal induction phase to be 2 wk of CPZ, the remainder of the experiments were conducted using this paradigm, and hereafter will be referred to as CAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the infiltrating cells within CAE lesions, we probed tissue sections with cell-specific antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD3+ T cells infiltrated CAE brains, unlike either IB-only or CPZ-only controls (SI Appendix, Fig S2 A and A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adjacent sections of the lesions colabeled with panleukocyte CD45 and the microglia/macrophage marker Iba1 indicated a significant leukocyte accumulation as well as a marked increase in Iba1 fluorescence (SI Appendix, Fig S2 B and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Substantial astrogliosis was also evident by significantly increased GFAP+ immunoreactivity within CAE lesions (SI Appendix, Fig S2 C and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Axonal integrity, assessed by quantification of panneurofilament labeling, indicated significant axonal dropout only in the CAE group (SI Appendix, Fig S2 D and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify the peripheral origins of a subset of the infiltrated monocyte/macrophage populations, parallel experiments were conducted in double transgenic mice in which a promoter specific to macrophages/microglia, CX3CR1-CreER, was crossed with Ai9 [Rosa-CAG-floxSTOPTdT (tomato red fluorescence protein reporter)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differential capacity for self-renewal in central versus peripheral monocytes/macrophages allowed binary discrimination on the basis of sustained TdT fluorescence in cells colabeled with Iba1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only in CAE groups were there Iba1+ cells lacking a TdT reporter (SI Appendix, Fig S2 E and E) suggestive of peripheral macrophages/monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, demyelination in CAE lesions was accompanied by myriad histopathologies resembling active MS lesions, including Gd enhancement, T-cell infiltration, elevated innate immunity, astrogliosis, and axonal loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Citrullination_Links_Myelinopathy_and_Pathological_Inflammation_in_CAE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next sought to define molecular mechanisms by which biochemically altered myelin drives inflammatory demyelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptidyl arginine deiminases (PADs), a family of enzymes known to biochemically alter and destabilize myelin in immune-stimulating ways (6, 8, 23), are strongly up-regulated in subsets of MS lesions (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether PADs also underlie CAE, a small molecule PAD inhibitor, KP-302, (compound 23 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24) was administered intraperitoneally (50 mg/kg) once daily during both the induction and incubation phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KP-302 conferred highly significant protection from inflammatory demyelination (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude antiinflammatory effects of KP-302, the compound was administered either during the CPZ induction phase only (Fig 3C) or the post-IB incubation phase only (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammatory demyelination was reduced only when KP-302 was administered during the induction but not the incubation phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Western blots indicated that citrullination, as a function of CPZ exposure during the induction phase, peaked at the 2-wk period when IB had the greatest effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased citrullination at molecular weights corresponding to MBP isoforms was consistent with deimination of the many arginine residues present on this predominant myelin protein (Fig 3F and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, immunohistochemistry revealed increases in both citrulline and decompacted myelin (QD9) in affected white matter regions of CAE animals (Fig 3 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data implicate citrullinated proteins, likely those of CPZ-altered myelin, as the primary drivers of CAE lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CAE_Splenocytes_React_Specifically_to_Citrullinated_Myelin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether CAE splenocytes were reacting specifically to citrullinated myelin, antigen recall experiments were carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Splenocytes from CAE animals at the peak of inflammatory demyelination (i.e., the 2+IB+2 time point) were cultured and exposed to either naive myelin or that of varying states of citrullination isolated from donor mouse brains by gradient ultracentrifugation (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific lock-and-key interactions between splenocytes and donor CPZ myelin were demonstrated by significant and specific increases in cell proliferation after 72 h of stimulation (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with autoreactivity to citrullinated myelin, myelin derived from CPZ animals treated with KP-302 to prevent in vivo citrullination did not activate the cultured cells (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although naive myelin also stimulated CAE splenocytes, this response was abrogated by in vivo treatment with KP-302, suggesting a high degree of sensitivity of CAE splenocytes to even low levels of physiological citrullination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the strength of the splenocyte response correlated with the degree of citrullination induced by varying durations of CPZ treatment (Fig 4C and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the myelin specificity of CAE splenocytes combined with the muted reaction to myelin from KP-302treated animals suggested that inflammatory demyelination in CAE reflected biochemically modified myelin driving a potent, secondary autoimmune response that was dependent on PAD-mediated, citrullinated, endogenous peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our CAE model provides clear proof of principle that subtle myelinopathy can trigger inflammatory demyelination, a concept that carries important implications for MS pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAE posits a working model of MS in which subclinical myelin perturbations accruing during an early prodromal or induction phase, convert underlying immune susceptibilities (26, 27) into self-myelin autoimmune attacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a mechanism could elegantly reconcile current conflicting theories of MS lesion development: autoimmune myelin destruction from the outside in may be the most obvious pathological manifestation of subclinical myelin pathology that, from the inside out (3), ultimately predisposes the patient to accelerated inflammatory destruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unremitting biochemical myelin alterations, ongoing from the earliest stages of MS, could explain why even potent immune-modulating therapies fail to halt later-stage MS progression and ensuing disability; once autoimmune inflammation largely subsides, either with immune-modulating therapy or with age by immune senescence, the underlying progressive biochemical pathology of myelin continues unabated, leading to degeneration of axoglial elements and irreversible disability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our data clearly demonstrate a causal link between myelin modifications and inflammatory demyelination in mouse, this link remains unresolved in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, evidence is mounting that even very early phases of MS harbor significant pathological changes (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a recent report of radiological brain abnormalities in asymptomatic yet at-risk individuals (5) raises the possibility that underestimated, as yet unidentified, CNS pathologies exist early in the disease process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a longitudinal analysis of dysregulated proteins in pediatric MS implies that perturbed axoglial physiology may be a feature of the earliest events of MS pathogenesis (30), although the initiating sites and molecules involved remain unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification in CAE of citrullinated myelin as a CNS-localized trigger of focal inflammatory demyelination, a molecular pathway previously linked to both autoimmunity and MS severity, demonstrates the utility of our model for unraveling mechanisms of myelin-induced autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The role of ultrastructural myelin changes identified in early MS lesions for disease pathogenesis has yet to be clarified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron micrographs of acute MS lesions reveal conspicuous pathology at the inner tongue of myelin (3133), the significance of which has since been corroborated experimentally in models spanning primary autoimmunity (10) to those chiefly of nonimmune demyelination (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no single animal model has been able to demonstrate inflammatory demyelination caused by endogenous, in vivo-generated myelin debris, that we argue could underpin MS pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PAD-modified myelin, present in MS lesions and directly correlated with disease severity (7), is less stable and more immunogenic (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypercitrullination of MBP strongly correlates with sites of lymphocyte infiltration and destruction in EAE (36), further underscoring the immunogenic nature of deiminated myelin proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, precisely how citrullinated myelin is immunogenic is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response of CAE splenocytes to myelin isolated from naive controls argues that all myelin, by virtue of its baseline citrullination, may be antigenic, and perhaps a threshold of citrullination exists above which pathological immune responses occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myelin citrullination, together with resultant decompaction, likely conspire to generate an antigenic milieu accessible to immune effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguing increases in PAD activity have been shown in normal-appearing MS white matter (9, 37), which together with our findings, argues further for a direct causative role of myelin hypercitrullination in the genesis of inflammatory lesions, both in our CAE model, and in MS (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data taken together with previous observations from human MS are consistent with an early, subclinical biochemical dysmyelination as the proximal event that drives both autoimmune inflammatory MS pathology and a parallel cytodegenerative process that continues during and after the inflammatory phase of clinical MS. Predicated on endogenous myelin antigens driving a secondary immune response, CAE opens potential new avenues of investigation into the underlying pathobiology of this disease, and represents an attractive preclinical model for testing novel therapeutics aimed at both degenerative and inflammatory processes, that in combination may be most effective for all phases of MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CAE_Induction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River), 78 wk of age, were fed ad libitum CPZ (0.2% wt/wt) crushed up in standard rodent chow for 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the day of CPZ cessation, under isoflurane anesthesia, complete Freunds adjuvant (11 mg/mL Mycobacterium tuberculosis) was s.c. and bilaterally injected in the hindlimbs as per standard EAE protocols, except for the addition of myelin or any other additional peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PTx (0.015 mg/kg) was then intraperitoneally injected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two days later, an equivalent second dose of PTx was administered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments involving small molecule PAD inhibitors (KP-302) involved i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dosing (50 mg/kg) once daily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refer to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 for detailed synthesis, chemical procedure, and characterization data for KP-302.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MRI_Sequences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals were imaged in a 9.4T Bruker MRI scanner with an Avance console and Paravision 5.1 while stabilized under isoflurane anesthesia in a small rodent, 35-mm volume coil with the following sequences: for qT2, a multiecho CarrPurcellMeiboomGill sequence was acquired [first echo 6 ms, interecho spacing 6 ms, 128 echoes, repetition time (TR) = 3,000 ms, 1.92 cm field of view (FOV), 1-mm slice, matrix = 128 × 128, 4 averages]; in the same imaging session as CPMG, an anatomical T2w image was also collected by fast spin echo [echo time (TE) = 32 ms, rare factor = 8, TR = 4,000 ms, 2 cm FOV, 0.5-mm slice thickness, 25 slices, matrix = 256 × 256, 1 average].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voxel-wise mean T2 decay times were calculated, data for regions of interest were averaged to a single value, and group differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Gd imaging, first a pre-Gd qT1 was acquired using a fast spin echo variable TR (VTR) sequence (TR = 250, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 7,500 ms, TE = 20 ms, rare factor = 4, 2 cm FOV, 5 slices, 0.5 mm/slice, 256 × 128, 2 averages).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the initial pre-Gd qT1 sequence, the animal was removed from the magnet bore but not the coil so that 1 mmol/kg Gd (Magnevist) could be injected intraperitoneally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animal was then reinserted and registered to prescan image, after which the same VTR sequence was repeated (10 min after Gd injection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean post-Gd T1 relaxation times in the medial corpus callosum across all five slices were normalized against mean pre-Gd T1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Group differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volumetric lesion analyses were calculated from multislice T1 and T2 MRI sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An observer blinded to group identities manually traced hyperintensities in the entire corpus callosum and calculated lesioned area as a percentage of total callosal volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue_Harvesting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissue was harvested either for histology or biochemistry at appropriate times after CPZ/immune boost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For histology, under heavy sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, mice were transcardially perfused, first with 12 mL at room temperature 1× PBS and then 12 mL ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue was postfixed in the same fixative at 4 °C overnight, after which it was cryoprotected first in 20% sucrose until the tissue sank and then 30% sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brains were embedded in OCT and rapidly frozen in dry-ice cooled isopentane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-micrometer sections were cut on a cryostat and collected on VWR Superfrost Plus Micro Slides (three sections per slide, region matched).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For biochemistry, the tissue was harvested fresh under heavy anesthesia and flash frozen in a bath of isopentane and dry ice and kept at 80 °C until homogenization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were homogenized on ice at 10% wt/wt in PBS on a drill press adapted for this purpose and kept at 80 °C until experimentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue_Histochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fixed, frozen tissue sections were stained with Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) (Solvent Blue 38, Sigma-Aldrich) for myelin and counterstained with Neutral Red (Avantor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stained brain sections were imaged on a Thorlabs EnVista whole-slide scanning microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area of LFB staining was calculated in ImageTrak (version 4.12.38, written by P.K.S.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  by analyzing red-green-blue (RGB) components, and using blinded, manual thresholding to determine appropriate signal above noise in three sections per animal from four to six animals per group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean area per square millimeter was compared between groups using one-way ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following antibodies performed optimally in unfixed frozen, 20-m tissue sections: rabbit anti-CD3 (1:100, A0452; Dako); mouse anti-peptidyl citrulline clone F95 (MABN328, EMD Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before immunostaining, a light fixation step with 10 min ice-cold methanol was required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No antigen retrieval was necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fixed, frozen 20-m tissue sections were used for the following antibodies: rat anti-CD45 (1:100, 550539; BD Biosciences); rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:500, 01919741; Wako); rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500, Z0334; Dako); mouse anti-panneurofilament clone SMI-312 (1:1,000, 837904; Biolegend).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean fluorescence area per square millimeter was compared among groups using one-way ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blot  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein concentrations of mouse brain homogenates were quantified using the Pierce BCA protein assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were then denatured in BOLT LDS sample buffer and BOLT sample reducing agent (Novex by Life Technologies) for 10 min at 95 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 20 g of denatured protein per sample was resolved in BOLT 412% Bis-Tris Plus gels (Invitrogen) and transferred onto PVDF membranes using an iBlot 2 gel transfer device (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular masses were estimated using Precision Plus Protein Dual Color Standards (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were first incubated with membrane blocking solution (Life Technologies) for 2 h, followed by incubation with primary antibody solution (anti-peptidyl citrulline, clone F95, mouse monoclonal IGMk, EMD Millipore Corp, LOT: 2750102, 1:100 in TBST-0.1/10% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were then incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody solution (peroxidase-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgM, -chain specific, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc, LOT: 124593, 1:2,000 in TBST-0.1/10% BSA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunochemical detection was carried out using the Novex ECL HRP chemiluminescent substrate reagent kit (Invitrogen), and imaged on a Fluor-S Max MultiImager (Bio-Rad) with Quantity One software (version 4.6.9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signal intensities were normalized to total protein by Coomassie Blue (Brilliant Blue R, Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coomassie Blue-stained membranes were imaged with the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and subsequent densitometry analysis was performed in ImageJ (version 1.51f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The means of band density values were compared between experimental groups by unpaired t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Antigen_Recall_Cultures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Splenocytes were isolated from three treatment groups: naive, IB only, and CAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, spleens were homogenized through a 70-m cell strainer to remove spleen connective tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red blood cells were lysed with 1% ammonium-chloride-potassium lysing buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 500,000 cells per well were plated in triplicate and exposed to one of six different isolated myelin extracts (1% wt/vol) isolated from the following donor mice: naive, naive + PADi (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, one per day for 14 d), 1 wk of CPZ, 2 wk of CPZ, 2 wk of CPZ+PADi, and 3 wk of CPZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess proliferation rates in culture, the cells were pulsed with [3H]-thymidine (1 mCi per well) after 72 h of culture and harvested 18 h later onto filter paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The counts per minute of incorporated [3H]-thymidine were read using a beta counter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical significance was determined using one- or two-way ANOVA with post hoc testing using either Tukeys or Sidaks tests for multiple comparisons (Prism 6.0, GraphPad software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cases of fewer subjects, a KruskalWallis test with Dunns multiple comparisons test was utilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data are presented as mean ± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
