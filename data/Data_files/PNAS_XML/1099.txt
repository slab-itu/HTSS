Regulation of inflammatory responses by dynamic subcellular localization of RNA-binding protein Arid5a  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immune cell activation is accompanied by dynamic changes in expression of genes related to inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitantly, immune reactions are tightly controlled to prevent harmful pathologies due to sustained inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression is controlled at multiple checkpoints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these, the post-transcriptional regulation of the balance between Arid5a and Regnase-1 is important for the induction of inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide important insight into the role of the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic localization of Arid5a in the development of inflammation through the induction of a change in the ratio of Arid5a to Regnase-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adenine-thymine (AT)-rich interactive domain 5a (Arid5a) is an RNA-binding protein found in the cytoplasm and nucleus of normally growing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Arid5a is known to play an important role in immune regulation, whether and how Arid5a subcellular localization impacts immune regulation has remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we generated Arid5a transgenic (TG) mice to address this question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While ectopic Arid5a overexpression did not affect expression of inflammatory cytokines under unstimulated conditions, significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, were produced in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, TG mice were more sensitive to LPS treatment than wild-type mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that Arid5a is imported into the nucleus via a classical importin-/1mediated pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On stimulation, nuclear Arid5a levels were decreased, while there was a concomitant increase in cytoplasmic Arid5a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arid5a is associated with up-frameshift protein 1, and its nuclear export is regulated by a nuclear export receptor, chromosomal region maintenance 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that Arid5a is a dynamic protein that translocates to the cytoplasm from the nucleus so as to properly exert its dual function in mRNA stabilization and transcriptional regulation during inflammatory conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generation_of_Arid5a_TG_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Deregulated overexpression of IL-6 is associated with autoimmune inflammatory diseases (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant therapeutic effects of the humanized antiIL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab have been demonstrated in various inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, demonstrating that abnormal production of IL-6 is responsible for the pathogenesis of these diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Arid5a levels are significantly higher in untreated patients with rheumatoid arthritis than in healthy controls (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Therefore, we investigated whether the overexpression of Arid5a induces inflammatory disease in Arid5a TG mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A schematic showing the generation of Arid5a TG mice is presented in Fig S1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the transgene in the indicated tissues was detected by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), using transgene-specific primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In tail samples, exogenous Flag-tagged Arid5a mRNA levels in TG mice were 32- or 28-fold higher than those in wild-type (WT) mice (Fig S1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations confirmed higher Arid5a expression levels in TG mice compared with WT mice (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm the expression of Flag-tagged Arid5a protein, we isolated peritoneal macrophages from WT and TG mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were stimulated with or without LPS for 2 h, and immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were then performed using anti-Flag beads and anti-Arid5a antibodies, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, Flag-tagged Arid5a protein was detected only in the stimulated cells of TG mice (Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Arid5a expression was higher in TG mice than in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Arid5a_Did_Not_Affect_the_Production_of_Inflammatory_Cytokines_Under_Unstimulated_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze whether overexpression of Arid5a increased the mRNA and protein levels of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in peritoneal macrophages or the serum, cells were isolated from WT and TG mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qRT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of Arid5a were significantly up-regulated in TG peritoneal macrophages compared with WT peritoneal macrophages under unstimulated conditions (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the levels of IL-6 and TNF in TG peritoneal macrophages and mice were not affected compared with those in WT peritoneal macrophages and mice (Fig 1 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results suggest that Arid5a did not affect the production of inflammatory cytokines under unstimulated conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Arid5a_TG_Mice_Were_More_Sensitive_to_Endotoxic_Shock_than_WT_Mice__and_Overexpression_of_Arid5a_Increased_the_Production_of_Proinflammatory_Cytokines_After_LPS_Stimulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the effects of Arid5a overexpression, WT and Arid5a TG mice were injected i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with LPS, and their survival was monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results showed that 50% of TG mice died within 48 h of LPS administration, whereas all of the WT mice survived under the same conditions (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, WT and Arid5a TG mice (68 wk old) were injected i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-6 and TNF serum levels at 2 h after LPS challenge were significantly increased in Arid5a TG mice compared with WT mice (Fig 2 B and C); thus, Arid5a contributed to augmentation of proinflammatory cytokine serum levels in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further analyze whether overexpression of Arid5a increased the mRNA and protein levels of inflammatory cytokines in peritoneal macrophages, cells were isolated from WT and TG mice and stimulated with LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qRT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of cytokines were significantly up-regulated in TG peritoneal macrophages compared with WT peritoneal macrophages (Fig S2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ELISA showed significantly higher secretion of IL-6 and TNF in Arid5a TG cells compared with WT cells (Fig S2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the in vivo data, we observed that Arid5a TG cells secreted higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than WT cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results suggest that Arid5a is associated with the proinflammatory response following LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Arid5a_Was_Actively_Imported_into_the_Nucleus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Arid5a interacts with nuclear proteins (1820), whereas Regnase-1 localizes to the cytoplasm (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed the localization of Arid5a and Regnase-1 by immunofluorescence staining in RAW264.7 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicated that Arid5a was localized mainly in the nucleus, whereas Regnase-1 was localized to the cytoplasm under unstimulated conditions (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined how Arid5a was imported into the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we predicted the cNLS of Arid5a using cNLS mapper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, cNLS prediction algorithms detected cNLS in the Arid5a protein (Table S1), suggesting that Arid5a was imported by a classical nuclear import pathway using importin-/1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the association between Arid5A and KPNA2, a member of the importin- family, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay using expressed tagged-proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEK293T cells were transfected with the empty vector or Flag-Arid5A plasmid, and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coimmunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that Arid5A was associated with KPNA2 (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we monitored the effects of bimax peptides, which inhibit cNLS-dependent nuclear import via high-affinity interactions with NLS-binding sites of importin- (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We transfected RAW264.7 cells with empty vector or bimax-expressing plasmid and then performed Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that the nuclear import of Arid5a was inhibited by bimax (Fig 3 C and D), suggesting that nuclear import of Arid5a was mediated by an importin-/1mediated pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Nucleocytoplasmic_Ratio_of_Arid5a_Protein_Changed_After_LPS_Stimulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the potential presence of a cNLS in Arid5a, our immunofluorescence results demonstrated that a substantial fraction of Arid5a was also localized in the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesized that Arid5a shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and plays different roles in the regulation of Il6 mRNA depending on its subcellular (nuclear or cytoplasmic) localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we next examined the nucleocytoplasmic dynamics and RNA-binding abilities of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first performed immunofluorescence staining with RAW264.7 cells stimulated with or without LPS for 4 h (Fig 4A), and then measured the nuclear and cytoplasmic ratios of Arid5a (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data indicated that Arid5a was localized mainly in the nucleus before LPS stimulation; however, after LPS stimulation, nuclear Arid5a protein was decreased, whereas cytoplasmic Arid5a was increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Western blot analysis of the fractionated extracts showed that in both RAW264.7 cells and isolated peritoneal macrophages, Arid5a protein was gradually increased in the cytoplasm after LPS stimulation, whereas nuclear Arid5a was decreased (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that a fraction of Arid5a translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm after LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then examined whether nuclear and cytoplasmic Arid5a have the potential to bind Il6 mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we first monitored the amounts of nuclear and cytoplasmic Il6 mRNA in RAW264.7 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions before and after LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qRT-PCR demonstrated that nuclear Il6 mRNA was increased after 14 h of LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, cytoplasmic Il6 mRNA was increased only after 4 h (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, to examine whether the nuclear and/or cytoplasmic Il6 mRNA bound to Arid5a, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays using anti-Arid5a antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RIP assays showed a 3.9-fold increase in the amount of Il6 mRNA bound to cytoplasmic Arid5a and a 2.6-fold increase in nuclear Arid5a after LPS stimulation, compared with in cells without stimulation (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these data indicate that both nuclear and cytoplasmic Arid5a exhibits the ability to bind to Il6 mRNA after LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Arid5a_Was_Associated_with_UPF1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A previous study demonstrated that Arid5a competes with Regnase-1 (1, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UPF1 is essential for NMD and Regnase-1mediated mRNA decay (7); therefore, we next investigated whether Arid5a is associated with the UPF family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To this end, cell lysates were prepared from RAW264.7 cells, and anti-Arid5a immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data indicate that Arid5a indeed bound to UPF family members (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm the association between Arid5A and UPF1, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay using ectopically expressed tagged proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEK293T cells were transfected with the Flag-Arid5A and/or Myc-UPF1expressing plasmids, and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coimmunoprecipitation assay demonstrated the Arid5A was associated with UPF1 (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we attempted to determine which domain of Arid5A was required for association with UPF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A coimmunoprecipitation assay with truncated mutants of Arid5A (Fig 5B) revealed that the C1 and C2 mutants, but not the N1 mutant, bound to UPF1 (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results indicate that the 1- to 150-aa region (i.e., N-terminal region) of Arid5A, containing the Arid domain, is required for its association with UPF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
UPF1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm via CRM1 (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether inhibition of the CRM1 pathway by LMB affects the nuclear export of Arid5a, we performed immunofluorescence staining with RAW264.7 cells and measured the fluorescence intensity of nuclear Arid5a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Arid5a decreased in the nucleus after LPS stimulation; however, LMB treatment inhibited Arid5a nuclear export after LPS stimulation (Fig 5 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that Arid5a was associated with UPF1, and that LMB inhibited CRM1-mediated Arid5a nuclear export after LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we investigated whether LMB inhibits IL-6 production after LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ELISA showed that the secretion of IL-6 was significantly down-regulated by LMB treatment in RAW264.7 cells; this result was consistent with findings observed in U937 human promyeloid cells (22) (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, these data suggest that while Arid5a protein normally localizes to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm to stabilize Il6 mRNA, cytoplasmic Arid5a was increased to a greater extent after LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase may lead to more efficient translation of Il6 mRNA and other inflammatory cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we have examined dynamics and subcellular localization of Arid5a in response to inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was not clear how Arid5a in the nucleus competes with Regnase-1 localized in the cytoplasm; therefore, we investigated the subcellular localization of Arid5a and Regnase-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Arid5a translocates to the cytoplasm from the nucleus during the inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arid5a localizes mainly to the nucleus with nuclear protein in resting cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Regnase-1 localizes to the cytoplasm (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predicted the cNLSs of Arid5a and Regnase-1; the results showed that Arid5a has a cNLS (Table S1), whereas Regnase-1 does not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that Arid5a is imported into the nucleus via a cNLS-dependent pathway with importin /.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under unstimulated conditions, Regnase-1 negatively regulates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) signaling (23) and prevents unwanted production of cytokines (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that Regnase-1deficient mice spontaneously developed inflammatory disease (6), a dual locking system of inhibition of transcription and degradation of mRNA seems to be essential for the maintenance of homeostasis (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, under stimulated conditions, IL-6 was necessary for the immune response, and Il6 mRNA had to be protected from destabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Arid5a translocates to the cytoplasm from the nucleus to inhibit Regnase-1mediated mRNA decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these findings suggest that Il6 mRNA is highly regulated by Arid5a in a compartment-specific manner; Regnase-1mediated mRNA decay is inhibited by cytoplasmic translocation of Arid5a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Arid5a physically interacts with the SRY-box 9 (Sox9) in the nucleus and up-regulates the chondrocyte-specific action of Sox9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sox9 is an essential transcription factor in chondrocyte lineage determination and differentiation (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Arid5A also associates with retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear gamma t (RORT) (18), which functions as a lineage-specifying transcription factor in Th17 cells (25), as well as estrogen receptor (ER), which regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Arid5A suppresses RORT and ER functions (18, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we have shown that the N-terminal region of Arid5A is required for the association with UPF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these data suggest that Arid5a function differs depending on localization; cytoplasmic Arid5a regulates mRNA stabilization by suppressing the function of UPF1, whereas nuclear Arid5a regulates the function of transcription factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
UPF1 is essential for NMD and Regnase-1mediated mRNA decay (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, UPF1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm via CRM1, indicating that the protein has potential roles in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRM1 is the only exportin that mediates the transport of more than 230 proteins, including tumor suppressors, growth regulators/proinflammatory proteins, and antiapoptotic proteins (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous study showed that NF-B/IB complexes shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus through cNLS-dependent nuclear import and CRM1-dependent nuclear export.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, LMB sequesters NF-B/IB complexes in the nucleus (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, LMB induces NF-B inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, these findings suggested that the inhibition of Arid5a nuclear export may be induced by NF-B inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NF-B was found to be activated by LPS stimulation because Il6 mRNA was produced in the nucleus after 1 h (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in this study, LMB was added after LPS stimulation for 2 h (Fig 5 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, LMB inhibited the nuclear export of Arid5a, which interacted with Il6 mRNA and UPF1, after LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Arid5a may be translocated via UPF1/Il6 mRNA/CRM1-dependent export after LPS stimulation (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA-binding proteins are associated with various diseases (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, tat activating regulatory DNA-binding protein 43 is essential for Il6 mRNA processing and stability in a stem loop/intron-dependent manner (29), This protein functions as another predominantly nuclear RNA-binding protein that translocates into the cytoplasm and aggregates as inclusion bodies in patients afflicted with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our previous study showed that inhibition of Arid5a phosphorylation and degradation increases the production of Il6 mRNA (31); thus, the inhibition of Arid5a protein degradation in the cytoplasm also may be related to neurodegeneration, cancer, or immune-related diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, our findings suggest that Arid5a is associated with cytokine regulation during the inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arid5a is exported into the cytoplasm after LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Arid5a is imported into the nucleus via an importin-/1 pathway, but is exported into the cytoplasm via a CRM1-dependent mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise molecular mechanism underlying nucleocytoplasmic Arid5a transport requires further study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of Arid5a nuclear export is expected to facilitate the development of autoimmune therapeutic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

C57BL/6J WT mice (68 wk old) were obtained from Japan SLC, Inc. For generation of Arid5a TG mice, the DNA sequence encoding the Flag tag was attached to the 5 end of Arid5a cDNA (1), and the resulting fragments were inserted between the NotI and XbaI sites of the pCAGGS vector, containing the chicken beta-actin promoter and a CMV immediate early enhancer to allow ubiquitous expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 223 pronuclear eggs were injected with a SacI-KpnI digested fragment (4.2 kb) and then transferred into the oviducts of pseudopregnant females the next day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sixty-four pups were born, and PCR genotyping was performed using tail tips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eleven pups were found to carry the CAG-Flag-Arid5a transgene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TG mice were identified by qRT-PCR with specific primers (forward: ACGATGATGACAAGGGCGAAT; reverse: TGGCTTGGGGGATACAGGAA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal experiments were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Osaka Universitys Graduate School of Frontier Bioscience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
