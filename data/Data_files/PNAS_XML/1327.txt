Interplay of a secreted protein with type IVb pilus for efficient enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli colonization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To avoid the mucosal barrier and attach to the intestinal epithelium, enteric pathogens have evolved a unique proteinaceous fiber called type IVb pilus (T4bP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its importance for bacterial pathogenesis, little is known about the adhesion mechanisms of T4bP, especially regarding the role of the minor pilin subunit located at its tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the type IVb minor pilin CofB of CFA/III from enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) plays a role not only in T4bP assembly by forming a trimeric initiator complex, but also in bacterial adhesion by anchoring a secreted protein, CofJ, at the trimerization interface of H-type lectin domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings expand our knowledge of T4P biology and provide important insights for developing therapeutics against ETEC infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Initial attachment and subsequent colonization of the intestinal epithelium comprise critical events allowing enteric pathogens to survive and express their pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), these are mediated by a long proteinaceous fiber termed type IVb pilus (T4bP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have reported that the colonization factor antigen/III (CFA/III), an operon-encoded T4bP of ETEC, possesses a minor pilin, CofB, that carries an H-type lectin domain at its tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CofB is critical for pilus assembly by forming a trimeric initiator complex, its importance for bacterial attachment remains undefined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that T4bP is not sufficient for bacterial attachment, which also requires a secreted protein CofJ, encoded within the same CFA/III operon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of CofB complexed with a peptide encompassing the binding region of CofJ showed that CofJ interacts with CofB by anchoring its flexible N-terminal extension to be embedded deeply into the expected carbohydrate recognition site of the CofB H-type lectin domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining this structure and physicochemical data in solution, we built a plausible model of the CofJCFA/III pilus complex, which suggested that CofJ acts as a molecular bridge by binding both T4bP and the host cell membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fab fragments of a polyclonal antibody against CofJ significantly inhibited bacterial attachment by preventing the adherence of secreted CofJ proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings signify the interplay between T4bP and a secreted protein for attaching to and colonizing the host cell surface, potentially constituting a therapeutic target against ETEC infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

ETEC_Adherence_to_Intestinal_Epithelial_Cells_Requires_CFA_III_and_Secreted_Protein_CofJ  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on its structural similarity with H-type lectin family proteins (24), we initially considered CofB as a tip-localized adhesin recognizing carbohydrate molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found no indication of binding between CofB and GalNAc molecules in isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments (SI Appendix, Fig S1), which is in part consistent with the inability of CFA/III-expressing ETEC to hemaglutinate erythrocytes (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although CFA/III is apparently required for bacterial attachment, it was also recently proposed to be involved in transporting CofJ (27), a secreted protein of unknown function encoded in the 14-gene CFA/III operon (cof operon) (Fig 1A) (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clarify the relationship between CofJ and CFA/III, we performed cell adherence assays with different E. coli strains, including the CFA/III-positive HB101 strain carrying the recombinant plasmid pTT240 that harbors all cof operon genes (cof+ strain) (28) and the HB101 derivatives, CofJ- or CofB-deficient strains (cofJ and cofB strains, respectively), using human colon adenocarcinoma-derived Caco-2 cells (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cof+ recovery rate calculated by dividing the number of colony-forming units (cfus) by that of the inoculum was 5.1%, whereas recovery rates of cofJ and cofB strains were markedly decreased to 0.01% and 0.3%, respectively (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation showed that cof+ and cofJ strains expressed peritrichous CFA/III pili having lengths and structures similar to those of the wild-type ETEC 260-1 and 31-10 strains (Fig 1D) (26, 27), these results suggested that ETEC adherence to intestinal cells requires not only the formation of CFA/III, but also the secretion of CofJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably, no pili were observed for the cofB strain by TEM, consistent with the previously proposed role of CofB in pilus assembly initiation (Fig 1D) (23, 24), and Western blotting analysis clearly demonstrated equivalent amounts of CofJ were expressed by cof+ and cofB strains in whole cell culture (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CofJ secretion into the culture supernatant was substantially reduced in the cofB strain (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar, but even more significant reduction in CofJ secretion was confirmed in culture supernatants of CofA- or CofD-deficient strains (cofA and cofD strains, respectively), in which the gene encoding major pilin or outer membrane secretin, respectively, was disrupted (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CofJ secretion by the ETEC 31-10P-pcofJ strain that lacks all of the cof operon genes but harbors a cofJ gene-harboring plasmid reportedly was negligible (27), we detected residual amounts of secreted CofJ in the culture supernatants of the cofA and cofD strains, which we ascribed to cell fragility or protein leakage in these heterologous expression systems, as suggested previously (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the observed marked reduction in CofJ secretion from these deficient strains strikingly supports the previously proposed function of CFA/III in CofJ secretion, although the mechanism has not yet been studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CofJ_Binds_to_the_Minor_Pilin_CofB  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that the interaction between CofJ and CFA/III is a key step in establishing CofJ secretion and adhesion of ETEC to the extracellular milieu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the interaction between CofJ and CFA/III and determine which of the two CFA/III subunits (CofA or CofB) interacts with CofJ, we performed pull-down assays using each pilin fused with a thioredoxin-His tag (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the insolubility attributed to the pilin N-terminal characteristic hydrophobic segment (15), throughout the experiments, we used truncated CofA and CofB constructs for recombinantly expressed proteins, in which the N-terminal 28 residues are removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experimental results showed that CofJ was detected only in the CofB coeluted fraction, indicating that CofJ specifically bound with the minor pilin CofB (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the purification process, we also noted that a certain part (2 kDa) of CofJ was susceptible to degradation over time as demonstrated by the close doublet bands on SDS/PAGE; notably, these degraded CofJ proteins did not bind with CofB (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then solved the crystal structure of CofJ with extreme care to avoid protease digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CofJ crystal structure solved by Dy derivative was determined at a resolution of 1.76 Å, with the crystal belonging to the space group of P212121 and a total of eight molecules in an asymmetric unit (SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of these eight structures showed substantial structural similarity, with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) value of less_than0.237 Å (SI Appendix, Fig S4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the intrinsic flexibility, however, the N-terminal 22 residues (2,214.3 Da) of all eight CofJ molecules were not included in the final models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N terminus would be solvent exposed and hence susceptible to protease cleavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we suspected that the N-terminal region corresponds to the degraded 2-kDa fragment of CofJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm this hypothesis, we prepared an N-terminal 24 residue-truncated mutant, N24-CofJ, with the Arg24 C terminus being a possible CofJ digestion site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, pull-down assay of N24-CofJ showed that it did not bind to CofB (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subsequent ITC experiment to measure the interaction between a synthesized peptide consisting of CofJ residues 124 [CofJ (124) peptide] and CofB revealed that the peptide bound to CofB with an affinity of Kd = 8.8 ± 1.6 M, whereas the intact CofJ molecule bound to CofB with higher affinity of Kd = 0.14 ± 0.01 M, and N24-CofJ showed no binding (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly indicated that the CofJ N-terminal region mediates the binding with CofB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crystal_Structure_of_CofJ_(124)CofB  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we were unable to obtain the cocrystal of CofB in complex with CofJ, the crystal of the CofJ (124)CofB complex was successfully obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of the complex was determined by molecular replacement using the homotrimeric structure of CofB (24) as a search model that produced interpretable electron-density maps including well-defined densities responsible for three CofJ (124) peptides in the trimeric interfaces between each of two CofB molecule pairs (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bulky Phe10 electron density of the CofJ (124) peptide was observed in each trimeric interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three CofJ (124) peptides were modeled using this Phe10 residue as a starting point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the well-defined electron density observed for the central 515 residues of CofJ (124) peptide (Fig 3B), the electron density map indicated that no structural model could be built for residues 14 and 1624 owing to the scarce electron densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After refinement, we determined the crystal structure of a CofJ (124)CofB heterohexamer complex, including three CofB molecules and three CofJ (124) peptides, at 3.52-Å resolution (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In each trimeric interface, the CofJ (124) peptide fragment from Ser5 to Pro15 was bound to the hydrophobic groove sandwiched by two CofB C-terminal H-type lectin domains (domain 3s) (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures of the three CofJ (124) peptides were essentially the same and well superimposed on each other, with rmsd values from 0.169 to 0.401 Å (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Superposition of the complexed CofB trimer structure solved here on that determined previously of CofB alone showed that domains 2 and 3 of CofB do not undergo structural changes at the backbone level upon peptide binding, except the peptide-binding site regions and the arrangement of CofB molecule domain 1s in the CofJ (124)CofB complex (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CofB domain 3, which is composed of nine -strands from 13 to 21 and one -helix of 4, exhibits structural similarity with H-type lectins that form homotrimers recognizing GalNAc molecules (24, 25), but shows some structural differences with others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the loop between CofB 17 and 18 is much longer than that of discoidin I (11 and 12) and covers nearly the entire conserved sugar recognition site (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, by utilizing the long 17/18 loop of one monomer and the 4/16 loop of another, CofB recognizes the CofJ (124) peptide with slight local conformational changes in these loops (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These unexpected features of CofB reasonably explain the fact that it precludes GalNAc binding in both the presence and absence of CofJ (SI Appendix, Fig S1), suggesting functional repurposing of its H-type lectin domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In particular, the CofB trimer specifically recognizes only a limited part (Ser5Pro15) of the CofJ (124) peptide by hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, indicating that this region is a core fragment for CofB binding and that the central aromatic amino acid, Phe10, is critical for the interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a synthetic 13-residue peptide comprising CofJ residues 416 [CofJ (416) peptide] that encompassed the above-mentioned recognizing sequence bound CofB trimer with an affinity (Kd = 4.8 ± 0.9 M) similar to that of CofJ (124) peptide, and the substitution of Phe10 to Ala of CofJ (416) peptide completely abolished its binding ability (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence alignment showed that the corresponding aromatic residue is also found in operon-encoded secreted proteins of other T4bP assembly systems, along with meaningful N-terminal region sequence similarity (SI Appendix, Fig S11) (21, 2931).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highly conserved aromatic residue is thus likely key to binding with minor pilins at the region where the conserved sugar-binding site is located in H-type lectin family proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated, it is noteworthy that the 20 flexible N-terminal residues, including the key aromatic residue at position 5, of the secreted protein TcpF of V. cholerae are reportedly critical for T4bP-mediated TcpF secretion, bacterial attachment, and microcolony formation (31), which is well explained by the interaction model provided here for CFA/III.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_Model_of_the_CofJCFA_III_Complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the stoichiometry of CofB and intact CofJ molecules in solution, we subjected the purified CofJCofB complex to analytical ultracentrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sedimentation velocity experiments clearly demonstrated that the purified CofJCofB complex exists as a single species in solution, with a sedimentation coefficient of 8.7 S and an estimated molecular mass of 194 kDa (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously reported that CofB in solution forms a trimer with a sedimentation coefficient of 7.3 S (158 kDa) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrated that the CofJCofB complex in solution exists as a heterotetramer (198.1 kDa) with one intact CofJ molecule (37.5 kDa) and three CofB molecules (160.6 kDa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on these findings and the CFA/III pilus model reported previously (24), we generated a structural model of the CofJCFA/III complex in which the CofJ monomer was situated further above the minor pilin CofB at the tip of T4bP (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flexible gap (10 residues) between the globular CofJ domain and the N-terminal interaction site (Ser5Pro15) of CofJ likely keeps the globular domain apart from the CofB trimer and sterically inhibits additional CofJ molecules from interacting with the top of the pilus tip, explaining the unique stoichiometry (1:3) of the CofJCofB complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, in the interaction model, the CofJ bottom surface is positively charged, whereas the CofB trimer top surface is negatively charged (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the globular domain of CofJ transiently interacts with CofB by electrostatic complementarity that may be responsible for the difference in affinity between intact CofJ and CofJ (124) peptide toward CofB as observed in the ITC experiments (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction model also revealed that the characteristic CofJ tyrosine cluster is located at the opposite side of the CofJCofB interface and is likely involved in target-cell recognition (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adherence assays of the cofJ strain to Caco-2 cells with addition of intact CofJ or N24-CofJ yielded recovery rates of 2.9% and 0.1%, respectively, again confirming the importance of interaction between CofJ and CFA/III (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, adherence inhibition assays using Fab fragments of an anti-CofJ IgG antibody demonstrated that the Fab fragments could prevent the attachment of cof+ strain to Caco-2 cells (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results further supported the hypothesis that CofJ serves in an anchor role, bridging both the host-cell surface and the CofB trimer at the tip of CFA/III in the process of ETEC adherence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To attach to the host intestinal epithelium at a safe distance from the mucosal barrier, ETEC express long polymeric fibers termed type IVb pili.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most distal end of the pilus is likely involved in the initial contact with the epithelium, and we have shown that the minor pilin with an H-type lectin domain is located at that position (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although a CFA/III-positive E. coli strain lacking the cofJ gene that encodes the secreted protein successfully produced T4bP, it exhibited negligible adherence to Caco-2 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show the importance of the interplay of T4bP with a secreted protein for bacterial attachment during ETEC infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent ITC experiments clearly demonstrated that CofJ interacts with the CofB trimer with submicromolar affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clues regarding interaction details were provided by the serendipitous observation that lack of the 24-residue N-terminal flexible region completely diminished CofJ binding activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of CofB in complex with a CofJ N-terminal 24-residue synthetic peptide revealed an unprecedented binding mode, by which the peptide is deeply embedded into the expected GalNAc-binding pocket typically conserved at the trimeric interface of the H-type lectin family (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding provides a conceptual advance in T4P biology, wherein T4bP anchors the secreted protein at the pilus tip for pathogenesis, as well as a plausible answer for the currently debated association stateeither monomeric or trimericof the type IVb minor pilin in action (24, 3234), based on the evidence that the trimeric association of CofB is prerequisite for its stable interaction with CofJ (3235).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together with their gene synteny (10), the sequence similarities among minor pilins and among secreted-protein N-terminal regions suggest that this interplay is likely conserved in T4bP-expressing enteropathogens, including at least ETEC, V. cholerae, and C. rodentium (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S11 and S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A database search using the CofB H-type lectin domain suggested that a wide variety of other enterobacteria potentially utilize similar T4bP assembly systems for attaching to and colonizing host intestinal epithelium, possibly through interaction with its cognate secreted protein (SI Appendix, Fig S14 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the requirement of CofJ in ETEC adhesion is proposed here, the mechanistic details remain obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of CofJ, determined here and reported previously (27), demonstrates that CofJ shows marked structural homology with pore-forming toxins (PFTs), such as -hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial and directional location of the CofJ N-terminal region is moreover also similar to that of the characteristic amino-latch N-terminal segment of -hemolysin (SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In prepore-to-pore transition on the target-cell surface, the amino latch (typically 1520 amino acids in length), initially flexible and highly exposed, plays an important role in stabilizing oligomeric association by anchoring neighboring subunits of PFTs (37, 38), whereas its truncation severely affects the ability to form functional pores (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the CofB trimer specifically interacts with the N-terminal CofJ extension, which potentially hampers pore formation by this secreted protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although no experimental evidence indicating pore formation of CofJ is currently available, the architectural plan encompassing the prepore state of PFTs may serve as a molecular bridge that binds to both the cell surface and other molecules (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this context, the cluster of tyrosine residues forming an aromatic patch at the side opposite to the CofJ N-terminal interaction site is particularly interesting (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of an aromatic patch is commonly observed in PFTs and might act as a multivalent lipid-binding site that recognizes lipid head groups of the cell membrane (3941), and CofJ reportedly can bind lipid vesicles as well as epithelial cells, such as HeLa and Caco-2 (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lipid-binding nature of CofJ provides advantages for the bacteria by reserving the preferential adhesion spot for initial and/or future attachment to the epithelium as well as in competing with other bacterial species, including commensal species, for subsequent microcolony formation (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To date, no broadly applicable vaccine for ETEC has been developed (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is partly explained by the high complexity of virulence factors, including more than at least 25 types of CFs, as well as several other secreted non-CF proteins, each of which functions at different stages of infection (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before intimate association with the target-cell surface, possibly via CFs of relatively short (15 m) CU pili (44, 45), another specific mechanism is apparently required for initial attachment while avoiding the mucosal barrier consisting of an inner layer of 1530 m (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such mechanism was recently proposed for the non-CF ETEC virulence factor EtpA, which is secreted and interacts as a molecular bridge with target cells and the tip of flagellum, a common bacterial appendage with typical length of 1015 m (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the wild-type CFA/III strain is nonflagellated and nonmotile, and some ETEC strains that possess Longus, one of the most prevalent CFs among ETEC clinical isolates that has substantial structural homology with CFA/III, are also nonflagellated (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our functional model of CofJ indicated it acts as a molecular bridge, in striking resemblance with EtpA; therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the interplay between the secreted protein and relatively long (515 m or more) proteinaceous fibers, such as flagellum and T4bP (48), is a common strategy for initial attachment of ETEC, avoiding the mucosal barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports demonstrate that EtpA-targeted vaccination is effective (51), and our results showed that Fab fragments of an antibody against CofJ significantly inhibited adhesion of a CFA/III-expressing E. coli strain (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4D and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the initial attachment of bacteria is a critical step common to all enteropathogens, the interplay between the secreted protein and T4bP shown here may constitute an attractive therapeutic target for vaccination and/or antiadhesive treatment against ETEC infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Details of experimental procedures are available in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E. coli K12 derivative carrying recombinant plasmid harboring the entire cof gene cluster (cof+ strain) and its gene-deficient mutants (cofA, cofB, cofD, and cofJ) were used for CFA/III functional analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant CofA and CofB proteins were overexpressed and purified according to previously reported methods (22, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For recombinant CofJ and N24-CofJ proteins, the E. coli expression strain SHuffle T7 Express LysY (New England Biolabs) was used for overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purification was carried out using standard techniques with affinity, ion-exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fab fragment of the anti-CofJ IgG antibody purified from rabbit serum and digested by papain was used for adherence inhibition assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For evaluating the recovery rate, bacterial adherence assays were performed using Caco-2 cells with E. coli strains cof+, cofB, and cofJ grown on CFA agar (28) for efficient CFA/III expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each strain, CFA/III formation was checked by TEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analyses were conducted using the strains cof+, cofA, cofB, cofD, and cofJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CofJ in the culture supernatant was detected by using anti-CofJ IgG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pull-down assay and ITC experiments were conducted using recombinant proteins, synthetic peptides, and GalNAc to analyze their potential interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CofJ was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method and the structure was determined by the SAD technique using the dysprosium heavy atom derivative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CofB in complex with CofJ (124) peptide was cocrystallized by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using the previously reported CofB structure (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the stoichiometry of the CofJCofB complex, sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation techniques were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
