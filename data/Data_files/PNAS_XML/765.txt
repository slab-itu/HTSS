Stem cell-released oncolytic herpes simplex virus has therapeutic efficacy in brain metastatic melanomas  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study provides an insight into stem cell-based oncolytic virus therapies for advanced melanoma tumors that have metastasized into the brain by developing clinically relevant mouse tumor models and testing the fate and efficacy of oncolytic herpes simplex virus-armed mesenchymal stem cells in such models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study therefore overcomes the hurdles of systemic delivery of oncolytic viruses and provides a clinically applicable therapeutic platform to target melanoma brain metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recent Food and Drug Administration approval of immunogenic oncolytic virus (OV) has opened a new era in the treatment of advanced melanoma; however, approximately 50% of patients with melanoma develop brain metastasis, and currently there are no beneficial treatment options for such patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To model the progression of metastases seen in patients and to overcome the hurdles of systemic delivery of OV, we developed melanoma brain metastasis models in immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice, and tested the fate and efficacy of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV)-armed mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using brain-seeking patient-derived melanoma cells and real-time in vivo imaging, we show a widespread distribution of micrometastases and macrometastases in the brain, recapitulating the progression of multifoci metastases seen in patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We armed MSCs with different oHSV variants (MSC-oHSV) and found that intracarotid administration of MSC-oHSV, but not of purified oHSV alone, effectively tracks metastatic tumor lesions and significantly prolongs the survival of brain tumor-bearing mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a syngeneic model of melanoma brain metastasis, a combination of MSC-oHSV and PD-L1 blockade increases IFN-producing CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes and results in a profound extension of the median survival of treated animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study thus demonstrates the utility of MSCs as OV carriers to disseminated brain lesions, and provides a clinically applicable therapeutic platform to target melanoma brain metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A_Panel_of_Human_Melanoma_Lines_Respond_to_oHSV  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering both malignancy and mutational status (23), we chose both established malignant human melanoma lines (SK-Mel-2, SK-Mel-28, MALME-3M, and MeWo) and patient-derived brain metastatic melanoma lines (TXM-13, M12, and M15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the efficacy of the G47-based recombinant oHSV in which cDNA encoding the mCherry fluorescent protein is placed under the IE4/5 immediate-early promoter of HSV (oHSV-mCh) on these lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-multiplicity of infection (MOI) oHSV-mCh infection led to rapid production and spread of oHSV in tumor cells over time (Fig 1 A and B), which resulted in robust dose-dependent cell killing (Fig 1C) in all tested cell lines but had no significant effect on the viability of normal nonproliferating human astrocyte cultures (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, we tested the efficacy of promising clinically approved therapeutic agents for advanced melanoma patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell viability assays revealed minor effects of BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 in BRAF mutant (SK-Mel-28, MALME-3M, and M12) melanoma lines and no effects in BRAF WT (SK-Mel-2, MeWo, TXM-13, and M15) lines (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) and low-dose cisplatin showed marginal effects on melanoma cell viability (SI Appendix, Fig S2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate the unique ability of oHSV to target a broad spectrum of malignant melanoma lines with a robust cell-killing effect regardless of their BRAF mutational status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Development_and_Characterization_of_Melanoma_Brain_Metastasis_Mouse_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To establish in vivo melanoma brain metastasis mouse models that recapitulate the steps of metastatic progression seen in patients, we chose two human melanoma lines, MeWo (BRAF WT, pigmented), which was isolated from lymph nodes of a patient with advanced melanoma, and M12 (BRAF mutant, nonpigmented), which was directly isolated from a melanoma brain metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both cell lines were engineered to express a bimodal firefly luciferase (Fluc)-mCherry (FmC) protein (SI Appendix, Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mimic the critical steps of metastatic colonization and blood vessel interactions, MeWo-FmC and M12-FmC were injected via the ICA into immunocompromised mice (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noninvasive bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of tumor-bearing mice revealed brain metastasis and exponential growth of metastatic tumors in the brain at 23 wk post-ICA injection of tumor cells (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pigmented metastatic foci were seen in the brains bearing MeWo-FmC tumors (Fig 2D), whereas no pathological changes were apparent in the brains bearing M12-FmC tumors (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at a cellular level, fluorescent images confirmed the presence of mCherry-positive (mCh+) tumor cells within macrometastatic foci in both models (Fig 2 E and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further immunohistochemistry analysis of brain sections from tumor-bearing mice demonstrated that metastatic melanoma cells (mCh+) were proliferative (Ki67+) and associated with reactive astrocytes (GFAP+) (MeWo-FmC, Fig 2 F and G; M12-FmC, Fig 2 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coronal brain sections from mice bearing M12-FmC brain metastases at different time points after tumor cell injection showed that tumor cells distributed across all representative sections and the number and size of metastases increased over time, consistent with increased bioluminescence (Fig 2L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative assessment of mCherry fluorescence on brain sections along the anteroposterior axis at 14, 21, and 28 d postM12-FmC cell implantation revealed distinct tumor foci that were detectable as early as 14 d, along with widespread distribution of micrometastases and macrometastases in the later stages of metastatic progression (days 21 and 28; Fig 2M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that ICA injection of patient-derived malignant melanoma cells generates clinically relevant mouse models that resemble the development of multifoci melanoma brain metastases observed in the clinic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MSCs_Act_as_Cellular_Vehicles_for_oHSV_Delivery  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the survival and viral spread of human MSCs freshly loaded with oHSV-mCh (MSC-oHSV-mCh) in vitro, MSCs were infected with oHSV-mCh at different MOI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased expression of mCherry within MSCs over time indicated efficient spread and amplification of oHSV-mCh (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell viability assays of MSCs loaded with oHSV at different MOI showed that 90% of MSC-oHSV survived at least 4 d postinfection with an MOI of 0.2 or 0.5, and  greater than 60% MSC-oHSV survived with an MOI of 1 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In parallel, we tested whether human MSCs had any influence on the growth of melanoma cells in culture and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first engineered MeWo cells to express GFP (MeWo-GFP) and combined GFP and Fluc markers (MeWo-GFP-Fluc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluc bioluminescent imaging revealed that MSC cocultured with MeWo-GFP-Fluc cells or ICA-injected into mice bearing MeWo-GFP-Fluc tumors did not result in any changes in tumor cell growth in vitro or in vivo (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further assess the oncolytic activity of MSC-released oHSV-mCh on melanoma cells, we cocultured MeWo-GFP cells with MSC-oHSV-mCh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dual fluorescent imaging revealed the release of oHSV-mCh from MSCs (representative as red cell population), which resulted in the infection of adjacent MeWo-GFP cells and spread of oHSV-mCh among melanoma cells (representative as yellow cell population), leading to extensive oncolysis and a significant decrease in tumor cell number (green cell population) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To visualize the activity and dynamics of oHSV delivered by MSCs in vivo, we used an oHSV bearing Fluc (oHSV-Fluc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSCs freshly infected with oHSV-Fluc (MSC-oHSV-Fluc) were injected either via the ICA or i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  into brain tumor-bearing mice and naive mice (nontumor-bearing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An in vivo Fluc BLI signal indicating viral infection was detected as early as day 1 after MSC-oHSV-Fluc injection via the ICA, with a significant increase at day 5 in the brain tumor-bearing mice compared with the naive mice (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fluc signals were detected exclusively in the brains of tumor-bearing mice, indicating that the majority of MSC-oHSV-Fluc cells home to tumor lesions in the brain upon ICA administration (SI Appendix, Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no Fluc BLI signal intensity was seen in the brain when MSC-oHSV-Fluc cells were injected i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  into mice bearing MeWo-Rluc tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, significant Fluc BLI intensity was seen in the lung, indicating that the vast majority of i.v.-injected cells were trapped in the lung (SI Appendix, Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further confirm the presence of oHSV within brain tumor lesions at cellular resolution after ICA injection, mice bearing MeWo-GFP tumors were ICA-injected with MSC-oHSV-mCh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multicolor fluorescence imaging of serial brain sections from mice killed at different time points showed a rapid spread of oHSV-mCh emanating from a small population of MSC-oHSV-mCh cells within tumor deposits in the brain, with concomitant shrinkage of MeWo-GFP tumor areas within 120 h (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ICA injection of purified oHSV-mCh did not result in detectable mCherry fluorescence in melanoma-bearing mice, with no effects on GFP+ tumor areas (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the fluorescent imaging results revealed a continuous increase in the oHSV-mCh-infected cell population in the brains of tumor-bearing mice with ICA-injected MSC-oHSV-mCh (Fig 3E) and a concurrent decrease in the GFP+ tumor cell population (Fig 3F), a stark contrast to the observations with purified oHSV-mCh administration via the ICA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
X-gal staining on brain sections from mice bearing tumors injected with MSC-oHSV-mCh via the ICA revealed a time-dependent increase specifically in the oHSV reporter lacZ-positive pigmented tumors cells (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar homing of MSC-oHSV-mCh was observed in mice bearing M12-GFP-Fluc tumor deposits in the brain (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data further confirm the transfer of oHSV from MSCs to tumor cells and the subsequent infection of tumor cells while leaving the normal brain cells behind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that intra-arterially administrated MSC-oHSV, but not purified oHSV, track and eliminate melanoma tumor cells in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MSC-oHSV_has_Therapeutic_Efficacy_in_Both_BRAF_WT_and_Mutant_Mouse_Models_of_Melanoma_Brain_Metastasis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next sought to determine the therapeutic potential of MSC-oHSV in mouse models of melanoma brain metastasis (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BLI imaging revealed a significant remission of metastatic tumor burden in the brains of MeWo-FmC-bearing mice treated with MSC-oHSV compared with continuous tumor growth by treatment with uninfected MSCs (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was further confirmed by a significant decrease in the number of pigmented lesions in the brains of the MSC-oHSVtreated group compared with controls (Fig 4D), resulting in a significant survival benefit in treated mice (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar studies were performed in mice bearing M12-FmC tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with MSC-oHSV significantly inhibited metastatic tumor growth in the brains of M12-FmCbearing mice compared with controls (Fig 4 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was further confirmed by a significant decrease in the number of Ki67+ proliferative tumor cells in the brain lesions of the MSC-oHSVtreated group compared with controls (Fig 4H), resulting in prolonged survival of MSC-oHSVtreated mice bearing M12-FmC brain tumors (Fig 4I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that intra-arterially administrated MSCs serve as robust cellular vehicles for delivering therapeutic oHSV to target and eliminate multiple metastatic deposits in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_the_Syngeneic_Melanoma_Brain_Metastasis_Mouse_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although direct antitumor properties were originally considered the main mechanism of OVs, an increasing body of evidence suggests that the host immune response may be critical to the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be mediated via innate immune effectors or via antiviral or antitumor adaptive cellular immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the use of an immunocompetent melanoma model to study the efficacy of MSC-oHSV is critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that MSC-oHSV will synergize with immune checkpoint blockers, such as those that target the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-oHSV in combination with antiPD-L1 immunotherapy, we successfully developed a syngeneic mouse model of melanoma brain metastasis by ICA injection of YUMM1.1 cells derived from an induced tumor in congenic C57BL/6 Tyr::CreER/BrafV600E/wtCdkn2A/Pten/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The YUMM1.1 cells were engineered to express GFP-Fluc (Y1.1-GFl; SI Appendix, Fig S8A) and were ICA-injected in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BLI on tumor-bearing mice revealed exclusive tumor growth in the brain (SI Appendix, Fig S8 B and C) and the exponential growth of metastatic tumor in the brain at 3 wk after Y1.1-GFl implantation (Fig 5 A and B), eventually resulting in mouse mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro immunocytochemistry analysis showed that YUMM1.1 cells express both S100, the melanoma biomarker protein, and PD-L1 (SI Appendix, Fig S9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, H&E staining showed the presence of multiple metastatic foci in mice brains (Fig 5 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemical analysis of brain sections from melanoma brain metastasis revealed an association of reactive astrocytes (GFAP+) with metastatic tumor cells, suggesting an inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, S100 staining marked melanoma tumor cells, and diffuse PD-L1 and frequent Ki67-positive staining specifically seen in tumor lesions indicated that the metastatic melanoma cells are immunosuppressive and actively proliferative within the brain (Fig 5 FK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the syngeneic mouse model of melanoma brain metastasis is an ideal platform for studying the interaction between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment, especially the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MSC-oHSV_and_AntiPD-L1_Have_Combined_Therapeutic_Efficacy_in_a_Syngeneic_Melanoma_Brain_Metastasis_Mouse_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the sensitivity of YUMM1.1 cells to oHSV infection in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oHSV infection greatly decreased YUMM1.1 cell viability, which was associated with the production of oHSV over time (SI Appendix, Fig S9 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coculture of YUMM1.1 and mouse MSCs freshly loaded with oHSV (mMSC-oHSV) resulted in a significant decrease in YUMM1.1 cell viability (SI Appendix, Fig S9D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the therapeutic efficacy of mMSC-oHSV in combination with antiPD-L1 antibody (PD-L1) administration, mice bearing melanoma brain metastases were divided into four groups: control (untreated), treated with PD-L1 (i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection), mMSC-oHSV (ICA injection), and mMSC-oHSV + PD-L1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant survival benefit was achieved by both PD-L1 and mMSC-oHSV monotherapy; however, the combined therapy of mMSC-oHSV + PD-L1 provided much greater survival extension than either monotherapy (Fig 5L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, we also tested the efficacy of BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 on the survival of tumor-bearing mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results revealed that PLX4720 slightly prolonged mice survival; however, the tumor growth eventually led to mortality (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometry analysis of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes demonstrated a greatly increased CD8+ fraction in the group of mice treated with mMSC-oHSV + PD-L1 compared with the untreated control group (Fig 5M and SI Appendix, Fig S11), whereas no significant changes in the CD4+ TIL subset were seen among the four groups (Fig 5N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the CD8+ cell population, more IFN-producing CD8+ cells were found within the brain of mice treated with mMSC-oHSV + PD-L1 compared with those of the untreated control group (Fig 5O), suggesting that infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ TIL may play a role in eradicating metastatic tumor cells in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strongly suggest that PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade significantly improves the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-based oncolytic virotherapy in melanoma brain metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we show that oHSV has a potent cell-killing effect in a broad spectrum of malignant melanoma lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the therapeutic efficacy of oHSV in melanoma brain metastasis, we created in vivo imageable mouse models of melanoma brain metastasis in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that ICA-delivered MSC-oHSV, but not purified oHSV, efficiently track metastatic tumor deposits in the brain, suppress brain tumor growth, and prolong survival in mouse models of melanoma brain metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that the combination therapy of MSC-oHSV and antiPD-L1 has improved therapeutic efficacy in syngeneic mouse model of melanoma brain metastasis, which is associated with an increased CD8+IFN+ TIL population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Melanomas are molecularly heterogeneous tumors bearing different mutations and are resistant to a number of currently used chemotherapies (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we screened a panel of seven melanoma cell lines consisting of both established and patient-derived brain metastatic melanoma lines for their responses to oHSV infection and oncolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal that oHSV infection has a consistent cell-killing effect on melanoma lines regardless of their BRAF mutational status, thus strongly supporting the use of oHSV for treating melanoma brain metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our screening results also demonstrated that the yields of oHSV in melanoma lines correlate with the efficiency of oHSV-mediated cell killing, suggesting that virus replication underlies the direct oncolytic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the oHSV yield in the patient-derived brain metastatic melanoma cell line M15 was relatively lower than that in the other melanoma lines, which correlated with less cell death in M15 cells treated with oHSV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with MeWo, M12, and MSCs, M15 melanoma cells have decreased expression of Nectin-1 receptor, a major cell surface receptor for HSV entry (SI Appendix, Fig S12), which may contribute to less permissive entry of oHSV into M15 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data show that oHSV achieves better infection and spread in M15 cells at higher MOI (SI Appendix, Fig S13 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our previous findings that the efficacy of oHSV-mediated cell killing can be significantly increased using a proapoptotic variant of oHSV, oHSV-TRAIL, in tumor lines that are less permissive to oHSV-mediated oncolysis (27), our future studies will focus on testing the efficacy of oHSV-TRAIL in such melanoma lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the therapeutic effects of oHSV in melanoma brain metastasis, we developed and extensively characterized in vivo imageable mouse models of melanoma brain metastasis that display the various features of brain metastasis observed in patients with advanced melanoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melanoma brain metastasis originates either directly from primary melanoma lesions or from metastatic lymph nodes and visceral lesions (13); therefore, we chose MeWo (derived from the metastatic lymph nodes in advanced melanoma) and M12 (derived from melanoma brain metastases) to mimic these two types of metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two melanoma lines are either BRAF WT or mutant (BRAFV600E), the most frequent BRAF mutation seen in melanoma patients (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that ICA injection of such lines results in the formation of clinically relevant mouse models that resemble the diverse features of metastatic melanoma, including widely disseminated numerous foci in the brain, aggressive and fatal growth, different mutational status of BRAF, and pigmented and nonpigmented lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mouse models provide a unique and valuable platform for testing existing and novel therapeutic approaches for melanoma brain metastasis and help us better understand the pathogenesis of melanoma brain metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies typically used either intratumoral injection of oHSV into solid tumor lesions or systemic injection of high-dose oHSV (19, 29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the multiple metastatic melanoma lesions in the brain, intratumoral injection into each single lesion is not a feasible approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systemic delivery of high-dose viruses carries a risk of virus-related toxicity (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICA delivery of oHSV has been explored previously in multiple glioblastoma and breast cancer brain metastasis models (32, 33); however, its efficiency is largely impeded by either antiviral activity present in plasma or undamaged BBB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our studies have shown that ICA injection of purified oHSV (2 × 106 pfu) is unable to access multiple metastatic lesions in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this limitation, we developed a strategy that uses MSCs as cellular carriers to shield oHSV from neutralization and achieve onsite delivery of oHSV to multiple tumor deposits in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stem cells, such as MSCs, are promising cell carriers for various antitumor viruses mainly because they can home to tumor deposits in the brain (3437), can be easily isolated from patients and grown in culture, and have high metabolic activity, which is important for virus production (20, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, MSCs are less immunogenic (39) and have been used in various clinical trials for different indications (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, MSCs also have been used as virus carriers in a phase 1 clinical trial in ovarian cancer patients (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using oHSV mutants bearing diagnostic proteins combined with bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging, our experiments reveal that MSCs act as oHSV carriers and track metastatic tumor deposits in the brain, ultimately releasing the oHSV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vivo imaging data suggest that after ICA injection of MSC-oHSV-Fluc, virus replication initially occurs within infected MSCs, which releases oHSV-Fluc upon cell lysis, transfers oHSV to adjacent tumor cells, and results in subsequent virus replication in tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the accessibilities of MSC-oHSV and purified oHSV to metastatic tumor lesions in the brain reveals that MSC-oHSV has superior tumor-tracking capability and results in a significant reduction in tumor foci and a survival advantage in mice bearing melanoma brain metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, ICA injection of MSC-oHSV was safe, and we did not observe any acute systemic toxicities or local adverse events, such as brain infarction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the mechanism of oHSV-mediated killing of MSCs remains unclear, our results indicate that it is not mediated via apoptosis due to the absence of cleaved PARP, a hallmark of cell apoptosis (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CNS is protected by the BBB and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which prevent most therapeutic agents from entering into the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although studies have shown increases in BBB permeability in various brain tumor models, it remains the key mitigating factor for delivering therapeutics into the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that delivery of therapeutic agents to the tumors in the brain is a major challenge, significant efforts have been made to develop efficient delivery routes to brain tumors, which include both invasive and noninvasive administration strategies (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous study, we showed that local implantation of encapsulated MSCs loaded with oHSV have therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of resected brain tumors (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have shown that i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injected MSC-oHSV have therapeutic efficacy in treating lung metastatic tumors (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies imply that i.v.-injected MSC-oHSV would be more suitable for treating both primary and metastatic tumors in the lungs as opposed to the tumors in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, exploring alternate routes of administration of MSC-oHSV to tumors in the brain was critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immune checkpoint blockade is a major advance in recent cancer therapy, especially for the treatment of metastatic melanoma (44), which is typically immunogenic, likely due to the large numbers of UV-associated mutations (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two monoclonal antibodies that block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions (pembrlizumab and nivolumab) have shown objective responses in 3040% of patients with melanoma brain metastasis (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oHSV represents a novel approach to tumor immunotherapy and is an attractive option based on its ability to preferentially target, infect, and replicate in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, oHSV viral genomes can be easily attenuated to limit host pathogenicity or engineered to express immune-potentiating genes to enhance the host antitumor immune response (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because PD-1 is activated mostly at tumor sites or other areas of active immune response, the side effects of antiPD-1/PD-L1 therapy tend to be less severe than those associated with antiCTLA-4 antibodies, which potentially affect all circulating T cells in the body and thus can cause significant, albeit manageable, autoimmune side effects (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, our results showed strong PD-L1 expression in melanoma brain metastasis in the syngeneic mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus chose to use an antiPD-L1 immune-checkpoint blocker to antagonize the immune suppression posed by metastatic melanoma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-oHSV in combination with antiPD-L1 for melanoma brain metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that CD8+IFN+ TIL population was associated with the survival benefits achieved by the combination therapy of MSC-oHSV plus antiPD-L1, suggesting that cytotoxic CD8+ TIL may play a critical role in killing metastatic melanoma cells in the brain, likely via activation of IFN-related signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Release of IFN at the tumor site could limit oHSV spread but trigger a variety of beneficial responses, such as activation of other immune cell subsets, up-regulation of MHC class I, and antiangiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transient nature of IFN secretion likely would limit the detrimental impacts of IFN-induced inflammatory reactions in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall cellular responses to the oHSV infection, coupled with the release of tumor antigens by virally infected dying tumor cells into the tumor microenvironment, attract innate and adaptive immune cells, including tumor-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This oHSV infection-mediated response makes virotherapy an ideal modality to combine with immune checkpoint blockers to achieve a more durable response and outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that the increased population of CD8+IFN+ TIL represents a beneficial antitumor immune response elicited by MSC-oHSV therapy for melanoma brain metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we have shown that intra-arterial delivery of MSC-loaded oHSV can effectively track and kill metastatic melanoma cells in the brain, and that combination therapy with an immune checkpoint blocker boosts the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-oHSV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study warrants clinical testing of MSC-oHSV alone or in combination with immune checkpoint blockers for patients with melanoma brain metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attributed to their innate tumor tropism, stem cells carrying oHSV have been shown to target tumor lesions in the lung and prevent metastases upon i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on previous findings and our present findings, stem cell-based oncolytic virotherapies could have the potential to be broadly applicable in targeting metastatic lesions in organs such as the liver, colon, and lung.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
