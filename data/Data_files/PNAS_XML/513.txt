Mechanism of the intrinsic arginine finger in heterotrimeric G proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The -subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins is a molecular switch that mediates a great number of physiological processes such as vision, smelling, and blood pressure regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A GTPase-activating protein (GAP) [e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) in the case of Gi1] regulates the off-switch by catalyzing GTP hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present the molecular reactions of GAP catalysis at atomic resolution using a combination of FTIR spectroscopy and biomolecular simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to X-ray structures, not GTP analogs but GTP itself is used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is crucial to reveal now a previously undescribed GAP mechanism for G. A key player of the hydrolysis reaction, called the arginine finger, is pushed from a monodentate -GTP coordination toward a bidentate --GTP coordination by RGS4, and thereby catalyzes GTP-hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Heterotrimeric G proteins are crucial molecular switches that maintain a large number of physiological processes in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal is encoded into surface alterations of the G subunit that carries GTP in its active state and GDP in its inactive state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of the G subunit to hydrolyze GTP is essential for signal termination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins accelerates this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key player in this catalyzed reaction is an arginine residue, Arg178 in Gi1, which is already an intrinsic part of the catalytic center in G in contrast to small GTPases, at which the corresponding GTPase-activating protein (GAP) provides the arginine finger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy in combination with isotopic labeling and site-directed mutagenesis to reveal the molecular mechanism, especially of the role of Arg178 in the intrinsic Gi1 mechanism and the RGS4-catalyzed mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complementary biomolecular simulations (molecular mechanics with molecular dynamics and coupled quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings show that Arg178 is bound to -GTP for the intrinsic Gi1 mechanism and pushed toward a bidentate --GTP coordination for the Gi1·RGS4 mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This movement induces a charge shift toward -GTP, increases the planarity of -GTP, and thereby catalyzes the hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Position of the intrinsic arginine finger in crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the active GTPS-bound state (PDB ID code 1GIA), Arg178 is oriented away from the substrate toward a glutamate (Glu43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the aluminium-tetrafluoride (AlF4)-stabilized intermediate (PDB ID code 1GFI), Arg178 points toward the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the inactive GDP state (PDB ID code 1GP2), Arg178 is again flipped away from the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy monitors reactions label-free at atomic resolution and provides both rate constants and structural information that are coded into IR spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT or mutant Gi1 was loaded with pHPcgGTP, a photolabile GTP derivate that binds to Gi1 but is not hydrolyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FTIR measurements were triggered by a laser flash that removes the pHP-caged group, resulting in the natural substrate GTP (result a0 of global fit as detailed in Materials and Methods, termed photolysis in the following) that is subsequently hydrolyzed by Gi1 (result a1 of global fit, termed hydrolysis in the following).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the photolysis and the hydrolysis reaction were monitored by time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained data were evaluated using a global fit (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) with one exponential function for Gi1-WT [rate constant k = 0.02 s1 at 15 °C (10)] or two exponential functions when intermediate formation occurred (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RGS4-catalyzed measurements were also evaluated using one exponential function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All resulting t1/2 values and their SEs are depicted in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectral information is coded into a photolysis spectrum (negative bands correspond to the caged GTP state, and positive bands correspond to the GTP state) and a hydrolysis spectrum (negative bands correspond to the GTP state, and positive bands correspond to the GDP + Pi state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several Gi1 mutants showed an intermediate during the hydrolysis reaction, and were therefore evaluated with an additional reaction rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of working label- and analog-free can be demonstrated when performing FTIR measurements using N-methylanthraniloyl (MANT)-GTP instead of natural GTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using MANT-GTP slows down hydrolysis kinetics by one order of magnitude and significantly alters, due to distortion of the catalytic center, the GTP and protein bands (SI Appendix, Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Arg178_Is_Bound_to_-GTP_in_the_Active_State_of_Gi1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FTIR measurements of Gi1-WT and Gi1-R178S are depicted in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently assigned the bands for -GTP, -GTP, and -GTP (1,243 cm1, 1,224 cm1, and 1,156 cm1, respectively); -GDP and -GDP (1,214 cm1 and 1,134/1,103 cm1, respectively); and free phosphate (1,078/991 cm1) for Gi1-WT (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, in this study, the -GTP vibration of the mutant Gi1-R178S appeared blue-shifted from 1,156 cm1 to 1,165 cm1 (Fig 2), indicating changes in the direct environment of the -phosphate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the exchange of Arg178 to Ser178 was the only difference between the measurements, we hereby conclude that Arg178 forms a hydrogen bond to -GTP in the active state of Gi1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of the band shift is in agreement with the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar blue shift caused by removing a single hydrogen bond was recently described for the small GTPase Ran (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutation Ran-Y32A caused a -GTP shift of 12 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Gi1-R178S, the band shift was observable in both the photolysis spectrum and the hydrolysis spectrum for measurements in H2O and measurements in D2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vibrations of -GTP and -GTP remained unaltered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that the Gi1-R178S mutation had no effect on -GTP, we applied isotopic labeling using 18O2-pHPcgGTP in Gi1-R178S and assigned the band at 1,243 cm1 clearly to -GTP, similar to Gi1-WT (SI Appendix, Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vibration of -GDP appeared slightly red-shifted from 1,214 cm1 (Gi1-WT) to 1,208 cm1 (Gi1-R178S).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of the intrinsic arginine finger slowed down the reaction by almost two orders of magnitude as we previously reported (10), and is comparable to the Gi1-Q204A mutation (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetics of the cleaved phosphate product bands are depicted in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Several_Gi1_Mutants_Exhibit_Intermediate_Formation_During_Hydrolysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mutation of the intrinsic arginine finger caused a rate separation during hydrolysis, showing an intermediate that preceded hydrolysis with spectral features at 1,280 cm1 and 1,230 cm1 (Fig 2A, cyan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This intermediate was observable for various point mutations in Gi1 (Gi1-E43Q, Gi1-K180P, Gi1-D150N, Gi1-E236Q/D237Q, Gi1-D229N, Gi1-W211A, and Gi1-E245Q) and is not an exclusive feature of the arginine mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The t1/2 values of both rates are depicted in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied isotopic labeling of the Gi1-E43Q mutant using -18O2-pHPcgGTP and -18O3-pHPcgGTP and found the band at 1,230 cm1 to be caused by both -GTP and -GTP (SI Appendix, Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RGS4_Addition_Accelerates_GTP_Hydrolysis_in_Gi1_by_Two_Orders_of_Magnitude  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to intrinsic FTIR measurements of Gi1, we performed measurements with its GAP RGS4 in a 1:1 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like in intrinsic Gi1-WT measurements, no intermediate formation was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RGS4 addition accelerated the t1/2 value of the GTPase reaction in Gi1 by almost two orders of magnitude from 68.2 ± 5.1 s (5 °C) to 1.4 ± 0.3 s (5 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetics of the cleaved phosphate product bands are depicted in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RGS4_Pushes_Arg178_Toward_a_Bidentate_--GTP_Coordination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The addition of RGS4 not only accelerated hydrolysis kinetics by two orders of magnitude but also changed the GTP and GDP vibrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most prominent change was a band at 1,184 cm1 that appeared in the photolysis and disappeared in the hydrolysis (Fig 3, red) (Complete photolysis and hydrolysis spectra from 1,800 cm1 to 950 cm1 are depicted in SI Appendix, Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied isotopic labeling using -18O2-pHPcgGTP (SI Appendix, Fig 6) and -18O3-pHPcgGTP (SI Appendix, Fig 7), and could thereby determine that the -GTP vibration caused the band at 1,182/1,184 cm1 for RGS4-catalyzed Gi1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this effect was completely reversible when the intrinsic arginine finger was missing due to the R178S mutation (Fig 3, cyan), so we can conclude that RGS4 induces a conformational change of Arg178 in such a way that it binds to -GTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Arg178 is simultaneously bound to -GTP, because for Gi1-R178S·RGS4, it was seen that in both the photolysis and hydrolysis spectra, the -GTP vibration was shifted from 1,156 cm1 to 1,165 cm1 (Fig 3, cyan), like in intrinsic Gi1 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of the RGS4-induced -GTP shift indicates that RGS4 binding changes more than the -GTP environment (e.g., induces structural changes like torsions or bond lengths and a different charge distribution).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -GDP vibration was also shifted from 1,214 cm1 to 1,219 cm1 in RGS4-catalyzed measurements, which was again reversible when Arg178 was missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Gi1-R178S·RGS4, no intermediate formation was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude a temperature artifact, we also repeated these measurements at 5 °C and observed no spectral changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our measurements demonstrated that the intrinsic arginine finger is bound to -GTP for intrinsic Gi1 and bound bidentately to -GTP and -GTP for Gi1·RGS4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RGS4_Stabilizes_Switch_I_in_MD_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed MD simulations of intrinsic and RGS4-bound Gi1 in the GDP- and GTP-bound states to gain a structural interpretation of the IR measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RGS4 does not contribute amino acids to the binding pocket of Gi1 like, for example, RasGAP; rather, it stabilizes the switch regions of Gi1 in a conformation that is probably favorable for GTP hydrolysis (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could confirm the proposed mechanism in our simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on switch I, because it contains the intrinsic arginine finger, and found this region to be stabilized by RGS4 in both the GDP and GTP states within a simulation time of 100 ns (Fig 4 A and B), probably in a conformation that is favorable for hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, intrinsic GTP-bound Gi1 showed lower rmsd values than GDP bound Gi1, which is consistent with the observation of increased thermostability of GTP-bound G subunits in previous studies (2, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MD_Simulations_Confirm_Monodentate_(Intrinsic)_and_Bidentate_(RGS4-Catalyzed)_Coordination_of_Arg178  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to rmsd calculations, we performed contact matrix analysis of the production runs with a focus on the interaction between Arg178 and the individual phosphate groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For intrinsic Gi1, the arginine finger was bound monodentately to -GTP in three of five simulation runs (Fig 4C), but the coordination to -GTP (Fig 4C, run 2) and even a bidentate coordination to -GTP and -GTP were also sampled (Fig 4C, run 5) in replica runs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations showed large conformational dynamics of Arg178, with the monodentate coordination at -GTP being the preferred interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is notable that in all starting structures, the arginine pointed in the opposite direction, forming a stacked -interaction to Glu43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This coordination was always disrupted, and Arg178 flipped down to the substrate in all simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also repeated the simulations starting from intrinsic Gi1·AlF4·GDP [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1GFI, with GDP·AlF4 replaced by GDP or GTP], where the arginine is already oriented toward the substrate to exclude starting structure artifacts, and found similar behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With RGS4 bound to Gi1 (PDB ID code 1AGR), the intrinsic arginine finger was always bound bidentately to -GTP and -GTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The terminal -NH2 groups of the side chain were tightly bound to the oxygen atoms of the - and -phosphate groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction was never interrupted in all five production runs (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IR_Band_Assignment_of_Gi1-Arg178  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Band assignments were performed using -15N2 isotopically labeled arginine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein expression was performed in M9 minimal medium (28) with unlabeled arginine replaced by -15N2 arginine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purity and labeling efficiency of recombinant proteins were checked via SDS/PAGE and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS (minimum 92% labeling efficiency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotopic labeling results in a red shift of arginine side-chain vibrations due to the increased reduced masses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because isotopic labeling of arginine amino acids affects all arginine side chains of Gi1, we also performed measurements of the mutant Gi1-R178S to ensure a site-specific assignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In H2O, no isotopic shift could be determined because the (CN3H5+) vibration at 1,6301,680 cm1 (29) is superimposed by absorptions of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exchanged the solvent to D2O and observed isotopic shifts exclusively in the area between 1,580 cm1 and 1,610 cm1 that is described in the literature for the symmetrical and asymmetrical arginine side-chain vibrations (29) in the hydrolysis spectrum (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The band at 1,604 cm1 that belongs to the GDP state is shifted to 1,600 cm1, and the band at 1,590 cm1 that belongs to the GDP state is shifted to 1,585 cm1 (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These band shifts could not be observed in the photolysis spectrum, probably indicating that Arg178 is in the Gi1 caged GTP state in a similar position as in the Gi1 GTP state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure a site-specific assignment, we also measured the mutant Gi1-R178S (Fig 5A, orange) and observed that the corresponding bands at 1,604 cm1 and 1,590 cm1 were missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional changes at 1,553 cm1 (negative, Amide II) and around 1,450 cm1 (positive, Amide II*) are caused by deuterium exchange that follows the hydrolysis (increased flexibility of switch regions in the GDP state) and is more pronounced for Gi1-R178S because of the slowed-down hydrolysis (two orders of magnitude).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the IR bands for Arg178 were assigned to 1,604 cm1 (Gi1·GTP) and 1,590 cm1 (Gi1·GDP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete hydrolysis spectra of unlabeled and labeled Gi1-WT and the Gi1-R178S mutants are depicted in SI Appendix, Fig 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IR_Band_Assignment_of_Arg178_in_Gi1-K180P  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After the successful band assignment of Arg178 in Gi1-WT, we were also interested in which step the arginine finger takes action in rate-separated mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we performed measurements with -15N2 arginine-labeled Gi1-K180P (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bands at 1,230 cm1 and 1,280 cm1 that appeared in the first rate in H2O were shifted to 1,238 cm1 and 1,275 cm1 in D2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotopic labeling of the first rate showed no band shifts [Fig 5C, double-difference () rate 1], whereas the second rate showed that the same bands at 1,604 cm1 and 1,590 cm1 were shifted to 1,600 cm1 and 1,587 cm1 like in WT Gi1 (Fig 5C,  rate 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence the arginine finger remains bound to GTP in the first rate and changes its conformation exclusively in the second rate of rate-separated Gi1 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The t1/2 values of the rates were t1/2 1 = 69 ± 26 s and t1/2 2 = 537 ± 58 s at 15 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete hydrolysis spectra of unlabeled and labeled Gi1-K180P are depicted in SI Appendix, Fig 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IR_Bands_of_Gi1-Arg178_Differ_from_the_Bands_of_the_Arginine_Finger_in_Ras·RasGAP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The arginine finger mechanism is conserved among many small GTPases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the RasGAP neurofibromin 1 (NF1), the band assignment of Arg1276 was already performed (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A band at 1,589 cm1 was assigned to arginine in a deuterated water environment, and a band at 1,571 cm1 was assigned to arginine within the binding pocket of Ras·GAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was not possible to observe the transient state, where Arg1276 is coupled to GTP, because bond breakage is faster than the movement of Arg1276 into the binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gi1 is equipped with an intrinsic arginine finger, and we could observe here the arginine finger coupled to GTP (SI Appendix, Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IR_Bands_of_the_Arginine_Finger_in_Gi1·RGS4_Differ_from_Intrinsic_Gi1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After the observation that Arg178 is coupled bidentately to -GTP and -GTP upon RGS binding, we examined whether the vibration of Arg178 in Gi1·RGS4 also differs from intrinsic Gi1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we performed FTIR measurements with -15N2 arginine-labeled Gi1 in a 1:1 complex with RGS4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the bands of Arg178 were no longer found at 1,604 cm1 and 1,590 cm1 as assigned for intrinsic Gi1 (SI Appendix, Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotopic labeling revealed that for both the GTP and GDP states, two bands could be assigned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the GTP state, bands at 1,601 cm1 and 1,583 cm1 were shifted to 1,596 cm1 and 1,580 cm1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the GDP state, bands at 1,613 cm1 and 1,593 cm1 were shifted to 1,610 cm1 and 1,590 cm1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in arginine vibrations supports the monodentate vs. bidentate binding mode we proposed for intrinsic and RGS4-catalyzed Gi1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed measurements of the complex Gi1-R178S·RGS4 in D2O to assign the site-directed arginine bands; however, in this case, the mutant is too invasive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting photolysis and hydrolysis difference spectra differed significantly from Gi1·RGS4, disallowing specific assignments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrolysis spectrum of Gi1-R178S·RGS4 matched the hydrolysis spectrum of intrinsic Gi1 with missing bands at 1,604 cm1 and 1,590 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spectra_from_QM_MM_Simulations_Reproduce_FTIR_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To decode the spectral data further, we performed coupled QM/MM simulations and calculated theoretical IR spectra of the individual phosphate groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated an ensemble of 15 snapshots of a 100-ns MD trajectory (details are provided in Materials and Methods) with the functionals B3LYP, M06, and PBE with the basis set 6-31G*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry of the binding pocket, including the intrinsic arginine finger, is depicted in Fig 6A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown via MD simulations and experiments, Arg178 is coupled to -GTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean values and SDs of each of 15 QM/MM simulations for the functional M06 are depicted in Fig 6E and compared with peak maxima and full width at half-maximum values of the experiment (FTIR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional M06/6-31G* exactly reproduces experimental peaks and band widths for AS P-O2, AS P-O2, and AS P-O3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculated IR vibrations of B3LYP/6-31G* and PBE/6-31G* showed slightly decreased absolute wavenumbers, but with comparable spacing and SDs, indicating the calculated geometry matches the experimental situation (SI Appendix, Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bidentate_Coupling_of_Arg178_Causes_Eclipsed_(--)-GTP_Conformation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the experiments predicted only a bidentate coupling of Arg178 to -GTP and -GTP, we calculated different starting positions of Arg178, with N oriented away from -GTP (PDB ID code 1AGR) (Fig 6B) and N oriented toward -GTP (Fig 6C), as suggested by 19F NMR of Rho-GAP (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both conformations caused significant shifts of the individual GTP vibrations (Fig 6E), but only the latter conformation formed -- eclipsed GTP (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eclipsed --oxygens in this geometry were proposed to stretch the bridging P-O-P bonds, and thereby catalyze GTP hydrolysis (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental band assignments for the Gi1RGS4 complex were already performed, showing a slight RGS4-induced blue shift (+6 cm1) for -GTP (SI Appendix, Fig 7) and a large red shift of -GTP of 59 cm1, resulting in a shift of the -GTP vibration between the -GTP and -GTP vibrations (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior was not reproduced in calculations with the N group of Arg178 turned away from -GTP (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the -GTP band was shifted to the opposite direction than in the experiments and the -GTP band showed higher wavenumbers than the -GTP band (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only with the N group of Arg178 pointing toward -GTP (Fig 6C) could the experimental behavior be reproduced with a small blue shift of -GTP and a large red shift of -GTP below the -GTP frequency (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the experimental -GTP shift of 59 cm1 could not be reproduced quantitatively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated average -GTP shift was only 20 cm1, which still reproduced the experimental behavior qualitatively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Origin_of_the_59_cm1_-GTP_Shift  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The QM/MM calculations suggested a tight coordination of -GTP between Arg178 on one side and Thr48 on the other side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we performed FTIR measurements of intrinsic and RGS4-catalyzed Gi1-T48A and assigned the -GTP band via isotopic labeling (SI Appendix, Fig 14), resulting in an -GTP band of 1,270 cm1 for intrinsic Gi1-T48A and a red shift to 1,222 cm1 for Gi1-T48A-RGS4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This point mutation decreased the RGS4-induced -GTP shift from 59 cm1 (Gi1-WT) to 48 cm1 (Gi1-T48A), which is representative of a strong hydrogen bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrolysis kinetics of the Gi1-T48A mutant with and without RGS4 appeared slightly slowed down to t1/2 = 9.6 ± 1.6 s (5 °C), which is one order of magnitude slower than Gi1-RGS4 (t1/2 = 1.4 ± 0.3 s) and in the same range as Gi1-R178S-RGS4 (t1/2 = 12.6 ± 2.7 s) (Table 1), demonstrating that Thr48 is relevant for RGS4-catalyzed hydrolysis of Gi1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

QM_MM_Simulations_Show_Charge_Shifts_and_Structural_Rearrangements_That_Assist_GTP_Hydrolysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluated the QM/MM Gi1-GTP geometries and calculated MerzKollman partial charges [electrostatic potential fitting (ESP)] for each GTP atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Charge distribution showed that upon RGS4 binding and rearrangement of Arg178, charges are transferred from -GTP to the bridging --oxygen (Fig 7 and SI Appendix, Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bridging oxygen becomes more negative from 0.5 e (intrinsic) to 0.6 e (RGS4-catalyzed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon product formation, one net charge is transferred to the -phosphate (q-GTP = 1 e; q-GDP = 2 e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RGS4 binding already transfers 10% of this charge in QM/MM calculations of the educt state (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the terminal P-oxygen atom that binds the nucleophilic attacking water becomes more positive, which might decrease the negative -GTP barrier the attacking water has to cross upon hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the -GTP angles showed that upon RGS4 binding and Arg178 movement, the -GTP group becomes more planar (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding angle is shifted below 100°, facilitating Walden inversion of the -GTP group that is needed for a second-order kinetics nucleophilic substitution (SN2) hydrolysis mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RGS4_Pushes_Gi1-Arg178_from_a_Monodentate_to_a_Bidentate_GTP_Coordination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings are summarized in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 and 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to crystal structures, Arg178 is bound to -GTP in the active state of Gi1 in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RGS4 catalyzes GTP hydrolysis in Gi1 by pushing Arg178 from a monodentate -GTP coordination to a bidentate --GTP coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change is accompanied by increased planarity of the -GTP group (Fig 8A), charge transfer toward -GTP (Fig 8B), and formation of (--) eclipsed GTP (Fig 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we have elucidated the intrinsic and GAP-catalyzed molecular reaction of the intrinsic arginine finger of Gi1 label-free with high spatiotemporal resolution by a combination of FTIR spectroscopy and molecular simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GTP itself, and not GTP analogs as in X-ray structure analysis, was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arginine finger of heterotrimeric G proteins is hydrogen-bonded to -GTP in the active state of intrinsic Gi1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RGS4 binding causes stabilization of the switch areas, and thereby pushes the arginine finger to a bidentate --GTP coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GTP hydrolysis in GTPases (e.g., EF-G, EF-Tu, Ras, Ran, Gi1) is proposed to take place in an SN2 mechanism via in-line attack of a water molecule at -GTP, with inversion of coordination around the phosphate (3237).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the proposed aspects were directly observed by combination of FTIR spectroscopy and QM/MM calculations in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the inversion of -GTP (38) is prepared by the Gi1RGS4 complex (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The O-P-O angle is twisted from a tetrahedral geometry toward a planar geometry that is proposed to be the transition state before inversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A corresponding pentavalent planar transition state analog is resolved in a number of crystal structures with aluminum fluoride and GDP (2, 6, 39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Displacement of Arg178 in Gi1-RGS4 toward -GTP pulls the hydrogen-bonded -oxygen atom toward a more planar geometry (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, displacement of the arginine finger resulted in reorganization of the charge distribution: -GTP becomes more negative (Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While in the GTP state, the -phosphate moiety has a formal charge of 1, but its charge is increased to 2 in the GDP state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the RGS4-induced movement of the intrinsic arginine finger from a monodentate -GTP toward a bidentate --GTP coordination, which transfers a negative charge to -GTP, induces a more product-like charge distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A shift toward the charge distribution of the transition state lowers the activation barrier, and thereby catalyzes the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more dissociative the character of the transition state is, the more its charge distribution resembles the charge distribution of the product (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is in excellent agreement with previous studies (2, 42, 43) that suggest charge transfer via the arginine finger as an important mechanism of GTP hydrolysis in small GTPases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, RGS4 coupling to Gi1 twists GTP from a - eclipsed conformation to a -- eclipsed conformation (Fig 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was shown previously for the small GTPase Ras-GAP system that this mechanism creates a strain in GTP, and thereby catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bidentate substrate binding caused a red shift of the -GTP band (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of the IR shift (59 cm1) that exceeds the expected shift of an additional hydrogen bond indicated that further structural alterations and charge shifts are caused by Arg178.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude the possibility that the -GTP band is influenced by the second critical amino acid of Gi1, Gln204, we also performed FTIR measurements of the mutant Gi1-Q204A and found almost no spectral changes (SI Appendix, Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biomolecular simulations revealed that the extent of the -GTP shift is caused by eclipsed (--)-GTP and tight coordination of -GTP between Arg178 and Thr48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, Thr48 is also relevant for RGS4-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis in Gi1 because it slowed down hydrolysis by one order of magnitude (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is contrary to the small GTPase Ras, where the corresponding inverse mutation, Ras-A18T, was described to cause mild forms of cancer (44), demonstrating the GAP mechanism of small GTPases and heterotrimeric GTPases is different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presented model could not be deduced from a number of Gi1 crystal structures that were solved with sulfur- or nitrogen-substituted, nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly the position that is occupied by Arg178 in our simulations of intrinsic Gi1 is identical to the position of the OS substitution at the -phosphate in various structures (2, 4548).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sulfur substitution causes altered biochemical and biophysical properties of the -GTP group (e.g., an increased van der Waals radius), probably hindering the Arg178 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some crystal structures of G isoforms [e.g., Gi1-T329A (49)] feature a different sulfur position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By rotation around the P-O-P-O torsion angle, the terminal -GTPS group is rotated and faces the side chain of Lys46 and the backbone of Gly203.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rotation of the -GTPS group is accompanied by the binding of Arg178 to -GTP and -GTP exactly as demonstrated here for Gi1·RGS4 (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar behavior of the intrinsic arginine finger is also observable in the G isoform Gt (PDB ID code 1TND), where Arg174 is pointing toward --GTP, interestingly also with N oriented toward -GTP as suggested by our QM/MM simulations (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several crystal structures that were stabilized with GDP-AlF4 also show that Arg178 is oriented toward the nucleotide (e.g., PDB ID code 1GFI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of FTIR experiments and QM/MM simulations presented here was able to distinguish between this broad ensemble of crystal structure conformations and to choose the conformation that Arg178 adopts in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed FTIR measurements of the conservative mutant Gi1-R178K (SI Appendix, Fig 16), which showed an almost unperturbed vibration of -GTP at 1,155 cm1, probably indicating that Lys178 is also bound to -GTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the kinetics of Gi1-R178K are slowed down to the level of Gi1-R178S, demonstrating that not only the charge of the arginine but also the precise geometry that enables bidentate binding is important for hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrolysis kinetics of WT or mutant Gi1 in FTIR measurements agree with previous studies using other methods on WT Gi1 (5052), the R178S mutant (51), and the K180P mutant (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acceleration by RGS4 by approximately two orders of magnitude is reproduced, as well as the ability of RGS4 to accelerate Gi1-R178S to nearly WT kinetics (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the related isoform Gs, no RGS protein is known that can accelerate GTP hydrolysis, preventing the corresponding arginine finger mutants of Gs from regaining activity due to GAP binding; it might also explain now why mutation of the arginine finger in Gs-affected patients much more compared to Gi1 (13, 14) and might open new roads for reversing the effect of these mutations by small molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Gi1-K180P, we observed a kinetic uncoupling between the movement of switch areas and hydrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, Sprang and coworkers (53) observed conformational changes that preceded the hydrolysis reaction for this mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rate is accompanied by structural changes in switch I, and can therefore be characterized by a change in fluorescence properties (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified label-free spectral marker bands, indicating that the conformational change is accompanied by changes of -GTP (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4) and -GTP (SI Appendix, Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One might assume that this conformational change is also caused by rotation of the --GTP torsions toward -- eclipsed GTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon RGS4 addition, the monodentate vs. bidentate binding model is further supported by the assignment of individual IR bands of Arg178.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assigned band at 1,604 cm1 for intrinsic Gi1·GTP disappears when RGS4 binds Gi1 and shows an altered band pattern at 1,601 cm1 and 1,583 cm1 when Arg178 is bound to -GTP and -GTP (SI Appendix, Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arginine vibration coupled to GTP could previously not be determined because this state is not sufficiently populated in Ras·GAP hydrolysis (SI Appendix, Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion we demonstrated that the intrinsic arginine finger is bound to -GTP in the intrinsic active state of Gi1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RGS4 binding pushes the arginine finger toward a bidentate --GTP coordination, and thereby facilitates GTP hydrolysis by shifting charges toward -GTP and increased planarity of the -GTP group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect this mechanism to be conserved among heterotrimeric GTPases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The pHPcgGTP and the isotopologs -18O2-pHPcgGTP and -18O3-pHPcgGTP were synthesized as described previously (17, 26, 54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -15N2labeled arginine was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deuterium oxide was purchased from Deutero GmbH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cloning  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human Gi1 (UniProtKB P63096-1) and human RGS4 (UniProtKB P49798) were amplified as described previously (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, genes were cloned into the vector pET27bmod with N-terminal 10× His-tag and tobacco etch virus site, and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5 for amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Point mutants of Gi1 were created using overlap extension PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each construct was verified by sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The plasmid encoding Gi1 was transformed into E. coli Rosetta2(DE3) (Novagen, Merck) and incubated at 37 °C overnight on LB agar plates supplemented with 0.2% (wt/vol) glucose, 50 g/mL kanamycin, and 20 g/mL chloramphenicol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precultures were incubated overnight at 37 °C and shaking at 160 rpm in LB supplemented with the same components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmid encoding RGS4 was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Merck) under identical conditions using only kanamycin for plasmid selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Gi1 main cultures, 1.5 L of M9 medium (50 mM glucose, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM CaCl2, 49 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KH2PO4, 11.5 mM NaCl, 23 mM NH4Cl, 0.2 mM thiamine-HCl, 0.5 mM thymine, and 0.62 mM each standard amino acid) supplemented with 50 g/mL kanamycin was inoculated with the preculture and grown at 37 °C and shaking at 100 rpm to an A600 of 0.5 absorbance units (AU).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For isotopic labeling, unlabeled arginine was exchanged for -15N2 arginine in the main culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein expression was induced at 18 °C by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio--d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For RGS4, main cultures contained 18 L of LB supplemented with 50 g/mL kanamycin and 0.2% glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were incubated at 37 °C, shaking at 100 rpm, and 20 L/min1 airflow in a Biostat C20-3 Fermenter (Sartorius), induced with IPTG, and grown at 18 °C for 18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g and 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gi1 was suspended in buffer A containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 5 mM d-norleucine; RGS4 was suspended in buffer B containing 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 5 mM d-norleucine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were flash-frozen and stored at 80 °C until protein purification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Purification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Purification was performed as described (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, cells were thawed, disrupted with a microfluidizer M-110L (Microfluidics Corp.), and centrifuged for 45 min at 45,000 × g and 4 °C to remove cell fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, RGS4-containing cells were centrifuged with an additional low-speed step for 15 min at 18,000 × g and 4 °C, followed by a high-speed step for 45 min at 75,000 × g and 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were applied to a 25-mL nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow columm (Qiagen) and eluted with buffers containing 200 mM imidazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fractions containing Gi1 or RGS4 were screened via SDS/PAGE, pooled, concentrated to 5 mL using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) concentrator (Amicon Ultra-15; Merck Millipore), and applied to an Illustra HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 200-pg column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak fractions were collected and concentrated to ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20 mg/mL for Gi1 or ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 mg/mL for RGS4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent in triplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were aliquoted, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 °C until utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Control_of_Labeling_Efficiency_with_LC-MS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Efficiency of arginine -15N2 labeling was checked via LC-MS in cooperation with Claudia Lindemann (Medical Proteome Center, Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Labeling efficiency was determined for four digested peptide fragments [AVVYSNTIQSIIAIIR (92.6% labeled), EYQLNDSAAYYLNDLDR (93.0% labeled), QLFVLAGAAEEGFMTAELAGVIKR (92.6% labeled), and IAQPNYIPTQQDVLR (93.2% labeled)] and resulted in an overall label efficiency of 92.8% ± 0.3%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gi1-K180P was arginine -15N2labeled with an efficiency of 96.7 ± 0.5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Gi1-WT and Gi1-K180P showed no scattering of heavy isotopes to amino acids other than arginine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nucleotide_Exchange_to_pHPcgGTP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nucleotide exchange reactions of WT and mutant Gi1 were performed in the presence of alkaline phosphatase coupled to agarose beads (SigmaAldrich Chemie GmbH,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphatase beads were washed five times with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and 100 M ZnSO4, with each washing step followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g until the supernatant was free of phosphatase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five milligrams of WT or mutant Gi1 was supplemented with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 M ZnSO4, and a twofold molar excess of unlabeled or oxygen-labeled pHPcgGTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were incubated for 3 h and analyzed via reversed-phase HPLC (LC-2010; Shimadzu) [mobile phase: 50 mM Pi (pH 6.5), 5 mM tetrabutylammoniumbromide, 7.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile; stationary phase: ODS-Hypersil C18 column] for remaining GDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After  greater than 95% of GDP was hydrolyzed to guanosine, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min and the supernatant was rebuffered using a Nap5 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) to 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 7.5 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT at 7 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fractions containing the highest protein concentrations were pooled and concentrated using a 10,000 MWCO concentrator (Amicon Ultra-0.5; Merck Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent in triplicate, and samples were aliquoted into 107.5-g portions (5 mM final concentration in FTIR samples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nucleotide exchange rates to pHPcgGTP were again analyzed via HPLC (always  greater than 95% cgGTP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized light-protected for 3 h at 55 °C and 0.05 mbar in a Christ Alpha-1-2 LDPlus lyophilizer (Martin Christ GmbH), and stored packed in parafilm and aluminum foil at 20 °C until utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For RGS4-catalyzed measurements, RGS4 was rebuffered using a Micro Bio-Spin P-6 column (Biorad) to 4 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 3 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl2, and 0.4 mM DTT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The buffer was prepared at 5 °C to guarantee pH stability in FTIR measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent in triplicate, and for each FTIR sample, 65 g of RGS4 was joined with 107.5 g of Gi1 (1:1 complex; lyophilization of isolated RGS4 leads to loss of protein function).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and stored light-protected at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FTIR_Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FTIR sample preparations of intrinsic Gi1 were made as described (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, lyophilized samples were resuspended in individual buffers to match a final concentration of 200 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 200 mM DTT, and 0.1% (vol/vol) ethylene glycol (5 mM protein concentration).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were packed between two CaF2 windows, one with a 10-m groove, that were sealed with silicon grease; fixed in a metal sample holder; and mounted in a spectrometer (Bruker IFS 66v/S or Vertex 80v; Bruker).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gi1·RGS4 was measured in 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM DTT, and 0.1% (vol/vol) ethylene glycol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For deuterated measurements, all stock solutions were prepared in D2O instead of H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample preparation was performed under nitrogen airflow under a transparent plastic cap in order to maximize hydrogendeuterium (HD) exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were constrained under nitrogen airflow and resuspended in D2O five times before the sample was sealed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficiency of deuteration was checked by integration of the H2O and D2O stretching vibrations in the spectrometer ( greater than 90% D2O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FTIR_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measurements were carried out as described (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, after background spectra were taken (400 scans), photolysis of the caged compounds was initiated with a laser flash at 308 nm with an LPX 240 XeCl excimer laser (Lambda Physics; 80 flashes within 160 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time point zero is defined after 40 laser flashes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction was followed in the rapid scan mode of the spectrometer at 5 °C or 15 °C for intrinsic Gi1 or at 5 °C for Gi1·RGS4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed via global fit (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time-resolved absorbance change A(,t) is described by the absorbance change induced by photolysis a0() followed by a number n of exponential functions fitting the amplitudes a for each wavenumber .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of n = 1, a1 corresponds to the hydrolysis spectrum:A(,t)=a0()+l=1nal()(1eklt).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the figures, disappearing bands face downward and appearing bands face upward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were averaged over at least three measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluation was performed in MATLAB R2012a (The MathWorks, Inc.) and OPUS (Bruker Corp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MD_Simulations_and_Evaluation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structures of active Gi1 (PDB ID code 1GIA), inactive Gi1 (PDB ID code 1GIA, chain A), GDP·AlF4-bound Gi1 (PDB ID code 1GFI), and Gi1·RGS4 (PDB ID code 1AGR) were prepared in the Moby program suite (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structure preparation included dihedral, angle, and bond corrections according to the UA amber84 force field (58), protonation according to pKa calculations using the PKA,Max,UH,JAB3 algorithm in Moby, and replacement of nucleotide analogs with natural GTP or GDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systems were initially solvated according to the Vedani algorithm (59), and thoroughly solvated in a cubic simulation cell with transferable intermolecular potential with 4 points (TIP4P) water and 154 mM NaCl in GROMACS 4.0.7 (6063).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systems were energy-minimized using steepest descent and heated to 310 K using the Berendsen thermostat and barostat with a time step of 1 fs for 25 ps with, restrained protein backbone positions in the optimized potentials for liquid simulations all atom (OPLS/AA) force field (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrostatics were calculated using PME (0.9 nm) and a van der Waals cutoff of 1.4 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Production runs were carried out without restraints for 100 ns in five replicas per system (total simulation time of 2 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluation was performed using the GROMACS package (g_rms) and the contact matrix algorithm implemented in Moby.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pictures were created using PyMOL (Schrödinger LLC) and Gnuplot 4.4 (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

QM_MM_Calculations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Snapshots from equilibrated MM simulations (25100 ns in 5-ns steps for each system) were truncated substructure-based around 1.5 nm of the QM core (GTP + Mg2+ + Mg2+-coordinating water molecules).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearest Na/Cl ions were taken into account to ensure the total charge of the system was zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QM core region (51 atoms) was embedded in a mobile MM region (0.5 nm), which was embedded in a fixed MM region containing protein and solvent centers (1.5 nm) that was again embedded by a fixed MM region containing protein centers beyond 1.5 nm of the QM core (MM layer ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6,000 atoms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, a single point calculation was performed using our own N-layered integrated molecular orbital and molecular mechanics (ONIOM) QM/MM embedded method (6668) implemented in Gaussian09 (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculated MerzKollman (ESP) charges were transferred to an external quasi-newton BroydenFletcherGoldfarbShanno minimizer (70, 71) implemented in the Moby program suite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mobile MM layer was optimized, and the updated coordinates were retransferred to the Gaussian program system, where a full optimization of the QM part with QM/MM embedding according to the ONIOM scheme was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure was repeated two times, followed by spectra calculation in the Gaussian program using normal mode analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No imaginary frequencies were observed for each calculation, indicating a minimum structure was always reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even a normal mode analysis of the MM part showed no imaginary frequencies, indicating that a minimum structure for both parts was reached successfully.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QM calculations were performed with the density functionals B3LYP, M06, and PBE and the basis set 6-31G*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculations using the B3LYP functional are well-characterized in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional functionals were chosen because of their strengths in dispersion (M06) and small IR scaling factors (PBE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IR frequencies were scaled according to the Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark Database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IR frequencies for each vibration were averaged over 15 snapshots for each simulation system, and the SE was calculated for comparison with the experimental band widths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We depicted only the asymmetrical vibrations of the individual phosphate groups, because their high transition dipole moment causes IR intensities that dominate the experimental spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QM/MM calculations showed two distinct AS(P-O3) bands for -GTP, whereas the experiments showed only -GTP vibration, which was previously described for small GTPases in the literature (2, 72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, mean values for AS(P-O3) were depicted to enable comparison with the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole QM/MM calculation procedure for one snapshot was performed within a single day on eight parallel central processing unit cores (1.9 GHz; AMD Opteron).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
