Punishment diminishes the benefits of network reciprocity in social dilemma experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The evolution of cooperation has a formative role in human societiescivilized life on Earth would be impossible without cooperation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is unclear why cooperation would evolve in the first place because Darwinian selection favors selfish individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After struggling with this problem for 150 y, recent scientific breakthroughs have uncovered multiple cooperation-promoting mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We build on these breakthroughs by examining whether two widely known cooperation-promoting mechanismsnetwork reciprocity and costly punishmentcreate synergies in a social dilemma experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While network reciprocity fulfilled its expected role, costly punishment proved to be surprisingly ineffective in promoting cooperation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ineffectiveness suggests that the rational response to punishment assumed in theoretical studies is overly stylized and needs reexamining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Network reciprocity has been widely advertised in theoretical studies as one of the basic cooperation-promoting mechanisms, but experimental evidence favoring this type of reciprocity was published only recently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When organized in an unchanging network of social contacts, human subjects cooperate provided the following strict condition is satisfied: The benefit of cooperation must outweigh the total cost of cooperating with all neighbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an attempt to relax this condition, we perform social dilemma experiments wherein network reciprocity is aided with another theoretically hypothesized cooperation-promoting mechanismcostly punishment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results reveal how networks promote and stabilize cooperation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stabilizing effect is stronger in a smaller-size neighborhood, as expected from theory and experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to expectations, punishment diminishes the benefits of network reciprocity by lowering assortment, payoff per round, and award for cooperative behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This diminishing effect is stronger in a larger-size neighborhood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An immediate implication is that the psychological effects of enduring punishment override the rational response anticipated in quantitative models of cooperation in networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical data analyses revealed that network reciprocity promotes cooperation (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report cooperativeness and its variation in terms of the median (M) and the interquartile range (IQR), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the control treatment (well-mixed interactions; CD), the level of cooperation was M=4% with IQR=8%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the static network (CD2), by contrast, the level of cooperation rose to M=38% with IQR=45%, which is significantly higher than in CD despite a large variation in the data (z-score 8.051; two-tailed MannWhitney U test pless_than109).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in the static network with punishment (CDP2), the level of cooperation was M=37% with IQR=40%, practically the same as in CD2 (z-score 0.326; two-tailed MannWhitney U test p=0.741).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same cooperativeness of participants in CD2 and CDP2 was surprising and shows that punishment fails to boost the cooperation-promoting effect of network reciprocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is furthermore notable that the lower level of defection in CDP2 relative to CD2 (M=52%, IQR=36% vs. M=62%, IQR=46%, respectively) happened only because some participants replaced defection with punishment (M=7%, IQR=10%) when this action was available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that network reciprocity truly promotes cooperation, aside from a higher overall cooperativeness in the static network (CD2) compared with the well-mixed interactions (CD), it was necessary to determine whether or not the level of cooperation in CD2 decreased over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the well-mixed interactions were detrimental for cooperativeness, even though the level of cooperation could be quite high initially (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the first 10 rounds of CD, the nonlinear transient dynamics was evidently strong, after which cooperativeness plunged to very low levels and stayed there for the remainder of a typical experimental session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Network reciprocity, however, was capable of maintaining a high level of cooperation throughout the experiment, despite some variability in the data (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regression analysis, after discarding the first 10 rounds, indicated that network reciprocity prevented cooperativeness from decreasing because the corresponding line slope was positive and statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was in sharp contrast with the experimental outcome when punishment was available (CDP2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CDP2 (Fig 2B), although the overall level of cooperation was similar as in CD2, the regression analysis revealed that a line with negative, statistically significant slope fits the data, thus suggesting that, even after 50 rounds, cooperativeness was still decreasing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The described results are, therefore, consistent with the interpretation that punishment interferes with the cooperation-promoting effect of network reciprocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified clustering as a fundamental, cooperation-promoting mechanism in static networks (SI Appendix, SI Results and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clustering is closely related to the concept of assortmenta measure of the extent to which cooperators recognize and group with other cooperators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand how network reciprocity stabilizes cooperation, we defined assortment as a cooperators average fraction of cooperative neighbors minus a defectors and, when available, a punishers average fraction of cooperative neighbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time evolution of this quantity (Fig 3A) showed that the level of assortment in the static network (CD2) was consistently higher than in the well-mixed interactions (CD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the regression analysis indicated that the static network stabilized assortment because the corresponding line slope was statistically indistinguishable from zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar result was obtained in the presence of punishment (CDP2; Fig 3B), but the level of assortment was consistently lower than in CD2 (z score 4.429; two-tailed MannWhitney U test pless_than105).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with these results, punishment lowered the ability of cooperators to associate with other like-minded individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In analyzing the anticipated synergies of network reciprocity and punishment, besides the overall level of cooperation, it is important to look at success as measured by payoff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intuitive representation of payoff distributions by using the probability density (Fig 4A) showed that network reciprocity (CD2) led to considerably higher payoffs per round than the well-mixed interactions (CD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The payoff in CD was M=0.62 with IQR=0.68 as opposed to M=1.52 with IQR=1.68 in CD2 (z score 5.830; two-tailed MannWhitney U test pless_than108; Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When punishment was introduced (CDP2), the distribution of payoffs was still wider than in CD, but narrower than in CD2 (Fig 4A; see also Fig 4B for pairwise comparisons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This narrowing was sufficient to push the payoff per round in CDP2 back to M=0.58 with IQR=1.70, which was indistinguishable from the level recorded in CD (z score 0.171; two-tailed MannWhitney U test p=0.864; Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An inescapable conclusion here is that punishment harms the payoff per round, especially at the high end of the attainable range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generally, an action that leads to a higher payoff under the given circumstances is said to be better adjusted to these circumstances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could therefore gain an insight into which actions were well-adjusted or maladjusted by analyzing the correlation between payoffs per round and action frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that when the interactions were well-mixed (CD), cooperation was a maladjusted action because the regression analysis indicated that more cooperative individuals ended up with a lower payoff per round (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This situation was reversed in the static network (CD2), wherein more cooperative individuals were rewarded with a higher payoff per round.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same result was valid when punishment became available (CDP2), yet the slope of the corresponding regression line was notably lower than in CD2 (2.6 vs. 1.9; Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lower slope in CDP2 relative to CD2 hinted at a potentially negative influence of punishment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This issue is addressed thoroughly below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Defection in CD and CD2 exhibited exactly the opposite characteristics to cooperation due to the constraint that frequencies of cooperation and defection must sum to unity (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defection is thus a well-adjusted action in CD, but maladjusted in CD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, defection in CDP2 has similar characteristics as in CD2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was reflected in the negative, statistically significant slope of regression lines between the payoff per round and the frequency of defection in both CD2 and CDP2, although the latter slope was notably lower in absolute value (2.6 vs. 1.6; Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the goodness of fit for the regression line in CDP2 was statistically indistinguishable from zero, giving us another hint that punishment poorly interacts with network reciprocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full extent of the problem became apparent in the static network in which neighborhood size equaled four (SI Appendix, SI Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neighborhood size was an important factor affecting network reciprocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, if neighborhood size increased, the level of cooperation decreased (cf M=38%, IQR=45% in CD2 vs. M=9.0%, IQR=26% in CD4; z score 4.670; two-tailed MannWhitney U test pless_than105; SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As before, aiding network reciprocity with punishment failed to increase cooperativeness (cf M=9.0%, IQR=26% in CD4 vs. M=9.4%, IQR=15% in CDP4; z score 0.280; two-tailed MannWhitney U test p=0.779).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, almost the same levels of cooperation in CD4 and CDP4, and only a slightly lower level of defection (M=88%, IQR=37%) in the latter treatment, implied that punishment (M=4.7%, IQR=13%) was used as an occasional replacement for defection, but to no availnetwork reciprocity weakened with neighborhood size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion was confirmed when success in terms of the payoff per round was related to action use (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, cooperation was a maladjusted action in the control treatment (CD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although network reciprocity (CD2) improved the prospects of cooperators, it was insufficient to establish a positive correlation between success and cooperativeness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most defeating result, however, was that punishment (CDP4) counteracted the positive effect of network reciprocity by making cooperation a maladjusted action once again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result corroborated what was only a hint in CDP2; namely, punishment acted to erase the reward that network reciprocity brought to cooperators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Social dilemma experiments described here yielded two main results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, network reciprocity has proven effective in promoting cooperation (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result confirmed the recent findings in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39, with the addition of identifying clustering as the key mechanism by which network reciprocity promotes cooperativeness (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clustering is interesting from an ecological perspective because closely related animals often protect themselves or gain food more efficiently by gathering in groups such as herds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human ability to communicate may have helped to extend these grouping tendencies beyond just the closest relatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nevertheless, the levels of cooperation in the static network remained significantly below 50%, thus suggesting room for improvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This naturally led to a question of whether aiding network reciprocity with another hypothesized cooperation-promoting mechanismsuch as punishmentwould boost the level of cooperation observed in static networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much to our surprise, punishment not only failed to boost cooperativeness, but also countered some positive aspects of network reciprocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest an interplay between three different factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Decreased assortment in the static network with punishment (Fig 3) is an indication that cooperators have a harder time identifying one another when punishing is possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A likely reason is that punishment sends a mixed signal to neighbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the implied message when punishing someone is I want you to be cooperative, the immediate effect is more consistent with the message I want to hurt you.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence that punishing in social dilemma experiments can be interpreted in the latter way is seen in occasional retaliatory use of punishment whereby participants punish one another consecutively for several rounds without becoming any more cooperative than they were to begin with (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This furthermore suggests that a response to punishment may be driven by impulse as much as reason, if not more.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fact that punishment reduces the payoff per round (Fig 4) reveals an overall demoralizing effect of this action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, individuals who get punished on multiple occasions may see a good chunk of their total payoff vanish in a short period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breaking off from the rest of the pack thus becomes more difficult, which in turn may cause doubts about ones performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With grim prospects for achieving a satisfactory success, players may lose interest in the game and play the remaining rounds in a less coherent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even if players remain interested in the game to the last round, punishment seems to reduceif not eliminatethe incentive to eventually choose cooperation over defection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, from the perspective of evolutionary game theory, completely rational players should cling only to actions that lead to an above-average payoff, whereas other actions should die out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of selection process should persist until only the best action(s) remain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the behavior of human participants in a social dilemma experiment may deviate from complete rationality, it is in line with our expectations that success, expressed in terms of the payoff per round, correlates positively with the frequency of cooperation in static networks (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise there would be little rationale to select cooperation over defection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even the results in a smaller-size neighborhood already hint that punishment blurs the positive correlation between success and cooperativeness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hint is confirmed in a larger-size neighborhood in which network reciprocity is weaker and thereby unable to prevent punishment from completely reversing the correlation between success and cooperativeness (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Players, therefore, have no way of learning to associate cooperation with success, which makes a wider adoption of this action unlikely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Punishment has proven ineffective in our experiment, which begs the question why punishing is so ubiquitous in the real world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A partial answer would be that human brain seems to be hardwired to derive pleasure from punishing defectors (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a fundamental perspective, however, a more satisfying answer would be that there are alternative situations in which punishments role as a cooperation promoter is substantial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that such situations may include asymmetries whereby one dominant side has the ability to punish without provoking retaliation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps even a variant of the present experiment would end up differently if punishment brought more bang for the buck, i.e., if the fine associated with punishment in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 were higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This brings us to an important limitation of our and similar approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In analyzing our experimental results, general conclusions about human behavior were drawn based on the use of a single or, at best, a few payoff matrices such as the one in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of basing conclusions on limited information, a preferred course of action would be to specify and systematically vary six parameters in the unilateral payoff matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, executing the necessary number of treatments and replicates may cause considerable logistic strain on experimenters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples of such strain include the need for an excessive number of recruits, the financial burden of repeatedly paying participation fees, and an increase in the time required to execute all aspects of an experimental study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the face of the described limitation, therefore, we have little choice but to extract valuable insights from the available data while keeping in mind that it would be unwise to extrapolate the implications of social dilemma experiments on human behavior far beyond the setting in which these experiments were conducted in the first place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the purpose of conducting the experimental treatments described herein (CD, CD2, and CDP2), we recruited 225 undergraduate volunteersmean age 20.2 y; female-to-male ratio approximately 1:1; multiple majorsfrom two universities in China: Tianjin University of Finance and Economics in Tianjin and Yunnan University of Finance and Economics in Kunming (for more details, see SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants engaged in a repeated PD game played in the professionally designed computer laboratories of both universities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon arrival, participants were randomly assigned to isolated computer cubicles, where a computer screen would display the instructions on experimental procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, all participants were required to complete a short questionnaire (SI Appendix, Fig S1) to verify their basic understanding of the game rules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before beginning an experimental session, several practice rounds were played against two random opponents to let participants familiarize themselves with the experimental interface (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Opponents were kept anonymous apart from displaying an opponent number to allow examining the result of each action more easily (SI Appendix, Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatments were implemented in z-Tree, a specialized software package for socioeconomic experiments (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The three experimental treatments differed in (i) how participants connected with one another and (ii) what actions were at their disposal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the control treatment (CD), each participant played a traditional PD gamein which cooperation (C) and defection (D) were the only available actionsagainst two opponents at a time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These opponents were randomly chosen in each round (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the static network (CD2), opponents were no longer randomly chosen, but instead participants formed a ring in which the first two neighbors acted as the game opponents (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This arrangement was unchanged during the game.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the static network with punishment (CDP2) differed from CD2 only in that punishment (P) was available as an independent action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to these definitions, the role of treatments CD2 and CDP2 was to establish the cooperation-promoting effect of network reciprocity relative to CD and the cooperation-boosting effect of punishment relative to CD2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All treatments consisted of two replicates (i.e., sessions or games) played between December 2015 and September 2016 by participants who had no prior experience with this kind of social dilemma experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No participant was allowed to play more than once.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A game consisted of 50 rounds, which took 1 h to complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants remained unaware of the exact number of rounds to avoid possible finite-game opportunism (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One round was completed only after all participants chose their preferred actions and examined the consequences thereof.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time allotted for each of these tasks was 30 s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Players success was measured in terms of their total payoff, updated after every round as prescribed by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This payoff was added to an initial endowment of 50 points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide participants with an incentive, the final endowment accumulated throughout a game was translated into the Chinese renminbi at a rate of ¥0.5 per point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the accumulated endowment was negative, participants would still get a show-up fee of ¥15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eearnings ranged from ¥15 to ¥148, with an average of ¥65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before being paid out, participants were asked to confirm their final endowment and sign a cash receipt form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Probability distributions behind socioeconomic data are rarely known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid assuming any underlying distribution, we used nonparametric descriptors (e.g., median and IQR) and statistical tests (e.g., MannWhitney U test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, linear regression analyses were used to determine trends and correlations in the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because socioeconomic data often exhibit high variation by which a few data points can disproportionately affect the results of the ordinary least squares regression, we replaced squared with absolute distances and thus reduced the effect of the potential outliers on the estimated regression parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was qualitatively similar to using the quantile regression, except that minimizing the sum of absolute distances allowed for a more intuitive interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The goodness of fit was assessed by using a measure analogous to the square root of the coefficient of determination, defined as Rabs=1res/tot, where SAres is the sum of absolute residuals and tot is the sum of absolute distances from the data mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By definition, 0Rabs1, where the lower (upper) bound signifies the presence (absence) of random scatter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All 95% confidence intervals were obtained by means of bootstrapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
