title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Individual differences in associative memory among older adults explained by hippocampal subfield structure and function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Older adults differ in the degree to which they experience memory impairments, but the underlying factors contributing to this variability remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motivated by the essential role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in declarative memory, we investigated whether episodic memory differences among older adults can be explained by differences in MTL subfield structure and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrated that a combination of structural and functional subfield measures significantly accounted for differences in memory performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings advance understanding of how independent but converging influences of both MTL structure and function contribute to age-related impairment in episodic memory, complementing findings in the rodent and human postmortem literatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Older adults experience impairments in episodic memory, ranging from mild to clinically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the critical role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in episodic memory, age-related changes in MTL structure and function may partially account for individual differences in memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ultrahigh-field 7T structural MRI and high-resolution 3T functional MRI (hr-fMRI), we evaluated MTL subfield thickness and function in older adults representing a spectrum of cognitive health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants performed an associative memory task during hr-fMRI in which they encoded and later retrieved facename pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motivated by prior research, we hypothesized that differences in performance would be explained by the following: (i) entorhinal cortex (ERC) and CA1 apical neuropil layer [CA1stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare (SRLM)] thickness, and (ii) activity in ERC and the dentate gyrus (DG)/CA3 region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regression analyses revealed that this combination of factors significantly accounted for variability in memory performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these metrics, CA1-SRLM thickness was positively associated with memory, whereas DG/CA3 retrieval activity was negatively associated with memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, including structural and functional metrics in the same model better accounted for performance than did single-modality models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results advance the understanding of how independent but converging influences of both MTL subfield structure and function contribute to age-related memory impairment, complementing findings in the rodent and human postmortem literatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Associative memory paradigm and results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During encoding, participants subjectively rated how well each name fit its associated face on a scale from 1 to 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During retrieval, participants made judgments regarding whether a given facename pair was intact, recombined, or new.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Box plot demonstrates individual differences in task performance as measured by associative d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present multimodal study yielded a number of different measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We briefly present findings from each modality, and then report our main analyses relating the combination of these measures to memory performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Behavioral_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Concurrent with fMRI, participants performed an associative memory task (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants first viewed facename pairs and then performed a recognition test in which they discriminated between three facename pair types: intact, recombined, and novel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the recognition test data, we calculated a sensitivity index, associative d, which served as the metric of associative memory performance used in our regression analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variability across participants for this measure is demonstrated in Fig 2 (Fig S1A for response rates broken down by condition and Fig S1B for variability in item d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

7T_Structural_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analyses of structural data focused on our a priori regions of interest (ROIs), ERC and CA1-SRLM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed the relationship between subfield thickness and associative d using separate regression models for each ROI while controlling for group and age (Fig 3A for scatter plots of the raw data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results demonstrate that although ERC thickness did not significantly account for variability in memory performance (P  greater than  0.3), CA1-SRLM thickness was positively associated with memory ( = 0.092, P = 0.048).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Results and Fig S2A for analyses of non-a priori ROIs, including significant findings for the CA1 stratum pyramidale, or SP, layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

3T_Functional_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analyses of functional data focused on encoding and retrieval activity in our a priori ROIs, ERC and DG/CA3 (SI Results and Fig S2 B and C for analyses in additional subfields).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encoding activity for each ROI was defined as follows: [subsequently intact trials called intact (SII)]  [subsequently intact trials called recombined (SIR)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Methods and Fig S3 for a complementary analysis of encoding activity according to stimulus novelty (novel  repeat).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retrieval activity was defined as: [intact trials called intact (II)]  [intact trials called recombined (IR)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, for each ROI, we assessed the relationship between functional activity and associative d separately for encoding and retrieval while controlling for group and age (Fig 3 for scatter plots of the raw data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At encoding, results demonstrate that neither ERC activity nor DG/CA3 activity significantly explained variance in task performance (values of P  greater than  0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At retrieval, DG/CA3 activity was negatively associated with memory ( = 0.118, P = 0.007), whereas ERC activity did not significantly account for variability in memory performance (P  greater than  0.7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Fig S4 for retrieval activity broken down by condition in each ROI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiple_Linear_Regression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined whether the combination of our a priori structural and functional metrics could significantly account for variability in associative d when controlling for group and age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate regression analyses were performed for encoding and retrieval, such that, for each analysis, structural and control variables remained the same, but functional metrics were specific to task phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The encoding model significantly accounted for variability in memory performance [F(6,36) = 2.569, P = 0.036, adjusted R2 = 0.183], but the only subfield metric approaching significance was CA1-SRLM thickness, which demonstrated a trend for a positive association with memory performance (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern of significance did not differ when excluding an ERC thickness outlier or separate ERC activity and DG/CA3 activity outliers (outliers defined as  greater than 2 SDs from the mean).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Table S1 for results from a complementary encoding model using activity associated with stimulus novelty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The retrieval model also significantly explained variability in associative memory performance [F(6,36) = 5.086, P less_than 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.369].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model revealed that two subfield metrics were significantly linked to performance: CA1-SRLM thickness, which was positively associated with memory, and DG/CA3 retrieval activity, which was negatively associated with memory (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern of significance did not differ when excluding an ERC thickness outlier or separate ERC activity and DG/CA3 activity outliers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we performed three follow-up analyses pertaining to the retrieval model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, to mitigate concerns regarding the large age range in our sample, we repeated the analysis using participants aged 60 and above, the results of which were similar to the model including all participants (SI Results and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we examined whether the same explanatory variables could account for performance on a different test of episodic memory by modifying the dependent variable to be a composite measure of neuropsychological tests of episodic memory (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model significantly accounted for variability in memory, with CA1-SRLM thickness being positively associated with memory performance (SI Results and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we evaluated the degree to which whole hippocampal structure and function were associated with associative d. Findings for this model paralleled those of the subfield-specific model, with hippocampal area showing a positive association with memory and retrieval activity showing a negative association with memory (SI Results and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_Comparison  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Focusing on retrieval, we next evaluated whether our model inclusive of both structural and functional measures better explains variability in memory than a model with structural or functional measures alone (with each model controlling for group and age).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results of each model can be found in Table 1: structure-plus-function model: F(6, 36) = 5.086, P less_than 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.369; structure-only model: F(4,38) = 2.762, P = 0.041, adjusted R2 = 0.144; function-only model: F(4,38) = 3.863, P = 0.010, adjusted R2 = 0.214.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we compared these models as follows (i): structure plus function compared with structure only, and (ii) structure plus function compared with function only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure-plus-function model accounted for significantly more of the variance in associative d than either structure only [F(2,36) = 7.768, P = 0.002] or function only [F(2,36) = 5.644, P = 0.007].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Group_Differences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For complementary analyses evaluating group differences in each modality (behavior, structure, and function) rather than individual differences, see SI Results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Behavioral_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the associative memory task, response rates in each group for each condition are displayed in Fig S1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these data, we computed separate sensitivity metrics (d) for associative and item memory (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variability in both associative d and item d are displayed in Fig S1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

7T_Structural_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to examining the relationship between associative d and thickness in our a priori regions of interest (ROIs), here we report the same analyses in the stratum pyramidale layer of CA1 (CA-SP) as well as in DG/CA3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that a CA1-SP outlier was excluded for statistical analysis (Fig S2A; thickness more than 3 SDs lower than the mean).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed the relationship between subfield thickness and associative d using separate regression models for each region while controlling for diagnostic group and age (Fig S2A for scatter plots of the raw data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results demonstrate that, although DG/CA3 area did not significantly account for variability in associative d (P  greater than  0.4), CA1-SP thickness was positively associated with memory ( = 0.097, P = 0.023).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

3T_fMRI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first report findings from the encoding phase in which functional metrics for each subfield relate to stimulus novelty (novel  repeated trials) during encoding rather than encoding success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of our a priori ROIs, we assessed the relationship between novelty activity and associative d while controlling for diagnostic group and age (Fig S3 for scatter plots of the raw data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results revealed that neither ERC nor DG/CA3 novelty activity significantly explained variance in task performance (values of P  greater than  0.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we examined the relationship between memory and functional activity in two non-a priori regions: CA1 and subiculum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each ROI, we assessed the relationship between activity and associative d separately for encoding and retrieval while controlling for diagnostic group and age (Fig S2 B and C for scatter plots of the raw data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encoding results demonstrate that neither CA1 nor subiculum activity significantly explained variance in task performance (values of P  greater than  0.7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to retrieval, analyses revealed a trend toward a significant negative relationship between CA1 activity and associative memory ( = 0.080, P = 0.068) as well as subiculum activity and associative memory ( = 0.103, P = 0.056).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiple_Linear_Regression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To complement our two main regression models, we performed four follow-up analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, with respect to subfield activity during the encoding phase, we performed a complementary analysis of encoding activity according to stimulus novelty (novel  repeat) rather than encoding success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this model indicated that the chosen metrics did not significantly explain variance in associative memory performance [F(6,36) = 1.852, P = 0.117, adjusted R2 = 0.109; Table S1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, to attenuate concerns regarding the large age range of our sample, we repeated our retrieval model regression analysis using participants aged 60 and above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this model paralleled those inclusive of all participants [F(6,29) = 3.657, P = 0.008, adjusted R2 = 0.313; Table S2].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we examined whether the same structural and functional metrics used in our retrieval model could account for performance on a different test of episodic memory by modifying the outcome metric to be a composite measure of neuropsychological tests of episodic memory (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model significantly accounted for variability in memory [F(6,36) = 12.26, P less_than 0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.617], with CA1-SRLM thickness being positively associated with memory performance (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to complement the subfield specificity of the retrieval model, we ran a similar model with associative d as the dependent variable and the following explanatory variables: whole hippocampal area, whole hippocampal retrieval activity (II  IR), participant diagnostic group, and age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model significantly explained associative memory performance [F(4,38) = 5.335, P = 0.002, adjusted R2 = 0.292], demonstrating that hippocampal area was positively associated with memory performance and hippocampal retrieval activity was negatively associated with memory performance (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these analyses, we also assessed collinearity among variables in our main analyses by computing variance inflation factors (VIFs) for each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results returned VIFs of less_than2; as such, collinearity was considered nonproblematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Fig S5 for a correlation matrix involving each explanatory variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Group_Differences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participant_Recruitment_and_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cognitively impaired participants were recruited from the Stanford Center for Memory Disorders, and included 12 individuals with aMCI and 5 with SCI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Healthy older adults were recruited from the community and approximated the ages of the cognitively impaired participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants underwent a clinical evaluation performed by a Stanford Center for Memory Disorders physician that included a history, physical examination, and neurological examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with a study partner, participants underwent a functional assessment that included the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) (61), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (62), Geriatric Depression Scale (63), and Functional Assessment Questionnaire (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A neuropsychological battery was also administered covering episodic memory, working memory, executive function, visuospatial function, and language, as described previously (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diagnoses of amnestic MCI (aMCI) were made according to the National Institute on AgingAlzheimers Association criteria (65), a CDR score of less_than1, and an objective memory impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) met all of the criteria for aMCI except that they had no objective memory impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inclusion criteria for the healthy older adults included a normal neurological examination, no neuropsychological abnormality, no cognitive complaint, and a CDR score of 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exclusion criteria for all participants included contraindications to MRI, a history of stroke or other brain abnormality, and any neurological or medical conditions that could interfere with normal cognition (other than aMCI or SCI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Table S3 for characteristics of each group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To complement the associative memory analyses reported in the main manuscript, we calculated a second sensitivity index, item d. To calculate this measure, we defined hit rate as the rate at which participants responded intact or recombined to intact pairs (II and IR, respectively) and recombined or intact to recombined pairs (RR and RI, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We defined the false alarm rate for this measure as the rate at which participants responded intact or recombined to novel pairs (NI or NR, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our item d measure was as follows: d = Z(II, IR, RR, RI rate)  Z(NI, NR rate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

7T_Structural_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thickness measurements for a priori regions reported in the main manuscript were performed as follows: We computed thickness manually for ERC and used a semiautomated method for CA1-SRLM thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also conducted supplemental thickness analyses for hippocampal subfields for which we did not have a priori hypothesesCA1-SP and DG/CA3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that DG/CA3 has a nonuniform shape, we computed area for this region rather than thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

3T_fMRI_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we performed analyses of 3T functional data that were identical to those reported in the main manuscript, with the exception that we focused on hippocampal subfields for which we did not have a priori hypothesesCA1 and subiculum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, for each of our a priori regions of interest (ERC and DG/CA3), we performed a complementary analysis of encoding activity such that activity was defined as [novel  repeat].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiple_Linear_Regression_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To complement the regression models reported in the main manuscript, we performed four follow-up regression analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, with respect to subfield activity during the encoding phase, we created a model identical to that of the encoding model in the main manuscript, with the exception of using subfield functional metrics corresponding to stimulus novelty rather than encoding success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, to attenuate concerns regarding the large age range of our sample (5185), we repeated our retrieval model regression analysis using only participants aged 60 and above (n = 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we examined whether the same metrics used in our retrieval model could account for performance on a different test of episodic memory by modifying the outcome metric to be a composite measure of neuropsychological tests of episodic memory as previously described (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, this metric included normalized performance averaged across three tests of delayed recall: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) (66), Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-R) (67), and the Logical Memory (LM) subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale, Third Edition (WMS-III) (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to complement the subfield specificity of the retrieval model, we ran a similar model but replaced the subfield-specific metrics with whole hippocampal area and whole hippocampal activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Group_Differences_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The impetus of our study was to examine individual differences in associative memory performance and the degree to which measures of MTL subfield structure and function could account for these differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, our sample included both putatively healthy older adults as well as those with cognitive impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To complement our individual difference analyses, we also performed a standard group analysis using two-sample t tests for each modality included in the regression models: behavior, MTL subfield structure, and MTL subfield function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While numerous studies point to episodic memory decline with age (13), substantial differences exist in the degree to which individuals exhibit memory impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a combination of ultrahigh-field 7T structural MRI and 3T hr-MRI, we examined whether individual differences in episodic memory among older adults can be explained, in part, by differences in MTL subfield structure and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting this hypothesis, our analyses demonstrated that variability in hippocampal structure and function partially accounts for variability in memory performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, CA1-SRLM thickness is positively linked to performance and DG/CA3 retrieval activity is negatively linked to performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, combining structural and functional metrics better explained variability in memory performance than did single-modality models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although prior aging studies have examined independent contributions of MTL subfield structure or function to memory (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3133 and 4345), here we incorporated both modalities and demonstrated independent but converging influences on performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extensive evidence indicates that the MTL is vulnerable to atrophy in both putatively healthy aging and in age-related disease (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from the five million Americans with clinically manifest AD (47), many more harbor neuropathological signs of the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By some estimates, AD biomarkers may be present two decades before a diagnosis is made (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a large autopsy series, for example, early stage neurofibrillary tau pathology was evident in the MTL in over 60% of 60-y-olds (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tau pathology is remarkably focal early in AD, first affecting portions of ERC and CA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CA1, postmortem studies show that pathology first appears in the SRLM layer (20, 50, 51), and in vivo work from our group demonstrates that, within CA1, SRLM is selectively vulnerable to atrophy in mild AD relative to controls (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27; see also, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52), as well as in healthy older relative to younger adults (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with the current data, these postmortem and imaging findings raise the possibility that putatively healthy individuals with a thin CA1-SRLM are experiencing early-stage AD-related tau pathology that contributes to poor memory performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ERC is also implicated in age-related atrophy (1519) and is an early target of AD pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results, however, did not indicate a significant relationship between ERC thickness and memory performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the MTL is known to support associative memory, the hippocampus is thought to play a more critical role in binding together and subsequently pattern completing elements of an event than MTL cortex, which is hypothesized to differentially support item recognition (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, future studies should investigate the degree to which age-related differences in ERC structure differentially explain performance on item vs. associative tests of memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our structural analyses focused on ERC and CA1-SRLM based upon prior findings (11, 1519, 28) as well as the need to avoid overfitting our regression models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, supplemental analyses revealed that CA1-SP thickness also was positively associated with performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding extends prior work from our laboratory demonstrating positive correlations between both layers of CA1 and memory in mild AD (45), as well as other research showing a relationship between atrophy of CA1 and memory impairment in individuals with MCI (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some studies of aging and mild AD have reported selective atrophy of DG/CA3 or subiculum (11), our supplemental analysis of DG/CA3 area revealed nonsignificant findings, and we did not measure subiculum size in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future large-scale studies with a sample size sufficient to evaluate each subfields contributions to memory in a single model may further resolve discrepancies in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to clarifying the relationship between subfield structure and memory, we also sought to examine whether differences in subfield function can partially account for memory performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings indicate a negative relationship between retrieval activity in DG/CA3 and associative memory performance, such that greater activity during successful retrieval is associated with worse task performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support prior findings demonstrating DG/CA3 hyperactivity in older relative to younger adults (31) and individuals with MCI relative to controls (3335) during a test of item recognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we extend these findings to demonstrate that increased DG/CA3 activity is linked to poor performance during associative recognition, a type of memory thought to be more vulnerable to age-related change than item memory (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are also in agreement with standard-resolution studies of associative memory that demonstrate hippocampal hyperactivity during successful memory trials in individuals with MCI relative to controls (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It bears noting, however, that other standard-resolution studies report a positive relationship between hippocampal retrieval activity and associative memory performance across the life span (see, e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that averaging activity across subfields may produce variable findings, continued high-resolution investigation of hippocampal function may help to resolve such inconsistencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One possible explanation for the consistent finding of increased hippocampal, and particularly DG/CA3, activity in older adults during memory success is that it is a form of neural compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that many older adults exhibit tau pathology in the absence of an AD diagnosis (49), an alternate explanation for this hyperactivity is hippocampal excitotoxicity associated with AD pathology (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, findings in aged rodents indicate that memory deficits associated with hippocampal hyperactivity may result from dysfunction of inhibitory interneurons (8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings suggest that DG/CA3 hyperactivity negatively affects memory performance, but the underlying mechanisms of this increased activity remain underspecified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It bears noting that supplemental analyses also revealed a trend for a negative relationship between memory and retrieval activity in CA1 and subiculum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future large-scale studies should include activity from multiple hippocampal subfields in the same model to help to determine the relative explanatory power of each subfields activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Outside of the hippocampus, ERC has also been implicated in age-related dysfunction (33, 3641); our findings, however, were not significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with ERC structure, it will be beneficial for future studies to examine the relationship between ERC function and performance on tests of item vs. associative memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, given that our imaging protocol was limited to the MTL, future whole-brain studies are needed to determine whether and how structural and functional differences in prefrontal and parietal regions explain differences in episodic memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, rather than independently consider the relationship of MTL subfield structure or function with memory performance, we combined measures from both modalities into a single model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combined model explained significantly more of the variance in memory performance than one inclusive of structural or functional measures alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study is a demonstration of independent but converging influences of MTL subfield structure and function on episodic memory in older adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results complement prior findings in the rodent and human postmortem literatures demonstrating subfield-specific changes with age, and provide an important bridge to understanding how these changes influence human behavior in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sixty-one older adults (5185 y) participated in the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four were dropped from analysis due to poor quality 7T structural images, seven were dropped due to excessive motion during 3T functional scans, and seven were dropped due to performance that yielded insufficient trial numbers (less_than10) for at least one condition of interest in the fMRI analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, results reported here focus on the remaining 43 participants with a full dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, 26 were healthy older adults (16 female, 2 left-handed), and 17 were patients with cognitive impairment (4 female, 1 left-handed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Table S3 for detailed characteristics of each group and SI Methods for a description of our clinical assessment and diagnostic criteria for all participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All study metrics, including clinical assessment, 7T imaging, and 3T imaging, were acquired within an average window of 68.2 d (range, 2185 d; SD, 6.2 d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants provided informed consent in accordance with a protocol approved by the Stanford Institutional Review Board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MATLAB Psychophysics Toolbox was used for stimulus presentation and response collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimuli included 140 color photos of unfamiliar faces paired with 140 fictional first names.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faces were drawn from the Center for Vital Longevity Face Database (agingmind.utdallas.edu/download-stimuli/face-database/) and modified by Ebner (57) to neutralize clothing and background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pictured individuals were Caucasian, ranged in age from 1894 y, and had a neutral expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Names were drawn from the Social Security Administrations database of popular baby names (www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/) from the 1920s to the 1980s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The degree to which MTL subfield structure and function can explain differences in memory was assessed using multiple linear regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All analyses were performed using R (www.r-project.org/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Associative d served as the dependent variable, and explanatory variables included ERC thickness, CA1-SRLM thickness, ERC activity, and DG/CA3 activity, while controlling for participant diagnostic group and age (SI Methods for methods used for non-a priori ROIs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate models were run for encoding and retrieval data such that structural and control variables remained the same, but functional variables changed according to task phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the encoding model, subfield activity was defined as [SII activity]  [SIR activity], reflecting successful associative encoding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the retrieval model, subfield activity was defined as [II activity]  [IR activity], reflecting successful associative retrieval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All explanatory variables were normalized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Results for a test of collinearity among variables and Fig S5 for a correlation matrix involving each variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
