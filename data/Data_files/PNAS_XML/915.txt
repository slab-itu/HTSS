Bird specimens track 135 years of atmospheric black carbon and environmental policy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Emission inventories of major climate-forcing agents like black carbon suffer high uncertainty for the early industrial era, thereby limiting their utility for extracting past climate sensitivity to atmospheric pollutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify bird specimens as incidental records of atmospheric black carbon, filling a major historical sampling gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that prevailing emission inventories underestimate black carbon levels in the United States through the first decades of the 20th century, suggesting that black carbons contribution to past climate forcing may also be underestimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study builds toward a robust, spatially dynamic inventory of atmospheric black carbon, highlighting the value of natural history collections as a resource for addressing present-day environmental challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atmospheric black carbon has long been recognized as a public health and environmental concern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, black carbon has been identified as a major, ongoing contributor to anthropogenic climate change, thus making historical emission inventories of black carbon an essential tool for assessing past climate sensitivity and modeling future climate scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current estimates of black carbon emissions for the early industrial era have high uncertainty, however, because direct environmental sampling is sparse before the mid-1950s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using photometric reflectance data of 1,300 bird specimens drawn from natural history collections, we track relative ambient concentrations of atmospheric black carbon between 1880 and 2015 within the US Manufacturing Belt, a region historically reliant on coal and dense with industry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that black carbon levels within the region peaked during the first decade of the 20th century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this peak, black carbon levels were positively correlated with coal consumption through midcentury, after which they decoupled, with black carbon concentrations declining as consumption continued to rise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precipitous drop in atmospheric black carbon at midcentury reflects policies promoting burning efficiency and fuel transitions rather than regulating emissions alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that current emission inventories based on predictive modeling underestimate levels of atmospheric black carbon for the early industrial era, suggesting that the contribution of black carbon to past climate forcing may also be underestimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings build toward a spatially dynamic emission inventory of black carbon based on direct environmental sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Black_Carbon_Deposition_on_Bird_Specimens  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Birds accumulate black carbon and other particulate matter on their feathers from the surrounding environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  References to plumage discoloration appear in the scientific literature as early as the 1930s, which prompted a debate over whether darkened feathers had resulted from superficial soiling or changes to internal pigmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter would indicate industrial melanism, an evolutionary phenomenon in which darker phenotypes thrive within soot-filled environments (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we confirmed that darkened breast feathers from specimens collected in the early 20th century are indeed covered in black carbon particles (Fig 1 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that most bird species undergo at least one annual molt to replace body feathers, black carbon deposition on specimens functions as an environmental sample from the year in which each bird was collected (we discuss the negligible effect of posthumous soiling from museum storage in SI Evidence that Bird Specimens Accumulated Black Carbon from the Environment Before Collection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measured reflectance values from a time series of bird specimens that were collected within the US Manufacturing Belt between 1880 and 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We defined the US Manufacturing Belt as the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin because these states were historically dense with industry and traditionally relied upon soft, bituminous coal, which emits greater quantities of particulate matter than the harder, anthracitic coal more prevalent in the Eastern United States (18, 19) (Fig S2 shows localities of specimens used in study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured reflectance from the breast and belly feathers of each specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reflectance is a photometric that describes the proportion of light reflected from a surface and is expressed as a percentage value ranging from 0% (pure black) to 100% (pure white).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black carbon, defined as the primary light-absorbing component of soot, has low reflectance properties, allowing us to quantify the relative sootiness of each specimen as a function of reflectance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data establish a relative estimate of ambient concentrations of black carbon based on a standardized, direct sampling metric that extends back 70 y before continuous, multicity air-monitoring networks were in place (2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We imaged 1,347 birds from five species collected within our geographic range, comprising 95% of available specimens with adult plumage at three major natural history museums.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small number of specimens were excluded because of preparation concerns or missing collection data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from a list of species that breed in the US Manufacturing Belt, we selected species that have naturally light, uniform breast and belly coloration to maximize the signal strength while allowing for comparisons across species (Fig 1 and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These species included the Field Sparrow (Spizella pusilla pusilla), Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodromus savannarum pratensis), Eastern Towhee (Pipilo erythrophthalmus erythrophthalmus), Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris pratensis), and Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) (Dataset S1 provides a list of vouchered specimens).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that differences in plumage are often used to define subspecies classifications, we restricted sampling to a single subspecies per species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each specimen was digitally photographed under standard lighting conditions, and reflectance measurements were taken from a uniform patch on the ventral side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each species in our sample undergoes an annual molt beginning in late summer that can last through the fall (20), which replaces soiled plumage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of discoloration on freshly molted fall birds further confirmed that soot accumulation, and not industrial melanism, was primarily responsible for darkened plumage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since molt patterns vary by individual, specimens sampled during these annual molting periods included a mix of fresh and soiled birds (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5), interfering with an accurate signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The annual molt for each species thus had to be accounted for to recover an accurate trend in black carbon levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initially determined molting periods based on Pyle, 1997 (20), which we corroborated by examining monthly variances within our dataset (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all species, specimens collected in the months of SeptemberNovember were excluded from the final dataset; for two species, specimens from August were also removed (for more details on monthly trends, see SI Materials and Methods and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the 1,347 specimens initially sampled, 250 fell within the defined molting periods and were excluded from final analyses, leaving 1,097 usable samples within the nonmolting monthly ranges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, black carbon levels are highest during winter months (8, 15), such that the period of heaviest accumulation on feathers occurs directly after the molt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seasonal coincidence likely obscures a monthly pattern of accumulation, but further work is needed to fully understand how birds seasonally accumulate and retain soot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since no month-to-month trends were apparent within the designated nonmolting months, specimens were placed into groups organized by year (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To integrate data across species, we normalized inverse raw reflectance values by calculating z scores within each species set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The z score for each specimen is defined as: (inverse raw reflectance value for an individual  inverse mean reflectance value for the species)/(SD of inverse reflectance for the species).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inverse reflectance was used rather than reflectance to better visualize drops in black carbon deposition, which register as an increase in reflectance and a decrease in inverse reflectance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the normalized dataset, we estimated a trend in black carbon deposition through time using a generalized additive model (GAM) in the mgcv R package (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Historical_Trends_in_Black_Carbon_and_Environmental_History  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results show that black carbon deposition on bird specimens peaked during the first decade of the 20th century (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This peak is consistent with the Greenland ice-core record, anecdotal accounts, and surveys conducted in Chicago and Pittsburgh during the second decade of the 20th century, all of which indicate modest improvements in air quality after 1910 despite a steady increase in overall coal consumption (22, 23) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black carbon accumulation on specimens remained high through the 1920s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first precipitous drop in deposition coincided with a temporary reduction in overall coal consumption during the Great Depression, which rebounded during World War II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second and lasting drop in deposition began in the postwar period, with coal consumption declining as other fossil fuels gained traction (Fig 2 and see Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second drop in black carbon deposition continues to present day, despite subsequent increases in coal consumption (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sharp drop in atmospheric black carbon is consistent with the midcentury drop recovered in the Greenland ice-core record and predicted in Bond et al., 2007 (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Greenland ice-core record also identifies forest fires as a historical source of atmospheric black carbon, but the associated emissions were comparatively low through our study period (15), such that their influence on our trend would be minimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From 1880 to 1910, black carbon deposition is not strongly correlated with coal consumption (Fig 2 and Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show high black carbon levels with only a slight upward trend across these three decades, despite a sharp increase in coal consumption over the same period (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While ambient concentrations of black carbon hit a historical peak in this period, the relatively constant levels of black carbon on specimens suggest that period reforms and antismoke initiatives registered a modest mitigating effect, reducing the growth in black carbon levels relative to consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toward the end of the 19th century, civic reformers organized to combat urban smoke pollution (2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1881, Chicago and Cincinnati passed the first municipal smoke ordinances in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These laws focused on regulating emissions, but they exempted residential burning and proved difficult to enforce (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 1910, most cities in the US Manufacturing Belt had established municipal departments specifically devoted to smoke abatement (3), and reform efforts began to expand beyond litigation to encompass education and technology-based solutions (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From 1910 to 1960, black carbon deposition was positively correlated with trends in coal consumption (Fig 2 and Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this period, reform efforts focused on curbing emissions through education and by promoting technologies to burn coal more efficiently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these concerted efforts to rein in soot emissions, our data confirm that the overall concentration of atmospheric black carbon remained tied to coal consumption through midcentury (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that efforts to regulate emissions directly were largely ineffective at reducing overall levels of atmospheric black carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the second half of the 20th century, black carbon deposition on specimens became decoupled from coal consumption (Fig 2 and Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As consumption began to rise again in the postwar period, atmospheric black carbon continued to decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decoupling can be explained by a new approach to city-level legislation, which targeted the types of fuel consumed in both domestic and industrial sectors rather than regulating emissions directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New regulations addressed the distribution of bituminous coal and mandated that consumers of soft coals use mechanical stokers or switch to smokeless fuels (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reforms effectively eliminated bituminous coal as a fuel source from residential furnaces, which are estimated to have produced over half of black carbon emissions during the early 20th century (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The success of these new regulations was contingent upon providing economically viable fuel alternatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a successful model implemented in St. Louis in 1940, Pittsburgh began subsidizing harder, low-volatile coal for domestic use in 1946 (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  St. Louis had seen the benefits of this new approach almost immediately, experiencing an 83.5% decrease in the total hours of thick atmospheric soot during the winter of 194041 (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following WWII, US cities also began transitioning to alternative fuel sources, specifically petroleum and natural gas (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 1950, 66% of households in Pittsburgh were heated with natural gas, up from 17% a decade earlier (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Around the same time, electricity production in the United States shifted away from scattered, coal-powered steam boilers to centralized power plants (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these plants were more efficient, they drove the steady rise in coal consumption in the second half of the 20th century as they met the increasing demands for electricity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the increased availability of fuel alternatives and the centralization of power production account for the decoupling of coal consumption from black carbon deposition on specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While soot mitigation in the United States took decades to achieve, the solutions proved to be relatively straightforward: Regulate the types of fuel consumed and promote affordable alternative fuel options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With black carbon levels declining by midcentury (Fig 2), the United States entered a new era of air pollution and environmental policy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decades of research and activism aimed at mitigating soot pollution culminated in the passage of the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955, the first federal air pollution legislation in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This act did not regulate or control pollution levels, but directed money toward research into air pollution, helping to establish a coordinated, national network to monitor air quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1963, the first incarnation of the Clean Air Act established federal limits on a variety of atmospheric pollutants, but by then, high levels of atmospheric black carbon had already receded (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Black_Carbon_Levels_Exceed_Predictive_Model_Estimates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results suggest that black carbon levels were higher at the start of the 20th century than estimates generated from predictive models (9, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Bond et al., 2007 (11) considered black carbon emissions on a national scale, our studies are largely comparable since their estimates for the United States are driven by bituminous coal, which was disproportionately consumed within the Manufacturing Belt (2, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 1880 and 1910, we recovered black carbon levels that were higher than the one estimated by Bond et al., 2007 (11) (Fig 2 and Fig S8A), a finding corroborated by the Greenland ice-core record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are consistent with the peak concentrations in the ice-core record during the first decade of the 20th century, but we recovered higher relative concentrations between 1880 and 1900.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy could be explained if certain types of particles precipitated from the atmosphere before reaching Greenland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lower estimates recovered by Bond et al., 2007 (11) are likely explained by the lack of reliable emissions data from the early industrial period used to parameterize predictive models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Bond et al., 2007 (11) acknowledge, this lack of data introduces high uncertainty into their model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, inconsistent burning practices and technology shifts across and within emitting sectors are difficult to account for in emission factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bond et al., 2007 (11) assumes that the burning efficiency for a given technology remains constant, without accounting for incremental improvements in operating procedures through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Operating efficiency became a key target of reform and education efforts after 1910, and our data suggest that these efforts did in fact register a modest mitigating effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emission factors in predictive models are thus limited in their ability to reflect real-world burning efficiency because of the inherent difficulties in quantifying variables like operating efficiency and asymmetric technology shifts throughout a given region or sector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our measurements are based on direct sampling of ambient concentrations, we are able to bypass assumptions about efficiency and technology implementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, translation of our measurements to emissions is not straightforward since, as with the ice-core record, the relationship between ambient concentrations and emissions depends on meteorological factors, which may have changed over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While our results show that current predictive models likely underestimate levels of atmospheric black carbon for the early industrial era, as consumption and emission factor data become more reliable through the 20th century, our results are positively correlated with predictive models (Fig 2 and Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1910, we recovered a trend in atmospheric black carbon that is strikingly consistent with the trend produced by Bond et al., 2007 (11) (Fig 2 and Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that predictive models effectively recover emissions when sufficient data exist to parameterize the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study thus provides support for the power of predictive modeling methods, while also indicating that black carbon emissions in the United States at the outset of the 20th century were higher than current estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that the climate-forcing effects of black carbon may also be underestimated for this period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Building_a_Usable_Emission_Inventory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A limitation of our current method is that reflectance values from specimens track relative trends in black carbon concentrations rather than recovering mass concentrations of atmospheric black carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calibrating reflectance to a standard unit of mass concentration represents a next step toward building a usable, spatially dynamic emission inventory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black carbon levels in Asian cities like Beijing and Delhi resemble those of the US Manufacturing Belt of a century ago (11), and we now have precise methods for measuring black carbon mass concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing contemporaneous measurements taken from these Asian cities with specimens collected from the same locations, our pre-1950 reflectance values could be calibrated to derive historical mass concentrations of black carbon from our sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once mass concentrations have been established, it would then become possible to estimate overall emissions for the region, although this step introduces additional challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ambient concentrations and emissions are related yet distinct measures, and the translation between the two requires consideration of local topography and meteorology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additional insights are discoverable through a more thorough material analysis of black carbon on birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size and shape of black carbon particles and aggregates define their optical properties and climate-forcing effects (1, 28), and thus knowing the historical size distribution of black carbon particles is critical for evaluating their climate impacts and building a usable emission inventory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Robust datasets of size distribution of black carbon particles, however, are similarly lacking before the 1950s, and these data are likewise difficult to predict with any certainty because particle size is dependent on a number of interacting variables, including the chemical composition of the fuel source, along with the technology and operating procedures used to burn the fuel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analyzing black carbon deposits on bird specimens for their physical properties, the size distribution from the early industrial era could be directly estimated for a given year and locale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data would be invaluable for developing more robust emission inventories of atmospheric black carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Photographing_Specimens  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specimens were imaged with a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (Sony a7R II) paired with a native 55 mm lens (Sonnar T* FE 55 mm F1.8 ZA), positioned at a fixed height of 72 cm over a self-contained light box (MK Digital Direct Photo-e-Box BIO) outfitted with 28-W continuous full-spectrum fluorescent bulbs (6,500 K, 84CRI) run through 120-V AC 60-Hz electronic ballasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens were illuminated by using top, side, and back bulbs in the light box, omitting the bottom (stage) bulbs and supplemental LED bulbs to ensure an even distribution of diffuse light from a single illuminant type source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the beginning of each imaging session, the lighting elements were turned on and allowed to warm up for 20 min before shooting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens were oriented so that the target area on the breast was positioned at the center of the cameras field of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light box was fully enclosed during each exposure, except for a rectangular aperture on the top, sized to fit the cameras field of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overhead lighting was turned off in each of the shooting locations, and windows were covered to further reduce ambient light leakage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The images were captured in 14-bit uncompressed raw format and analyzed by using RawDigger software (Version 1.2.11), which provides access to raw data directly recorded by the digital cameras CMOS sensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyzing the raw sensor data directly enabled us to bypass the linearization step described by Stevens et al., 2007, and McKay, 2013 (32, 33), since the raw values have not been altered by nonlinear gamma encoding algorithms that are introduced when raw sensor data are converted into conventional image formats, such as JPEG or TIFF (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before shooting, we tested the linearity of the cameras CMOS sensor following the procedure outlined in Stevens et al., 2007 (32) and we found that the sensor provided a linear response over the entire dynamic range (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exposure settings (shutter speed, aperture, and ISO) were optimized through a series of trials using reflectance standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted trials using four types of reflectance standards, including the XRite ColorChecker Passport (8-step), QPcard 101 (3-step), Labsphere Spectralon Diffuse Reflectance Standards (10 reference targets), and Munsell Neutral Value Scale matte finish (31-step).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that each standard provided comparable results, but we selected the Munsell Neutral Value Scale as our primary standards because it was relatively affordable, provided the largest number of reference points, and included published reflectance percentages printed directly on the cards for easy reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine exposure settings, we analyzed trial images in RawDigger with a goal of maximizing the dynamic range (defined as the distance between minimum and maximum light intensities) without introducing signal clipping on any of the color channels (R-G-B-G2), which occurs when certain clusters of pixels fall outside of the dynamic range due to overexposure (saturation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is essential to refer to the raw data when assessing whether signal clipping has occurred, since the channel-specific histograms on many digital cameras displays incorporate gamma-encoding algorithms that make it difficult to tell whether signal clipping has actually occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure settings maximizing dynamic range will often indicate overexposed areas on the cameras built-in displays, when no signal clipping in the raw file has taken place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ISO was set to 100 to ensure a limited amount of digital noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the trials, an aperture of f/16 was chosen to minimize optical vignetting (light falloff), which is introduced at lower focal ratios, while providing a depth of field that would ensure that the target area appeared in focus for all specimens, which varied in height due to differences in natural size and preparation of the specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these parameters in place, a shutter speed of 1/25 s was selected to maximize the dynamic range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the use of a light box ensured relatively even and continuous illumination compared with open studio lighting arrangements, perfectly consistent illumination is difficult to achieve in practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some unevenness was discovered in blank reference images, which was determined to have resulted from lens variables (optical vignetting and lens flare) and may have also been influenced by the arrangement of the bulbs in the light box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for these factors, the target area for each specimen was confined to a 3-×3-inch square, which limited variance in illumination to less_than1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under the constant lighting conditions that a light box provides, reflectance standards theoretically only need to be photographed once over the course of shooting to generate calibration regressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, however, some minor variations in overall illumination were discovered between the three locations, which may have been due to light leakage or slight variations in the voltage supply to the bulbs at each location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variation, however, was easily accounted for by imaging the Munsell Neutral Value Scale reflectance standards at each location and calculating reflectance values for specimens with location-specific reflectance regressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since reflectance is expressed as a percentage, and these percentage values are relative to the standards, no additional adjustments were needed to normalize the color channels or calibrate the values across shooting locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We photographed each card of the Munsell Neutral Value separately at The Field Museum and Carnegie Museum of Natural History, positioning each card at the center of the field of view in the same area where we measured reflectance from bird feathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine reflectance regressions from these locations, we used all 31 reflectance standards (ranging from 3.1 to 90% reflectance).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, we photographed the Munsell Neutral Value Scale fanned out in single photograph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this sample, we only included 12 reflectance steps (ranging from 9 to 84.2% reflectance) that fell within the target area (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Determining_the_Smoothing_Function_for_the_GAM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Smoothing parameters for GAMs can be determined in mgcv by using functions such as GCV that minimize residual deviance (goodness of fit) and degrees of freedom (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With our final dataset, the GAM estimated a smoothing function of k=10 (this model is plotted in Fig S10), which recovered a smoother curve than k=20 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oversmoothing, however, can obscure signals in the data (35, 36), which appears to be happening with k=10 based on our knowledge of likely inflection points (such as the 1929 US stock market crash) that are present in the consumption data and the Greenland ice-core record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reference, in Fig S10, we include a variety of smoothing functions from k=10 to k=100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the comparison of possible k values, k=10 appears to apply an overly powerful smoothing operation in the GAM, forcing the first decline of black carbon to begin in the early 1920s rather than the end of the decade where we would expect it to appear based on consumption trends; k=13 through k=35 recovers trends that are effectively identical, which appears to recover important signals in the data that over smoothing misses; k=36 and greater generate toothy trends that overrepresent random variations within the sample set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the variation in the shape of different GAMs, we selected a smoothing function of k=20 to produce a relatively smooth trend line that still maintained a distinctive shape that allowed for comparison against consumption data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

How_Sampling_Months_Were_Determined  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beginning in late summer, each species used in the study initiates an annual molt to replace worn and soiled body feathers with fresh plumage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This molting period can last through the fall months (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural variation in the timing of the molt produces a mix of birds with fresh and soiled plumage among specimens sampled from these months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This annual molt signal was apparent in our sample, with samples from fall months producing shifts in mean reflectance caused by the introduction of freshly molted birds, along with uncharacteristically broad ranges in reflectance values compared with other months (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Freshly molted individuals do not provide evidence for atmospheric conditions in a given year, warranting their removal from the final dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since freshly molted birds begin to accumulate particulate matter immediately after the molting cycle is complete, rather than selectively evaluating which individuals had recently molted, all of the specimens sampled during these months were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the months to exclude for each species based on abrupt shifts in mean reflectance between months, which are indicative of annual molting patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in Horned Larks, reflectance values shift abruptly between July and August and then increase again between November and December, indicating that the sample of birds in the months of AugustNovember includes a substantial number freshly molted individuals (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this method, the months of AugustNovember were excluded for Horned Larks and Red-headed Woodpeckers, and the months of SeptemberNovember were excluded for Field Sparrows, Grasshopper Sparrows, and Eastern Towhees (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could be confident in these shifts given their seasonal timing, since overall black carbon emissions seasonally trend in the opposite direction for a given year in the Northern Hemisphere, as fuel consumption increases to meet heating needs when average temperatures drop (8, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We limited this inquiry to the years 18801950 because after midcentury, birds are substantially cleaner in all months, compromising our ability to detect monthly breakpoints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Evidence_that_Bird_Specimens_Accumulated_Black_Carbon_from_the_Environment_Before_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To link reflectance data to black carbon levels for a single year, it had to be established that black carbon accumulation occurred before collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple lines of evidence indicated that the black carbon accumulated on bird specimens originated from the environment while the birds were alive and not from posthumous soiling or discoloration that occurred while being stored in a collection:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, these lines of evidence suggest that any posthumous soiling from sitting in museum storage is negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This research highlights the unexpected ways in which museum materials can yield insights about the physical and natural world and help address present-day environmental challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural history collections are powerful resources for tracking environmental pollutants through time (29, 30) because specimens provide durable snapshots of the past environments from which they were drawn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this study, bird specimens provided an incidental record of atmospheric black carbon from a period before standardized methods and coordinated systems for assessing air quality were in place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on the US Manufacturing Belt because of its historical importance as a polluting region, but our dataset can naturally be expanded to encompass other regions with long industrial histories, such as Western Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural history collections thus represent a unique resource for exploring past environments and environmental history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the purpose of this study, we used bird specimens as a direct sampling metric to assess historical concentrations of black carbon, which we used in turn to evaluate past environmental policy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study, however, also highlights the impact of environmental pollution on wildlife.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our samples show that black carbon particulate covered the landscape along with its living inhabitants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black carbon accumulation on birds has potential implications for evolutionary pathways because plumage is fundamental in avian displays and signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Birds use their plumage to attract mates, defend territories, and/or camouflage themselves within the landscape to escape detection from predators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What happens when bright, sexually selected plumage patches are coated in soot, obscuring plumage signals that have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What are the consequences of black carbon deposition for visual predators when animal prey coloration is homogenized with the surrounding environment?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How black carbon deposition on feathers has impacted signaling within and among species remains an open question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Reflectance has long been used as an efficient and reliable metric in atmospheric sampling (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the purposes of this study, we were interested in deriving relative ambient concentrations from black carbon deposition on bird feathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since black carbon is defined by its light-absorbing properties, trends of black carbon deposition on specimens can be quantified as a function of the reduction in reflectance relative to unsoiled specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We adapted photography methods from Stevens et al., 2007, and McKay, 2013 (32, 33) to quantify the reflectance of each specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For complete details of the materials and methods used to photograph specimens, see SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the reflectance value for each specimen from a digital image, we used regression equations calculated from reflectance standards to convert raw sensor data to known reflectance values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated R, G, and B channel-specific regressions from Munsell Neutral Value Scale reflectance standards in RawDigger (Version 1.2.11) for each of our three shooting locations: The Field Museum, Chicago; University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, Ann Arbor; and Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Pittsburgh (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our cameras CMOS sensor incorporates an additional G channel (G2), we averaged both G-channel values to produce a single G-channel regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equations for each regression line can be found in Fig S9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We uploaded the digital photograph of each specimen into RawDigger and sampled the uniform white patch on the ventral side of each specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recovered median raw R, G/G2, and B channel sensor values from a sampling area that ranged from 25 to 900 mm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since feathers are a textured, heterogeneous surface, median values were used to minimize any effect of outliers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each specimen, the sample area was determined by selecting a large continuous area without conspicuous portions of exposed skin, staining due to residual fat deposits, or other preparation and conservation issues (see Dataset S1 for sample areas).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the collection-specific regression equations to calculate reflectance values separately for R, G/G2, and B channels for each specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then averaged the three channel-specific reflectance values to obtain a composite reflectance value for each specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
