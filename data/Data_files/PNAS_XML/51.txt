A distinct pathway for tetrahymanol synthesis in bacteria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sterols and sterol-like lipids have critical physiological roles in both eukaryotes and bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cyclic lipids are also well preserved in ancient rocks and can function as microbial molecular fossils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gammacerane is one such lipid that is used as an indicator of water column stratification deep in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a proper interpretation of gammacerane biosignatures requires a full understanding of the biosynthesis and taxonomic distribution of one of its potential precursors, tetrahymanol, in modern microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we establish that bacterial tetrahymanol producers are more diverse than previously thought and demonstrate that bacteria have evolved a biochemical mechanism distinct from eukaryotes for synthesizing tetrahymanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tetrahymanol is a polycyclic triterpenoid lipid first discovered in the ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis whose potential diagenetic product, gammacerane, is often used as a biomarker for water column stratification in ancient ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria are also a potential source of tetrahymanol, but neither the distribution of this lipid in extant bacteria nor the significance of bacterial tetrahymanol synthesis for interpreting gammacerane biosignatures is known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we couple comparative genomics with genetic and lipid analyses to link a protein of unknown function to tetrahymanol synthesis in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tetrahymanol synthase (Ths) is found in a variety of bacterial genomes, including aerobic methanotrophs, nitrite-oxidizers, and sulfate-reducers, and in a subset of aquatic and terrestrial metagenomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the potential to produce tetrahymanol is more widespread in the bacterial domain than previously thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Ths is not encoded in any eukaryotic genomes, nor is it homologous to eukaryotic squalene-tetrahymanol cyclase, which catalyzes the cyclization of squalene directly to tetrahymanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, heterologous expression studies suggest that bacteria couple the cyclization of squalene to a hopene molecule by squalene-hopene cyclase with a subsequent Ths-dependent ring expansion to form tetrahymanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, bacteria and eukaryotes have evolved distinct biochemical mechanisms for producing tetrahymanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Tetrahymanol_Production_in_a_-Proteobacterium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum is an obligate aerobic methanotroph isolated from sediments of a hypersaline alkaline lake (31) whose genome encodes homologs of several hopanoid and sterol biosynthesis genes (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipid analysis of M. alcaliphilum revealed tetrahymanol and a putative 3-methyltetrahymanol in addition to an array of aminohopanoids, 3-methylaminohopanoids, and 4-methylsterols typically found in -Proteobacterial methanotrophs (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2) (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of tetrahymanol was unexpected because M. alcaliphilum is neither physiologically nor phylogenetically close to the Bradyrhizobiaceae family, the only bacteria known to synthesize tetrahymanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. alcaliphilum not only produces significantly more tetrahymanol than what is typically observed in the -Proteobacterial species (20, 21, 30) but also varies the amount of tetrahymanol under different culture conditions (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we observed an eightfold increase in tetrahymanol in stationary phase cells (day 5 of growth) compared with late exponential phase cells (day 1.5 of growth).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the higher levels of tetrahymanol production in M. alcaliphilum, this organism seemed ideal for pursuing studies to uncover potential tetrahymanol biosynthesis proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_a_Tetrahymanol_Synthase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify putative bacterial tetrahymanol biosynthesis proteins, we used comparative genomics to search for protein-encoding genes present in M. alcaliphilum, R. palustris, and B. japonicum but absent in bacteria that we have experimentally verified to produce hopanoids but not tetrahymanol (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant 31 M. alcaliphilum genes have no homologs (maximum e-value 1e-5) in tetrahymanol producing ciliates and other eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, one gene, encoding a hypothetical protein with no identifiable motifs (locus tag: MEALZ_1626), occurs in all Methylomicrobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Rhodopseudomonas genomes and exclusively in bacterial genomes also containing squalene-hopene cyclase (maximum e-value 1e-50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the genomic context of this protein does not demonstrate a link to lipid biosynthesis, its distribution pattern in bacterial genomes led us to hypothesize that MEALZ_1626 may play a role in tetrahymanol production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of this locus in M. alcaliphilum resulted in a loss of tetrahymanol but not hopanoids (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, placing the MEALZ_1626 gene in a permissible site on the chromosome of the deletion strain restored production of tetrahymanol (Fig S3A), indicating that this gene, renamed ths for tetrahymanol synthase, encodes a protein that is specifically required to produce tetrahymanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Homologs of M. alcaliphilum Ths are present in 104 bacterial genomes in three different phyla (Table S1), including several -Proteobacteria (Rhodopseudomonas, Bradyrhizobium, Nitrobacter, Afipia, Agromonas, and Rhodovulum species), aerobic methanotrophic -Proteobacteria (Methylomonas and Methylomicrobium species), and sulfate-reducing -Proteobacteria (Desulfovibrio species).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of ths in the sulfate-reducing Desulfovibrio was surprising; several strains of these anaerobic bacteria synthesize hopanoids, but there are no reports of tetrahymanol production (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, lipid analysis verified that Desulfovibrio inopinatus is capable of producing trace amounts of tetrahymanol (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An unrooted maximum likelihood tree of Ths amino acid sequences from cultured organisms (Fig 2A and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5A and S6) indicates that there are two divergent lineages of Ths: one comprises the -Proteobacteria, and a second comprises the -Proteobacterial methanotrophs and -Proteobacterial sulfate-reducing bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that Ths homologs in the -Proteobacteria are truly involved in tetrahymanol synthesis, we deleted the R. palustris TIE-1 ths homolog (locus tag: Rpal_0860, 28% identity and 43% similarity to M. alcaliphilum Ths).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetrahymanol production was lost in the R. palustris ths strain (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of ths from a plasmid restored tetrahymanol biosynthesis in the mutant, verifying that this protein is a bona fide tetrahymanol synthase in the -Proteobacteria phyla as well (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better understand the types of ecosystems tetrahymanol-producing bacteria might inhabit, we searched for homologs of Ths in environmental metagenomes (2,606 total JGI environmental metagenomes; e-value cutoff: 1e-05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 472 potential Ths homologs in 35 different metagenomes (Fig 3 and Table S2) including 25 soil, 8 freshwater, and 2 marine metagenomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An unrooted maximum likelihood tree constructed with a subset of Ths metagenome and genome sequences (Fig S5B) demonstrates that the majority of soil metagenome Ths homologs clustered within the -Proteobacterial clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clustering suggests that these bacteria are a potential source of tetrahymanol in terrestrial environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few freshwater lake sequences also clustered within the -Proteobacteria, but those associated with methanotrophy (e.g., Lake Washington samples) were more closely related to the -Proteobacterial methanotrophs (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the distribution of Ths in metagenomes seems to reflect the environmental distribution of the Ths-containing cultured bacteria as shown in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tetrahymanol_Synthase_Mechanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our genetic analyses indicate that ths is required for tetrahymanol biosynthesis in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned above, the squalene-hopene cyclase is also required, but it is unclear if any additional characteristics of Shc or the cellular environment in tetrahymanol-producing bacteria are necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we expressed M. alcaliphilum ths in two hopanoid-producing strains that typically do not synthesize tetrahymanol, the -Proteobacterium Methylococcus capsulatus Bath (36) and the -Proteobacterium Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ths+ strains produced tetrahymanol (Fig 4), demonstrating that ths is sufficient to induce tetrahymanol biosynthesis in hopanoid-producing bacteria and that the occurrence of both ths and shc in a genome is a strong indicator of tetrahymanol production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, it still remained unclear how Shc and Ths together catalyzed the conversion of squalene to tetrahymanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mechanism in which Ths demethylates squalene at the C-23 position to generate C(23)-norsqualene before cyclization by Shc (Fig 5A) is plausible based on in vitro studies (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this mechanism would require addition of the C-23 methyl group after cyclization to form tetrahymanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more straightforward scenario would require Shc to first cyclize squalene to a hopene, such as diploptene (27, 28), and then Ths would convert this hopene to tetrahymanol via a ring expansion (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test these two possibilities, we first engineered Escherichia coli to produce high levels of squalene by introducing a plasmid that expresses the M. alcaliphilum squalene synthase (sqs) gene as well as a second plasmid that increases overall isoprenoid synthesis (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strain, also expressing M. alcaliphilum ths from a third plasmid, did not demethylate or otherwise modify squalene, nor did it produce tetrahymanol, indicating that Ths was not directly using squalene as a substrate (Fig 5B and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next modified this E. coli strain to produce hopenes by introducing a plasmid that expresses both M. alcaliphilum sqs and shc and found that expression of M. alcaliphilum ths in this system resulted in tetrahymanol production (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Ths is converting a hopene to tetrahymanol rather than modifying squalene before cyclization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The discovery of tetrahymanol synthase demonstrates the effectiveness of combining comparative genomics and classical genetics with organic geochemistry to link gene identity to novel protein functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a critical need for these types of studies given the rapid rate at which acquisition of genomic data are currently outpacing the assignment of hypothetical protein function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tetrahymanol synthase case is particularly compelling because this protein has no known motifs or characterized homologs, nor does the genomic context provide any clues to its involvement in lipid synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, without the framework provided by lipid analysis and comparative genomics it would have been difficult to link the ths open reading frame with tetrahymanol biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings also indicate that tetrahymanol biosynthesis has experienced convergent evolution with eukaryotes and bacteria developing distinct mechanisms for producing the same molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of the biochemical mechanism involved in catalyzing the conversion of squalene to tetrahymanol by Ths and Shc will prove useful in better constraining the evolutionary history of cyclic triterpenoid biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that Ths is functioning by expanding the E ring of a hopene after cyclization of squalene by Shc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot yet distinguish which hopene is converted to tetrahymanol, a ring expansion of diploptene through the protonation of the C-22 double bond to propagate a carbocation seems most likely as this mechanism is similar to what occurs in the formation of the C ring during cyclization of squalene to hopene by Shc (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because Ths has no identifiable motifs that could be responsible for protonation of the diploptene double bond, further studies of the structure and function of Ths may reveal novel protein folds or biochemical mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analysis of Ths distribution in genomes and metagenomes demonstrates that the potential for tetrahymanol production is more widespread in the bacterial domain than previously thought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that Ths homologs are present in a variety of -Proteobacteria typically found in soil environments associated with plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the majority of metagenomic Ths homologs we identify in this study tend to cluster within the -Proteobacteria clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, tetrahymanol-producing -Proteobacteria are potentially a significant source of tetrahymanol in terrestrial systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low abundance of Ths homologs in marine metagenomes, despite the presence of ths in a few marine bacterial isolates (Table S1), suggests that bacterial tetrahymanol production may not be common in modern marine ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this restricted distribution may be a result of biases in the available genomic and metagenomic databases rather than a true accounting of tetrahymanol-producing bacteria in these ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As more metagenomes become publicly available, we may see an increase in environmental Ths sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the genomic and metagenomic data we have now suggest that marine ciliates may be the predominant depositional source of tetrahymanol in marine environments (42), whereas bacterial sources may be significant in terrestrial or lacustrine ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The production of tetrahymanol in aerobic methanotrophs and sulfate-reducing bacteria is also notable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, not all aerobic methanotroph or sulfate-reducing bacterial genomes have a Ths homolog, indicating that only a subset of these taxa have the potential to produce tetrahymanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physiological studies aimed at understanding why only certain methanotroph or sulfate-reducing bacterial species produce tetrahymanol may demonstrate a correlation between this lipid and specific environmental niches or physiological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, recent studies have documented the occurrence of aerobic methanotrophs in the suboxic zone of stratified marine and freshwater water bodies, whereas sulfate-reducing bacteria are often found in the anoxic sediments of these systems (4348).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, tetrahymanol synthesis in bacteria may be functionally linked to these types of stratified environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is significant because the gammacerane index is used primarily as an indicator of stratified conditions in ancient ecosystems (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of Ths enables physiological studies to directly test a potential link between environmental conditions and tetrahymanol in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can now characterize levels of ths expression as well as phenotypes of ths gene deletion mutants in cultured strains under environmental conditions relevant to water stratification (e.g., high salinity, suboxic, or sulfidic).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ths can be used as a genetic marker to probe for the capability of bacterial tetrahymanol biosynthesis in stratified environments and also for environmental transcriptomic studies to assess how changes in these ecosystems affect ths expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a functional link can be established in bacteria between tetrahymanol and a response to specific environmental parameters relevant to water stratification, then gammacerane would continue to function as a robust indicator of water stratification conditions regardless of whether the depositional source was bacterial or eukaryotic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Construction_of_Tetrahymanol_Synthase_Mutants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A homologous recombination-based selection/counterselection method previously used in M. capsulatus was used to delete the MEALZ_1626 locus in M. alcaliphilum (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deletion plasmid pJW002 was transferred into M. alcaliphilum via conjugation using the donor strain E. coli BW29427, a dap auxotroph, as described in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50 and 51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Merodiploids with pJW002 integrated into the M. alcaliphilum chromosome were selected on HS-NMS plates containing gentamicin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single gentamicin-resistant colonies were cultured without antibiotic for 3 d to allow excision of pJW002 from the chromosome and then plated on HS-NMS supplemented with 5% (wt/vol) sucrose to select for the loss of the sacB gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MEALZ_1626 deletion mutants were identified by screening sucrose-resistant colonies by PCR with primers internal to the MEALZ_1626 and flanking the boundaries of the construct (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same selection/counterselection method described above was used to delete Rpal_0860 in R. palustris TIE-1 as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28 using plasmid pVW135 (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Heterologous_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
M. capsulatus Bath strains harboring pSRKGm or pSRKGm-ths (pABB238) were cultured in 50 mL NMS supplemented with gentamicin, and expression was induced at midexponential phase with 100 µM IPTG for 16 h. B. phytofirmans PsJN strains harboring pSRK-lacUV5 (pABB251) or pSRK-lacUV5-ths (pABB261) were cultured on 0.2X TSB plates supplemented with gentamicin and 100 µM IPTG for 48 h after which colonies were harvested from two plates for lipid extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli DH10B strains harboring three plasmids, pTrc99a, pTrc-sqs (pABB303), or pTrc-sqs-shc (pABB305); pSRK-lacUV5 (pABB251) or pSRK-lacUV5-ths (pABB261); and pJBEI2997 (Addgene plasmid 35151) (41), were cultured in 5 mL TB supplemented with chloramphenicol, carbenicillan, and gentamicin until midexponential phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression was induced with 500 µM IPTG for 69 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lipid_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min (50 mL of methanotrophs, 20 mL of R. palustris, 40 mL of D. inopinatus, or 5 mL of E. coli), and cell pellets were stored at 20 °C before lipid extraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were resuspended in 2 mL of deionized water and transferred to a solvent washed Teflon centrifuge tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five milliliters of methanol and 2.5 mL of dichloromethane were added, and the cell mixture was sonicated for 1 h. Ten milliliters of deionized water and 10 mL of dichloromethane were added to samples after sonication, mixed, and incubated at 20 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 2,800 × g, and the organic layer was transferred to a 40-mL baked glass vial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total lipid extract was evaporated under N2 and derivatized to acetate esters by incubating in 100 L of 1:1 acetic anhydride:pyridine for 1 h at 70 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were dried under N2 after derivatization and resuspended in 100200 L of dichloromethane before analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C-30 hopanoids, methylsterols, and tetrahymanol were analyzed via high-temperature gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetrahymanol was quantified by comparison with a cholestanol standard added to samples before derivatization and was normalized to the largest hopene peak detected in the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipid extracts were separated on an Agilent 7890B Series GC with helium as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.2 mL/min and programmed as follows: 100 °C for 2 min, ramp 15 °C/min to 320 °C, and hold 28 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first analysis of M. alcaliphilum extracts was done on a DB5-HT column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  × 0.1 m film thickness) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All subsequent analyses of M. alcaliphilum and other bacterial extracts were done on a DB17-HT column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  × 0.125 m film thickness) to allow for better separation of the desmethyl and 2-methylhopanoids in R. palustris extracts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two microliters of the sample were injected into a Gerstel-programmable temperature vaporization (PTV) injector, operated in splitless mode at 320 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GC was coupled to a 5977A Series MSD with the source at 230 °C and operated at 70 eV in EI mode scanning from 50 to 850 Da in 0.5 s. Aminohopanoids were detected via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry at the Vincent Coates Foundation Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Stanford University (mass-spec.stanford.edu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All lipids were identified based on their retention time and comparison with previously published spectra (33, 52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bioinformatics_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The JGI Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) phylogenetic profiler (img.jgi.doe.gov) was used to identify M. alcaliphilum 20Z proteins with homologs found in the genomes of R. palustris TIE-1 and B. japonicum USDA110 but not found in M. capsulatus Bath, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus Pal5, Methylosarcina lacus, Methylomonas methanica, or Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetrahymanol synthase homologs were detected in the IMG genomic and metagenomics databases by BLASTP (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geneious (Biomatters Limited) was used to align protein sequences from genomes via MUSCLE (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metagenomic Ths protein sequences were aligned to genomic Ths sequences via MAFFT (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/) (56), and redundancy in the alignments was reduced through the Decrease Redundancy Program (web.expasy.org/decrease_redundancy/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence similarities from MUSCLE-aligned sequences were rendered using ESPript 3.0 (espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/) (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large gaps from metagenomics sequence alignments were removed via GBLOCKS (molevol.cmima.csic.es/castresana/Gblocks_server.html) (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximum likelihood trees were constructed by PhyML (59) using the LG+gamma model, four gamma rate categories, 10 random starting trees, NNI branch swapping, and substitution parameters estimated from the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ths trees were generated and edited by importing the resulting PhyML trees into iTOL (itol.embl.de/) (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Plasmid_Cloning_and_Mutagenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plasmids were constructed by digestion of PCR products and vectors with restriction enzymes (NEB) followed by purification and ligation with T4 DNA ligase (NEB) or by sequence and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC), adapted from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, complementary overhangs were created on gel-purified PCR product inserts and a restriction enzyme-linearized vector by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase (EMD Millipore) in the absence of nucleotides followed by annealing and transformation without ligation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site-directed mutagenesis of plasmids was performed by DNA synthesis with 2.5 U PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Stratagene), one oligonucleotide (0.2 M) encoding the desired change, 0.2 mM dNTPs, and 50 ng plasmid DNA in a 25-L reaction with a 1 min/kb extension time at 68 °C, followed by DpnI digestion and transformation by electroporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

E. coli strains were transformed by electroporation using a MicroPulser Electroporator (BioRad) as recommended by the supplier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmids were transferred into M. capsulatus Bath, B. phytofirmans PsJN, and R. palustris TIE-1 via conjugation using the DAP auxotroph BW29427 (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Thirty-milliliter starter cultures of M. alcaliphilum were grown for 2 d at 30 °C in HS-NMS and used to inoculate 50 mL of HS-NMS in a 250-mL serum bottle (2% inoculum, in quadruplicate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth at 30 °C for 5 d was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm of a 200-L aliquot in a Synergy 2 Microplate Reader (BioTek).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
