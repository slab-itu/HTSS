Greater Internet use is not associated with faster growth in political polarization among US demographic groups  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By many measures, Americans have become increasingly polarized in recent decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We study the role of the Internet and social media in explaining this trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that polarization has increased the most among the demographic groups least likely to use the Internet and social media, suggesting that the role of these factors is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We combine eight previously proposed measures to construct an index of political polarization among US adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that polarization has increased the most among the demographic groups least likely to use the Internet and social media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our overall index and all but one of the individual measures show greater increases for those older than 65 than for those aged 1839.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linear model estimated at the age-group level implies that the Internet explains a small share of the recent growth in polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_and_Measures_of_Polarization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our primary sources of data are the ANES 19482012 Time Series Cumulative, 2008 Time Series Study, 2012 Time Series Study, and 2016 Time Series Study datasets (3639).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Code for replication is available as Dataset S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data can be accessed via the respective institutions outlined here and in the references.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ANES is a nationally representative, face-to-face survey of the voting-age population that is conducted in both preelection and postelection rounds and contains numerous demographic variables and political measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2012 and 2016 ANES surveys include a separate sample of respondents who completed the survey online; we drop these respondents to maintain consistency across years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also restrict the ANES data to presidential election years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We supplement the ANES data with survey microdata on social media use from the Pew Research Center that covers the years 2005, 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also use Pew Research Center survey microdata on Internet use in each presidential election year between 1996 and 2016 (4047).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our primary measures of Internet use are an indicator of Internet use from the ANES, an indicator for obtaining campaign information online from the ANES, and an indicator for social media use from the Pew Research Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some analysis also uses an indicator for Internet use from the Pew Research Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, section 1 contains additional details on the construction of these indicators, including information about changes in question wording across survey waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measures_of_Political_Polarization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculate eight measures of polarization that have been used in past work and have increased in recent years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each case, we try to reconstruct the measures exactly as proposed in past work and only intentionally deviate where explicitly stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide an overview of each measure here, relegating additional details to SI Appendix, sections 1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In computing each polarization measure, we restrict the sample to respondents with valid, nonmissing responses to each of the relevant questions used in constructing the measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the exact sample used varies across polarization measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the ANES codebooks definition of a valid, nonmissing response, except for the self-reported ideology measure, where we treat individuals who respond Dont know or Havent though much about it as having a missing response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observations are weighted by using the ANES survey weights unless otherwise stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our first two measures of polarization use the ANES thermometer ratings of parties and ideologies to capture how respondents feelings toward those on the other side of the political spectrum have changed over time (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ANES thermometer scale ranges from 0 to 100, with higher values reflecting more positive feelings toward the specified group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Partisan affect polarization is the sum of the mean differences, taken separately for Republicans and Democrats, between the favorability of individuals toward their own party and their favorability toward the opposite party.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leaners, respondents who initially report not having a party affiliation but who subsequently report leaning toward one party, are included with their associated parties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ideological affect polarization is the sum of the mean differences, taken separately for liberals and conservatives, between the favorability of individuals toward their own ideological group and their favorability toward the opposite ideological group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those who identify as strict moderates on the 7-point ideological scale are excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Partisan sorting captures the association between self-reported partisan identity and self-reported ideology (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is defined to be the average absolute difference between partisan identity and ideology (both measured on a 7-point scale), after weighting by the strength of partisan and ideological affiliation and transforming the measure to range between 0 (low partisan sorting) and 1 (high partisan sorting).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Partisan-ideology polarization is closely related to partisan sorting and captures the extent to which the self-reported ideological affiliation of Republicans and Democrats differ (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is defined to be the average ideological affiliation of Republicans (excluding leaners) on a 7-point liberal-to-conservative scale minus the average ideological affiliation of Democrats (excluding leaners) on the same 7-point scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Perceived partisan-ideology polarization captures the extent to which respondents perceive ideological differences between the parties (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is defined to be the average perceived ideology of the Republican Party minus the average perceived ideology of the Democratic Party, each on a 7-point liberal-to-conservative scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Issue consistency and issue divergence measure the extent to which individuals issue positions line up on a single ideological dimension (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Issue consistency is the average absolute value of the sum of seven responses, with each valid response defined as conservative (coded as 1), moderate (coded as 0), or liberal (coded as 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The responses are to a question about self-reported ideology and to questions about the following six policy issues: aid to blacks, foreign defense spending, governments role in guaranteeing jobs and income, government health insurance, government services and spending, and abortion legislation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Issue divergence is the average of the unweighted correlations between these same seven responses and an indicator for Republican affiliation, among Republican and Democratic affiliates (including leaners).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Straight-ticket voting captures the frequency with which individuals split their votes across parties in an election (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is defined to be the survey-weighted proportion of voting respondents who report voting for the same party (Republican or Democratic) in both the presidential and House elections of a given year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We define an overall index of polarization Mt equal to the average of these eight measures in year t, normalizing each measure by its value in 1996:Mt=1|M|mMmtm1996.Here, M is the set of all eight polarization measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also compute this index for different groups of respondents, in which case we continue to normalize by the 1996 value in the full sample m1996.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SI Appendix, Table S1 reports a correlation matrix for the individual polarization measures mt and the index across presidential election years from 1972 to 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1 plots each measure of polarization and the index from 1972 to 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By design, all of the measures we include show an overall growth in polarization, with the index growing by 0.28 index points between 1996 and 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that the index grew about as quickly in the decade before 1996 as the decade after it, a pattern also exhibited by many of the individual measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Trends_in_Internet_and_Social_Media_Use  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 shows trends in Internet and social media use by age group between 1996 and 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the ANES or the Pew Research Center survey weights when constructing each internet measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2, Left, shows trends in Internet use with data from the ANES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (SI Appendix, Fig S1 shows the analogous trends using the Pew Research Center data.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Internet use question was first asked in 1996, when less_than40% of 1839 y olds used the Internet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This figure shows that the elderly (65+) have substantially lower levels of Internet use across all years and that the levels are even lower for those aged 75+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2, Center, shows that the contrast is even starker when looking at whether respondents obtained campaign information online; 75% of 1839 y olds report having obtained information about the 2016 presidential campaign online, as opposed to less_than40% of those aged 65+ and less_than20% of those aged 75+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2, Right, shows trends in social media use between 2005 and 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, older respondents have substantially lower levels of social media use than younger respondents, with a more than fourfold difference between the oldest and youngest groups in 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Trends_in_Polarization_by_Demographic_Group  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By_Age  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3 shows trends in our polarization index by age group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 provides additional quantitative detail, and SI Appendix, Fig S2 shows analogous plots for the individual polarization measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 1996 and 2016, polarization grew by 0.23, 0.23, and 0.47 index points, respectively, among those aged 1839, 4064, and 65+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bootstrap standard errors show that we can reject, at the 5% level, the hypothesis that the increase for those aged 1839 is equal to the increase for those aged 65+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For every measure except perceived partisan ideology, the oldest age group experienced larger changes in polarization than the youngest age group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Focusing on partisan affect polarization, an especially important measure, we see in Table 1 that the change in partisan affect is monotone in age category, with the change among those 65+ more than three times that for 1839 y olds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3S5, we present plots analogous to Fig 3 using cohorts instead of age groups, restricting the sample to males or females, restricting the sample to those who self-identify with a party, and restricting the sample to those who self-identify as being very much interested in the upcoming election.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SI Appendix, Fig S6, we show that the trends between the 1839 and 65+ age groups track fairly closely across the entire 19722016 time period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

By_Predicted_Internet_Use  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4 shows trends in polarization according to a broad index of predicted Internet use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suppose thatPr(internetit=1|Xit)=Xit,[1]where internetit is the ANES indicator for Internet use for respondent i in survey year t,  is a vector of parameters, and Xit is a vector of characteristics including indicators for survey year, age group, gender, race, education, and whether an individual lives in the political South.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 using weighted least squares on the sample of the ANES respondents between 1996 and 2016 with valid responses to the questions used to construct each variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Coefficient estimates and variable definitions are reported in SI Appendix, Table S2.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compute predicted Internet use internet^it for each respondent with valid covariate responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 plots the polarization index for respondents in the first and fourth quartiles of internet^it for each respective survey year t. We see that the polarization level for the top quartile (the group most likely to use the Internet) is substantially larger than that of the bottom quartile, even in 1996 when only a small percentage of the population obtained campaign information online.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with previous literature which suggests that users of the Internet and social media are a selected group (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that respondents in the bottom quartile have experienced larger changes in polarization between 1996 and 2016 than respondents in the top quartile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S2 shows analogous plots for the individual polarization measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Model_of_Internet_s_Impact_on_Polarization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the role of the Internet in explaining the rise in polarization, we consider the following linear model:E(Mtg|g,stg,t)=g+t+stg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]Here, Mtg denotes polarization for group g in year t, g is a group-specific intercept,  is a coefficient on a linear time trend t relative to 1996, and  is a coefficient on a measure stg of the extent of Internet or social media use in group g in year t.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimate the model via ordinary least squares (OLS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Years t are the presidential election years between 1996 and 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Groups g are the 1839, 4064, and 65+ age groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimate the model with and without the constraint that =0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing the value ^c estimated with the constraint to the value ^ estimated without the constraint, we arrive at an estimate (^c^)/^c of the share of the linear trend that can be accounted for by an effect of the Internet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 2 presents the point estimate and 95% CI of the ratio (^c^)/^c for each of the three measures stg shown in Fig 2, plus the additional measure of internet use from the Pew Research Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Table S3 presents the values of all estimated parameters of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, with and without the constraint that =0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For all Internet measures except the ANES measure of Internet use, we find that the point estimate is negative, indicating that allowing for an effect of the Internet increases the estimated time trend, and our CIs rule out the Internet explaining 17% of the linear time trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the ANES measure of Internet use, our point estimate indicates that the Internet explains a modest 6% of the time trend, with wide CIs that include much larger values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7S10 show the observed and predicted values from each unconstrained model, along with an estimated counterfactual in which we assume that stg remains constant at its 1996 level throughout the time period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The counterfactuals support a limited role for the Internet in explaining the change in polarization between 1996 and 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SI Appendix, Table S4 presents sensitivity analysis for the findings in Table 2 in which we successively modify two assumptions in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2: that each group is affected only by its own Internet use, and that the effect of Internet is equal across groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many authors point to the Internet in general and social media in particular as possible drivers of political polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that polarization has increased the most among the groups least likely to use the Internet and social media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under appropriate assumptions, these facts can be shown to imply a limited role for the Internet and social media in explaining the recent rise in measured political polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
