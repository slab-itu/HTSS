Myosin-1E interacts with FAK proline-rich region 1 to induce fibronectin-type matrix  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is an intensely studied protein involved in many medically relevant biological processes, including cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the large interest in FAK, a promising strategy to target FAK therapeutically is elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that a region within the FAK protein that contains autophosphorylation site tyrosine (Y) 397 is essential for FAK activity in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myosin-1E (MYO1E), an actin-dependent molecular motor protein, directly interacts with FAK to induce Y397 autophosphorylation, which, in turn, causes changes in gene expression commonly observed in aggressive cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings are significant because they further delineate FAK function in vivo and identify the MYO1EFAK interaction as a possible Achilles heel for cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in development and human disease, including cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is currently thought that the four-point one, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM)kinase domain linker, which contains autophosphorylation site tyrosine (Y) 397, is not required for in vivo FAK function until late midgestation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we directly tested this hypothesis by generating mice with FAK Y397-to-phenylalanine (F) mutations in the germline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Y397F embryos exhibited reduced mesodermal fibronectin (FN) and osteopontin expression and died during mesoderm development akin to FAK kinase-dead mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified myosin-1E (MYO1E), an actin-dependent molecular motor, to interact directly with the FAK FERM-kinase linker and induce FAK kinase activity and Y397 phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active FAK in turn accumulated in the nucleus where it led to the expression of osteopontin and other FN-type matrix in both mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human melanoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support a model in which FAK Y397 autophosphorylation is required for FAK function in vivo and is positively regulated by MYO1E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

FAK_Y397F_Embryos_Die_Early_During_Mesoderm_Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the contribution of the FAK FERM-kinase domain linker to FAK function in vivo, Y397 was substituted with the nonphosphorylatable amino acid phenylalanine (F) in the germline of mice (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although mice heterozygous for the Y397F mutation displayed no apparent phenotype, their intercross failed to produce live homozygous offspring (Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Timed matings revealed that the development of homozygous FAK Y397F embryos stalled at embryonic day (E) 9.5 with a phenotype characterized by hemorrhage, an unorganized somite structure, and an enlarged and unfused allantois (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-mount 3D imaging of CD31-immunostained blood vessels in FAK Y397F embryos demonstrated severely malformed or absent intersomitic vessels (Fig 1B) and a lack of small vascular networks (Fig 1C and Movies S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FAK Y397F yolk sacs were without differentiated blood vessels (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phenotype of FAK Y397F resembled the phenotype of fibronectin (FN)-deficient embryos (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because FAK has been shown to mediate FN expression (14) and an FN-rich matrix is critical for angiogenesis (13), we tested whether the vascular phenotype of FAK Y397F embryos was accompanied by an abnormal FN-type matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that FN protein was substantially reduced in cryosections of E9.5 FAK Y397F embryos (Fig 1E), whereas laminin and collagen expression was unchanged (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using quantitative PCR on whole-embryoderived RNA at E9.5 to screen for other ECM affected by FAK Y397F, we found a strong mutation-induced reduction in the expression of osteopontin (SPP1; Fig 1F), an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide-containing ligand of FN-binding integrins involved in angiogenesis and bone formation (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data showed that the FAK FERM-kinase linker is required for normal mesoderm development and the expression of FN-type ECM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FAK_Proline-Rich_Region_1_Binds_Myosin_1E_Through_Arginine_358_and_Prolines_371_and_374  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we wanted to define the protein complex that forms at the FERM-kinase linker to promote FAK function through Y397 and induce FN-type ECM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify FAK linker interacting protein(s), we used stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), followed by pull-down experiments with synthesized FAK linker peptide (amino acids 358409; Fig 2A) or scrambled peptide (to identify nonspecific interactors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein identification and quantification was by mass spectrometry-based proteomics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among proteins that bound specifically to phospho-Y397 FAK peptide were SRC, actinin-4 (ACTN4), and myosin-1E (MYO1E) (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these proteins, only MYO1E bound to nonphosphorylated FAK peptide versus scrambled peptide (Fig S2A) and equally well to phospho-Y397 and nonphosphorylated FAK peptides (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the binding of SRC, MYO1E, and ACTN4 to FAK peptides was direct or indirect, we produced GST-tagged recombinant protein and pursued in vitro binding studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that recombinant GST-tagged ACTN4 did not bind FAK peptides directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the proteomics data, full-length SRC-GST precipitated with phospho-Y397, but not nonphosphorylated FAK peptide (Fig 2C) or FAK Y397F peptide (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MYO1E, the third identified FAK interacting protein, is one of only two class I myosins that contain an SH3 domain (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYO1E has previously been shown to localize to integrin adhesions (17) and to colocalize with paxillin in cancer cell invadosomes (16), where it promotes receptor-mediated endocytosis (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WM858 melanoma cells, a BRAFV600E cell line that expresses high amounts of FN and SPP1 (19), MYO1E organized into rosette-like structures surrounding a paxillin core (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FAK and MYO1E colocalized in a confocal plane at the interface of the core and rosette (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endogenous FAK from adherent or suspended cells coimmunoprecipitated with full-length MYO1E irrespective of FAK Y397 phosphorylation (Fig 2F) and was pulled down by recombinant GST-tagged wild-type MYO1E SH3, but not by mutated MYO1E SH3, harboring a tryptophan (W)-to-lysine (K) mutation at position 1088 (W1088K; Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The folding of this mutant was confirmed by circular dichroism and NMR (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, recombinant MYO1E SH3 bound directly to the synthesized and bead-immobilized FAK linker (amino acids 358409; Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction was almost completely disrupted by the addition of RALPSIPK (Fig 2H), an octapeptide uniquely found in FAK proline-rich region 1 (PRR1) and sufficient to bind MYO1E SH3 (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No effects on MYO1E SH3 binding could be observed upon addition of the scrambled PLAIRKSP peptide (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these findings indicated that MYO1E binds PRR1 of FAK, we next synthesized peptides with point mutations in critical PRR1 residues: mutations in arginine (R) 368, which is thought to form a salt bridge with E1070 of MYO1E, and in prolines (P) 371/374, which likely adopt a polyproline type II helical structure that interacts with the MYO1E SH3 domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results showed that the R368A mutation, as well as the PP371/374AA (PAPA) mutation, inhibited FAK binding to wild-type MYO1E SH3 (Fig 2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_Analysis_of_the_MYO1E_SH3FAK_PRRI_Interaction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next used NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) of the MYO1E SH3FAK PRR1 interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant 15N-labeled apo MYO1E SH3 showed a very high-quality NMR spectrum with well-dispersed peaks indicating a folded and monomeric protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon addition of RALPSIPK peptide, peaks affected by the interaction shifted due to changes in the environment of affected amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) of four peaks observed during titration were used to determine the Kd of the interaction at 51 M (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Kd determined by NMR was then used to define the setup of two independent ITC experiments, which yielded a Kd of 22 ± 1 M (Fig 3B), confirming the order of magnitude of the affinity of this interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These affinities were similar to the affinities of the SRC SH3FAK PRR1 interaction with reported Kds between 32 and 63 M depending on method (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the mode of interaction between FAK PRR1 and MYO1E SH3, we assigned the peaks in the 1H15N spectrum; we then quantified the CSPs and mapped them on the structure of human MYO1E SH3 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 2XMF] (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CSPs are spread throughout the domain, the part of the protein most affected by the binding clusters to one region, exemplified by the strong shifts in residues W1089, F1100, N1102, and N1103.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we assigned the peaks corresponding to the side chain imines of W1088 and W1089 (Fig S3B), and found that the side chain of the crucial residue, W1088, displays a very large CSP, even though the perturbation of the backbone amide is only moderate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This binding surface is in accordance with the canonical binding surface of proline-rich peptides on SH3 domains, located in-between the RT loop and the n-Src loop on the C-terminal helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Superposition of the MYO1E SH3 domain with the structure of the SRC SH3 domain in complex with a class 1 peptide confirms this mode of interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model underlines the importance of peptide residues R368, P371, and P374 for the interactions that were observed in pull-down experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Myosin_1E_Induces_FAK_Kinase_Activity_and_Downstream_SPP1_Expression_in_Fibroblasts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether MYO1E SH3 induces FAK kinase activity, we performed in vitro FAK kinase reactions in the presence of 1:2 titrated MYO1E SH3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When MYO1E SH3 was incubated with full-length FAK, kinase activity increased several fold (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in kinase activity was not observed when MYO1E SH3 was incubated with FAK kinase domain (amino acids 393698) devoid of FAK PRR1 (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether FAK PRR1 induces FAK Y397 autophosphorylation in cells, we reconstituted FAK-null fibroblasts with PRR1-mutated FAK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblots revealed a significant reduction in phospho-Y397 FAK with the PAPA or R368A mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When separating nuclear from cytoplasmic fractions, R368A or PAPA-induced reductions in phospho-Y397 FAK were in the nuclear compartment (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, reexpression of MYO1E in MYO1E-null fibroblasts increased FAK Y397 phosphorylation (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, MYO1E promoted the nuclear accumulation of total and phospho-Y397 FAK (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because phospho-Y397 FAK was abundant in the nucleus of MYO1E-reconstituted cells, we next tested whether FAK Y397 promoted the expression of FN-type ECM as observed in FAK Y397F embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total sequencing of RNA from FAK-null or FAK-reconstituted wild-type or Y397F fibroblasts yielded 41,000 sequenced genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two hundred seventy-two genes were in a union of genes differentially expressed in FAK-null versus wild-type fibroblasts and FAK wild-type versus Y397F fibroblasts (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred one genes had lower expression in FAK-null and Y397F cells compared with FAK wild-type cells, and thus depended on Y397 for their up-regulation; functional association analysis of these 101 genes by STRING (string-db.org) revealed an FN-centered cluster (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the most highly FAK-induced genes was SPP1 (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these data, reexpression of MYO1E in MYO1E-null fibroblasts induced SPP1/FN mRNA (Fig 4G), whereas SPP1/FN mRNA was reduced in the presence of FAK PAPA compared with wild-type FAK (Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the role of FN and SPP1 in promoting cell proliferation and invasion, FAK Y397F fibroblasts grew less confluently and invaded less well into Matrigel than wild-type controls (Fig 4I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, FAK PAPA fibroblasts grew less confluently than wild-type controls (Fig 4J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, MYO1E-reconstituted fibroblasts grew more confluently and invaded faster into Matrigel than MYO1E-null controls (Fig 4K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MYO1E_FAK_Induces_SPP1_Promoter_Activity_and_Proliferation_in_Melanoma_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FAK and MYO1E could be visualized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of WM858 melanoma cells by postembedding immunogold electron microscopy (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these SPP1/FN high-expressing cancer cells (19), the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic phospho-Y397 FAK ratio was high (Fig 5B) compared with wild-type FAK-cherry reconstituted mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High levels of nuclear phospho-Y397 FAK were also observed in patient-derived melanoma xenograft cell lines M12 and M15 and patient-derived in-transit cutaneous melanoma metastases (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether Y397 phosphorylation promotes FAK nuclear accumulation, WM858 cells were treated with the FAK kinase inhibitor PF-562271, which prevented FAK Y397 phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that nuclear FAK was reduced in the presence of PF-562271, as was nuclear SRC (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in WM858 cells that expressed wild-type or Y397F FAK-cherry, nuclear Y397F was reduced compared with wild type (Fig 5F), indicating that the Y397F mutation interferes with nuclear FAK accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, total and phospho-Y397 nuclear FAK was reduced in cells with reduced MYO1E mRNA due to effective MYO1E shRNA derived from RNAi Consortium (TRC) clones 152421 and 152890 versus ineffective shRNA from clone 151296 and nontargeting control shRNA (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate whether nuclear FAK promotes FN-type ECM expression in WM858 cells, we performed six chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments revealed that FAK associates with the consensus binding sequence GCGC[AC]TGCGC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This binding sequence is highly similar to the optimal binding site for nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), (T/C)GCGCA(C/T)GCGC(A/G) (Fig S6), which coregulates promoter activity of SPP1 family genes (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether FAK drives SPP1 promoter activity, we tagged the endogenous SPP1 promoter in WM858 cells with a dual-luciferase reporter (Dual-Glo cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firefly luciferase was introduced to assay SPP1 promoter activity, and Renilla luciferase was coupled to the CMV promoter as a loading control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the SPP1 promoter was activated by vitamin D, because it was shown to harbor vitamin D response elements (22) (Fig 5H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retinoic acid receptor agonists, reported previously to induce SPP1 (23), also induced SPP1 promoter activity (Fig 5I), as did stable overexpression of FAK wild type-cherry and MYO1E-GFP (Fig 5J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed an unbiased screen of pharmaceutically active compounds to identify compounds that inhibit SPP1 promoter activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the structurally related FAK kinase inhibitors PF-431396 and PF-562271 were among a handful of drugs that strongly inhibited SPP1 promoter activity (Fig 5K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another structurally unrelated FAK inhibitor, PF-573228, was less potent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, neither SRC kinase inhibitors nor small-molecule inhibitors of mitogen-activated or rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinases (RAFs) inhibited SPP1 promoter activity (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SPP1 promotes melanoma cell proliferation and tumor growth (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure of WM858 or M12 cells to PF-562271 inhibited proliferation, as determined by automated counting of fluorescently labeled nuclei with a half-maximal effective concentration of 0.3 ± 0.1 M. Likewise, isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranosideinducible shRNA targeting FAK in WM858 cells inhibited proliferation (Fig 5L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When FAK-depleted cells were transiently reconstituted with either wild-type or PAPA mutant murine FAK, wild-type cells proliferated faster (Fig 5M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, knockdown of MYO1E using effective shRNA TRCN152890, but not ineffective shRNA TRCN151296 or nontargeting control shRNA, inhibited proliferation of WM858 cells (Fig 5N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data are consistent with a model where upon MYO1E interaction with FAK in melanoma cells, FAK becomes activated and accumulates in the nucleus to induce SPP1 promoter activity and proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this model, nuclear phospho-Y397 FAKpositive cutaneous melanoma expressed higher levels of SPP1 than nuclear phospho-Y397 FAKnegative precursor tissue (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in cutaneous melanoma, mitotic rate is an independent adverse predictor of survival (25), indicating a possible role for MYO1E/FAK-driven cancer cell proliferation in prognostically important processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we found that FAK function in vivo critically depends on the release of FAK kinase autoinhibition and dependent Y397 autophosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, FAK kinase activity is induced by a direct interaction of MYO1E and FAK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the FAK kinase domain is released from autoinhibition, SRC binds to phospho-Y397, thereby stabilizing the release of autoinhibition (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full catalytic activity in turn leads to nuclear accumulation of FAK, and transcription of FAK target genes such as SPP1 and FN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified MYO1E as a FAK PRR1 interactor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to SRC, MYO1E binds the FERM-kinase linker in the absence of phospho-Y397.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYO1E SH3-mediated autoinhibition of MYO1E motor function (26) may be released by MYO1E binding to FAK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYO1E binding to FAK then tethers FAK to actin, which may promote endocytosis (18) and could explain why FAK function is tightly linked to actomyosin dynamics and integrin endocytosis (10, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon FAK Y397 autophosphorylation, SRC binds FAK through SH2 domain interaction, which, in turn, releases SRC SH3 to interact with FAK PRR1, thereby possibly replacing MYO1E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneous binding of SRC SH2 and SH3 to FAK linker profoundly increases affinity versus SH2 binding alone (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of phospho-Y397, the affinity of MYO1E SH3 for FAK PRR1 octapeptide RALPSIPK is only marginally higher than the affinity of SRC SH3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in peptide pull-down experiments using full-length nonphosphorylated FAK linker peptide, SRC is not easily precipitated (via its SH3 domain) in the absence of Y397 phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that the affinity of full-length SRC for FAK linker is lower than the affinity of recombinant SRC SH3 (28), specifically in the absence of SH2 binding to phospho-Y397, or that MYO1E and FAK interact at additional sites outside of the RALPSIPK sequence either directly or indirectly that have yet to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability of MYO1E/FAK to influence matrix composition is consistent with in vivo MYO1E/FAK mutant phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normal epidermis, which is avascular and does not depend on FN receptors and ligands, is unaffected by changes in MYO1E or FAK function (6, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, complex mesenchymal processes such as neovascularization require the induction of an FN-based ECM (30) and are affected by FAK (31) or MYO1E loss of function (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer cells produce an FN-rich fibrotic matrix to facilitate metastasis, and both FAK (4, 7) and MYO1E (32) promote carcinogenesis in murine cancer models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, MYO1E protects kidney podocytes from mechanical stress-induced injury, as does SPP1, which may be induced by FAK (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, keloid formation (i.e., a wound-healing reaction with excessive scar formation) has been associated with MYO1E (35) and FAK function (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYO1E/FAK-induced SPP1 may play a role in keloid formation because SPP1 is known to drive tissue fibrosis (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Melanoma expresses high levels of SPP1 and other FN-type ECM, which, in turn, promotes metastasis (19, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a role of nuclear phospho-Y397 FAK in driving SPP1 expression, we found high levels of phospho-Y397 FAK in the nucleus of patient-derived melanoma tissues and cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, phospho-Y397 FAK was abundant in the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other authors have reported a predominantly cytoplasmic localization of phospho-Y397 FAK [e.g., in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (3)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular basis for this discrepancy is not well understood but may involve MYO1E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research must address the mechanisms that drive the nuclear shuttling of FAK to provide additional insight into medically relevant processes that rely on ECM remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Binding constants were determined using a NanoITC instrument (TA Instruments) at 25 °C in buffer containing 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5) and 200 mM NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RALPSIPK peptide was injected into MYO1E SH3 with stirring at 250 rpm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were carried out at 1.4 mM MYO1E SH3 and 16 mM peptide and at 0.38 mM MYO1E SH3 and 2.8 mM peptide, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were corrected for dilutional heat of the peptide, processed, and integrated using the NanoAnalyze suite (TA Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single-site model was used for curve fitting in NanoAnalyze.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plasmids_and_Constructs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A mammalian expression vector harboring cherry-tagged FAK cDNA (cherry-C1-FAK-HA) was a gift from Anna Huttenlocher, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI (Addgene plasmid 35039).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quikchange II XL Kit (200521; Agilent Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For stable expression in cell lines, cDNA was cloned into the lentiviral expression vector LV022 (Applied Biological Materials).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For recombinant expression of GST-tagged MYO1E, we used plasmid pGEX-5X-3 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For recombinant expression of GST-tagged ACTN4, we used plasmid pBP-His-GST (PV567919; Applied Biological Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Primary_Cells_and_Cell_Lines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MYO1E-null fibroblasts (lot 3-7) were derived from MYO1E-deficient mice (29) and immortalized using SV40 whole gene (106 IU/mL) delivered by lentivirus (G203; Applied Biological Materials) overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The p53/ FAK knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; CRL-2644) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WM858 melanoma cells (p53/) were purchased from Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M12 melanoma cells (BRAFV600E, NRASWT, KRASWT; p53-positive) and M15 melanoma cells (BRAFWT, NRASQ61K, KRASWT; p53-positive) were obtained from patient-derived melanoma brain metastases and maintained as patient-derived xenografts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma and viral contamination by the RapidMAP 21 test (Taconic) or the Mayo IMPACT Profile (IDEXX BioResearch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lines were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate WM858 Dual-Glo human melanoma cells (i.e., WM858 cells with a dual-luciferasetagged endogenous SPP1 promoter), exon 2 (ENSE00003680042) of SPP1 was targeted for a double-strand break using a custom-made zinc finger nuclease (CSTZFN; SigmaAldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the predicted 42-bp zinc finger nuclease-binding site (capital letters) and cutting site (lowercase letters) were as follows: 5-CTCCTAGGCATCACCTGTgccataCCAGTGAGTACAGTTGCA-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A donor vector with 500-bp homology arms was cloned so that the SPP1 sequence downstream of the endogenous SPP1 ATG start codon (4: 87,976,896; GRCh38.p7) was replaced with luc2P reporter gene, a luciferase gene that contains hPEST, a protein destabilization sequence cloned from pGL4.15[luc2P/Hygro] (E6701; Promega Corporation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately downstream of luc2P, our donor vector contained a mammalian selectable marker for hygromycin, followed by a CMV promoter-driven hRluc Renilla luciferase gene, intended as a loading control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correct insertion of the donor cassette downstream of the SPP1 ATG start codon was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activity of the SPP1 promoter-driven firefly luciferases and the CMV promoter-driven Renilla luciferase was assayed using the Dual-Glo protocol (E2940; Promega Corporation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The firefly signal was normalized to the Renilla signal and then further normalized to a treatment control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were cultured in the presence of 250 g/mL Hygromycin B (H0654; SigmaAldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The luciferase signal was measured using white, flat-bottomed, 96-well plates (CLS3362; SigmaAldrich), a Varioskan Flash multimode reader (Thermo Scientific) in luminometric measurement mode, a measurement time of 10 s per well, and SkanIt software version 2.4.3.37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate WM858 melanoma cells with MYO1E shRNA or nontargeting control shRNA, WM858 cells were infected with lentiviral particles containing shRNA derived from the TRC clones TRCN0000151296, TRCN0000152421, and TRCN0000152890 or from nontargeting control in pLKO.1-puro-CMV-tGFP vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For targeting RPS6KB1, cells were infected with lentiviral particles containing shRNA derived from the TRC clones TRCN0000003162, TRCN0000003161, TRCN0000003160, TRCN0000003159, and TRCN0000003158 or from nontargeting control pLKO.1-puro-CMV-U6 vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For targeting, PTK2/FAK cells were infected with lentiviral particles containing shRNA derived from TRC clones TRCN0000194984 and TRCN0000196310 or from nontargeting control pLKOpuroisopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)1XLacO vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note the PTK2/FAK-targeting shRNA TRCN0000121207, TRCN0000121318, and TRCN0000121129 were ineffective in WM858 melanoma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To induce effective knockdown, cells were cultured in the presence of 50 M IPTG for at least 5 d. All cells were selected using 0.5 g/mL puromycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transient_and_Stable_Transfection_Transduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For transient transfection of WM858 cells, we used Lipofectamine 2000 or 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate stable cell lines, cells were infected with lentivirus in 2 mL of complete medium containing 8 g/mL polybrene and a virus multiplicity of infection of 220.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection was by 11.5 g/mL puromycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Timed_Matings_and_Embryo_Isolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In all mating procedures, female mice were exposed to male mice overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of a vaginal plug the next morning was used to determine E0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staged embryos (E8.5E16.5) were dissected in ice-cold PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryos were observed under an Olympus SZX12 Microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small pieces of tail or paw were digested in PBS containing proteinase K at 56 °C for 90 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteinase K was heat-inactivated at 80 °C for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two microliters of the sample was used to set up a PCR assay for genotyping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Whole-Mount_3D_Imaging_of_CD31_in_Embryos  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole-mount 3D imaging of CD31 was performed as previously described (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To allow for deep penetration of laser light and confocal sectioning, embryos were dehydrated by increasing methanol concentrations, cleared in benzyl alcohol/benzyl benzoate (1:2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope using ZEN software (release 8.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Coimmunoprecipitation_and_GST_Pull-Downs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For coimmunoprecipitation of FAK, 500 g of WM858 melanoma cell protein lysate containing GFP-tagged MYO1E in Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (MPER; 78501; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was diluted in an equal volume of PBS (28372; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated with Protein G-coated magnetic beads (88847; Thermo Fisher Scientific), which were preincubated with 10 g of rabbit GFP antibody (ab290; Abcam) or 10 g of rabbit IgG (12-370; EMD Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation was overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads were washed in PBS-diluted MPER (4:1 ratio) gently three times, eluted in PS loading buffer, and run on a Wes microfluidic Western blotting system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For GST pull-down of FAK, 10 g of recombinant GST-tagged MYO1-SH3 domain [GST-MYO1E(SH3)] or GST-tagged tryptophan (W)-to-lysine (K) mutation at position 1088 (W1088K) mutated SH3 domain [GST-MYO1E(SH3WK)] was incubated with glutathione magnetic beads (88821; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads were then incubated with cell lysate as described above at 4 °C with gentle rotation overnight, washed in PBS, eluted in PS loading buffer, and run on a Wes microfluidic Western blotting system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Expression_and_Purification_of_Recombinant_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Purified GST-tagged SRC was purchased from SigmaAldrich (S1076).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GST-tagged Myo1E SH3 domain (wild type or W1088K mutated) in vector pGEX-5X-3 (18) or GST-tagged ACTN4 in vector pBP-His-GST (PV567919; Applied Biological Systems) was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein-containing bacterial supernatant was applied to a GST Trap FF column (5 mL; GE Healthcare Life Sciences), washed, and eluted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GST-tagged Myo1E SH3 domain was dialyzed [20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2 (pH 8.0)] and digested with Factor Xa from New England Biolabs (P8010) at 4 °C for 16 h using 1 g of the protease to cleave 1 mg of fusion protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cleaved protein was isolated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC; SD200/16/60) with SEC buffer [20 mM Hepes, 200 mM NaCl (pH 7.5)] and concentrated to 6 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complex formation was observed on an ETTAN system equipped with a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column using a protein concentration of 1 mg/mL and a 1.6-fold molar excess of the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For circular dichroism measurement, the sample was diluted with deionized water to yield a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed using a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean of 10 protein spectra (300 nm to 190 nm) was corrected by subtracting the buffer spectrum, and the calculated mean residue weight ellipticity was plotted using SciDAVis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For 15N-labeled protein, a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site was introduced between the GST-tag and Myo1E SH3 domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This construct was expressed in E. coli Rosetta 2 cells using M9 minimal medium supplied with 15N ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source and 13C glucose as the carbon source for double-labeled samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fusion protein was affinity-purified as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After addition of 1 mM DTT and TEV protease, the protein was incubated overnight at 30 °C to cleave the GST-tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pure Myo1E SH3 domain was obtained by SEC (SD75/16/60) with SEC buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For pull-downs, synthetic peptides were immobilized on 100 L of Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (65001; Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 2 g of recombinant GST-tagged MYO1E protein on a rotator overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For competition experiments, 2 g of MYO1E-GST and 150 g of synthesized, unconjugated RALPSIPK peptide (FAK amino acids 368375) or 2 g of MYO1E-GST and 150 g of unconjugated scrambled PLAIRKSP peptide were incubated with FAK peptide (amino acids 358409) coupled to Dynabeads overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads were washed twice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein was eluted by boiling at 95 ° in PS loading buffer for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eluates were separated using PS capillaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microfluidic_Western_Blotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Western blots were performed as Simple Western assays using the Wes system (PS), a combination of capillary electrophoresis and immunodetection techniques, following the manufacturers protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of chemiluminescence was based on peak height after correction for a baseline signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw data were generated by Compass software (version 2.5.82.7.1, build ID 0201-0826).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compass is the control and data analysis application for Simple Western instruments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_Microfluidic_PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA from patient biopsy-derived paraffin sections was extracted and processed as previously described (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA from mouse embryos was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (74134; Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One microgram of total RNA was transcribed into cDNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (170-8891; Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All cDNA derived from paraffin sections or fresh-frozen material was preamplified using TaqMan Preamp Master Mix (4391128; Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was then performed using the Fluidigm BioMark HD system and dynamic array-integrated fluid circuits (Fluidigm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absolute SPP1 and FN RNA copy numbers in mouse embryos or MEFs were determined using copy number standards (38) and normalized to 106 copies of housekeeping genes (ACTB and RPL8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some experiments, absolute copy numbers were normalized to a control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following primers were used for mouse-derived cDNA amplification by quantitative PCR: ACTB (1)-forward, GGCTACAGCTTCACCACCAC; ACTB (1)-reverse, TAATGTCACGCACGATTTCC; ACTB (2)-forward, TGACCCAGATCATGTTTGAGA; ACTB (2)-reverse, GTACATGGCTGGGGTGTTG; RPL8-forward, AGGCAAAGAGGAACTGCTG; RPL8-reverse, GGATGCTCCACAGGATTCAT; SPP1-forward, TGACCCATCTCAGAAGCAGA; SPP1-reverse, TTCTTCAGAGGACACAGCATTC; FN-forward, GTAGGAGAACAGTGGCAGAA; and FN-reverse, GTGCAGGAGCAAATGGC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gene_Expression_by_Next-Generation_Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FAK MEF RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA sequencing was performed as previously described (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, RNA-derived cDNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentration and size distribution of the resulting libraries were determined on an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip and confirmed by Qubit fluorometry (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unique indexes were incorporated at the adaptor ligation phase for three-plex sample loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Libraries were loaded onto paired-end flow cells to generate cluster densities of 700,000 per square millimeter following Illuminas standard protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow cells were sequenced as 51 paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were processed through the Mayo RNA-sequencing analysis pipeline, MAP-RSeq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw and normalized (reads per kilobase of gene per million mapped reads) gene expression read counts were obtained per sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential gene expression analysis was carried out using the freely available edgeR Bioconductor software package (bioconductor.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because scaling by total lane counts can bias estimates of differential expression, edgeR uses trimmed mean normalization on raw read counts to determine whether genes are differentially expressed using the negative binomial method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BenjaminiHochberg correction is used to control for multiple testing to obtain a false discovery rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proliferation_and_Matrigel_Invasion_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For proliferation analysis, cells were seeded at low densities (2,5005,000 cells per well).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were incubated using an IncuCyte ZOOM (Essen Bioscience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell growth based on percent confluence was determined from phase contrast images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For proliferation assays based on automated counting of fluorescent nuclei, cells were first infected with the NucLight Red reagent (4476; Essen Bioscience) and selected using 1 g/mL puromycin to obtain a stable nuclear red fluorescent label.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Invasion assays were performed by seeding cells at a density of 30,000 cells per well on a thin coating of Matrigel (0.1 mg/mL, standard formulation; Corning) in 96-well ImageLock microplates (4379; Essen BioScience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then allowed to grow confluent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before scratching, cell proliferation was inhibited by 30 min of exposure to 10 g/mL mitomycin C (M4287; SigmaAldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monolayers were scratched using the WoundMaker pin tool (4493; Essen BioScience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medium was changed, and cells were covered in 2 mg/mL Matrigel diluted in complete medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative wound density was calculated using the IncuCyte Scratch Wound Cell Migration Software Module (9600-0012; Essen Bioscience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunocytochemistry_and_IHC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For immunocytochemistry, cells were cultured on LAB-TEK II chamber slides (154453; Thermo Scientific), fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at room temperature, and stained with a BOND-MAX autostainer (Leica Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, slides were washed with 1× Bond Wash solution (Leica Biosystems), and cells were permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing and blocking with 3% BSA in PBS for 60 min, slides were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of primary antibody in Bond Primary Antibody Diluent (Leica Biosystems) for 90 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were washed three times for 2 min each time and incubated with a 1:100 dilution of secondary antibody in Bond Primary Antibody Diluent for 60 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After three 2-min wash steps, DAPI staining was performed for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were collected at room temperature by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM780) with a 40×/1.0-N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  objective using ZEN software (release 8.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colocalization of MYO1E/FAK was highlighted using the ZEN software colocalization algorithm using arbitrary cutoffs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For IHC on paraffin sections using phospho-FAK Y397 antibody (44-624G), sections were baked, dewaxed, and exposed to EDTA-based pH 9.0 solution (AR9640; Leica Biosystems) using a BOND-MAX autostainer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibody detection was by alkaline phosphatase-linked polymers (DS9390; Leica Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For IHC on frozen sections using laminin, collagen, or FN antibodies, epitope retrieval was not required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibody detection was by secondary Alexa 488-conjugated antibody (1:200 dilution).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stained paraffin sections were digitalized with an Aperio ScanScope (Leica Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For FAK phospho-Y397stained slides, an overview and a maximum magnification image were imported into Microsoft Powerpoint (version 14) per case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate contrasted images of FAK phospho-Y397 versus background, maximum magnification images were converted to 75% black and white, brightness was set to 50%, and contrast was set to 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Postembedding_Immunogold_Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were fixed in 4% PFA + 2% sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following fixation, channels were rinsed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in LR Gold Resin (EMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrathin sections (0.09 m) were labeled with FAK (06-543; EMD Millipore) or GFP antibodies (ab290; Abcam) and with 10 nm of gold-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies (EMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micrographs were acquired using a JEOL1400 Plus transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChIP-Seq  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNAprotein complexes in WM858 melanoma cells were cross-linked using fresh 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by glycine quenching (125 mM for 5 min at room temperature).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 106 cells were harvested and lysed by incubating in 10 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 10 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatin was first fragmented using micrococcal nuclease at 2000 gel units/mL (New England Biolabs) in 20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, and 1 mM CaCl2 digestion buffer at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 20 min, the reaction was stopped with 100 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.1), 20 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, and 0.2% sodium deoxycholate buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chromatin was further fragmented using a Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode) set at the high setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fragment sizes were determined using an Advanced Analytical Technologies Fragment Analyzer Automated CE System.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatin preparations were reacted with antibodies against FAK (06-543, EMD Millipore; C20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mCherry (ab183628; Abcam) overnight at 4 °C and precipitated using Protein G agarose beads (Roche Diagnostics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After elution of DNAprotein complexes, cross-links were reversed by proteinase K digestion overnight at 62 °C and DNA was purified using the Qiagen PCR Purification Kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing libraries were constructed using the NuGEN Ovation Ultralow DR Multiplex System 1-8 (NuGEN Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the DNA fragments underwent end repair, barcoded sequencing adapter ligation, purification (Agencourt RNAClean XP beads; Beckman Coulter), and PCR amplification (13 cycles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Final ChIP libraries were sequenced (paired-end, 51 bases per read) on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed using the HiChIP pipeline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, paired-end reads were mapped by the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) software package, and pairs with one or both ends uniquely mapped were retained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peaks were called for these samples using the MACS2 software package at a false discovery rate of 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For data visualization, Bedtools was used in combination with in-house scripts to generate a normalized tag density profile at a window size of 200 bp and step size of 20 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were visualized using Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peaks called by MACS2 for all of the samples were multi-intersected using Bedtools to obtain a list of shared peaks that were detected in more than one ChIP experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The list of peaks was filtered to remove peaks in the blacklist regions, which may be false peaks because of satellites, telomere repeats, and centromere repeats [blacklist regions from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retained peaks were assigned to genes if they were present in ±2 kb around the translation start site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MEME Suite was used to discover novel DNA-binding motifs from the peak regions, which were called outside the blacklist regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak region for this analysis was obtained from ±100-bp regions around each peak center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The width of the motif was constrained between 7 and 10 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FAK_Kinase_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assay kinase activity, we used the ADP-Glo Kinase Assay method (V9101; Promega) in combination with the FAK Kinase Enzyme System (V1971; Promega), which included recombinant FAK kinase domain amino acids 393698 using the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full-length recombinant FAK from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells was obtained from Abcam (ab105909).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 10% ATP-to-ADP conversion at a 100 M concentration using full-length FAK (SB10 value) at room temperature and 90 min of incubation was achieved by 65 ng of enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate the percentage of enzyme activity, we first subtracted the signal of the negative control (no enzyme and no MYO1E SH3) from sample signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 100% kinase activity signal (no MYO1E SH3) was used to calculate fold change in the presence of MYO1E SH3 titration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
