Optogenetic skeletal muscle-powered adaptive biological machines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding the design rules that govern the structure and function of natural biological systems gives us the ability to forward engineer machines integrated with and powered by biological components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such machines, or bio-bots, can sense, process, and respond to dynamic environmental signals in real time, enabling a variety of applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a modular optogenetic muscle actuator used to power actuation and locomotion of 3D printed flexible skeletons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observing and controlling the functional response of such muscle-powered machines helps replicate the complex adaptive functionality we observe in natural biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstration thus sets the stage for building the next generation of bio-integrated machines and systems targeted at a diverse array of functional tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Complex biological systems sense, process, and respond to their surroundings in real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of such systems to adapt their behavioral response to suit a range of dynamic environmental signals motivates the use of biological materials for other engineering applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a step toward forward engineering biological machines (bio-bots) capable of nonnatural functional behaviors, we created a modular light-controlled skeletal muscle-powered bioactuator that can generate up to 300 µN (0.56 kPa) of active tension force in response to a noninvasive optical stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When coupled to a 3D printed flexible bio-bot skeleton, these actuators drive directional locomotion (310 µm/s or 1.3 body lengths/min) and 2D rotational steering (2°/s) in a precisely targeted and controllable manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The muscle actuators dynamically adapt to their surroundings by adjusting performance in response to exercise training stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstration sets the stage for developing multicellular bio-integrated machines and systems for a range of applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In vivo, muscle is anchored to bone via tendons, and the concerted contraction of sarcomeres acting in parallel along a muscle fiber drives articulation of bones across joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed and 3D printed a poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel skeleton composed of two pillars (artificial tendons) that connect the muscle to a flexible beam (articulating joint) to mimic in vivo structure (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then 3D printed a PEGDA ring mold that served as a template for the formation of a muscle ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enable comparisons to our previous muscle strip design (10), we also manufactured a strip mold (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Optogenetics, the method of genetically engineering light-responsive cells, enables noninvasive external control over cellular function (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ion channels that respond to light stimuli have been implemented in a variety of applications that require cellular manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the seminal studies in this field were performed on neurons, recent studies have demonstrated optogenetic approaches to control other cell types, including skeletal muscle (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To implement optogenetic control of our muscle actuators, we used an existing lentiviral transduction protocol to engineer C2C12 murine myoblast cells with a mutated variant of the blue light-sensitive ion channel, Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), namely ChR2(H134R) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transduced cells, labeled with a tdTomato tag, were selected using FACS to maximize expression of ChR2(H134R).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multinucleated myotubes differentiated from these myoblasts were anticipated to demonstrate paced contractility in response to an external light stimulus of 470-nm wavelength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Optogenetic myoblasts were combined with a solution of Matrigel basement membrane, fibrinogen, and thrombin (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cell/gel solution, designed to mimic native extracellular matrix, was injected into the molds, and traction forces exerted by embedded cells drove self-assembly into densely packed muscle strips and rings (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Muscle strips formed around (and thus were permanently tethered to) the bio-bot skeletons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Muscle rings were manually transferred to bio-bot skeletons 1 d after seeding (day 1) (Fig 1E, Fig S2, and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process allowed for mechanical coupling of the actuator to the device while still preserving modularity of design, because muscle rings could be transferred to any of a wide variety of mechanical skeletons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simplify manual transfer, bio-bot skeletons were chemically tethered to an underlying glass slide during transfer and mechanically released from the slide on day 2 after seeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both muscle strip and ring devices were cultured in growth medium (DMEM + 10% FBS) containing the fibrinolytic inhibitor aminocaproic acid (ACA) for 3 d to induce cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then transferred to differentiation medium [DMEM + 10% horse serum (HS)] containing ACA on day 4 to drive fusion of individual myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes with mature contractile sarcomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This medium was supplemented with human insulin-like growth factor (IGF1) to accelerate the differentiation process and induce muscle hypertrophy (10, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The thickness of engineered muscle tissue is dependent on the formulation of the cell/gel solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until a certain lower limit, higher concentrations of cells and fibrin form thinner muscle rings that lead to more densely compacted tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond this limit, increasing the cellular and fibrin concentration cannot reduce the muscle tissue thickness further, as the embedded cells and fibrin network occupy a finite volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of muscle rings was thus used as a metric to select cell/gel solution formulations that would maximize muscle tissue compactness and cellular density (Fig 1F and Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This characterization of optimal muscle dimensions coupled with the modularity of the ring design enabled forward engineering of many types of machines including larger scale bio-bots, bio-bots powered by multiple muscle rings, and multilegged bio-bots (Fig S3 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_Optogenetic_Muscle_Ring_Force_Output  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Macroscale muscle contraction is the sum of many microscale contractions of individual myotubes acting in parallel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aligning the axis of contractility for myotubes within muscle is thus critical to observing large combined forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed immunofluorescence staining on muscle rings to observe the distribution of the mature muscle marker, myosin motor protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm was used to determine local alignment (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myotubes in muscle rings are aligned at 90° in regions parallel to the bio-bot beam (Fig 2A-1) and shift in alignment around the edges of the skeleton with smaller peaks at 90° and a larger peaks at 45° (Fig 2A-2) and 135° (Fig 2A-3), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis reveals a high degree of local alignment along the axis of tension imposed by the mechanical constraint of the bio-bot skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed a closer inspection of muscle ring architecture in the region represented in Fig 2A-2 via multichannel fluorescence imaging of DAPI cell nucleus marker, the ChR2 tdTomato tag, and the immunostained myosin marker (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were evenly distributed throughout the muscle ring and expressed the tdTomato marker for optogenetic ion channels, indicating that they could be expected to generate functional contractile responses to blue light stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scanning electron microscopy imaging likewise showed densely compacted and evenly distributed myotubes with a high degree of local alignment (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cross-section image of the muscle ring was used to verify that hierarchical organization of muscle architecture and alignment was preserved in 3D (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure the passive tension force exerted by both muscle strip and muscle ring devices, we used Euler-Bernoulli beam bending theory to correlate bio-bot skeleton deformation with muscle force production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, passive tension forces for muscle strip and ring devices were not significantly different, with muscle strips exerting passive tension forces of 1,940 ± 350 µN and muscle rings exerting passive tension forces of 1,710 ± 230 µN on day 9 after seeding (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This force corresponds to a passive tension stress of 1.6 ± 0.3 kPa for muscle strips, which had average cross-sectional areas of 1.2 ± 0.04 mm2 (n = 3), and 3.2 ± 0.4 kPa for muscle rings, which had had average cross-sectional areas of 0.54 ± 0.06 mm2 (n = 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These stress values are comparable to those previously reported for tissue engineered skeletal muscle (10, 12, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mature muscle was stimulated optically and electrically using custom-built apparatus (Fig 3A), and a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelasticity model was used to correlate contraction-induced displacement of bio-bot skeletons to active tension forces produced by engineered muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical stimulation of muscle strip and ring devices at 1, 2, and 4 Hz with 50-ms pulses produced paced contractions (Fig S4B) and physiological force-frequency response behavior (Fig 3 B-1 and C-1), where the dynamic fluctuation of active tension force reduced with increasing frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with native skeletal muscle at high frequency stimulation, the passive tension baseline increased during the stimulation period, indicating that the muscle was not allowed to fully relax from one received stimulus before the next received stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For muscle strips, forces produced by optical stimulation (45 ± 11, 32 ± 12, and 25 ± 12 µN at 1, 2, and 4 Hz, respectively) are significantly lower (Fig 3B-2) than those produced by electrical stimulation (195 ± 19, 112 ± 26, and 88 ± 30 µN at 1, 2, and 4 Hz, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, there was no significant difference between optical and electrically stimulated active tension forces in muscle rings (Fig 3C-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At stimulation frequencies of 1, 2, and 4 Hz, optical stimulation of rings produced active tension forces of 195 ± 7.3, 114 ± 8.1, and 110 ± 16 µN, respectively, whereas electrical stimulation produced active tension forces of 185 ± 17, 117 ± 19, and 119 ± 6.7 µN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This difference in functional performance of optogenetic muscle strips and rings is explained by an analysis of the effective penetration depth (500740 µm) of 470-nm light into biological tissue (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although muscle strips had maximum thicknesses up to 1,200 µm, the densely compacted muscle ring actuators were less than 700 µm thick (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, light stimulation of muscle rings excited a larger number of myotubes than in muscle strips, resulting in greater force production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This principle was verified by demonstrating that increasing light energy density increased muscle ring functional performance (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A maximum energy density of 1.9 mW/mm2 was used for all experiments, a value that falls within the range of saturation intensity values reported in the literature on optogenetic cells (12, 18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrical stimulation of muscle strips and rings revealed comparable active tension force production for both designs, indicating that similar numbers of myotubes were recruited in each case (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When normalized by cross-sectional area, however, muscle rings produced significantly greater active tension stresses with a maximum of 0.34 ± 0.03 kPa at 1-Hz stimulation compared with muscle strips, which produced active tension stresses of only 0.16 ± 0.02 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Optimizing_Functional_Performance_of_Optogenetic_Muscle_Rings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exercise training of engineered muscle during differentiation has been shown to increase force output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For electrically stimulated conditioning, improved functionality is attributed to increased differentiation, improved alignment, and increased glucose uptake (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mechanically stimulated conditioning, improved functionality is attributed to a change in gene regulation and protein expression, increased metabolic activity, cellular proliferation, and improved myofiber organization (10, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A previous study has shown that optical stimulation during differentiation of optogenetic C2C12s in 2D can improve the alignment of sarcomeric proteins and increase the fraction of contractile myotubes (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that optical conditioning of muscle rings during differentiation could thus lead to an enhancement in functional performance (force production).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism of periodic cellular depolarization and contraction would be similar to that of electrical stimulation, but less invasive, as it avoids electrolysis of the surrounding media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we hypothesized that combining mechanical and optical stimulation could lead to synergistic enhancements in functional performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To provide a passive mechanical stimulus during differentiation, we kept bio-bots chemically tethered to an underlying glass slide throughout differentiation to maximize cellular alignment and myotube formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bio-bots were mechanically released from the stiff underlying substrate before stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide optical conditioning during differentiation, we subjected muscle rings to a daily regimen of optical stimulation at 1, 2, and 4 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured active tension force output for four different groups: control group 1, no mechanical conditioning (bio-bots released from substrate on day 1), no optical conditioning; control group 2, mechanical conditioning (bio-bots tethered to substrate until day 12), no optical conditioning; exercise group 1, no mechanical conditioning, optical conditioning during differentiation (days 411); and exercise group 2, mechanical conditioning, optical conditioning (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An analysis of force output for exercise group 1 revealed that active tension forces grew from 56 ± 11 µN on day 7 (the first day with observable macroscale contractility) to 195 ± 24 µN on day 12 at 1-Hz stimulation (Fig 4B-1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, control group 1 produced active tension forces of only 43 ± 6.0 µN on day 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control group 2 produced forces of 91 ± 37 µN on day 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these forces were higher than those of bio-bots from control group 1, the results were not significantly different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exercise group 2, which was subjected to both mechanical and optically stimulated exercise during differentiation, produced active tension forces of 283 ± 32 µN on day 12 (Fig 4B-2 and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data serve to demonstrate that mechanically and optically stimulated exercise can lead to significant improvements in muscle functional performance, and the combination of both types of stimuli synergistically enhances force output even further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with previous demonstrations of mechanical and electrical multimodal stimulation for engineered muscle (24, 25) but is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of optical conditioning driving functional improvements in muscle performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As optical stimulation provides a less invasive and cell type-specific approach for localized control of muscle contraction, this approach to enhancing functional performance is a significant improvement over the current state of the art.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To validate our hypothesis that optical stimulus conditioning improves myotube formation, we assessed the DNA and protein content in control group 2 and exercise group 2 muscle rings and compared the ratio of protein/DNA in each case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger protein/DNA ratios are correlated with greater cellular hypertrophy (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As all rings contained the same number of embedded myoblasts, the DNA content for all muscle rings was 1.76 ± 0.35 µg DNA/mg muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the protein content for exercise group 2 rings was 51.2 ± 2.6 µg protein/mg muscle, compared with 41.7 ± 2.7 µg protein/mg muscle for control group 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of protein/DNA was thus significantly larger in the exercise conditioned case, 29.1 ± 1.5 µg protein/µg DNA compared with the control group, 23.7 ± 1.5 µg protein/µg DNA, corroborating the theory that exercise conditioning resulted in increased cellular hypertrophy (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Directional_Locomotion_and_2D_Steering_in_Optogenetic_Muscle_Ring-Powered_Bio-Bots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the most readily observable form of work produced by an actuator is locomotion, this was chosen as the desired functional output for our muscle-powered machines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, to observe directional (1D) locomotion in response to optical stimulation, the design of the bio-bot skeleton was made asymmetric by increasing the length of one of the hydrogel pillars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With each contraction of the engineered muscle tissue, the longer pillar displaced a greater amount than the shorter pillar, as the moment arm from the muscle to the beam was greater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in displacement drove net movement in the direction of the longer pillar (Fig 5A and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inch worm-like walking was readily observed and measured, allowing for a simple method of assessing bio-bot functional performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of bio-bot speed for the muscle rings in the exercise training study revealed that rings in exercise group 2 powered walking at speeds of 138 ± 6.4 µm/s (optical stimulation, 1 Hz) and 145 ± 19 µm/s (electrical stimulation, 1 Hz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, rings in control group 2 powered walking at significantly slower speeds of 35 ± 8.5 µm/s (optical stimulation, 1 Hz) and 38 ± 5.1 µm/s (electrical stimulation, 1 Hz) (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the frequency of stimulation correspondingly increased locomotive speed, despite the reduction in the dynamic range of active tension at higher frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bio-bot speed increased nearly 80% from 138 ± 6.4 µm/s at 1 Hz to 246 ± 59 µm/s to 4 Hz, providing an added mechanism of improving and controlling performance (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The true advantage of incorporating optogenetics is the precision stimulation enabled by enhanced spatial control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focusing light onto different regions of the muscle ring enables control over the number and location of excited myotubes and hence control over the magnitude and direction of macroscale force output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Directional locomotion in 1D and steering in 2D can thus be induced and controlled via the external stimulus without requiring asymmetric modifications to the physical geometry of the bio-bot device itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide a simple demonstration of this design principle, we took advantage of the modularity of the muscle ring actuators to design a two-leg geometrically symmetric skeleton powered by a muscle ring actuator tethered to each leg (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finite element analysis (FEA) simulations predicted that stimulation of both muscle rings at the same time would result in zero net movement, due to overall symmetry of pillar displacement (Fig 6A-1 and Movie S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prediction was verified by electrical stimulation of a two-leg bio-bot device, which demonstrated paced contractility but zero net locomotion in response to whole device stimulation at 2 Hz (Fig 6A-2 and Movie S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FEA simulations also predicted that stimulation of only one muscle ring would drive directional locomotion in the direction of the stimulated leg (Fig 6B-1 and Movie S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical stimulation of only one leg, for the same bio-bot device electrically stimulated in Fig 6A-2, resulted in net locomotion in the direction of the stimulated leg at speeds of up to 310 µm/s (1.3 body lengths/min) at 2-Hz stimulation (Fig 6B-2 and Movie S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, exciting only half of a muscle ring with a light stimulus resulted in rotational locomotion as predicted by FEA (Fig 6C-1 and Movie S8) and verified empirically (for the same bio-bot device shown in Fig 6 A-2 and B-2) at 2.25°/s (135°/min) at 2-Hz stimulation (Fig 6C-2 and Movie S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results, presented for a single representative bio-bot, indicate that the demonstrated differences in locomotive behavior for this device can be attributed purely to the mode of external stimulation (both rings, one ring, half ring).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On average, two-legged bio-bots conditioned using the regimen specified for exercise group 2 demonstrated directional locomotion (in response to one ring stimulation) at 312 ± 63 µm/s at 2 Hz (Fig S5A-1), significantly greater than control group 2 two-leg bio-bots, which demonstrated speeds of only 97.5 ± 16 µm/s at 2 Hz (Fig S5A-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same exercise group and control group two-legged bio-bots were tested with half ring stimulation at 2 Hz, to show that differential responses could be obtained by changing the mode of external stimulation (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exercised bio-bots demonstrated rotational locomotion at 2.1 ± 0.5°/s, significantly greater than the control bio-bots, which demonstrated rotational locomotion at speeds of 0.95 ± 0.2°/s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future, a moving light stimulus that combines whole and partial ring stimulation could be used to direct and drive both directional locomotion and 2D steering of symmetric bio-bot devices in a precisely controlled manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we presented a controllable and modular bioactuator that can be readily adapted to a variety of device designs and applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although locomotion is presented as the desired functional output in this study, muscle rings produce significant contractile force output even when untethered to a mechanical skeleton (Movie S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such rings can thus be combined in parallel and series to fabricate pumps, swimmers, etc., in future designs that harness the modularity of this technology, proving to be more reproducible and widely adaptable than the bioactuators originally presented as proof-of-concept studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the well-defined characterization of ring composition, dimensions, and modulated force output, we can now treat engineered muscle rings, or rings formed from other cell types, as building blocks that enable the fabrication of complex multicellular bio-integrated machines and systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Incorporating optogenetic ion channels into muscle rings provided us with a noninvasive method of exciting groups of aligned myotubes with precise spatiotemporal control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with previously presented approaches, which controlled muscle-powered bioactuators via electrodes in close proximity to the bioactuator device, optogenetics provided noncontact yet localized control of stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fundamental distinction drove complex controllable directional locomotion and 2D steering of bio-bots, a capability that has not been previously presented in untethered biological machines powered by engineered muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This design modification, enabled by targeted genetic engineering of skeletal muscle myoblasts, thus resulted in a profound improvement in the complexity of functional behaviors produced by engineered muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important advancement presented in this study is the improvement in functional performance produced by exercise training of muscle rings with combined optical and mechanical stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This evidence of increased muscle force production in response to multimodal conditioning demonstrates the dynamically tunable and adaptive nature of these modular bioactuators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Forward engineered biological machines harness the ability of biological materials to sense, process, and respond to environmental signals in real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modular bioactuators we present in this study power bio-bots that demonstrate adaptive behavior in response to noninvasive light stimuli, enabling a variety of applications that require dynamic sensing and actuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of adaptive behavior, which emerges from the coordinated interactions in a multicellular network, drives much of the complex functionality we observe in natural biological systems (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future generations of bio-bots could further harness the power of biological materials by incorporating self-assembling or self-healing functionalities or serving as factories of cell-secreted factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporating multiple cell types, such as neurons for signal processing or endothelial cells for vascularization and nutrient transport, would enable the design and fabrication of more complex biological machines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As many such machines will require modular bioactuators, this demonstration of a light-controlled adaptive skeletal muscle-powered biological machine thus enables a variety of applications while simultaneously setting the stage for the next generation of bio-integrated machines and systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

C2C12 murine myoblasts were infected with pLenti2-EF1-ChR2[H134R]-tdTomato-WPRE plasmid to express a mutated variant of the light-sensitive ion channel, Channelrhodopsin (ChR2[H134R]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tdTomato tag was used to selectively enrich myoblasts that expressed ChR2[H134R] via FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were maintained in growth medium (GM) consisting of DMEM with l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (Corning Cellgro) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Lonza), 1% (vol/vol) l-glutamine (Cellgro Mediatech), and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-streptomycin (Cellgro Mediatech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Design_and_Fabrication_of_Flexible_3D_Printed_Bio-Bot_Skeletons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A commercial stereolithographic 3D printing apparatus (SLA 250/50; 3D Systems) was used to manufacture parts designed in CAD software (Solidworks) and sliced into printed layers by 3D Lightyear software (v1.4; 3D Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injection molds were fabricated on glass slides using a prepolymer solution composed of 20% (wt/vol) PEGDMA MW 1,000 g/mol (Polysciences) in PBS (Lonza) with 0.5% (wt/vol) 1-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-propanone-1-one photoinitiator (Irgacure 2959; BASF) dissolved in DMSO (Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bio-bot skeletons were fabricated on glass slides using a prepolymer solution composed of 20% (vol/vol) PEGDA MW 700 g/mol (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS with 0.5% (wt/vol) Irgacure 2959 photoinitiator dissolved in DMSO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following fabrication, molds and bio-bot skeletons were rinsed in PBS, sterilized in 100% ethanol (Decon Labs) for 1 h, and stored in PBS for at least 1 h before use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For parts that required chemical tethering to the underlying slides, the glass was pretreated with 2% (vol/vol) 3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100% ethanol for 5 min, washed in 100% ethanol for 5 min, and baked at 110 °C for 3 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Formation_of_Optogenetic_Muscle_Rings_and_Strips  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strip molds were assembled by placing bio-bot skeletons within holders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both strip molds and ring molds were kept moist, but unsubmerged, in PBS during the injection molding process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optogenetic C2C12 myoblasts were trypsinized (TrypLE; Life Technologies), suspended in a solution of GM supplemented with 1 mg/mL ACA (Sigma Aldrich) (GM+), and combined with ice cold 30% (vol/vol) Matrigel basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences), 4 mg/mL fibrinogen (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.5 U/mg-fibrinogen thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich) for a total cell/gel solution volume of 120 µL per muscle strip or ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cell/gel solution was immediately injected into the strip/ring molds and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before the addition of enough GM+ to submerge the muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The muscle actuators were then incubated for 3 d in GM+, with daily media changes, and incubated after that in differentiation medium (DM++) with daily media changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differentiation medium consisted of DMEM with l-glutamine and sodium pyruvate (Corning Cellgro), supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat inactivated HS (Lonza), 1% (vol/vol) l-glutamine, 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-streptomycin, 1 mg/mL ACA, and 50 ng/mL IGF1 (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Optical_and_Electrical_Stimulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Muscle strip and ring actuators were optically stimulated using a 470-nm LED (Mightex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trains of 50-ms pulses of specified frequency (1, 2, and 4 Hz) were generated using a custom-built device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LED output was focused using a lens, and a maximum power of 1.9 mW/mm2 was used (corresponding to a spot diameter of 8 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical stimulation of bio-bots was conducted in DM++ media, and all movies were taken through a red camera filter to make the focused nature of the light stimulus easier to visualize.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During exercise training, a 2-min rest period was incorporated between stimulation at different frequencies, and all experiments were performed at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrical stimulation was conducted using a custom-built electrical setup designed to provide bipolar electrical pulses of 20-V amplitude (21.6 V/cm field strength) and 50-ms pulse width, as previously described (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrical stimulation of bio-bots was conducted in serum-free DMEM to reduce electrolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Passive tension force was measured by correlating the deflection of the curved beam in the bio-bot skeleton to the contractile force applied on the bio-bot skeletons pillars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Displacements were measured in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health), and passive tension force was calculated from an equation derived from Euler-Bernoulli beam-bending theory: P=(8EI/lL2)max.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this equation, E represents the Youngs modulus of the beam (319 kPa) as measured using a tensile mechanical testing apparatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I is the moment of inertia, L is the beam length, l is the measured moment arm from the muscle strip to the beam, and max is the measured beam deflection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active tension force was measured by correlating the displacement of the ends of the bio-bot skeleton to the active contractile force produced in response to an external stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bio-bot was treated as a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic structure composed of a spring and damper in parallel, where applied stresses are related to measured strains by the following equation: (t)=E(t)+[d(t)/dt], as previously described (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Speed was calculated by dividing distance traveled by time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunofluorescence_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Muscle strips and rings were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde (EMD Chemicals) for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.2% (vol/vol) Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min, and stored in blocking solution (Image-iT FX Signal Enhancer; Invitrogen) before staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The muscle was then incubated in mouse MF-20 antimyosin heavy chain (1:400 dilution in Image-iT FX, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, The University of Iowa Department of Biology) for 6 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:400 dilution in Image-iT FX; Invitrogen) for 12 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, they were incubated in DAPI (1:5,000 in sterilized deionized water; Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min before fixation onto a glass-bottom dish (MatTek) with warm agarose gel and imaging with a confocal microscope (LSM 710; Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_Protein_Quantification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Muscle rings were detached from hydrogel skeletons, rinsed in PBS, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of analysis, rings were weighed, halved, and weighed again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA concentration in each half was measured using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 1000) at 260 nm after genomic DNA was isolated using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total DNA content was calculated from the concentration using the known elution volume and total muscle ring mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other halves of the muscle rings were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific) on ice and briefly sonicated (Digital Sonifier 150; Branson).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and diluted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein concentration in these halves was determined with a spectrophotometer by comparing absorbance of each sample at 562 nm to a standard curve of BSA protein absorbance vs. concentration, using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total protein content was calculated from the concentration using known supernatant volume and total muscle ring mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analysis was performed via one-way ANOVA followed by Tukeys multiple comparison test for P less_than 0.05 using OriginPro software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are presented as mean ± SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
