Coordinated beating of algal flagella is mediated by basal coupling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In areas as diverse as developmental biology, physiology, and biomimetics, there is great interest in understanding the mechanisms by which active hair-like cellular appendages known as flagella or cilia are brought into coordinated motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevailing theoretical hypothesis over many years is that fluid flows driven by beating flagella provide the coupling that leads to synchronization, but this is surprisingly inconsistent with certain experimentally observed phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate the insufficiency of hydrodynamic coupling in an evolutionarily significant range of unicellular algal species bearing multiple flagella, and suggest that the key additional ingredient for precise coordination of flagellar beating is provided by contractile fibers of the basal apparatus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cilia and flagella often exhibit synchronized behavior; this includes phase locking, as seen in Chlamydomonas, and metachronal wave formation in the respiratory cilia of higher organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the observations by Gray and Rothschild of phase synchrony of nearby swimming spermatozoa, it has been a working hypothesis that synchrony arises from hydrodynamic interactions between beating filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work on the dynamics of physically separated pairs of flagella isolated from the multicellular alga Volvox has shown that hydrodynamic coupling alone is sufficient to produce synchrony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the situation is more complex in unicellular organisms bearing few flagella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that flagella of Chlamydomonas mutants deficient in filamentary connections between basal bodies display markedly different synchronization from the wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We perform micromanipulation on configurations of flagella and conclude that a mechanism, internal to the cell, must provide an additional flagellar coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In naturally occurring species with 4, 8, or even 16 flagella, we find diverse symmetries of basal body positioning and of the flagellar apparatus that are coincident with specific gaits of flagellar actuation, suggesting that it is a competition between intracellular coupling and hydrodynamic interactions that ultimately determines the precise form of flagellar coordination in unicellular algae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Flagellar synchronization in multicellular vs. unicellular algae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Pairs of isolated, somatic flagella of VC tend to synchronize either in IP or AP depending on their relative orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) CR flagella maintain position 2 yet swim a robust IP breaststroke that is lost (i) by mutation of the DF, and (ii) in pairs of nearby uniflagellate cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C and D) Ultrastructure comprising BBs, rootlets, and eyespot in VC (C) and CR (D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numbered microtubule triplets are denoted by t1t9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Synchronization_of_Chlamydomonas_Flagella  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The basic configuration of two flagella appears in multiple lineages by convergent evolution, e.g., in the naked green alga Spermatozopsis (23), in gametes of the seaweed Ulva (24), and in swarm cells of Myxomycetes (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CR exemplifies the isokont condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells ovoid, 5 m radius, have flagella 1.5× body length and distinguishable by BB age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During cell division, each daughter retains one BB from the mother (26), which becomes associated with the trans-flagellum, and a second is assembled localizing near the eyespot and associates with the cis-flagellum (Fig 1 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When both flagella prescribe identical beats, a nearly planar breaststroke results, which is highly recurrent and stable to perturbations (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite extensive research (2832), exactly how this IP breaststroke is achieved has remained elusive; coupling of the flagella pair may be by (i) hydrodynamics, (ii) drag-based feedback due to cell body rocking, or (iii) intracellular means.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CR cells turn by modulation of bilateral symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During phototaxis (33), photons incident on the eyespot activate voltage-gated calcium channels, which alter levels of intracellular calcium, leading to differential flagellar responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ionic fluctuations (e.g., Ca2+) alter not only the flagellar beat but also the synchrony of a pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gait changes involving transient loss of synchrony (called slips) occur stochastically at rates sensitive to such environmental factors (15, 27, 34) as temperature, light, chemicals, hydrodynamics, and age of cell culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In free-swimming cells, slips can alter the balance of hydrodynamic drag on the cell body, producing a rocking motion that promotes subsequent resynchrony of flagella (31), but this does not explain the robust IP synchrony in cells held immobilized on micropipettes (16, 29), nor the motility of isolated and reactivated flagellar apparatuses (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The altered beat during slips is analogous to the freestyle gait (AP in Fig 1) characterized in the phototaxis mutant ptx1, which stochastically transitions between IP and AP gaits (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dependence of CR flagellar synchronization state on physiology through temperature or ionic content of the medium (27) leads us now to the possibility for intracellular coupling of flagella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Early work (18) identified thick fibers connecting the two Chlamydomonas BBs, including a 300×250×75 nm3 bilaterally symmetric distal fiber (DF), bearing complex striation patterns with a periodicity of 80 nm (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two or more parallel proximal fibers (PF) also connect the BB at one end (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Striation periodicity varies across species, and is changeable by chemical stimuliindicating active contractility (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DF contains centrin, also found in nuclear basal body connectors (NBBCs) (Fig 1B), which are involved in localization of BBs during cell division (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two BBs have an identical structure of nine triplet microtubules that form a cartwheel arrangement (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the DF lies in the plane of flagellar beating, and furthermore attaches to each BB at the same site relative to the beating direction of the corresponding flagellum (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inherent rotational symmetry makes the DF uniquely suited to coordinating the IP Chlamydomonas breaststroke.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hypothesizing a key role for the DF in CR flagellar synchrony, we assess the motility of the mutant vfl3 (CC1686; Chlamydomonas Center), with DFs missing, misaligned, or incomplete in a large fraction of cells (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Swimming is impaired: many cells rotate in place at the chamber bottom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vfl3, the number of flagella (05), their orientation and localization on the cell body, and cell size are abnormal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BBs still occur in pairs, but not every BB will nucleate a flagellum (39), thus allowing the flagella number to be odd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no structural or behavioral defects were observed in the flagella (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A number of representative configurations of flagella occur in vfl3, for cells bearing two or three flagella (Fig 2 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2G presents the wild-type case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider pairwise interactions between flagella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each flagellum, we extract a phase (t) from the high-speed imaging data by interpolating peaks in the SD of pixel intensities measured across predefined regions of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vfl3 flagellar beating frequencies are found to be more variable than the wild type, so we elect to determine phase synchrony between pairs of flagella via a stroboscopic approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given phases 1, 2, we wish to characterize the distribution PC() of =2mod2|t:1mod2=C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the phase of flagellum 2 is measured conditional on the phase of flagellum 1 attaining the value C. From long timeseries, we determine  by binning [0,2] into 25 equiphase intervals centered around {Ck,k=1,,25} to obtain the Nk corresponding time points for which 1mod2 falls into the kth interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of this conditional phase k:={2(ti),i=1,,Nk}, which is peaked when oscillators phase lock and uniform when unsynchronized, can then be displayed on a circular plot by conversion to a color map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2, we take k=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase vectors can be summed and averaged to define a synchronization indexS=125k25|1NkjNkexp(ijk)|,[1]where Sk=1 (perfect synchrony) and Sk=0 (no synchronization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vfl3, steric interactions between nearby flagella (e.g., Fig 2A) can lead to intermittent beating and reduction in beat frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when measured beat frequencies differ for flagella on the same cell, periods of phase locking are observed, which we attribute to hydrodynamic interactions (12, 15, 40) (see also Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the triflagellates of Fig 2 D and E, beating of a given flagella pair becomes strongly coupled, with IP or, respectively, AP synchrony being preferred when flagella are oriented with power strokes parallel or, respectively, antiparallel (compare f0, f2 in Fig 2D with f0, f2 in Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even biflagellate vfl3 cells with a native CR-like configuration cannot perform IP breaststrokes (e.g., Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, wild-type CR flagella operating over a large frequency range are able to achieve robust synchrony, despite intrinsic cis/trans frequency differences of up to 30% during slips, or conditions of physiological stress such as deflagellation (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, possession of functional or complete DFs appears necessary for CR flagellar synchrony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Micromanipulation_of_Flagellate_Algae  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next we ask whether the CR breaststroke can instead be produced by hydrodynamic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of flagella belonging to different cells offers a tractable alternative to removal by mutation of such physical connectors as the DF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We construct, by micromanipulation, configurations of two flagella that cannot be coupled other than through the immersing fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 3A, one flagellum was removed from each of two wild-type CR cells by careful mechanical shearing (Materials and Methods), so that a CR-like arrangement comprising one cis and one trans flagellum is assembled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite similarity with the wild-type configuration, no sustained IP breaststrokes were obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Closely separated (less_than5 m) pairs exhibit periods of phase locking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beat frequencies of these flagella are found to be noisier than their counterparts in intact CR cells, and, consequently, measured phase locking is not robust (S=0.08).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conditional (stroboscopic) phase  (Fig 3A) is peaked weakly about , indicating a tendency for AP synchronization, but the IP state is also possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bistability is not species-specific; we rendered uniflagellate (see also ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) pairs of pipette-held VC somatic cells (normally biflagellate) and placed them in a similar configuration (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the resulting pairwise flagellar interactions indicates a strong preference for AP synchronization, although the IP is again observed (see Movies S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the phase stroboscope is now strongly peaked near = (with S=0.67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The existence, stability, and frequency of IP and AP states are wholly consistent with a basic theory (40) that models a pair of hydrodynamically coupled flagella as beads rotating on springs with compliant radii R separated by distance  (see SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming R, either IP or AP states of synchrony are predicted to be stable depending on whether the beads are corotating or respectively counterrotating (15, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, CR-like configurations should tend to AP synchrony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our experiments, flagella often come into such close proximity during certain phases of their beat cycles that the far-field assumptions of the original model break down.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonlocal hydrodynamic interactions between different portions of flagella must now be considered for the true flagellar geometry (rather than in a phase-reduced bead model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, undulating filaments can be driven by fluidstructure interactions into either IP or AP oscillating modes, depending on initial relative phase (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inherent stochasticity of flagellar beating (27) thus leads to transitions between IP and AP states (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrodynamic effects are notably stronger in the case of VC than CR, due to reduced screening by a smaller cell body and a distinctive upward tilt of the flagellar beat envelope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During evolution to multicellularity, this latter adjustment of BB orientation (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 C and D) facilitates beating of flagella confined within a spherical colony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CR mutant ptx1 also displays noisy transitions between IP and AP gaits (15) due to an unknown mutation; the implications of this we shall return to later (see Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The similarity of two flagellar waveforms in any given state (IP or AP) can be compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ease of visualization, waveforms discretized at equidistant points are ordered from base to tip: fiL, fiR for i=1,Np, and rescaled to uniform total length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are rotated by T() through angle  between the horizontal and line of offset between the BBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We denote by fLfL=T(fLm) and fRfR=T(fRm), with m=(f1L+f1R)/2, and compare the resulting shape symmetries during IP and AP states (Fig 3 A and B, stacked).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synchronization index of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, although suitable for identifying presence or absence of phase synchrony, does not discriminate between AP and IP states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we compute the pairwise curvature difference (t,s)=LR as a function of time (t) and normalized arclength (s), where L, R are signed curvatures for the left and right flagellum according to their respective power stroke directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During IP and AP synchrony,  exhibits a wave pattern at the common or phase-locked frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal or high-curvature bends propagate from flagellum base to tip in accordance with the mechanism of flagellar beating in these species (0.897±0.213 mm/s for CR, and 0.914±0.207 mm/s for VC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we have established, in two species, that robust IP synchrony akin to the CR breaststroke does not arise from hydrodynamic coupling between two coplanarly beating flagella arranged in a CR-like configuration, even when beat frequencies are comparable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, the propensity for algal flagella to be deformable by hydrodynamic loading (12), e.g., flows generated by nearby flagella, suggests that an internal coupling must be present to compensate in such cases where fluid interactions are contrary to the desired mode of propulsion by flagella in the organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this delicate interplay, will a dramatic perturbation to the state of hydrodynamic interactions between flagella affect their native mode of coordination?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we require an organism with more than two flagella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetraselmis is a thecate quadriflagellate, and is amenable to micromanipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4A depicts a pipette-immobilized Tetraselmis cell with flagella free to beat in a pattern qualitatively similar to free-swimming cells observed under identical conditions (see Movie S4), in which flagella maintain a transverse gallop (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4C and 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One flagellum was then trapped inside a second pipette with suction so as to completely stall its beating, with minimal disruption to the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flagellar dynamics were monitored and interflagellar correlation functions were computed (Fig 4B), showing that the prior beat patterns continue (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small increase in beat frequency in the remaining flagella (5%) is consistent with calcium-induced frequency elevation by mechanosensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This remarkable ability of the cell to sustain its coordination pattern strongly implicates internal beat modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Symmetries_of_the_Algal_Flagellar_Apparatus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Such a hypothesis brings us now to further detailed study of a large number of lesser-known species that have differing or more complex basal architectures and which, in turn, we find to display varied and novel flagellar coordination strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is believed that volvocine green algae (including VC) derived from Chlamydomomonas-like ancestors, the general classification of Viridiplanta (green plants) has undergone repeated revisions due to the enormous variability that exists in the form and structure exhibited by its member species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Features, both developmental (mitosis, cytokinesis) and morphological (number, structure, arrangement of flagella, nature of body coverings such as scales and theca), have served as key diagnostics for mapping the likely phylogenetic relationships existing between species (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We selected unicellular species of evolutionary interest to exemplify configurations of 2, 4, 8, or even 16 flagella (Movies S5S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include (Fig 5) distinct genera of biflagellates and quadriflagellates, both occurring abundantly in nature, the rare octoflagellate marine Prasinophyte known as Pyramimonas octopus, and its relative Pyramimonas cyrtopterathe only species known with 16 flagella (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, only three Pyramimonas species have eight flagella during all or parts of their cell cycles (4547).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several species belong to the Prasinophytesa polyphyletic class united through lack of similarity with either of the main clades (Chlorophyta and Streptophyta), whose 16 genera and 160 species (48) display a remarkable variability in flagella number and arrangement that is ideal for the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Distinct quadriflagellate gaits were identified, involving particular phase relations between flagella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analogy may be drawn with quadruped locomotion (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For measured flagellar phases j (flagellum index j), we compute the matrix ij=ij (i,j=1,,4), where ij=ji, ii=0, and ik=ij+jk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each gait is then associated with a 3-tuple of phase differences: [121314].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, Pyramimomas parkeae swims with two pairs of precisely alternating breaststrokes akin to the trot of a horse (Fig 6A and Movie S6); its four isokont flagella insert anteriorly into an apical pit, emerging in a cruciate arrangement typical of quadriflagellates (Fig 6, type I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase relation [121314]=[0] is seen in both free-swimming and micropipette-held cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Chlorophyte alga Polytomella sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  parva (Fig 5) was also found to display this gait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two further gaits (Movie S6) occur in the type Pyramimonas species P. tetrarhynchus (49), a freshwater alga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first we term the pronk, where all flagella synchronize with zero phase difference (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second, flagella beat in a sequence typical of the transverse gallop in quadrupeds (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. tetrarhynchus swims preferentially with the latter gait, whereas pronking can occur when the cell navigates near walls/obstacles, or when changing direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rotary gallop, with flagella beating counterclockwise (CCW) in orderly sequence (Fig 6C and Movie S6) occurs in the volvocale Carteria crucifera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in Tetraselmis (recall Fig 4), the flagella separate distally into pairs (Fig 6, type II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells display the transverse gallop when free-swimming or pipette-held despite strong hydrodynamic interactions within each pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternate synchronous gait of four flagella has been reported in this species (50), but was not observed under our experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ordinarily, motive gaits whereby the limbs of a quadruped or arthropod are actuated in precise patterns are produced by networks of coupled oscillators controlled by a central pattern generator (CPG) or equivalent (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogously, can we relate symmetries of the flagellar apparatus to gait symmetries, with contractile filaments providing the putative coupling?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focus on quadriflagellates, where an abundance of species makes possible comparative study (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial symmetries of flagella Xj (indexed by j=1,2,3,4) are represented as permutations  of {1,2,3,4}, so that Xk(t)=X(k)(t) for all times t. Periodic gaits also possess temporal symmetries: If T is the gait period, then, for the kth oscillator, Xk(t)=Xk(t+T) for all t. We normalize T to 2 and consider invariance of flagella under phase shifts  taken modulo T/2; the pair [,] denotes a spatialtemporal symmetry of the {Xj}, whereXk(t)=X(k)(t),[2]and k=1,,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The set of spatiotemporal symmetries may admit a (symmetry) group under composition,[1;1]°[2;2]=[12;1+2],[3]to be matched with known quadruped/quadriflagellate gaits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a basal morphology of a rectangularly symmetric network (51) with distinct lengthwise and crosswise couplingsin Fig 5 (phase coordination) represented by lines of differing lengthsspatial symmetries include  (the identity, fix everything), =(12)(34) (reflect in y axis), =(13)(24) (reflect in x axis), and =(14)(23) (interchange of diagonals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 5, we attach named gaits and associated symmetry groups to the species in which they are observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, some quadriflagellates display a stand gait (a transient rest phase where no flagellum beats); this has the largest number of symmetries: [;],[;],[;],[;], for arbitrary .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Can such a network resemble coupling of algal flagella?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite significant variation across species, linkages or roots connecting BBs are key systematic characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These can be microtubular or fibrillar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microtubular roots, which were probably asymmetric in very early flagellates (20), position BBs and attached flagella during development (two per BB: termed left, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The right root is generally two-stranded, and, together with the left root (X-stranded), forms an X-2-X-2 cruciate system characteristic of advanced green algae [X=4 in CR (18)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one absolute configuration of BBs exists for each species, and its mirror-symmetric form is not possible (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, in CR, two BBs emerge at 7090° with a clockwise (CW) offset characteristic of advanced biflagellate algae (Fig 1D); in contrast, many evolutionarily more primitive flagellates have BBs oriented with a CCW offset (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibrillar roots, classified as system I or II (43), become more numerous with flagella number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are generally contractile, likely contributing to interflagellar coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each BB is unique up to the imbrication of its member tubules: A constant positional relationship pertains between its two roots and a principal connecting fiber linking the two ontogenetically oldest BBs, labeled 1,2 in keeping with convention (53, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is this fiber that is mutated in vfl3 mutants (recall Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Take a quadriflagellate species for which the basal architecture is known, and consider its associated swimming mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In P. parkeae (Fig 6A), a prominent (striated) DF called the synistosome links BBs 1,2 only (55), so that the coupling is different between different pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the advanced heterotroph Polytomella parva, which swims with a comparable gait, flagella form opposing V-shaped pairs with different coupling between pairs (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Tetraselmis, the flagella separate distally into two nearly collinear pairs with BBs forming a single zig-zag array (Fig 5), in a state thought to have arisen from rotation of two of the flagellar roots in an ancestral quadriflagellate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfibers that are functionally related to the Chlamydomonad PF and DF connect alternate BBs, whereas BBs within the same pair are linked by Z-shaped struts (57), emphasizing a diagonal connectivity that may explain its transverse gallop (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the rotary gallop, prominent in C. crucifera (Fig 6C), is more consistent with a square symmetric network involving near-identical connectivity between neighboring flagella than with a rectangular one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the flagellar apparatus in this species has been shown to exhibit unusual rotational symmetry: BBs insert into an anterior papilla at the corners of a square in a cruciate pattern [class II sensu Lembi (58)] and are tilted unidirectionally in contrast to the conventional V shapes found in Chlamydomonas and Polytomella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [Here DFs, rather than linking directly to BBs, attach to rigid electron-dense rods extending between them (58).]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a different network of couplings appears when two biflagellate CR gametes fuse during sexual reproduction (59) to form a transiently quadriflagellate dikaryon (similar to configuration II, Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, original DFs between cis and trans remain, but new fibers do not form between pairs of flagella of unlike mating type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong hydrodynamic coupling due to their physical proximity results in a striking double bilateral breaststroke (Movie S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A bound-like gait can appear if both sets of CR flagella slip together (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, algal motility appears to be constrained by the form of underlying coupling provided by a species-specific configuration of BBs and connecting fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The case of octoflagellates and hexadecaflagellates swimming is more complex (Movies S7 and S8), limited by the number of species available for study, and presence of a large number of fibrous structures whose identities remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A consistent numbering system for BBs has greatly facilitated the study of flagellar transformation in algae with many flagella, which we adopt (53, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in other Pyramimonas, BBs 1,2 remain connected by a large synistosome (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In P. octopus, up to 60 individual fibers establish specific connections with specific BB triplets, in addition to six to eight rhizoplasts linking the basal apparatus to the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous rhizoplasts and connecting fibers also exist in P. cyrtoptera but were never resolved fully because of the untimely death of T. Hori (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In P. octopus (Fig 7), BBs arrange in a diamond (partially open to allow nuclear migration during mitosis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BB duplication is semiconservative (61): Eight new BBs form peripheral to the existing ones during cell division (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The innermost BBs (1,2) assume the new position 1 in the two daughters (i.e., full maturation) after round 1 of cell division, but BBs 3,4 and 58 only reach maturation after rounds 2, 3, respectively (47, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All 2n BBs in a given cell reach and thereafter remain at position 1 by the nth generation [see P. cyrtoptera (44)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In electron micrographs of P. octopus, flagellar beating is oriented in CCW sequence (47, 54) consistent with observed CW body rotation (viewed from above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells 20 m in length, with yet longer flagella whose distal portions fold and recurve by the cell, swim at 200300 m/s along helical paths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diametrically opposite groups (usually but not exclusively pairs) of flagella beat synchronously with ordered phase shifts between groups (Fig 7A and Movie S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IP coupling appears more robust in distinguished pairs (Movie S7), reflecting prominent symmetries of the basal architecture; e.g., a large synistosome links BBs 1,2, whose flagella beat in opposite directions (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compatible with its benthic nature, P. octopus display the stand gait introduced previously (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Swimming motion resumes spontaneously when all eight flagella reactivate (pronking), and the normal gait is reestablished within only two or three beats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A transient state in which beating occurs in four of eight flagella (staggered) is observed in Fig 7D, in which actively beating flagella are identified by summing successive gradient images (in contrast, in Fig 7C, all eight flagella are in motion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We visualize the flow disturbance imparted by flagellar beating using optical flow to monitor the migration of image pixels between frames, and estimate flow directions and magnitudes (62) (also Computer Vision toolbox, MATLAB; The MathWorks, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Components of the 2D flow field were determined by minimizing an objective function subject to certain global (smoothness) or local (fidelity) constraints, and pixels delineating the same object are likely to have constant intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike conventional particle image velocimetry (PIV) methods, this removes the need to seed the medium with foreign particles or tracers, and fluid flow due to motion can be obtained directly from optical data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow strengths decay rapidly away from boundaries of flagella as well as the cell body, which is also in motion (Fig 7 C and D, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, gait transitions in these primitive algae can be dramatic and involve unusual flagellar coordination in response to external stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we reserve special attention to the P. cyrtoptera pronking gait, which displays striking hydrodynamic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

P. cyrtoptera is the only hexadecaflagellate known (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is an Arctic species thought to have evolved when P. octopus failed to divide after duplication of chloroplasts and flagella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measuring up to 40 m, this is the largest Pyramimonas ever recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its 16 flagella (32 when dividing), which are longer than the cell and emerge radially from a deep anterior flagellar pit (Fig 8 A and B), are used by the organism to attach to icy surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The name P. cyrtoptera is derived from the Greek for cyrtos, meaning curved, and pteron, meaning wing, in reference to cell morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light microscopy reveals a lobed structure with two pairs of split eyespots and the presence of two chloroplasts (Fig 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. cyrtoptera cells are stenothermal and euryhaline: Growth becomes limited above 78 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once removed from their natural habitat where temperature variations are typically less_than2 °C, cell cultures often prove fragile and difficult to maintain in the laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hexadecaflagellate swimming presents an intriguing circumstance in which the distance of separation between flagella is so small that hydrodynamic coupling is inevitable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When fully splayed (Fig 8B), the 16 flagella are separated, on average, by 360/16=22.5° or 7.85 m measured at a radial distance of 20 m from the cell, compared with 360/8=45° and twice this distance in P. octopus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In P. cyrtoptera, the interflagellar distance is thus far below the critical length to achieve synchronization by hydrodynamics (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong hydrodynamic interactions are evident between some or even all flagella (Movie S8), none more so than during the pronk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of tracking individual flagella (which beat in synchrony), we use the area A(t) bounding the flagella as proxy for phase of beat cycle (normalized),16(t)=(ttntn+1tn)[tnttn+1],[4]where tn are discrete marker events corresponding to local maxima of A(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pronking occurs at 25 Hz (Fig 8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant hydrodynamic effects are also evidenced in cells swimming against surfaces, where flagella exhibit symplectic metachronal waves (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insufficiency_of_Hydrodynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phenomenon of cooperative or synchronous beating of cilia and flagella has received growing attention, with hydrodynamic interactions historically assumed to be the major source of coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is only recently (15, 31, 32) that researchers have begun to question this long-standing belief.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach was motivated in part by the freestyle gait (AP) in the CR phototaxis mutant ptx1, realizing that the wild-type IP breaststroke cannot be reconciled with hydrodynamic theory (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional ingredient, internal to the cell, must be maintaining IP synchrony in CR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that entrainment of CR flagella by periodic external flows only occurs at frequencies close to the natural beat frequency and strengths greatly in excess of physiological values led Quaranta et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to a similar conclusion (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DF likely couples CR flagella, providing a degree of freedom that can reorient a flagellum at the BB through its contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In isolated and reactivated flagella apparatuses, for example, the DF constricts in response to elevated extracellular calcium to reduce the opening angle between the two BBs (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because BBs nucleate/anchor flagella and function as centrioles during cell division, the DF can also be affected by mutations in BB duplication and segregation (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This brings us back to the unusual flagellar coordination in ptx1, which is thought to possess two trans-like flagella (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If BB signaling or connectivity is disrupted or weakened in ptx1, stochastic IP/AP transitions can result when hydrodynamic interactions compete with a reduced intracellular coupling (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, for all their DF defects, flagella of vfl3 do not synchronize, or only hydrodynamically, when very close together (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work should seek to examine flagellar apparatuses of ptx1 under electron microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The failure of hydrodynamics to synchronize two flagella in a CR-like configuration, let alone two functionally distinct flagella such as a cis and a trans (16, 65), was shown by micromanipulation of two pipette-held cells (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The diversity of coordination gaits in flagellate species (Fig 5) implicates internal coupling as a generic remedy for this insufficiency of hydrodynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, nonuniqueness of stable quadriflagellate gaits for even identical configurations of four flagella is incompatible with the existence of a single hydrodynamic mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some species, a number of gait bifurcations can occur during free-swimming, involving modification or even cessation of beating in one or more flagella, suggesting coordination is an active process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significant perturbation to the hydrodynamic landscape resulting from immobilizing one flagellum in Tetraselmis suecica was found to have little effect on the native coordination of the remainder (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, symmetries of flagellar gaits are much more species- than drag-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intracellular_Coupling_of_Flagella_by_Contractile_Fibers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gaits are defined by the relative phase between oscillators, which, in the analogy of multilegged locomotion, may be produced by CPG or pacemaker signals, which, in algae, we conjecture to be mediated by the basal architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flagellar apparatuses imaged by electron microscopy reveal species-specific networks of connections that increase in complexity with flagella number (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Symmetries of an underlying network of structural couplings (51) likely translate downstream into symmetries of observed multiflagellate gaits (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BB from which the flagellum nucleates is a center for conduction of morphogenetic and sensory information between flagella and other intracellular organelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although BBs are not essential for flagellar function [isolated axonemes continue to beat when reactivated in ATP (66, 67)], the contractility of inter-BB connections may contribute to coordination (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CR, robust NBBCs descending near the DF link BBs to the nucleus (Fig 1B), and remain intact even after detergent lysis treatment (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These can be induced by calcium to undergo significant contraction (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, rhizoplasts of scaly algae, including Pyramimonas and Tetraselmis, can contract and relax cyclically (43, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These species display frequent directional changes (mechanoshock) that may be mediated by the extraordinary contractility of rhizoplasts (50), with normal coordination after abrupt gait changes rapidly reestablished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibrillar structures under tension experience much distortion during active beating, as observed from misalignment of fiber striation patterns (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contraction during live beating is ATP-dependent in Polytomella (71), occurs in real time in paralyzed flagella and temperature-sensitive mutants of Chlamydomonas (72), and occurs to an extraordinary degree in Microthamnion zoospores (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATPase activity has also been identified in the rod cells of the human eye where a large striated root attaches to the BB of a short (nonmotile) cilium (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attachment sites of contractile fibers also exhibit great specificity, in most species to specific microtubule triplets and disk complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In P. octopus, contractile fibers attach to the weaker side of BBs (triplets 69), and may function to pull the flagellum back from each power stroke during its unique multibreaststroke gait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evolution_of_Multiflagellation_Among_Viridiplantae  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an appendage, cilia, flagella, and its 9+2 axoneme prevails across eukaryotes and, especially, the green algae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, beyond the universality of this basic machinery, much variability (Fig 5) persists in the placement of organelles, form of flagellar insertion, and diversity of flagellar coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basal apparatus is that rare structure that is both universally distributed and stable enough to infer homology across large phylogenetic distances, and yet variable enough to distinguish between different lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative species considered here express 2n flagella, with much conservatism in the biflagellate or quadriflagellate condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since an early flagellate phagocytosed a prokaryote (the future chloroplast) 1 billion years ago, green algae have evolved photosynthesis and autotrophism (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their radiation and division into the Streptophyta and Chlorophyta (76) has been corroborated by modern high-throughput chloroplast genome sequencing (77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Occupying a basal phylogenetic position are morphologically diverse species of freshwater and marine Prasinophytes, including the Pyramimonas species (20) studied here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These have conspicuous body and flagella scales that are precursors of theca and volvocalean cell walls (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, P. tetrarhynchus, P. octopus, and P. cyrtoptera are assigned according to morphological characters (78) to the same subgenus, in which accelerated rates of evolution were confirmed by cladistic analysis of rbcL gene sequences (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in basal ultrastructure were major events (20), with the quadriflagellate condition arising multiple times; in fact, it is the quadriflagellates (e.g., Carteria) and not Chlamydomonad-type biflagellates that are considered basal to advanced volvocales (77, 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advanced heterotrophic alga Polytomella, thought to have evolved by cell doubling along a direct line of descent from CR (80), displays the same trot gait as the ancestral P. parkeae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, convergent ultrastructural modifications coincident with multiplicity and doubling of BBs may have evolved to enable strong coupling between opposite flagella pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sparsity of species bearing 4 localized flagella (P. octopus, P. cyrtoptera) may stem from the difficulty and activity costs of a flagellar apparatus capable of maintaining coordination from within despite external effects such as hydrodynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. cyrtoptera exemplifies an intermediate between few to many flagella [16 is the highest number ever reported in a phytoflagellate (44)], and is able to exploit hydrodynamics for swimming in a novel manner (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energetic gains of such cooperativity may have inspired derivation of multiflagellated colonial volvocales from unicellular ancestors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Opportunities for fluid-mediated flagellar coordination and metachronism impose new constraints on the configuration of flagella and BBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In VC somatic cells, for example, BBs reorient during early stages of development to become parallel (Fig 1C), whereas biflagellate VC sperm cells (required to swim independently) retain the primitive V formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implications_for_Active_Control_of_Flagellar_Coordination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the comparative studies carried out in this work, we conclude that the physical principle for coordinating collective ciliary beating in Volvox or Paramecium differs from that responsible for defining precise patterns of beating in unicellular microswimmers bearing only a few flagella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the former case, hydrodynamic coupling between flagella is sufficient (12), but, in the latter (especially for obligate autotrophs), there is far greater incentive for efficient swimming to be robust despite hydrodynamic perturbations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in arrays of mammalian cilia, ciliary roots and basal feet structures continue to provide additional resistance to fluid stresses (22, 81).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rapid changes in cellular structure that are of fundamental evolutionary interest may have arisen, in the first instance, in green flagellates than higher organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the base of flagella in these algae are found diverse networks of interconnecting filaments that are not only responsible for anchorage and placement of flagella but that must now also be implicated in defining the symmetries of flagellar coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CR, for instance, most BB connections do not appear until after the BBs have already formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fiber contractility can produce elastic coupling between BBs to force nearby flagella into modes of synchrony (IP or AP) that oppose hydrodynamic influences (15, 82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This elasticity may be actively modulated, highlighting a direct correlation between cellular physiology and flagellar beating that has already been identified (27, 83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further insights into such processes will certainly require additional modeling and experimentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapidity with which patterns of synchrony can change is suggestive of transduction by electrical signals or ionic currents (84), which may be effected from cell interior to flagella by changes in the state of contraction or relaxation of connecting fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Striations of algal rhizoplasts are even biochemically mutable in a manner reminiscent of mammalian muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are therefore led to suggest that a parallel evolution of neuromuscular control of appendages may have occurred much earlier than previously thought (50, 85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Culturing_and_Growth_of_Algae  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Below are brief descriptions of the protocols for species whose flagellar dynamics are studied here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Volvox  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
V. carteri was prepared as described elsewhere (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining species, unless otherwise specified, were maintained under controlled illumination on 14-h day/10-h night cycles, and at a constant temperature of 22 °C (incubation chamber; Binder).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Manipulation_of_Viscosity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To facilitate identification of flagella in certain species, the viscosity of the medium was increased by addition of methyl cellulose (M7027, 15 cP; Sigma-Aldrich) to slow down cell rotation and translation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microscopy_and_Micromanipulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The capture of single cells is as described elsewhere (12, 14, 16, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Fig 3A, caught CR cells were examined under the light microscope to identify the eyespot and thus cis and trans flagella; the correct flagellum was then carefully removed using a second pipette with smaller inner diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
