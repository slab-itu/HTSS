Distal substitutions drive divergent DNA specificity among paralogous transcription factors through subdivision of conformational space  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most organisms contain families of related proteins that evolved from duplication of an ancestral gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the example of DNA binding by the steroid hormone receptors, this work examines the structural mechanisms by which these related proteins evolved separate functions during their history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that a functionally promiscuous ancestor was capable of accessing multiple protein conformations to bind disparate DNA sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This functional and conformational diversity were divided among daughter genes after gene duplication, allowing evolutionarily related proteins to generate disparate transcriptional outcomes in response to signaling input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many genomes contain families of paralogsproteins with divergent function that evolved from a common ancestral gene after a duplication event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand how paralogous transcription factors evolve divergent DNA specificities, we examined how the glucocorticoid receptor and its paralogs evolved to bind activating response elements [(+)GREs] and negative glucocorticoid response elements (nGREs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that binding to nGREs is a property of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DNA-binding domain (DBD) not shared by other members of the steroid receptor family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using phylogenetic, structural, biochemical, and molecular dynamics techniques, we show that the ancestral DBD from which GR and its paralogs evolved was capable of binding both nGRE and (+)GRE sequences because of the ancestral DBDs ability to assume multiple DNA-bound conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent amino acid substitutions in duplicated daughter genes selectively restricted protein conformational space, causing this dual DNA-binding specificity to be selectively enhanced in the GR lineage and lost in all others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key substitutions that determined the receptors response element-binding specificity were far from the proteins DNA-binding interface and interacted epistatically to change the DBDs function through DNA-induced allosteric mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These amino acid substitutions subdivided both the conformational and functional space of the ancestral DBD among the present-day receptors, allowing a paralogous family of transcription factors to control disparate transcriptional programs despite high sequence identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) DBD adopts distinct conformations to activate and repress transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) The NMR structure of free GR DBD in solution (46) is shown (Left); the GR DBD can dimerize on an inverted repeat (+)GRE element (21) to activate transcription (Center) or can bind as two monomers on an nGRE (Right) to repress transcription (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) NMR spectra of 15N-labeled GR DBD in the absence of DNA (Left) or bound to (+)GRE DNA (Center) or nGRE DNA (Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA-contacting residues (e.g., G439 or K442) are shifted upon nGRE or (+)GRE binding, but residues of the dimerization loop (red) are substantially shifted upon (+)GRE binding but not binding to the TSLP nGRE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between (+)GRE- and nGRE-bound GR DBD occur at other residues, including the appearance of NMR peaks for arginine side chains (Arg s.c.) when bound to nGRE (Lower Right), indicating altered rates of exchange of DBD(+)GRE and DBDnGRE complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that GR DBD adopts two distinct conformations to activate or repress transcription when bound to DNA (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C and D) All 3-keto SR DBDs bind to a consensus (+)GRE with nanomolar affinity (C), but only hGR binds to nGREs with nanomolar affinity (D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E and F) Whereas full-length hGR is capable of repressing a constitutively active nGRE-containing reporter, MR is not (E), despite high sequence and structural similarity within the DBDs (F) (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA_Substrates_Dictate_Conformation_of_the_GR_DBD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a dual DNA/RNA binding protein, GR binds a diverse number of nucleic acid substratesincluding (+)GRE DNA, nGRE DNA, mRNA, and the long intergenic noncoding RNA Gas5through its DBD (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether GRs nucleic acid substrate alters the conformation of its DBD, we performed 2D [1H,15N] heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) on 15N-labeled human (h)GR DBD free in solution as well as bound to both a consensus (+)GRE and an nGRE from the TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin) promoter (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, GR binding to both the (+)GRE and nGRE caused marked chemical shift perturbations within the GR DBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the GR DBD adopted distinct conformations when bound to an nGRE versus an (+)GRE, in agreement with the crystal structures solved of GR DBD(+)GRE and GR DBDnGRE complexes (20, 21) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues comprising the GR DBDs dimerization loop, such as Ala458, Gly459, and Arg460, showed significant chemical shift perturbations when bound to (+)GRE DNA but not nGRE DNA, supporting the notion that the GR DBD binds to the TSLP nGRE as two monomers (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, NMR peaks for arginine side chains appeared when the DBD was bound to nGRE, indicating altered rates of exchange of DBD(+)GRE and DBDnGRE complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, 2D [1H,15N] HSQC experiments with differing DBD:DNA molar ratios indicate that GR DBDnGRE binding is characterized by two nonidentical, monomeric binding events (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, GR DBD residues at the proteinDNA interface are affected by higher concentrations of GR DBD relative to nGRE DNA, whereas residues at the dimerization interface are not (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding demonstrates that two dimerization-independent GRDNA binding events occur between the GR DBD and the TSLP nGRE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

GR_Is_the_only_SR_Capable_of_Binding_nGREs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3-keto SRs exhibit extremely high sequence conservation within the DBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sequence conservation is mirrored by functional conservation at (+)GREs: all 3-keto SRs are capable of binding to a consensus (+)GRE with high affinity (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in vitro binding experiments demonstrate that GR is the only SR capable of binding with nanomolar affinity to the TSLP nGRE (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the inability of the non-GR 3-keto SRs to bind nGREs extends to cellular repression of nGRE-containing promoters, we tested the ability of MRGRs closest paralogto repress a constitutively active promoter containing the TSLP nGRE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with in vitro binding results, MR was unable to repress transcription from this element (Fig 1E), confirming that GR and MR exhibit a divergence in function at nGREs, which is quite remarkable considering the high sequence identity of GR and MR within the DBDs as well as the small size of the domain (75 aa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the X-ray crystal structures of the GR (21) and MR (20) DBDs bound to (+)GRE DNA are superimposable, suggesting that subtle structural and evolutionary mechanisms underlie the functional differences among the 3-keto SRs (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DBD-nGRE_Binding_and_Subsequent_Repression_Is_a_Feature_of_the_Ancestral_3-Keto_SR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To trace the evolutionary history of divergent response element specificity among the SRs from their well-established phylogeny (22), we reconstructed sequences of ancestral DBDs from key nodes within the 3-keto SR evolutionary lineage (SI Appendix, Tables S1S6 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All ancestral sequences were strongly supported (mean posterior probabilities were between 0.96 and 0.99 across sites), with very few ambiguously reconstructed residues (SI Appendix, Fig S4 and Tables S1S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used overlap-extension PCR to insert these DBDs into the full-length hGR and tested the DBDs ability to both activate a simple (+)GRE reporter and repress the TSLP nGRE under a constitutively active promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All extant and ancestral proteins within both the GR and MR lineage activated a (+)GRE reporter (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the ancestral (Anc)SR2 DBD, the common ancestor of all 3-keto SRs, was able to repress the TSLP nGRE from baseline, although this activity was not significant when corrected for multiple comparisons (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This slight repressive ability was retained in the AncCR DBD, the common ancestor of both GR and MR, lost in the AncMR, and enhanced in the GR lineage (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, a dramatic increase in the ability of GR to repress nGREs occurred between AncGR to AncGR2, which represents the GR protein in the common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates and all bony vertebrates, respectively (23) (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Remarkably few mutations led to divergence of function within this small protein domain, allowing a unique opportunity to pursue the detailed mechanisms by which functions are altered and distributed among paralogous proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illuminate the biochemical and structural mechanisms by which repression at nGREs was selectively retained and enhanced in the GR lineage, we recombinantly expressed and tested all ancestral DBDs for in vitro binding to both (+)GRE and nGRE DNA (Fig 2E and SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All ancestral DBDs bound to a consensus (+)GRE, as expected given the ability of all extant 3-keto SR DBDs to activate from these sequences (Fig 1E and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ancestral 3-keto SR, AncSR2, bound nGREs with affinity in the high nanomolar range, implying that nGRE binding originated at the ancestor of all 3-keto SRs and was then retained in GR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike hGR, the AncSR2 DBD displayed no negative cooperativity on nGREs; instead, negative cooperativity of DBD-nGRE binding emerged gradually along the lineage from AncSR2 to hGR (14) (SI Appendix, Table S7 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ancestral capacity to bind the TSLP nGRE was lost along the lineage leading to AncSR3, the common ancestor of the androgen and progesterone receptors (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only three historical amino acid substitutions occurred along this branch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that none of the individual changes affected the affinity of AncSR2 for nGREs or (+)GREs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When combined, however, the three mutations ablated nGRE binding, pointing to a strong epistatic interaction among these historical substitutions (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along the other lineageleading toward the GR and MRthe ancestral capacity to bind nGRE was retained in AncCR, ancestor of MR and GR, despite two amino acid changes in the DBD sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the duplication of AncCR to produce separate GR and MR genes, nGRE binding was lost in the lineage leading to MR, consistent with cellular repression data (Fig 2C and SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single historical substitution mediated this loss in function, and our experiments indicate that this mutation interacted epistatically with the two earlier amino acid substitutions during the AncSR2AncCR interval to abolish nGRE binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

GR_Evolved_Enhanced_Intermonomer_Allostery_at_nGREs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After establishing that GR alone retained an ancestral ability to bind to nGREs, we sought to obtain the structural mechanisms by which this expanded DNA specificity was uniquely retained and enhanced in the GR lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of the AncSR2 DBDTSLP nGRE complex reveals that the GRnGRE binding orientation and sequence specificity originated at the ancestor of all 3-keto SRs, before the emergence of vertebrates (5) (Fig 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Table S8), despite the superior ability of GR DBD to repress nGRE-mediated transcription in cells (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR data from (+)GRE- and nGRE-bound GR (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S1) indicate that DBD conformation differs when bound to distinct response elements, and such allosteric changes have been shown to affect transcriptional output (21, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories followed by community and suboptimal path analysis of the SRDNA complexes show that AncSR2s daughter proteins in the GR and MR lineage contain more complex community organizations, resulting in diverging allosteric communication upon DNA binding among AncSR2-derived paralogs: at nGREs, the community connecting DBD monomers is much larger in hGR versus AncSR2, indicating that DNA-mediated intermonomer communication and resulting negative cooperativity at nGREs (14) is enhanced in hGR compared with AncSR2 (Fig 3 CF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At (+)GREs, the community structure of AncSR2 bound to a (+)GRE is relatively simple compared with human (h)MR and hGR, with each monomer consisting of one large community ( and ) in direct allosteric communication, with some communication diverted through residues in the protein dimerization loops and through the DNA response element itself (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to both AncSR2 and hGR, such extensive DNA-mediated communication between DBD monomers is not a feature of the MR branch of the SR phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MD trajectories and resulting community analysis of the AncMR(+)GRE (SI Appendix, Table S8) and MR(+)GRE crystal structures (20) reveal a qualitatively different community organization and routes of communication, compared with their GR paralogs (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A greater fraction of the total communication between AncMR monomers occurs directly through the dimerization interface, as opposed to through the DNA, relative to the GR lineagea trend more pronounced in hMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the link between transcriptional output and allosteric communication (21, 25), the fracturing of the community organization and weakening of allosteric cohesiveness leads to a network in AncMR and hMR with decreased intra-DNA allosteric communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlates with weaker binding to nGRE sequences, where protein dimerization does not occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that all amino acid substitutions driving these allosteric changes occurred far from the DNA binding surface, which is likely necessary to maintain (+)GRE binding (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Subtle__Irreversible_Structural_Changes_Enhanced_nGRE_Binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the effects of the key historical substitutions on nGRE binding, we determined the X-ray crystal structures of several ancestral DBDs in complex with a nGRE or (+)GRE (SI Appendix, Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Gly425Serthe key substitution in the GR lineage that enhanced repression at nGREs (Fig 2)is involved in a change in conformational freedom of the DBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the AncGR2DNA crystal structure, the sidechain of Ser425 is solvent exposed and makes no contacts with DNA or the remainder of the GR DBD (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the conformational freedom granted by glycine residues (Fig 4C), we hypothesized that subtle changes in backbone conformation may underlie the large effect caused by the Gly425Ser substitution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All extant and ancestral 3-keto SRs (other than GRs) contain the ancestral glycine and occupy glycine-only backbone conformations when bound to (+)GREs, as visualized by a Ramachandran plot (Fig 4 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the AncSR2(+)GRE crystal structure (26) contains two dimers; Gly425 of one dimer occupies glycine-only Ramachandran space and Gly425 of the second dimer occupies general Ramachandran space (Fig 4D), indicating that AncSR2 may be more dynamic and able to occupy a wider range of conformational ensembles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Gly425Ser substitution at the AncGR2 node locked the GR lineage into a restricted subset of Ramachandran space, compared with the MR and AncSR3 lineages (Fig 4 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MD trajectories show that position 425 of AncGR2 occupies a separate subset of Ramachandran space from AncGR, eliminating any artifacts from crystal packing (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of these conformational changes, community analysis reveals that the Gly425Ser substitution decreases direct communication of the two DBD monomers via the dimerization interface and instead increases interprotein communication via DNA on activating elements, a trend that is preserved in hGR (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reversal of this substitution (Ser425Gly) in hGR causes the protein to retain high-affinity binding to a (+)GRE but to lose much of hGRs affinity for nGREs (Fig 4 H and I); similarly, in cells, full-length GR with the Ser425Gly mutation is a much less potent repressor of the TSLP nGRE (Fig 4J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate the two amino acid changes between AncGR2 and hGR, Ile420Leu and Phe478Tyr, locked hGR into dependence on the Gly425Ser substitution for even low-affinity binding to nGREs, a hypothesis supported by sequence alignments (SI Appendix, Fig S8) and similar to the evolutionary ratchet observed in SR ligand-binding domains (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of the GR DBD Ser425Gly mutant bound to DNA (SI Appendix, Fig S9) reveals that residue 425 reverts to a glycine-only conformation (Fig 4M), confirming that backbone conformation is the likely mechanism for the large-effect seen by the Gly425Sser substitution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when not bound to DNA, 2D [1H,15N] HSQC NMR experiments reveal that reversal of the Gly425Ser substitution in the hGR DBD results in large conformational changes in residues comprising the DNA-binding interface (SI Appendix, Fig S10), consistent with the historical substitutions effects on DNA-mediated interprotein communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of residue 425 to a nonglycine amino acid, such as alanine, does not cause a loss of nGRE binding, confirming that backbone dynamics are responsible for the effects of the Gly425Ser substitution (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the Ser425Gly mutation has been widely studied in the context of hGR and shown to have deleterious effects on the repression of T-bet, AP-1, and NF-B by hGR (2932), suggesting DNA binding-mediated effects play a larger role in proinflammatory transcriptional repression by the GR than has been previously assumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the historical Gly425Ser substitution conferred nGRE-mediated repression at the AncGR-AncGR2 transition, this substitution is not sufficient to improve affinity for nGREs when introduced into the human MR (Fig 4 K and L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates an additional role for epistatic mutations during steroid receptor DBD evolution: either mutations occurred in the lineage leading to AncGRbut not that to MRwhich were necessary for Gly425Ser to yield repression at nGREs, or restrictive mutations occurred in the lineage leading to MR, which prevented Gly425Ser from having that same effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In either case, amino acid substitutions that do not affect function on (+)GREs modified the capacity of other mutations to affect function nGREs, changing the evolutionary potential of the protein in a lineage-specific fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the epistatic and function-switching mutations caused the diverging paralogs to follow evolutionary paths that yielded similar transcription factors that control distinct transcriptional programs and effect specific responses to signaling input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results illuminate the mechanism by which closely related transcription factors with similar function and high sequence identity can evolve distinct specificity to alternate response elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, a moonlighting ancestor, the AncSR2 DBD, developed a weak affinity for and repressive ability at nGREs, likely as it evolved toward a (+)GRE-binding phenotype (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This nGRE-binding ability was subsequently lost at two independent time points during 3-keto SR evolution but maintained and enhanced in the lineage leading to modern-day hGR (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings strongly support the hypothesis that subdivision of ancestral promiscuous functions is an important mechanism of divergent function among paralogs (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The detailed biochemical, structural, and MD studies described here present a unified view of the molecular basis for alternate response-element specificity among paralogous transcription factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, enhancement of nGRE-binding ability in the GR lineage and the loss of nGRE-binding ability in the MR and AncSR3 lineages were critical for development of divergent DNA specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both computational and directed evolution studies have implicated epistasis as a primary factor in molecular evolution (34, 35), and studies of historical protein divergence have established a major role for epistasis in specific cases (28, 3641).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the two loss-of-function events described here, three amino acid substitutions combine to accomplish a loss of nGRE binding with no effects on (+)GRE binding (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal order in which these substitutions occurred in the GR/MR lineage can be partially resolved on the phylogeny: the two earliest-occurring changes did not change binding to either element, but once the changes were in place, addition of the third and last substitution abolished nGRE binding and regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate that initially neutral amino acid substitutions lay the necessary groundwork for later function-changing mutations with which the initial substitutions interact epistatically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutations that drove functional divergence among the 3-keto SRs were far from the DNA-reading -helix, presumably because binding to both nGREs and (+)GREs requires the same DNA-binding interface of the SR proteins, likely imposing strong selective constraint on this region of the protein in all DBDs in the family (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Functional promiscuity and conformational dynamism have been hypothesized to contribute to protein evolvability (33, 42), but there have been very few direct studies of the historical evolution of a proteins occupancy of the ensemble of potential conformers (43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reinforce the importance of these factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the ancestral 3-keto SR, AncSR2, was capable of binding both nGREs and (+)GREs (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our NMR experiments show that, to bind both response elements, the hGR DBD accesses two conformational states (Fig 1 A and B), and it is likely that other members of the family that exhibit nGRE binding, including AncSR2, use a similar mechanism for their promiscuous functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations suggest that the ancestral promiscuity and conformational dynamism was retained and refined in hGR and is likely a feature of the many DNA/RNA binding proteins encoded within the human genome (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are consistent with previous hypotheses that evolvable proteins may exist in closely related but functionally distinct conformers whose distribution may be easily perturbed by mutation (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the SRs, the Gly425Ser substitution at the AncGR to AncGR2 transition led to a discrete partitioning of Ramachandran space between the GR and MR lineage (Fig 4 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the significant distance of residue 425 from the DBDs DNA-binding interface (Fig 4 A and B), the residues alteration was sufficient to change the evolving proteins occupancy of conformational space and confer alternate DNA-binding specificity on MR and GR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, two paralogous DBDs evolved specific control over distinct transcriptional programs, despite their high primary sequence identity and structural similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
