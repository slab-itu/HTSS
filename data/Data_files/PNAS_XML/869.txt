Leaderless secreted peptide signaling molecule alters global gene expression and increases virulence of a human bacterial pathogen  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regulation of virulence factor production is critical for bacterial pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) produces a potent secreted protease, streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB), that is crucial for pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is known that GAS produces SpeB at high population density, the molecular mechanism whereby GAS coordinates temporal SpeB production is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify a GAS-encoded short leaderless intercellular peptide signal [SpeB-inducing peptide (SIP)], and define the mechanism by which SIP induces population-wide SpeB production and contributes to GAS virulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, discovery of SIP provides a framework for the identification of SIP-like leaderless peptide signals in other microorganisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data reveal a paradigm of bacterial signaling and identify previously unknown molecules that may serve as therapeutic targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Successful pathogens use complex signaling mechanisms to monitor their environment and reprogram global gene expression during specific stages of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a major human pathogen that causes significant disease burden worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A secreted cysteine protease known as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB) is a key virulence factor that is produced abundantly during infection and is critical for GAS pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although identified nearly a century ago, the molecular basis for growth phase control of speB gene expression remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have discovered that GAS uses a previously unknown peptide-mediated intercellular signaling system to control SpeB production, alter global gene expression, and enhance virulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GAS produces an eight-amino acid leaderless peptide [SpeB-inducing peptide (SIP)] during high cell density and uses the secreted peptide for cell-to-cell signaling to induce population-wide speB expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SIP signaling pathway includes peptide secretion, reimportation into the cytosol, and interaction with the intracellular global gene regulator Regulator of Protease B (RopB), resulting in SIP-dependent modulation of DNA binding and regulatory activity of RopB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, SIP signaling causes differential expression of 14% of GAS core genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several genes that encode toxins and other virulence genes that enhance pathogen dissemination and infection are significantly up-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using three mouse infection models, we show that the SIP signaling pathway is active during infection and contributes significantly to GAS pathogenesis at multiple host anatomic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our results delineate the molecular mechanisms involved in a previously undescribed virulence regulatory pathway of an important human pathogen and suggest new therapeutic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_ropB-speB_Intergenic_Region_Encodes_a_Factor_That_Up-Regulates_speB_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structural homologs of RopB have their cognate regulatory peptides encoded in their immediate genomic vicinity (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we analyzed the 940-bp ropB-speB intergenic region for ability to alter speB expression (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the region that may encode an activation factor, we constructed three trans-complementation plasmids that contain different fragments of the intergenic region (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, gene expression is higher from a multicopy plasmid than the chromosome (SI Appendix, Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesized that higher expression levels of a gene encoding the putative activation factor will decouple growth phase-dependent speB expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we introduced each of the three plasmids into wild-type (WT) GAS and characterized the resulting strains for early onset of speB expression by qRT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to the WT strain, each of the three intergenic fragments caused an 8- to 14-fold increase in speB transcript level in the late exponential phase of growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the activation factor for speB expression is likely encoded within the shortest of the three fragments, that is, the 257-bp fragment located between 775 and 519 bp upstream of the SpeB translation start site (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of the 940-bp intergenic region identified three hypothetical ORFs (orf), termed orf-1, orf-2, and orf-3 (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the intergenic region contains cis-acting regulatory elements required for speB expression (27), genetic alterations within the promoter in the form of nucleotide deletions or insertions might disrupt the regulatory elements and spacing between the regulatory elements in the promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to preserve the overall architecture of the promoter, we constructed isogenic mutant strains that replace the start codon (ATG) of each orf with a stop codon (TAG) in the chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the resulting three mutant strains grew differently than the WT strain (SI Appendix, Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translational disruption of orf-1 (i.e., orf-1* mutant) abolished speB expression, SpeB protein levels, and SpeB protease activity (Fig 1 DF and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcript level of speB made by the orf-1* mutant strain was comparable to that of the ropB mutant, suggesting that orf-1 is a crucial factor in speB transcriptional regulation (Fig 1 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the orf-2* and orf-3* mutant strains had WT-like speB transcript levels, suggesting that the putative polypeptides encoded by orf-2 and orf-3 are dispensable for speB expression (Fig 1 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Provision of orf-1 alone in trans (pDCorf-1) was sufficient to rescue the defective phenotype of the orf-1* mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotype restoration in the orf-1* mutant by the trans-complementation plasmid was reversed by translational disruption of orf-1 in trans (pDCorf-1*) (Fig 1 D and F and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude the possibility that defective speB expression in the orf-1* mutant is due to altered ropB expression, we measured the transcript levels of ropB in the WT, orf-1* mutant, and trans-complemented strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcript levels of ropB during different phases of growth in the orf-1* mutant were comparable to those of WT and trans-complemented strains, suggesting that the nonsense substitution in the start codon of orf-1 does not affect the expression of divergently transcribed ropB (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest that the observed phenotype of the orf-1* mutant strain is caused by genetic inactivation of orf-1, not by promoter alterations (Fig 1 DF and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, trans-complementation plasmid pDCorf-1 failed to restore speB expression in the ropB mutant strain (Fig 1D), indicating that the regulatory activity of the orf-1 gene product requires RopB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data indicate that orf-1 encodes the activation factor for RopB-dependent speB expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the purpose of clarity, due to its ability to induce speB expression, we will refer to the putative eight-amino acid polypeptide corresponding to the orf-1 gene product as SpeB-inducing peptide (SIP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_GAS-Encoded_Short_Peptide_Signal_Activates_RopB-Dependent_speB_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if orf-1 is transcribed, we performed Northern blot analysis using a probe complementary to orf-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the polycistronic nature of speB transcripts (34, 40), several bands ranging in size between 300 and 1,500 bases corresponding to the orf-1 transcript were detected (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the orf-1 transcript was detected only in WT GAS grown to the stationary phase, indicating that orf-1 is expressed at high cell density (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate if the predicted short peptide encoded by orf-1 acts as an intercellular signal and activates speB expression, we conducted two synthetic peptide addition experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, synthetic peptides containing different fragments of SIP were tested for their ability to restore speB expression to an orf-1* mutant (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the orf-1* mutant strain was grown to stationary phase and supplemented with synthetic peptides of varying length, only the full-length SIP (SIP-1) caused robust induction of speB expression ( greater than 630 fold) and restored WT-like speB transcript levels, secreted SpeB levels, and SpeB protease activity (Fig 2 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthetic peptide SIP-5 containing the N-terminal seven amino acids had weaker activity ( greater than 30 fold), whereas all other tested synthetic peptides failed to activate speB transcription (Fig 2 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we also tested the ability of SIP to cause early induction of speB expression by WT GAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our observations derived from the orf-1* mutant strain, peptide SIP-1 decoupled growth phase dependency of speB expression and induced early onset of speB expression by the WT strain ( greater than 130 fold) in the late exponential growth phase (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if the observed speB induction is specific for the primary amino acid sequence of SIP, we conducted analogous experiments with a scrambled (SCRA) peptide of identical length and amino acid composition of SIP (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, SCRA peptide did not activate speB expression in either the orf-1* mutant or WT strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the interpretation that induction is specific for SIP (Fig 2 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, addition of SIP-1 to the isogenic ropB mutant strain did not induce speB transcript production (Fig 2B), even when SIP was added at 300-fold excess (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that amino acid sequences corresponding to SIP-1 are the high cell density-specific activation peptide signal for RopB-dependent speB expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_Mechanism_of_GAS_Intercellular_Signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most of the characterized peptide signals in gram-positive bacteria are generated by proteolytic processing of a precursor propeptide form into mature active peptide by membrane-bound enhanced expression of pheromone (Eep) protease (4144).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, SIP is unique in that it is made as a mature leaderless peptide (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracellular mature peptides are subsequently reinternalized into the bacterial cytosol by oligopeptide permeases (Opp) (41, 45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this process, inactivation of opp or dipeptide permease (dpp) in GAS caused down-regulation of speB expression (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the hypothesis that SIP biosynthesis involves similar molecular mechanisms, we constructed isogenic single-mutant strains of eep (eep), opp (oppDF), or dpp (dppA) and the double mutant, oppDF/dppA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When tested for speB expression, all four mutant strains had WT-like speB transcript levels and protease activity (Fig 3 B and C), indicating that the eep, opp, and dpp genes are not involved in SIP signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address the lack of influence of Opp and Dpp permeases on SIP signaling, we considered two possibilities: (i) SIP is not secreted, and thus does not require active import by peptide permeases, or (ii) SIP is secreted and internalized by a yet-to-be-identified mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results from secretome swap assays and synthetic peptide addition experiments suggest that SIP is secreted and internalized into the cytosol (35) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the hypothesis that the regulatory factor in the secretome is encoded by the sip gene, we performed secretome swap assays using conditioned medium obtained from the WT or orf-1* mutant strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our hypothesis, compared with the WT secretome, inactivation of SIP in the orf-1* mutant resulted in the loss of regulatory activity in the secretome derived from this strain, indicating that SIP is the high cell density-specific activation factor in the secretome that induces speB expression (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next investigated if the secreted SIP is reinternalized into the bacterial cytoplasm using synthetic SIP peptide containing fluorescein modification at its amino terminus (FITCSIP-1) (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide addition experiments with FITCSIP-1 demonstrated that the modified FITCSIP-1 is functional and retained the ability to induce speB expression in the orf-1* mutant strain similar to unmodified SIP-1 (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if FITCSIP-1 is reimported into the bacterial cytoplasm, we incubated the orf-1* mutant with FITCSIP-1 and assessed the cytosolic presence of FITCSIP-1 by measuring the relative fluorescence in the clarified cell lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An FITCSIP-1 concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence was observed in the cell lysates from FITCSIP-1treated samples compared with SIP-1treated or untreated GAS (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we investigated the cytosolic presence of FITCSIP-1 in the orf-1* mutant strain by confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence signal was present in the cytoplasm of GAS cells incubated with FITCSIP-1, whereas no fluorescent signal was detected in the unsupplemented or unmodified SIP-1supplemented GAS growth (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the interpretation that exogenously added FITCSIP-1 is transported into the bacterial cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the presence of additional import mechanisms, we constructed a triple-mutant strain (oppDF/dppA/orf-1*) in which the orf-1* mutation was introduced into the isogenic double-mutant strain, oppDF/dppA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of speB in this triple-mutant strain is dependent entirely on exogenously provided synthetic SIP peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we measured speB transcript levels in the triple-mutant strain grown in the presence or absence of exogenously added SIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed in the orf-1* mutant strain, addition of SIP restored WT levels of speB expression and SpeB protease activity in the triple mutant (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that secreted SIP is reimported into the bacterial cytosol, and that GAS uses specialized export and import mechanisms for SIP signaling that are distinct from other characterized bacterial peptide signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain information about the molecular mechanism of gene regulation by SIP, we used a fluorescence polarization (FP) assay to test the hypothesis that SIP directly interacts with RopB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RopB bound directly to SIP with a Kd of 2.6 nM, indicating a very high-affinity interaction between the two partners (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strong interaction was disrupted only by the addition of unlabeled SIP, indicating that the RopBSIP interaction is sequence specific (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the downstream mechanistic consequences of RopBSIP interaction, we first assessed the effect of SIP binding on RopBDNA interactions using an oligoduplex containing the putative RopB-binding site located upstream of the P1 promoter (27) (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although apo-RopB had the ability to mediate sequence-specific DNA interactions (Kd of 352 nM) (Fig 4E), SIP binding caused a ninefold increase in the affinity of the SIP-bound form of RopB for DNA (Kd of 38 nM) (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that SIP binding promotes high-affinity RopBDNA interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further study RopBDNA interactions, we analyzed the DNA-binding properties of RopB by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RopB bound to promoter sequences containing RopB-binding sites that are located upstream of the P1 promoter, whereas it failed to bind sequences upstream of the P2 promoter that lack the RopB-binding site, indicating that these interactions are sequence specific (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no SIP-induced differences in RopBDNA interactions were observed, as both apo- and SIP-bound RopB had similar DNA-binding properties (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that apo-RopB binds DNA with relatively high affinity (Fig 3E), it is likely that the sensitivity of EMSA is not sufficient to distinguish the differences in DNA-binding affinities of apo- and SIP-bound RopB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that RopB at higher concentrations formed multiple supershifted RopBDNA complexes, suggesting that RopB multimerizes on the promoter sequences (SI Appendix, Fig S6 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to rule out the possibility that the defective speB expression in the orf-1* mutant is not due to impaired RopB binding to speB promoter sequences, we carried out EMSA studies using speB promoter sequences from the WT or orf-1* mutant strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed no significant differences in RopB interactions with the WT and orf-1* promoters (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data add further support to our conclusion that translation disruption of orf-1 is the underlying cause for the defective speB expression in the orf-1* mutant strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Purified apo-RopB typically eluted as a homodimer during size exclusion chromatography (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed that the addition of SIP caused a shift from RopB dimer to a higher order oligomer much larger than a dodecamer (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mass spectrometry analysis of the oligomer fractionated by size exclusion chromatography confirmed that the oligomeric RopB contains bound SIP, indicating that SIP binding induces RopB oligomerization (Fig 4 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were further confirmed by Blu-native PAGE analysis of RopB in the presence or absence of SIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although apo-RopB had the tendency to oligomerize, the higher order oligomeric form of RopB was stabilized only by SIP binding (Fig 4I and SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the structural components of RopB involved in SIP-dependent oligomerization, we conducted similar experiments using the C-terminal domain (residues 56280) of RopB (RopB-CTD) (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, SIP failed to induce RopB-CTD oligomerization (SI Appendix, Fig S9), suggesting that an intact DNA-binding domain (residues 155) is required for SIP-dependent RopB oligomerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate if RopB binds DNA in both dimeric and oligomeric forms, we conducted EMSA with purified RopB dimer coincubated with SIP and DNA, or preformed RopB-SIP oligomer fractionated by size exclusion chromatography (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous results, RopB dimer formed higher order RopB-SIPDNA complex, whereas preformed RopB-SIP oligomer failed to bind DNA (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the preformed RopB-SIP oligomer is not compatible for DNA binding and that SIP-induced high-affinity RopBDNA interactions precede RopB multimerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the data suggest that SIP directly interacts with RopB and modulates gene regulation by inducing a two-pronged allostery in RopB, namely, high-affinity RopBDNA interactions and RopB polymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Global_Gene_Regulatory_Influence_of_SIP_Signaling_Pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the hypothesis that SIP controls a global quorum-sensing regulon, we constructed an isogenic orf-1 mutant strain with an in-frame deletion of the entire SIP coding region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of orf-1 abolished speB expression, and addition of synthetic SIP peptide restored WT-like speB transcription and SpeB protease activity in the orf-1 mutant, indicating the nonpolar nature of the orf-1 mutant (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis to compare the global transcript profiles of the WT and orf-1 mutant strains grown to stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the WT strain, 271 genes (14% of the GAS core chromosome, P less_than 0.05, and twofold differences) were differentially regulated in the orf-1 mutant strain, of which 228 genes were up-regulated and 43 genes were down-regulated (SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the level of speB transcript was drastically down-regulated in the orf-1 mutant strain ( greater than 2,000-fold reduction) relative to the WT strain (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional genes that were significantly down-regulated in the orf-1 mutant include genes that encode known virulence factors, such as SagP, NdoS, Sdn, and HlyIII (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the up-regulated genes in the orf-1 mutant strain belong to the following categories: (i) de novo protein synthesis (rps, rpl, and rpm operons that encode ribosomal subunits), (ii) DNA synthesis (pyr, pur, guaAB, nrd, carAB, and rexAB operons), (iii) cell wall synthesis and cell division (murB, murN, pgdA, smc, and divIVA), (iv) group A carbohydrate antigen synthesis (rgpBCDEFG operon), (v) transporters involved in nutrient acquisition (dpp, opp, and pot operons), (vi) proteases (pcp, pepB, pepN, pepO, pepXP, cppA, and clpX), and (vii) cell surface protein (grab) (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further understand the effect of SIP on global gene regulation, we also performed RNA-seq analysis of WT and orf-1* mutant strains grown to stationary phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the WT strain, 72 genes (4% of the GAS core chromosome, P less_than 0.05, and twofold differences) were differentially expressed in the orf-1* mutant strain, of which 31 genes were up-regulated and 41 genes were down-regulated (SI Appendix, Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed in the orf-1 mutant strain, the level of speB, spi, and orf-3 (SpyM3_1743) transcripts was drastically down-regulated in the orf-1* mutant strain ( greater than 1,300-fold reduction) relative to the WT strain (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the SIP regulon identified in the orf-1* mutant strain is relatively smaller compared with that of the orf-1 mutant strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the differences in the global gene regulatory influence of SIP between orf-1* and orf-1 mutant strains, we compared the RNA-seq reads from the orf-1* and orf-1 mutant strains within the ropB-speB gene loci (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the level of ropB transcript was significantly up-regulated in the orf-1 mutant strain relative to the WT strain (greater than threefold increase) (SI Appendix, Fig S12 and Table S2), whereas no significant difference in the ropB transcript level was observed in the orf-1* mutant strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that transcription activation of speB, spi, and orf-3 (SpyM3_1743) by RopB is SIP-dependent; however, RopB has additional SIP-independent regulatory roles that may contribute to the larger regulon observed in the orf-1 mutant strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the global transcriptome data demonstrate that the SIP signaling pathway directly or indirectly up-regulates the expression of several secreted virulence factors, including SpeB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RopB-SIP_Signaling_Pathway_Is_Required_for_WT_GAS_Virulence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the hypothesis that the RopB-SIP signaling pathway participates in GAS pathogenesis, we compared the virulence of the WT and orf-1* mutant strains in a mouse model of bacteremia (17, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with its key role in SpeB production, the virulence of the orf-1* mutant strain was significantly attenuated relative to the WT strain and comparable to that of the ropB and speB mutant strains that lack SpeB production (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested if SIP signaling is also critical for GAS virulence in invasive disease using a mouse model of necrotizing myositis (17, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orf-1* mutant strain was significantly less virulent than the WT and trans-complemented strains (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inasmuch as SpeB contributes to host tissue damage and disease dissemination (1418, 22, 51), we also investigated lesion character by visual and microscopic examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the virulence phenotype, the orf-1*, ropB, and speB mutant strains caused smaller muscle lesions with less severe tissue destruction relative to WT and trans-complemented strains (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we tested if the RopB-SIP signaling pathway contributes to GAS virulence in a mouse model of skin and soft tissue infection (17, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with WT and trans-complemented strains, the orf-1*, ropB, and speB mutant strains caused significantly smaller and more confined lesions (Fig 5D) with less tissue damage and ulceration (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these virulence data demonstrate that the RopB-SIP signaling pathway significantly contributes to GAS pathogenesis at multiple anatomic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RopB-SIP_Signaling_Pathway_Is_Active_During_Mouse_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated if the RopB-SIPmediated quorum-sensing pathway controls speB expression in vivo during the course of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were inoculated s.c. with each of the indicated strains, and speB transcript levels in the infected lesions were measured by qRT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the WT strain grown to the late exponential phase in laboratory medium, the WT strain isolated from infected lesions had a 3,000-fold higher level of speB transcript (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the in vitro observations, lesions from mice infected with ropB and orf-1* mutants had drastically decreased speB expression in vivo and speB transcript levels were comparable to those of the WT strain in the late exponential growth phase (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, trans-complementation of the orf-1* mutant strain with pDCorf-1 fully restored WT-like speB transcript levels, indicating that SIP-mediated speB regulation occurs in vivo (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we assessed the ability of synthetic peptide SIP to activate speB expression in vivo and promote bacterial virulence using the s.c. mouse model of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coinjection with SIP restored a WT-like virulence phenotype to the orf-1* mutant strain, resulting in larger ulcerated lesions relative to orf-1* mutant coinjected with the SCRA peptide (Fig 6 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that synthetic peptides containing the SIP amino acid sequences have biological activity in vivo, and are sufficient to restore GAS pathogenesis in the orf-1* mutant strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our data demonstrate that SIP signaling is active during host infection and, moreover, show that SIP-mediated up-regulation of virulence gene expression contributes significantly to GAS virulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the aggregate, we here show that GAS uses complex intercellular communication machinery to monitor its population density and determine whether to initiate a virulent lifestyle that involves host tissue damage and disease dissemination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented herein show that an intercellular peptide signal, SIP, and the intracellular global gene regulator RopB form a signal/receptor pair that contributes significantly to GAS pathogenesis by modulating virulence gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the nucleotide sequence encoding the inferred eight amino acids of SIP is absolutely conserved, and the promoter sequences upstream of the SIP-coding region are highly conserved among 11 different GAS serotypes (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the SIP signaling pathway likely represents a virulence regulatory mechanism conserved among many GAS M-protein serotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All previously characterized bacterial peptide signals are produced as propeptides that have a cleavable amino-terminal secretion signal sequence and protease cleavage sites, resulting in a mature peptide (8) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secretion signal sequence targets the propeptide to the secretion machinery at the cell membrane, where the propeptide undergoes proteolytic cleavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The released mature peptide is exported, and subsequently reimported into the cytosol by Opp permeases (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, SIP lacks the distinctive sequence motifs of bacterial peptide signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GAS produces SIP in a mature form that is devoid of a secretion signal sequence and protease cleavage site (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, SIP is secreted and reimported by an Opp permease-independent import mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences indicate that SIP biosynthesis is an important exception to the established paradigm of bacterial peptide signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, SIP belongs to a previously undescribed new class of leaderless bacterial peptide signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such lack of conformity likely hobbled previous extensive efforts to identify SIP (18, 21, 22, 27, 3033, 35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that RRNPP family proteins are widespread among low guanine + cytosine gram-positive bacteria and bacteriophages (42, 52), and the cognate peptide signals for the vast majority of these regulators have not yet been identified, we speculate that leaderless peptides analogous to SIP will participate in other microbial signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our delineation of SIP signaling may accelerate discovery of similar peptide signals in other microorganisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Typically, the internalized cognate peptides bind to the respective regulators and trigger regulator-specific conformational changes that modulate gene regulation (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characterized activation peptide-induced allostery among RRNPP family regulators includes disruption of tetramerization in PrgX from Enterococcus faecalis, induction of tetramerization in NprR from Bacillus cereus, and unmasking of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain that aids promoter binding by PlcR from B. cereus (39, 5355).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that SIP controls RopB regulatory activity by facilitating high-affinity RopBDNA interactions and RopB polymerization (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences upstream of the P1 promoter have two putative RopB-binding sites, site 1 and site 2, and these two sites are separated by a 121-bp-long spacer region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two sites are highly similar (Fig 4C), and RopB binds to each site with comparable affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is plausible that SIP promotes RopB interactions with the two high-affinity operator sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these interactions as nucleation events, RopB polymerizes on the spacer between the two sites, resulting in RopB-dependent transcription activation from the P1 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, additional investigations will be required to test the proposed model and elucidate the mechanism by which RopB polymerization contributes to its regulatory activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on earlier work (18) and results presented here, we propose the following model (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During low cell density, the inhibition peptide signal derived from the secretion signal sequence of Vfr interacts with RopB and negatively influences speB expression, possibly by inhibiting RopBDNA interactions (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, during high cell density, expression of vfr is down-regulated, which results in low-level SIP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial SIP production acts as a positive feedback loop, resulting in robust induction of SIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SIP-bound RopB binds to operator sequences, polymerizes on the promoter, and mediates transcription activation of target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To summarize, the data we present here provide detailed molecular and mechanistic understanding of a key virulence regulatory pathway of an abundant human pathogen responsible for greater than 700 million human infections annually worldwide (56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the work identified previously unknown molecular targets that may be exploited to develop new therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
