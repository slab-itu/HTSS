title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Behavioral responses to annual temperature variation alter the dominant energy pathway, growth, and condition of a cold-water predator  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Climate warming is having wide-ranging effects on aquatic ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fish are believed to adapt their feeding behavior as temperatures change, but empirical evidence of this behavior in nature and its impacts on individual fitness are lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We monitored the feeding behavior and growth of a temperature-sensitive fish population in a pristine lake for 11 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fish adjusted their feeding behavior annually in response to differences in temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cooler years, fish ate more large prey from shallow nearshore regions, resulting in higher growth and condition than in warmer years, when fish ate more small prey from deep offshore regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the impacts of warming on aquatic ecosystems can scale from the individual to the food web level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is a pressing need to understand how ecosystems will respond to climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, no long-term empirical studies have confirmed that fish populations exhibit adaptive foraging behavior in response to temperature variation and the potential implications this has on fitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use an unparalleled 11-y acoustic telemetry, stable isotope, and markrecapture dataset to test if a population of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), a cold-water stenotherm, adjusted its use of habitat and energy sources in response to annual variations in lake temperatures during the open-water season and how these changes translated to the growth and condition of individual fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that climate influenced access to littoral regions in spring (data from telemetry), which in turn influenced energy acquisition (data from isotopes), and growth (markrecapture data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In more stressful years, those with shorter springs and longer summers, lake trout had reduced access to littoral habitat and assimilated less littoral energy, resulting in reduced growth and condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual variation in prey abundance influenced lake trout foraging tactics (i.e., the balance of the number and duration of forays) but not the overall time spent in littoral regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lake trout greatly reduced their use of littoral habitat and occupied deep pelagic waters during the summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our results provide clear evidence that climate-mediated behavior can influence the dominant energy pathways of top predators, with implications ranging from individual fitness to food web stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Theoretical illustration of how seasonality in water temperatures during the open-water season impacts foraging behavior of lake trout in small Boreal Shield lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A and B) Cold water temperatures immediately after ice-out in the spring and before ice-on in the fall allow lake trout to access the littoral zone (less_than6 m depth) without thermal consequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, during summer warm littoral temperatures impose an energetic cost to lake trout accessing the littoral zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, (B) lake trout should exhibit greater use of littoral habitat and prey (prey fish and benthic invertebrates/aquatic insects) when springs and falls are longer, and conversely, should use more pelagic habitat and prey (Mysis and zooplankton) when summers are longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In B, increasing arrow thickness denotes expected increased use of energy pathways based on littoral water temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lake_Temperatures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The length of spring, when lake trout can access the littoral zone without thermal consequence (15 °C), averaged 43 d and varied in duration by nearly a month (3159 d) over the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The summer period, when lake trout are putatively thermally restricted from accessing the littoral zone (15 °C), was on average 2.7 times longer than the spring and averaged 109 d with a difference of 1 mo (36 d) between the shortest (85 d) and longest (121 d) summers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer summers typically had warmer littoral zone temperatures (Pearson correlation: n = 11, r = 0.79, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of the fall season, when lake trout spawn but can also use the littoral zone for feeding without thermal consequence, averaged 61 d (range: 5172 d) and was on average 1.5 times longer than the spring and 1.8 times shorter than the summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a given year, the length of the spring and summer seasons showed a negative correlation (n = 11, r = 0.59, P = 0.06), spring and fall lengths were not significantly correlated (n = 11, r = 0.42, P = 0.20), and neither were fall and summer lengths (n = 11, r = 0.32, P = 0.34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Habitat_Use  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lake trout displayed clear seasonal shifts in habitat use and behavior that followed changes in mean littoral zone temperatures (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately following ice-out, lake trout often spent several hours or entire days within the littoral zone (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mean littoral zone water temperatures exceeded 15 °C (summer), lake trout greatly reduced their forays into the littoral zone until water temperatures cooled to 15 °C in the fall, when lake trout quickly reoccupied the littoral zone (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total time spent by lake trout in the littoral zone during the spring of each year averaged 550 h and increased with spring length (log10; F1,8 = 6.75, P = 0.03, r2 = 0.46) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the number (F1,8 = 0.28, P = 0.61) or average duration (F1,8 = 1.13, P = 0.32) of littoral forays made in the spring was not predicted by spring length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, lake trout made a greater number (F1,8 = 12.22, P less_than 0.01, r2 = 0.60) of shorter (F1,8 = 5.24, P = 0.05, r2 = 0.40) forays in springs with higher prey fish densities (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrasting effect of number and duration of forays meant that prey fish abundance (measured as catch per unit effort, CPUE) did not alter the total time lake trout spent in the littoral zone during the spring but only how they used that time (F1,8 = 0.00, P = 0.98) (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The amount of time that lake trout spent in the littoral zone each summer averaged 43 h and was not predicted by summer length (F1,8 = 0.09, P = 0.77) (Fig 3B) or prey fish CPUE (F1,8 = 0.01, P = 0.93).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number or average duration of littoral forays made by lake trout in the summer also was not predicted by summer length (log10; number of forays: F1,8 = 0.55, P = 0.48; average foray duration: F1,8 = 2.31, P = 0.17) or prey fish CPUE (log10; number of forays: F1,8 = 0.69, P = 0.43; average foray duration: F1,8 = 0.09, P = 0.78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean summer water temperature in the littoral zone also did not predict the time spent by lake trout within the littoral zone during the summer (F1,8 = 0.01, P = 0.92) Fig S1D or the number of littoral forays (log10; F1,8 = 1.76, P = 0.22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, lake trout made shorter forays as mean summer littoral zone water temperatures increased (F1,8 = 3.79, P = 0.08, r2 = 0.32) (Fig S1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time spent within the littoral zone the during summer was not related to the length of the preceding spring (F1,8 = 0.01, P = 0.92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The amount of time that lake trout spent in the littoral zone each fall averaged 301 h but, unlike spring, was not predicted by fall length (square-root; F1,8 = 1.13, P = 0.32) (Fig 3C) or prey fish CPUE (square-root; F1,8 = 0.04, P = 0.85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number or average duration of littoral forays made by lake trout in fall also was not predicted by fall length (number of forays: F1,8 = 3.14, P = 0.12; average foray duration: F1,8 = 0.02, P = 0.90) or prey fish CPUE (number of forays: F1,8 = 0.58, P = 0.47; average foray duration: F1,8 = 0.24, P = 0.64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time spent within the littoral zone during the fall also was not related to the length of the preceding spring (square-root; F1,8 = 0.20, P = 0.67) or summer (square-root; F1,8 = 0.14, P = 0.72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Energy_Sources  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The proportion of littoral energy assimilated by lake trout, estimated using 13C values (logit-transformed for analyses), averaged 0.66 (range 0.400.95) over the study and was positively related to spring length (F1,9 = 12.66, P less_than 0.01, r2 = 0.59) (Fig 4A) and negatively related to summer length (F1,9 = 12.58, P less_than 0.01, r2 = 0.58) (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of littoral energy assimilated by lake trout was not predicted by prey fish CPUE (F1,9 = 1.53, P = 0.25) but was negatively related to mean summer littoral zone temperature (F1,9 = 7.49, P = 0.02, r2 = 0.45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lake trout stomachs contained more prey in spring (6.33 ± 6.15 g, mean ± SD) than in summer (1.73 ± 1.45 g) and fall (3.45 ± 2.75 g), and the composition of these prey items varied seasonally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stomach contents collected in spring contained 60% benthic invertebrates and insects, 37% littoral prey fish, 3% Mysis, and no zooplankton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stomachs collected in summer contained 45% littoral prey fish, 2% benthic invertebrates and insects, 27% Mysis, and 26% zooplankton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fall stomach contents contained 22% littoral prey fish, no benthic invertebrates or insects, 72% Mysis, and 6% zooplankton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Growth_and_Condition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The growth (i.e., change in weight) and condition of individual lake trout were positively related to the time spent within the littoral zone during the spring (weight: F[1,127] = 8.69, P less_than 0.01, r2 = 0.07; condition: F[1,127] = 5.82, P = 0.02, r2 = 0.04) (Fig 5 A and B) and summer (weight: F[1,126] = 30.39, P less_than 0.01, r2 = 0.19; condition: F[1,126] = 11.95, P less_than 0.01, r2 = 0.09) (Fig 5 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth and condition were also positively related to the proportion of littoral energy assimilated (weight: F[1,139] = 13.96, P less_than 0.01, r2 = 0.09; condition: F[1,138] = 5.44, P less_than 0.01, r2 = 0.04) (Fig 5 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with behavioral data, growth and condition of individual lake trout were also positively correlated to spring length (weight: F[1,139] = 8.56, P less_than 0.01, r2 = 0.06; condition: F[1,138] = 6.74, P = 0.01, r2 = 0.05); however, neither was related to summer length (weight: F[1,139] = 0.17, P = 0.68; condition: F[1,138] = 0.56, P = 0.46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found that lake trout, a mobile cold-water predator, made consistent and predictable seasonal shifts in habitat use that were triggered by changes in lake-water temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the phenology of littoral zone temperatures shifted from year to year, so did lake trout use of nearshore habitat and acquisition of energy from this prey-rich habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In warmer years, when littoral energy acquisition was lower, individual lake trout had reduced growth and condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ability of a single population of aquatic top predators to adjust its foraging behavior rapidly to interannual changes in climatic conditions and the corresponding impacts on measures of fitness highlight the adaptability of this glacial relict species to persist under adverse conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, recent evidence that many fish species from various thermal guilds and trophic levels may be capable of flexible foraging behavior (20) suggest that our results may be broadly applicable for understanding the impact of climate change on aquatic ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results suggest that water temperature phenology (i.e., seasonality) supersedes prey density as the main controller of littoralpelagic coupling by lake trout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although prey fish abundance and summer littoral zone temperature influenced foraging strategy (i.e., the balance of the number and duration of littoral forays), these factors did not affect the overall time spent within the littoral zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, longer springs resulted in greater occupation of littoral habitat and acquisition of littoral energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, littoral energy use declined with increasing summer length, which was negatively correlated to spring length in a given year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that changes in temperature can fundamentally rewire energy pathways, a result that has the potential to impact food web stability (79, 21), but of course the direction and magnitude of these impacts would vary depending on the how future warming alters the phenology of water temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reductions in the growth and condition of individual lake trout observed in years with reduced littoral habitat use and littoral energy use could result from a combination of factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, increased reliance on Mysis and zooplankton would be less energetically efficient than foraging on larger prey fish or benthic invertebrates because predatory fish are more active when forced to feed on numerous, smaller prey (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased energetic cost of feeding on small prey has been illustrated by studies that found predatory fish in lakes without pelagic prey fish had increased muscle activity and greater activity rates than those same species in lakes containing pelagic prey fish (2325) and by studies showing that more active fish generally grow more slowly (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, in oligotrophic lakes, the littoral zone is often more productive and smaller in volume than the pelagic zone (6, 17), and therefore the probability of a lake trouts encountering prey would be higher in the littoral zone than in the pelagic zone, increasing foraging success but also reducing the time required to find prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite thermally suboptimal temperatures in littoral regions during summer, lake trout used this habitat to access preferred prey in all years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regular, although limited, foraging into waters with temperatures above their thermal preference indicates the energetic importance of acquiring large, energy-dense prey (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that capturing prey fish in warm water could be a more efficient strategy than foraging on small prey within the pelagic zoneat least for some parts of summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rapid forays into warm, shallow water have been documented previously for lake trout (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, during the peak of summer, when littoral temperatures were highest, lake trout seemed to reduce greatly and even stop use of the littoral zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior also has been exhibited by other temperature-sensitive fish, including brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), which have been documented to stop foraging and seek cool-water refuge when temperatures exceed their thermal preferences (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, continued warming of surface-water temperatures during the summer (15, 16) could extend periods of limited littoral access in salmonids, increasing their reliance on pelagic-derived energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fall period also provides thermal conditions in which lake trout could exploit littoral prey without consequence and presumably could offset the constraints imposed by the stressful conditions during the preceding seasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the fall periods generally were longer than the spring periods, lake trout on average spent less time in the littoral zone during the fall than in the spring, even though the littoral zone is also the region where spawning occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, lake trout did not increase their use of this habitat in fall periods that were preceded by stressful conditions (i.e., shorter spring and/or longer summers), and their fall diet reflected a reliance on pelagic prey, mainly Mysis, as earlier studies have noted (13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least in our study system, the fall does not seem to be a period when lake trout make extensive use of littoral resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the apparent limited acquisition of littoral energy in summer and fall periods, it appears that the spring period, which is strongly influenced by climate (16), is critical for the annual growth and condition of lake trout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Observed reductions in individual growth and condition associated with reduced access to littoral energy also have important implications for population persistence through impacts on reproduction and recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further reductions in access to littoral regions with future warming could prevent lake trout from accumulating sufficient energy to spawn in the fall (27), potentially increasing the frequency of skip-spawning (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prospective smaller postadult body size with warming could also lead to reductions in fecundity, which is positively correlated with body size (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, increased reliance on pelagic energy by adult lake trout during longer and/or warmer summers would increase competition with juvenile lake trout that rely almost exclusively on Mysis and zooplankton (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the potential for less frequent spawning, production of fewer eggs, and lower recruitment to adulthood posed by warming could have severe implications for the ability of lake trout populations within small lakes to persist through future climate change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is worth noting that our study lake did not contain pelagic prey fish (e.g., cisco, Coregonus artedi), and this type of food web represents only a subset of lake trout lakes (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In lakes with cisco, lake trout would be able to access prey fish throughout periods of thermal limitation (13), and so the impacts of seasonal phenology on foraging behavior and fitness in cisco-containing lakes may differ from our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a study by King, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (37) found that lake trout inhabiting a cisco-containing lake had reduced growth in years with earlier onset of thermal stratification, likely because of reduced access to littoral prey in the spring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the impacts of seasonal phenology on the foraging behavior and fitness of lake trout may be similar across lake types; however, the magnitude of these changes may vary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the adaptive behavior of lake trout illustrated here also has implications for predicting how future warming may alter the geographic distribution of cold-water fish species, particularly around southern range borders, where surface temperatures may exceed thermal limits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At these southern edges, adaptive foraging behavior and use of refuge may allow cold-water populations to persist for extended periods when simple surface models would predict range contractions (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study occurred over 11 y (20032013) within the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD)-Experimental Lakes Area, Canada (49°40N, 93°44W) (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lake 373 (L373) is an unmanipulated long-term reference lake used to monitor natural variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a small (surface area 27.3 ha, maximum depth 20.5 m), single-basin lake that thermally stratifies during summer, when mean littoral zone temperatures typically range from 1721 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lake supports a native, naturally reproducing lake trout population that consisted of 285 adults during our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lake does not contain pelagic prey fish, and the main prey items for adult lake trout are littoral prey fish (Phoxinus eos, Phoxinus neogaeus, Margariscus margarita, and Cottus cognatus), benthic invertebrates, insects, Mysis, and zooplankton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lake also contains white sucker (Catostomus commersonii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We considered the littoral zone to be water depths less_than6 m (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because L373 is bowl-shaped, with no islands or shoals, littoral regions were located only along the perimeter of the lake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lake_Temperatures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Annual ice-on and ice-off dates were monitored at nearby (12 km) Rawson Lake (54.3 ha) and were assumed to be the same for L373 because the lakes are similar in size and depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water temperatures in L373 were measured every 30 min using a string of data loggers (HOBO Temp Pro H20-001; Onset) deployed over the deepest point of the lake (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Logger data from 29 April to 20 June 2003 were not available, and biweekly temperature profile data were supplemented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated the mean daily temperature of the littoral zone during each open-water season using data from temperature loggers at 16 m. The period between ice-off and the date that the mean littoral zone temperature exceeded 15 °C was denoted spring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The period when the mean littoral zone temperature exceeded 15 °C was denoted summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fall was the period between the date that the lake cooled to 15 °C and ice-on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Winter was considered the ice-covered period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because lake trout spawn inshore in the fall (40), we were unable to distinguish between foraging and spawning behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using the date when littoral water temperatures exceeded 15 °C, we provide a measure of how access to littoral energy is controlled by temperature (19, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not use the existence of a planar thermocline to define summer, because this can occur when littoral temperatures are 15 °C and would not represent a physiological barrier for lake trout (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Habitat_Use  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We monitored the depths of lake trout using acoustic telemetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Telemetry data were collected from 41 individual fish (fork length 380501 mm) implanted with depth-sensing transmitters (V16P-4L or V13P-1L; VEMCO Ltd.) that randomly transmitted a coded signal every 1664 s (V16) or every 120300 s (V13) (Tables S1 and S2 for transmitter and biological details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depths of transmitter-implanted fish were monitored year-round using four or five omnidirectional hydrophone receivers (VR2; VEMCO Ltd.) with overlapping detection ranges distributed throughout the lake (19, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Raw telemetry data were filtered before analyses (details are given in Supporting Information and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final telemetry dataset for estimation of spring, summer, and fall habitat use consisted of 1,979,775 detections (range 63,016368,755 per year) from 29 individual fish (range two to nine fish per year).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No telemetry data from 2005 were available, because all new transmitters were implanted that spring, and we did not use data from the year in which transmitters were implanted to avoid potential effects of tagging on behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using data for each fish, we calculated daily estimates of (i) the number of forays into the littoral zone; (ii) the average duration of each littoral foray; and (iii) the total time spent in the littoral zone during the spring, summer, and fall of each open-water season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A littoral foray was denoted by a fishs depth changing from 6 m to less_than6 m between consecutive detections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of forays performed by an individual fish on a given day was then summed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daily estimates of the total time spent in the littoral zone by each fish were calculated as the ratio of littoral zone detections to total detections scaled to a 24-h period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daily estimates of average foray duration for each fish were then calculated as the total time spent in the littoral zone divided by the number of littoral forays on that day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that our method would categorize a lake trout moving into depths less_than6 m in offshore regions as a littoral foray, but we assumed all forays occurred in the nearshore region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Energy_Sources  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used stable carbon (13C) isotopes to estimate use of littoral- vs. pelagic-derived energy by lake trout (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pectoral fin-ray tips (lake trout) and dorsal muscle (littoral prey fish) were collected each fall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mysis and bulk zooplankton were collected monthly during each open-water season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were dried, ground, loaded into tin capsules, and analyzed using standard methods at the University New Brunswick or the University of Waterloo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable isotope values were conveyed in  notation (): 13C = [(13C/12C sample/13C/12C standard)  1] × 1,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 13C values of lake trout fins were first corrected to equivalent muscle values using the equation 13Cmuscle = 0.73 × 13CFin  8.11 (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mathematically lipid-corrected the 13C values of prey fish and Mysis using 13Cmuscle (normalized) = 13Cmuscle + [3.32 + (0.99 × C:N)] (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correction was not applied to lake trout because lipids should not be an issue for fin tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 20032005, stable isotope data for prey fish were not available; in these years we estimated the 13C values of prey fish by adding the mean difference in 13C values of prey fish and littoral mayflies during years when both these items were analyzed to the mean values of littoral mayflies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that lake trout fin-ray tips have been found to turn over at similar rates to white muscle (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the proportion of littoral energy assimilated by each lake trout using a two-source mixing model that treated Mysis and littoral prey fish as the pelagic and littoral end members, respectively (45): proportion littoral energy = (13Clake trout  13CMysis)/(13Cprey fish  13CMysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lake trout 13C dataset contained 194 samples (n = 1520 per year) with fork lengths ranging from 199502 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A small number of lake trout stomach contents obtained from nonlethal gastric lavages were collected in the spring (23 and 28 May, n = 14) and summer (12 August, n = 4) of 2014 and from fall markrecapture sampling mortalities (various dates between 121 October 19862012, n = 24) to support stable isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prey items from each stomach were identified and grouped into the following groups: benthic invertebrates and insects, prey fish, Mysis, and zooplankton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then calculated the proportion of the total stomach content weight for each diet item.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Growth_and_Condition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lake trout growth was examined using data from annual markrecapture sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fish were captured each fall using trap nets and short (less_than30 min) evening gill net sets on spawning shoals (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following capture, the weights, fork lengths (in millimeters), and tag numbers from previously captured fish were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Newly captured fish received a tag for future identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Condition was estimated as a percentage of standard weight specific for lake trout (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 141 instances in which an individual fish was captured in consecutive years during the study period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prey_Fish_Abundance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relative abundance of littoral prey fish were calculated as CPUE based on annual collections (46, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each spring, two or three small-diameter mesh trap nets were set for 2739 consecutive days to target the nearshore-littoral zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual CPUE estimates were calculated by dividing the total number of prey fish by the number of net days (i.e., number of trap nets × number of fishing days).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included all cyprinid species and slimy sculpin in putative littoral prey fish CPUE values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analyses were carried out in R, v. 3.3.2 (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assumptions of linear mixed effect models (LMMs) and linear regression were evaluated (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where necessary, data were transformed to meet assumptions as reported in Results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LMMs were fit using the nlme package (53), and fits were evaluated (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated least squares means for each factor level in LMMs using the lsmeans package (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the small sample size (11 y), we considered P less_than 0.1 as statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed habitat use data from spring, summer, and fall seasons separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LMMs were applied to each habitat measure (number of littoral forays, average foray duration, and total time in littoral zone) over all years for each season, for a total of nine LMMs, which treated year as a fixed factor and individual fish as random intercepts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean estimates (±SD) of habitat use for each year/season were obtained using the least squares means from each LMM and were subsequently used as response variables in linear regression to test if each seasonal habitat use measure was predicted by the corresponding season length, prey fish CPUE, length of the preceding season (summer and fall only), and mean summer littoral zone temperatures (summer only).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mean estimates of the proportion of littoral energy assimilated for each study year were obtained by calculating means (±SD) over all individual lake trout analyzed for 13C within each year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear regression procedure described above for habitat use then was used to test if the mean proportion of littoral energy was predicted by season length (spring or summer), prey fish CPUE, and summer littoral zone water temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotope data were not related to fall length, because samples were collected near the start of the fall in each year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We determine how variations in littoral energy and habitat use translated to growth by treating annual changes in individual lake trout weight and condition as response variables in separate linear regressions with springsummer littoral energy use, spring and summer littoral habitat use, and the length of the spring, summer, and winter periods used a predictor variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fall habitat use or fall length was not used as a predictor for annual growth because fish collections occurred throughout this period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Preparation_of_Telemetry_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before analysis we filtered raw telemetry data to remove dead fish, malfunctioning tags, detections outside the depth range of the lake, and multiple/false detections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because transmitters were implanted during the spring, data from the year a fish was tagged were excluded to avoid potential effects of tagging on behavior (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only fish that had data for an entire year from their date of tagging were included in the final analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two types of telemetry transmitters used over the course of this 11-y study differed in how frequently they transmitted coded signals (i.e., pings) (V16: 1564 s, V13: 120300 s) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both transmitter types recorded pressure, which was converted to an instantaneous depth, and emitted this information, along with individual fish identification, at random intervals within a prescribed time period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a transmission was detected by a receiver, it was given a time stamp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The V16 transmitters were implanted in spring 2002 and were active for 14 y (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spring 2005 we began using V13 transmitters and continued to do so for the duration of the study (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because V16 transmitters emitted pings about five times more frequently than V13 transmitters, on average, the probability that a V16 transmitter would ping and be detected during a quick foray by a lake trout into the littoral zone was, by chance, greater than that of the slower-pinging V13 transmitters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A difference in the probability of detecting a fish in the littoral zone because of transmitter type would bias among-year comparisons of telemetry data in this 11-y record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to remove any potential bias, we needed to thin detection data of fish implanted with V16 transmitters so that their detection frequencies were comparable to those of the V13 transmitters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we removed detections from V16 data with intervals (i.e., time difference between subsequent detections of that transmitter) that were less than the minimum ping frequency of V13 transmitters (122.22 s) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To thin V16 data, we used a function written in the R statistical computing package that calculated the transmission intervals for all detections for each fish in a given year and then removed the first (chronologically) detection that had a transmission interval less than a set time of 122.22 s. This process was repeated until the new dataset contained only detections with intervals less than 122.22 s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test if increasing minimum ping frequencies resulted in underestimates of littoral habitat use, we used data collected from lake trout implanted with V16 transmitters in 2003 and 2004, previously reported as a warm and cool years, respectively (19), for comparison of a range of littoral use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, all dead fish/transmitters and multiple detections were removed (when the same ping was detected by multiple receivers, only the first detection was kept).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we created four separate V16 detection datasets with varying minimum ping frequencies for each year of data for each fish (i.e., a fish with data for both 2003 and 2004 would have eight separate detection datasets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four datasets for each year for each fish included (i) detection data that were not thinned (minimum ping frequency of the V16 transmitters: 17 s) and detection data that were thinned to minimum ping frequencies of (ii) 52 s, (iii) 87 s, and (iv) 122.22 s, in which 52 s and 87 s represent midpoints of the minimum ping frequencies of raw V16 (17 s) and V13 (122.22 s) transmitters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having multiple detection datasets with differing minimum ping frequencies allowed us to determine if our estimates of the number of forays into and total time spent in the littoral zone by lake trout each year were altered by the minimum ping frequency of the transmitters used and to apply corrections as needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Datasets then were divided into spring and summer, based on the criteria described in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypotheses were tested separately for each season using LMMs with individual fish treated as random intercepts to account for repeated measures and minimum ping frequency treated as a continuous fixed factor (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assumptions of LMM were tested using q-q plots, boxplots, and scatter plots of normalized residuals (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where necessary, data transformations were used to meet assumptions and are provided in Results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Number_of_Littoral_Forays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The numbers of littoral forays in both spring and summer were log10 transformed to meet assumptions of LMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For spring data, we found that the estimated number of littoral forays decreased linearly as minimum ping frequencies increased (minimum ping frequency: F1,54 = 5.34, P = 0.02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slopes (minimum ping frequency × year: F1,52 = 0.28, P = 0.60) and intercepts (year: F1,53 = 0.52, P = 0.47) of the relationship between the number of littoral forays and minimum ping frequency did not differ among years (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, for summer data, we also found that the estimated number of forays decreased linearly as minimum ping frequencies lengthened (minimum ping frequency: F1,46 = 4.48, P = 0.03).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slopes (minimum ping frequency × year: F1,44 = 1.89, P = 0.18) and intercepts (year: F145 = 0.01, P = 0.96) of the relationship between the number of littoral forays and minimum ping frequency did not differ among years (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spring and summer analyses supported our hypothesis that when transmitters pinged more often, they had a higher probability of transmitting while a fish was in the littoral zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for fall, we did not find any effect of minimum ping frequency (minimum ping frequency: F1,26 = 1.53, P = 0.23), year (year: F1,28 = 0.02, P = 0.90), or their interaction (minimum ping frequency × year: F1,28 = 0.01, P = 0.93) on the estimated number of littoral forays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the degree to which the number of forays was underestimated by increasing minimum ping frequencies during the spring and summer, we used the models described in the paragraph above to predict the average number of littoral forays that would be detected at minimum ping frequencies of 17, 52, 87, and 122.22 s. Assuming that a minimum ping frequency of 0 (model intercept) meant that a transmitter was pinging continuously, we calculated the percent difference between the modeled number of littoral forays of minimum ping frequencies of 17 s, 52 s, 87 s, and 122.22 s with that of the intercept (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most important to our study, we found that a minimum ping frequency of 122.22 s (that of V13 transmitters) underestimated the number of forays by 63% in spring and by 86% in summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we adjusted our estimates of the number of spring and summer littoral forays based on tags with minimum ping frequencies of 122.22 s by 63% and 86%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Time_Spent_in_the_Littoral_Zone  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The total time spent within the littoral zone each spring and summer was square root transformed before analysis to meet assumptions of LMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For spring, we found that neither the interaction between minimum ping frequency and year (minimum ping frequency × year: F1,52 = 0.10, P = 0.75) nor minimum ping frequency alone (minimum ping frequency: F1,53 = 0.06, P = 0.80) had an effect on our estimates of time spent in the littoral zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did, however, find that estimates of littoral zone use differed among years (year: F1,54 = 58.84, P less_than 0.001) (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, for summer, we found that neither the interaction between minimum ping frequency and year (minimum ping frequency × year: F1,44 = 2.36, P = 0.13) nor minimum ping frequency alone (minimum ping frequency: F1,45 = 1.02, P = 0.32) had an effect on our estimates of time spent in the littoral zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did, however, find that estimates of littoral zone use differed among years (year: F1,46 = 17.76, P less_than 0.001) (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fall, we found that the interaction between minimum ping frequency and year (minimum ping frequency × year: F1,27 = 1.28, P = 0.27), the year (year: F1,29 = 0.01, P = 0.94), and the minimum ping frequency (minimum ping frequency: F1,29 = 1.37, P = 0.25) all had no effect on our estimates of time spent in the littoral zone (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that estimates of time spent in the littoral zone with a minimum ping frequency of 17 s (which is quite rapid) did not differ from those at 122.22 s provides confidence in our using minimum ping frequencies of 122.22 s in our estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
