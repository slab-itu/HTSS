title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Physical proximity of chromatin to nuclear pores prevents harmful R loop accumulation contributing to maintain genome stability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During transcription, the mRNA may hybridize back with its template DNA, forming a structure called R loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structures have been associated with genome instability and human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using budding yeast as a model organism to screen for new genes preventing R loops, we identified MLP1 and subsequently showed that the nuclear basket protein Mlp1/2 has a role in preventing R loop formation and genome instability in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work indicates that R loops are formed in the nucleoplasm and that proximity of transcribed chromatin to the nuclear pore constrains R loop formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study opens additional perspectives to understand the role of RNA in the control of genome integrity as a function of nuclear location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During transcription, the mRNA may hybridize with DNA, forming an R loop, which can be physiological or pathological, constituting in this case a source of genomic instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the mechanism by which eukaryotic cells prevent harmful R loops, we used human activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to identify genes preventing R loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A screening of 400 Saccharomyces cerevisiae selected strains deleted in nuclear genes revealed that cells lacking the Mlp1/2 nuclear basket proteins show AID-dependent genomic instability and replication defects that were suppressed by RNase H1 overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, DNARNA hybrids accumulated at transcribed genes in mlp1/2 mutants, indicating that Mlp1/2 prevents R loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the Mlp1/2 role in gene gating to nuclear pores, artificial tethering to the nuclear periphery of a transcribed locus suppressed R loops in mlp1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same occurred in THO-deficient hpr1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that proximity of transcribed chromatin to the nuclear pore helps restrain pathological R loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Screening_of_Yeast_Null_Mutants_for_AID-Mediated_Hyperrecombination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously showed that expression of AID, a B-cell enzyme essential for somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, in yeast THO mutants exacerbate their transcription-dependent hyperrecombination phenotype (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used AID overexpression as a tool to uncover mutations that lead to R loop accumulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using gene ontology (GO) term annotations, we selected 400 viable deletion strains lacking genes with nuclear functions from the yeast knockout collection (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 400 strains were transformed with plasmid p313LZGAID, carrying a direct-repeat recombination construct with the lacZ gene between two leu2 repeats and expressing the human AID gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transformed cells, including wild-type, hpr1 and mft1, were grown in galactose to induce AID expression and plated on appropriate media to assess the amount of recombinants (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 123 candidates with high levels of recombination in AID-expression conditions in at least two of three independent experiments were selected for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, four fresh transformants were grown either in glucose (AID) or galactose (+AID), and serial dilutions were plated on selective media for each candidate (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-two strains showing high recombination by visual inspection only under AID expression were selected for further analysis, whereas those showing high recombination without AID were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After performing fluctuation tests with the 22 selected strains (Fig S1C), we selected mpl1 as the only mutation conferring significant hyperrecombination in the presence of AID.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lack_of_Mlp1_2_Causes_R_Loop-Dependent_Genome_Instability_and_R_Loop_Accumulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because MLP1 and its paralog MLP2 encode proteins of the nuclear basket with distinct but overlapping functions, we pursued our analysis in mlp1, mlp2, and mlp1 mlp2 double mutants in the W303 strain background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we showed that AID expression leads to hyperrecombination in mlp1, mlp2, and mlp1 mlp2 using the L-lacZ system under the control of the LEU2 promoter (Fig 1A and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the double mutant, the basal recombination frequency is slightly increased compared with the wild type (4.6-fold), whereas the levels of AID-induced recombination are similar to those of either single mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the AID-dependent increase in recombination was suppressed by RNase H1 overexpression, suggesting that the action of AID is enabled by the presence of R loops in the three strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the transcription dependency of AID-mediated recombination in the L-lacZ system under control of the GAL1 promoter under conditions of low (glucose) or high (galactose) transcription (Fig 1B, Fig S2, and Table S2) revealed that hyperrecombination in mlp1/2 mutants depended on both AID expression and transcription, consistent with its dependency on R loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombination was also analyzed in a direct-repeat chromosomal system based on two mutated copies of the HIS3 gene on chromosome XV (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AID expression substantially increased recombination in an RNase H1-sensitive manner in the three mutants (Fig 1C and Table S2), consistent with the plasmid-born system results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, recombination frequencies were also slightly increased in the absence of AID expression compared with the wild type, indicating that mutation of Mlp1/2 leads to a weak increase in recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, Rad52-foci were monitored as a mark of double-strand breaks (DSBs) by fluorescence microscopy in cells expressing a Rad52YFP fusion protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AID expression led to significantly higher percentages of S/G2 cells with Rad52-foci in mlp1, mlp2, and mlp1 mlp2 mutants compared with the wild type (Fig 1D and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This AID-dependent increase in Rad52 foci was also suppressed by RNase H1 overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of S/G2 cells with Rad52 foci showed a slight but significant increase in the three mutants strains also in the absence of AID expression, consistent with the idea that mlp1/2 mutants increase genomic instability, in agreement with the implication of the Mlp1/2-bound nucleoporin Nup60 in DSB appearance (39), and as further supported by the analysis of plasmid loss, which increases over twofold in mlp1, mlp2, and mlp1 mlp2 compared with the wild type (Fig 1E and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess whether Mlp1/2 inactivation increases R loops, DNARNA hybrid immunoprecipitation (DRIP) with the S9.6 antibody were done in mlp1, mlp2, and mlp1 mlp2 strains at genes previously shown to form DNARNA hybrids or to generate transcription-dependent replication defects in R loop-accumulating THO mutants (10, 40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that R loops accumulate at the tested genes (GCN4, PDC1, SPF1, and PDR5) in the three strains (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNase H treatment decreased the R loop levels and a very low S9.6 signal was obtained at GAL1 when not transcribed, confirming that the signal was DNARNA hybrid specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, DRIP analysis at the transcribed TRP1 gene located in the intervening sequence of the his3 direct-repeat recombination system (Fig 1C) showed also R loop accumulation in three mutants (Fig 2C), consistent with the results of the recombination assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results indicate that the lack of Mlp1/2 increases cotranscriptional R loops that may potentially cause genome instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because similar results were obtained in single and double mutants, we hereafter focus on mlp1 strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

R_Loop_Accumulation_Interferes_with_Replication_in_mlp1_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interference with the replication process has emerged as one of the major causes of R loop-mediated genome instability (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we assayed replication fork (RF) progression in mlp1 cells by different means.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we analyzed replication by FACS and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in mlp1 cells (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences could be appreciated between the mlp1 and wild-type strains, independently of AID expression or the presence of hydroxyurea (HU), which slows down replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this method might not be sufficiently sensitive, we analyzed replication by monitoring BrdU incorporation in cells upon release from -factormediated G1 arrest in the vicinity of the early firing origins ARS508 and ARS1211.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These origins were chosen because they are situated in close vicinity to the SPF1 and PDC1 genes, respectively, in which R loops accumulate in mlp1/2 mutants (Fig 2B) and in head-on orientation in respect to replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was immunoprecipitated with anti-BrdU antibody and subjected to real-time qPCR at the 5 and 3end of the transcription units and the ARS sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mlp1 cells showed mild defects in replication compared with wild-type cells (Fig 3A and Fig S4), which are also seen in the absence of HU (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the difference in BrdU incorporation observed between wild-type and mlp1 cells was completely lost in cells overexpressing RNase H1 at all analyzed regions, indicating that R loop accumulation is likely responsible for the replication delay (Fig 3A and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To appraise whether the replication defects might be due to the head-on orientation of replicationtranscription of the systems tested, we analyzed BrdU incorporation at ARS1021, an early firing ARS located next to the codirectionally orientated gene ECM17 (Fig 3B and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNase H1-sensitive replication defects were observed at this locus as well, supporting the conclusion that R loop accumulation leads to general replication defects in mlp1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gene_Tethering_to_the_NPC_Prevents_R_Loop_Accumulation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent work has shown that Mlp1 is a target for intra-S checkpoint kinase Rad53, and that Mlp1 phosphorylation results in the release of DNA gated at the NPC (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, we took advantage of reported mutants carrying a phosphomimetic or a nonphosphorylatable mlp1 allele (mlp1-S1710D and mlp1-S1710A, respectively) (37) and analyzed AID-mediated recombination and Rad52-foci (Fig 4 A and B and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are consistent with our hypothesis that gene gating may prevent the formation of R loops and their associated genomic instability because the mlp1-S1710D mutant that mimics constitutive checkpoint activationthat in turn supposes release of the damaged DNA from the NPCbehaved similarly to the gene gating-deficient mlp1 strain in both assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, the mlp1-S1710A mutant that does not allow checkpoint-dependent release from the NPC did not appear to show R loop-mediated increase in recombination or Rad52 foci accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, plasmid loss was also exacerbated in the D allele compared with the A allele (Fig 4C and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct assessment by DRIP with the S9.6 antibody confirmed R loop accumulation in the D mutant (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the A mutant, the S9.6 signal was also increased, but it was RNase H-resistant, indicating that it does not correspond to R loops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we asked whether R loops in mlp1 cells could be suppressed by artificially tethering the DNA to the NPC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this we used the reported artificial anchoring system of the GAL1 locus to the NPC (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Artificial tethering is achieved through the insertion of LexA binding sites downstream of GAL1 and expression of a LexANup60 fusion protein containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An NLS-containing LexA is used as a control with no NPC anchoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were collected at different time points upon transcriptional activation of the locus in galactose medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcription was followed by northern of GAL1 and ChIP of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) occupancy, and R loops where detected by DRIP (Fig 5 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the control experiment in which the GAL1 locus was not tethered to the NPC, transcriptional activation occurred less efficiently in mlp1 than in the wild type, and R loops were detected from the first time-point after transcriptional activation, in agreement with the idea that R loops are concomitant with transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the LexANup60 fusion protein was expressed in mlp1 cells, transcription activation was improved and R loops did not accumulate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that artificial tethering of the GAL1 gene abolishes both the transcriptional defects and the accumulation of R loops at this locus in mlp1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This role of gene gating in preventing R loops is not specific to cells lacking the nuclear basket Mlp1 protein, because analysis of R loops with and without NPC tethering in mlp1 and THO-deficient hpr1 cells revealed that artificial anchoring of the GAL1 locus to the NPC did suppress R loop formation in both mlp1 and hpr1 cells (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LexANup60 expression per se did not have a global effect on R loop formation, as shown by analysis of the unrelated and R loop-rich rDNA locus that showed equal R loop levels in wild-type, mlp1, and hpr1 cells expressing LexA and LexANup60 at the rDNA (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that gene gating plays a determinant role in the prevention of R loop accumulation in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
R loops cause genome instability and have been linked with a number of neurodegenerative diseases and with tumorigenesis (42, 45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using AID expression as a tool, we identified MLP1 in a screen for genes involved in preventing R loop accumulation in budding yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses of mlp1, mlp2, and mlp1 mlp2 mutants revealed that R loops accumulate at transcribed genes in either of these strains, leading to increased genome instability as seen by AID-dependent hyperrecombination, increased Rad52 foci, and plasmid loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the idea that interference with the replication process is one of the major causes of R loop-mediated genome stability (42, 43), deletion of MLP1 causes mild replication defects that are suppressed by RNase H1 overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such replication defects were observed without AID expression, consistent with the moderate increase in recombination, Rad52 foci, and plasmid loss observed in untreated mlp1/2 mutants, suggesting that R loops accumulated in the absence of the Mlp1/2 moderately challenge genome stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In yeast, Mlp1 associates with highly transcribed genes and is required for gene gating at the NPC (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that tethering of the GAL locus to the NPC is sufficient to suppress R loops at this locus in mlp1 cells, as well as in the hpr1 THO mutant, suggesting that gene gating does generally prevent R loop formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of export-competent mRNPs is important in preventing R loops and their accompanying genome instability (2), whereas gene gating facilitates mRNA export (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covering of the nascent RNA with mRNP biogenesis factors and physical transport through nuclear pores would prevent the nascent RNA from forming a DNARNA hybrid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this view, overexpression of RNA binding factors such as Tho1, Nab2, or Sub2/UAP56 suppresses the transcription-dependent hyperrecombination of THO mutants (5, 47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noteworthy, Nab2 physically interacts with Mlp1 and is believed to be required for proper docking of the mRNP to the Mlp1/2 platform (31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, mlp1/2 or nab2 mutations lead to frequent release of the mRNP into the nucleoplasm (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the THSC/TREX-2 mRNP biogenesis complex is required for gene gating (50), it would be interesting to investigate whether Nab2 overexpression restores gene gating in THSC/TREX-2 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results show that mlp1 and hpr1 cells share a similar behavior with respect to their R loops being suppressed by artificial tethering of a chromosomal locus, whereas their impact on genome stability is far apart, hpr1 being extremely hyperrecombinant in a transcription-dependent manner (51) and mlp1 showing moderately increased transcription-dependent recombination only after AID expression (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences might rely on the fact that, unlike Mlp1, THO is recruited to active genes by the elongating RNAP II and participate in transcription (10, 52, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, altered chromatin structure has been associated with R loops in THO mutants both in Caenorhabditis elegans and yeast (54), which could represent a serious threat to RF progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thus possible that THO mutants accumulate genome-threatening situations, which may interfere with the cellular processes that normally deal with pathological R loops or stalled forks, whereas these situations are not produced in mlp1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, according to the recent evidence that a second step of R loop stabilization is required for R loop-mediated genome instability, as would occur in hpr1 mutants but not in specific histone H3 and H4 mutants (23), it is also possible that R loops in mlp1/2 mutants might not be efficiently stabilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, our data supports a model in which physical proximity to the NPC would protect transcribed genes from R loop accumulation (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In NPC-gated genes, the nascent mRNP would readily get exported out of the nucleus, reducing the probability of back-hybridization with the DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a more efficient mRNP assembly or the NPC itself may contribute to prevent R loop formation at gated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, R loop accumulation would occur in DNA transcribed in the nucleoplasm, as seen in mlp1/2 gene-gating defective cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is consistent with the facts that both transcription elongation and RNA export are impaired in THO mutants (5, 55) and that R loops in THO- and Mlp1-depleted cells are suppressed by artificial DNA tethering to the NPC (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, our study suggests that replication stress-induced release of transcribed genes from nuclear pores (37) would lead to R loop formation in the nucleoplasm, which may serve to further amplify the checkpoint activation cascade and signal the sites of RF stalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this idea, different studies suggest that R loops may accumulate in cells undergoing replicative stress (20, 25, 27) and participate in DNA damage signaling to activate ATM in human cells (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the NPC-associated helicase DDX19 relocates to the core of the nucleus in response to replication stress or DNA damage to remove R loops (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study thus opens new perspectives to understand the role of RNA in genome dynamics and the control of genome integrity as a function of nuclear location and raises the question of whether the human Mlp1/2 homolog TPR may fulfill the same functions in replication checkpoint and R loop prevention as in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
