MerminWagner fluctuations in 2D amorphous solids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reducing dimensionality often entails striking new physics, as, e.g., the Quantum Hall effect in 2D electron systems or the different recurrence probabilities of random walks in various dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, phase transitions in 2D and 3D differ significantly: Long before graphene came into focus, theories for melting of 2D crystals were developed and probed with colloidal monolayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2D, the crystalline and fluid phase is separated by a so-called hexatic phase, unknown in 3D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, 2D crystals exhibit instabilities on large length scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that those instabilities also exist in 2D amorphous solids, but do not melt thema topic that emerged only recently, 50 y after the prediction in 2D crystals by D. Mermin and H. Wagner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a recent commentary, J. M. Kosterlitz described how D. Thouless and he got motivated to investigate melting and suprafluidity in two dimensions [Kosterlitz JM (2016) J Phys Condens Matter 28:481001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was due to the lack of broken translational symmetry in two dimensionsdoubting the existence of 2D crystalsand the first computer simulations foretelling 2D crystals (at least in tiny systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of broken symmetries proposed by D. Mermin and H. Wagner is caused by long wavelength density fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those fluctuations do not only have structural impact, but additionally a dynamical one: They cause the Lindemann criterion to fail in 2D in the sense that the mean squared displacement of atoms is not limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing experimental data from 3D and 2D amorphous solids with 2D crystals, we disentangle MerminWagner fluctuations from glassy structural relaxations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrate with computer simulations the logarithmic increase of displacements with system size: Periodicity is not a requirement for MerminWagner fluctuations, which conserve the homogeneity of space on long scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Counting the path to cover space in various dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1D, fluctuations can add up independently on an axis along 0 to 1, whereas in 3D they have to be correlated along the six different ways from 0 to 3 and stay finite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2D, fluctuations add up logarithmically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(Left) MSD of a defect free 2D crystal (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control parameter  is an inverse temperature; increasing  triggers solidification (melting is at m=60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On long times, the MSD diverges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even a 2D crystal has fluid-like character due to MerminWagner fluctuations, whereas, using local coordinates, the CR-MSD stays finite (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Center) In a 2D glass, an additional -process causes the CR-MSD (blue) not to stay finite, and the amplitude of the global fluctuation given by the MSD (red) is significantly larger (the glass transition is at G200, this curve is therefore plotted transparent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both 2D systems labeled with triangles are fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Right) MSD (red) and CR-MSD (blue) for a 3D glass for various supercooling (details below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the amplitude is significantly smaller, and the upturn seem to appear simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the ordinate is zoomed in in 3D compared with 2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glasses labeled with diamonds are deep in the glass phase, and the -process starts to appear only at the end of the accessible time window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
1_Colloidal_Systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This difference of global and local fluctuations in 2D is already a hallmark of MerminWagner fluctuations, but before we focus in orientational and structural decay, the experimental realization of 2D and 3D systems and details about the simulations are briefly discussed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D systems are well established, and we investigated crystallization, defects (3740), and the glass transition (30, 35, 36) with this setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They consist of colloidal monolayers where individual particles are sedimented by gravity to a flat a water/air interface in hanging-droplet geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colloids are a few microns in size and perform Brownian motion within the plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control parameter of the system is =Epot/Ekin, given by the ratio of potential energy of the particles (due to mutual dipolar interaction) and the kinetic energy EkinT due to thermal motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be interpreted as an inverse temperature (or dimensionless pressure); thus, large values of  refer to small temperatures and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole monolayer consists of a few hundred thousand particles, and a few thousand are monitored by standard video microscopy and digital image analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S1 and as explained in SI Text, 2% of pinned particles on a solid substrate is enough to suppress MerminWagner fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3D colloidal systems consist of more than a billion particles, dissolved in an organic solvent with identical mass density; thus, particles do not sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colloids are slightly charged and the interaction is given by Coulomb interaction screened by a small amount of counterions in the solvent (Yukawa potential).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details are given in Table S1 and SI Text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monitoring is performed with confocal microscopy, providing 3D images with several thousand particles being tracked in the field of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finite size effects in 2D were additionally investigated with computer simulations, specifically Brownian dynamics simulation of hard disks (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent crystallization, a binary mixture of different sizes of disks was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase diagram was controlled by entropy (not temperature), and the control parameter in this systems was solely given by the (area) packing fraction  of disks in the plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison of MSD and CR-MSD for the 2D simulation is given in Fig S2, completely in line with Fig 2 for 2D experimental glass data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Colloidal systems are so-called soft-matter systems: The interaction energy between particles is of the order (tenth of) eV, comparable to atomic or molecular systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because length scales (distances between particles) are approximately 104 to 106 times larger, energy densities (and therefore elastic moduli) are smaller by 108 to 1012 in 2D, and even 1012 to 1018 in 3D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, soft matter has a rich variety of excited states at moderate temperatures, and thermally induced fluctuations are easily accessible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This offers the unique possibility to measure MerminWagner fluctuations in the laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For atomic systems, including Graphene, it has been argued that sheets of cosmologic size are necessary to detect any realistic amplitude of MerminWagner fluctuations (4143).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

2_Structural_and_Orientational_Decay_in_2D_and_3D  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure the structural decay and to investigate the -process in glass, one frequently uses the intermediate scattering function Â¯(q,t)=n(q,t+)n(q,), where n(q,t) is the Fourier transform of the density n(r,t) at time t. The self-part of the intermediate scattering function q(t) ignores cross-correlations between different particles at rk and rl, but correlates the position of particle ri at =0 with its position at =t in Fourier space, where the sum runs over all particles N.q(t)=1Nj=1Neiquj(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 is nothing but distribution of displacements in Fourier space uj(t)=rj(t+)rj().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wave vector q is as usual chosen to be q=2/a0, the position where the structure factor S(q) has its first maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Angular brackets indicate the canonical ensemble average for simulations and an average about various starting times  in experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3, q(t) is plotted as red curves for four different systems: Shown are the 2D crystal (Fig 3, Upper Left) and 2D glass (Fig 3, Upper Right) of dipolar particles as in Fig 2, but omitting the fluid curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After an initial decay due to thermal vibrations (which is hardly seen on the log-lin scale), the red curves enter a plateau, indicating the dynamic arrest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the stiffest glass (diamonds) is stable on the accessible timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3, Lower Right shows data from simulations of a 2D hard disk system for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qualitative behavior is the same as for the 2D dipolar glass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3, Lower Left shows the 3D glass, again with a typical two-step decay, except for the strongest glass (red diamonds), where the decay is hardly visible on the experimental accessible timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In analogy to the CR-MSD, one can define a cage-relative intermediate scattering function given in blue in Fig 3, where the displacement is reduced by the center of mass motion of the nearest neighbors (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2D, the nearest neighbors are defined by VoronoiTessellation, whereas in 3D a cutoff value of 1.2a0 is used to identify particles within the first shell representing the cage,qCR(t)=1Nj=1Neiq(uj(t)ujcage(t)),[4]where the displacement of the cage of particle j given by the Nj neighbors reads ujcage(t)=1Nji=1Nj(ri(t+)ri()).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further introduce the bond order correlation function G6(t)=6(t+)6(), which correlates the local director field in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the crystal, the director field is given by the bond direction to the nearest neighbors in sixfolded space:6=1Niiei6ij(t),[5]and ij(t) is the time-dependent angle of the bond direction between particle i and j and an arbitrary reference axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2D glass, only 20% of the particles are sixfolded, 75% are fivefolded and sevenfolded (together and similar distributed), whereas less_than5% are fourfolded or eightfolded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for the 2D binary mixture, we sum up all relevant director fields,G6(t)=n=48n(t+)n(),[6]still G6(t=0)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 3D glass, the local director field of particle i is given by Q6mi=1Njj=1Njq6m(ij,ij) based on the spherical harmonics qlm(,) for l=6 with polar  and azimutal  angle of the bond (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D correlation function readsG6(t)=42l+1iNm=6m=6Q6mi(t+)(Q6mi()),[7]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 3, we now compare the cage-relative intermediate scattering function q(t) plotted in blue and the bond-order correlation function G6(t) plotted in green.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the crystal, both correlation functions do not decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for the MSD, the MerminWagner fluctuations are shortcut by using local coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientational order does not decay because the modulus of rotational stiffness, (usually called Franks constant in analogy to liquid crystal theory) is infinite in a 2D crystal (4, 6), even if translational order decays and the MSD diverges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-range bend and splay are suppressed, while long range density fluctuations are allowed in 2D crystals (4, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the soft glasses =200/231 (green and blue squares/circles in Fig 3, Upper Right), both correlation function qCR(t) and G6(t) decay, but not the stiffest one for =423 (diamonds), where the standard q(t) was already stable within the given time window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the timescales for orientational and cage-relative structural decay is the same for identical  (comparing curves with green and blue squares for =200 and green and blue circles for =231).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The separation in timescales compared with the standard structural decay q(t) (red) is clearly visible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D simulations show the same behavior, which means that 2D glasses are affected by slow MerminWagner fluctuations and structural relaxations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3, Lower Left shows the 3D glass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stiffest glass 1 (diamonds) is almost stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In glass 2 (blue, red, and green circles) and glass 3 (blue, red, and green squares), all correlation functions decay on the same timescale due to structural relaxations, but without MerminWagner fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that 2D crystals are affected by MerminWagner fluctuations, and 2D glasses are affected by MerminWagner fluctuations and -relaxation, whereas 3D glasses are only affected by -relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

3_Finite_Size_Effects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 3, a separation of timescales between standard structural and orientational decay was shown for the 2D glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the -relaxation is strongly dependent on the supercooling, but only marginally affected by system size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Escaping the cage is a local mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that all experimental systems are much larger than the examined fields of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude of MerminWagner fluctuations, conversely, depends on elasticity (which is a function of temperature), but more importantly, it depends logarithmically on system size (14, 15, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No predictions exist for the timescale of MerminWagner fluctuations, but it is reasonable to assume that they also depend on system size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accidentally, it might be the case that MerminWagner fluctuations and -relaxation fall on top of each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we vary systematically the number of particles for the simulated hard disk system at fixed packing fraction between 1,000 and 16,000 disks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 shows a comparison of cage-relative and normal MSDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All displacements measured in local coordinates collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normal MSD, conversely, shows a strong finite size effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The height of the plateau is extracted by taking the amplitudes of the displacement at the inflection point r2(i), indicated by open circles in Fig 4, being determined by fitting a third-order polynomial in the region of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the inflection point shifts to later times for larger systems, validating the assumption above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plotting the square root of the amplitude of the inflection point as a function of the logarithm of the linear system size LN gives a straight line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the logarithmic fingerprint of MerminWagner fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent manuscript by H. Shiba et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (32) independently reports the same logarithmic increase of long wavelength fluctuations in 2D of a simulated soft sphere glass, although to our knowledge they have not yet been directly measured in crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

4_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13, E. Flenner and G. Szamel reported fundamental differences between glassy dynamics in two and three dimensions and detected strong finite size effects in 2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localization in a 2D glass (e.g., measured by the plateau of the intermediate scattering function or MSD) is not well pronounced and decays faster in large systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bond-order correlation functions (taking only sixfolded particles into account) decay later and show less size dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, particle trajectories show sudden jumps in 3D, but not in 2D, and dynamical heterogeneities are significantly pronounced in 3D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They conclude that vitrification in 2D and 3D is not the same, calling for a reexamination of the present glass transition paradigm in 2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We perform this reexamination, taking MerminWagner fluctuations into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot address differences between Newtonian and Brownian dynamics (13) in colloidal experiments, and thus they are not discussed in the present manuscript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other differences observed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13 for 2D and 3D disappear in our system when using local coordinates (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. Flenner and G. Szamel investigated remarkably large systems to reduce finite size effects, but this even enhances MerminWagner fluctuations: Those fluctuations affect translational degrees of freedom, but not orientational ones, and depend logarithmically on the system size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29, we showed that non-Gaussian behavior of the self part of the van-Hove function (which measures the variance of displacements at a given time) in 2D systems is only visible in local, cage-relative coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equivalently, the dynamical heterogeneities show significantly more contrast in cage-relative coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MerminWagner fluctuations simply smear out local events like hopping and cage escape if particles are measured in a global coordinate frame (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30, we assumed that the presence of collective motion might be due to long wavelength fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Now this is validated in direct comparison with 2D crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent manuscript by S. Vivek et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (31) reports results of a soft sphere and a hard sphere glass in 2D compared with a 3D glass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using similar correlation functions, their results are essentially the same, but the (almost) hard sphere glass showed less signature of MerminWagner fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be explained by the work of FrÃ¶hlich and Pfister (20): They determined the following conditions for MerminWagner fluctuations to appear: (i) The pair-potential of particles has to be integrable in the far field and (ii) analytically at the origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first condition rules out Coulomb interaction, because for this long-range potential, the second, third, and higher nearest-neighbors interaction is strong enough that particle displacements cannot add up statistically independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second condition questions hard sphere interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An easy argument in the limit of zero temperature might go as follows: When all particles are at contact and closed packed, no positional fluctuations can appear at all.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At finite temperature, the MerminWagner fluctuations are excited, as shown in Fig 4, but the separation of timescales is less pronounced in Fig 3 for the hard-disks simulation, consistent with the results of Vivek et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative ansatz to investigate MerminWagner fluctuations is reported by H. Shiba et al., showing analogue results in large-scale computer simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shiba et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  analyzed bond-breakage correlations, four-point correlations (46), and intermediate scattering functions in 2D and in 3D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Being a local quantity, bond-breakage correlations do not differ in 2D and 3D; thus, the microscopic nature of the glass transition is similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the density of vibrational states of a 2D system, computed from the velocity autocorrelation function, shows an infinite growth of acoustic vibrations, very similar to 2D crystals (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those beautiful results are completely in line with our arguments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Connecting MerminWagner fluctuations and glassy behavior in 2D points to another question that is yet not completely solved, namely, how (shear) solidity appears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glass is a solid on intermediate timescales, but on infinite times it may flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 2D crystal is soft on infinite length scales (lacking globally broken symmetries) and a solid only at intermediate scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

5_Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparing experimental and simulation data in 2D and 3D, we show that a 2D crystal is affected by MerminWagner fluctuations in the long time limit; a 2D glass has MerminWagner fluctuations as a second channel of decay beside the standard -process of structural relaxation, whereas a 3D glass only shows an -process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of MerminWagner fluctuations is not limited to low dimensional crystals; they also appear in 2D amorphous solids and certainly in 2D quasicrystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison of structural and orientational measures shows that MerminWagner fluctuations can explain the differences in orientational relaxation times (not affected by long wavelength fluctuations) and translational relaxation times (affected by those fluctuations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, MerminWagner fluctuations exist on large scales, and the local effect (within the size of the cage) is only an affine translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the cage-escape mechanism is not influenced by MerminWagner fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can conclude that the microscopic mechanism of the 2D and 3D glass transition is not necessarily different, whereas the transient localization measured by global variables is less pronounced in 2D compared with 3D, taking MerminWagner fluctuations into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SI_Text  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The confinement of colloids to two dimensions is achieved by sedimentation to an interface, which in our case is the lower water/air surface in hanging droplet geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume is regulated actively with a microsyringe to get a flat interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluid interface guarantees free diffusion of the colloids (without any pinning) within the horizontal monolayer, but the sedimentation height is about 20nm and negligible compared with the size of the colloids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter consist of polystyrene beads with diameter A=4.5m (species A) for the crystals and a mixture of species A and B (to avoid crystallization) for the glass samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Species B has B=2.8m and the glassy mixture has a relative concentration of =NB/(NA+NB)50%, where NA and NB are the number of particles of both species in the field of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colloidal beads are further doped with iron oxide nanoparticles, which results in a superparamagnetic behavior and a mass density of 1.7 kg/dm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole monolayer consists of several hundred thousand particles, where 2000 particles are monitored by video microscopy in a 1158Ã865m2 subwindow in the glass sample and 3000 particles in a 835Ã620m2 subwindow in the crystalline sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual colloids are tracked with a spatial resolution of 50nm and with a time resolution of the order of a second.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system is kept at room temperature and exempt from density gradients due to a monthlong precise control of curvature and inclination of the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because of the superparamagnetic nature of the particles, the potential energy can be tuned by means of an external magnetic field H applied perpendicular to the monolayer, which induces a repulsive dipoledipole interaction between the particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio between potential energy Emag and diffusive thermal energy kBT,=04H2(n)3/2kBT(B+(1)A)2,[S1]acts as inverse temperature (or dimensionless pressure for fixed volume and particle number).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n=1/a2 is the 2D particle density with a mean particle distance 13mless_thanaless_than22m (depending on the kind of sample).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetic susceptibility per bead is A=6.51011Am2/T and B=61012Am2/T for species A and B, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For low , the system is fluid because the thermal motion dominates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing  induces crystallization at m=70 (39) or dynamic arrest and vitrification at G=195 (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Digital image analysis gives the positions of the beads as a function of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides the complete phase-space information of the colloidal ensembles at all relevant timescales on an atomic level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our glasses are well-aged; we carefully checked that the -process is independent of waiting time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details of the 2D setup are described elsewhere (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the water/air interface is crucial: We performed additionally a whole set of measurements as function of  on a solid substrate (object plate) where accidentally between 1 and 3% of particles were pinned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pinning sufficiently suppresses MerminWagner fluctuations and the differences between MSD and CR-MSD disappears, as shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3D glass consists of monodisperse, charged polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) particles of C=2.6m diameter, covered with poly-12-hydroxystearic acid to prevent aggregation, which are dissolved in a well-adjusted cyclohexylbromide (CHB) and decaline mixture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mixture matches the mass density to prevent sedimentation and simultaneously the refractive index of solvent and colloid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the latter, the ensemble is not turbid, and one can look deep into the sample (which consists of several billion particles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The particles are doped with rhodamine 6G, and by using standard confocal microscopy, the 3D trajectories of up to 6000 particles can be monitored and analyzed simultaneously in a field of view of approximately 70Ã60Ã30m3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Care has to be taken to use thoroughly cleaned solvents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CHB was passed through an activated alumina column to remove H2O, HBr, and any other polar molecules and ions (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dispersed in CHB, PMMA colloids acquire a moderate positive charge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seems to originate from the adsorption of protons and bromide ions stemming from the decomposition of CHB (with protons being adsorbed more likely) (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the small abundance of ions in the solvent, one obtains a screened Coulomb interaction with the dimensionless Yukawa potential:u(r)=lB(e/21+C/2)2Zeff2err,[S2]where  is the inverse screening length of the ions and lB=e2/(kBT40r) is the Bjerrum length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the length where the interaction potential between two elementary charges e in the medium with dielectric constant r equals the thermal energy kBT (0 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  System parameters are determined from fits of theoretically computed structure factors S(q) [using an approximate integral equation theory (50)] to the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective mean charge Zeff=500 on the surface of the colloid is the same for all three presented systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the phase diagram has two relevant parameters left that counteract: These are the packing fraction , which is given by the particle distance (and size), and the screening length 1, given by the density of counterions and any other ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge polydispersity Z is dominated by the surface area polydispersity, thus being of the order of up to 17% for a size polydispersity determined by electron microscopy to be 8%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effectively suppresses crystallization, which occurs not earlier than 12 wk after rejuvenation of the sample by shaking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S1 shows the parameters of three different glasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the following, we will also compare experimental results with simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those are made for a 2D binary mixture of hard disks undergoing Brownian motion by using an event-driven simulation algorithm (51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system contains N=16,000 particles, is made up of a 50:50 mixture with diameters dA=1, dB=1.4, and is equilibrated by Newtonian dynamics before data are collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The packing fraction , giving the ratio of the area occupied by the disks to the area of the system, varies from =0.77 to =0.81, hence in the vicinity of the glass transition point c0.795 (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the simulations, the averaging (angular brackets) is done for typically 100 runs as function of density and for finite size effects up to 200 independent runs as function of system size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2 shows the comparison of MSD and CR-MSD in similar manner as Fig 2 for the experimental systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed MerminWagner fluctuations in 2D crystal and 2D glass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the question of which low-dimensional systems will show MerminWagner fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because well-defined neighbor distances with low variance as in glasses, quasicrystals, and crystals are required, we suggest hyperuniformity, originally formulated to characterize structures with isotropic photonic bandgaps (54, 55), to be a necessary requirement: in hyperuniform structures the number variance (R)=NR2NR2 of NR atoms within a n-dimensional sphere of radius R is proportional to the n  1 dimensional surface of the sphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
