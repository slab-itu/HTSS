Endolysosomal trafficking of viral G protein-coupled receptor functions in innate immunity and control of viral oncogenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We show that the autophagy-related protein Beclin 2 functions as a newly described cellular regulator of viral G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and as a suppressor of viral GPCR-driven tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beclin 2 functions in regulating Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded GPCR levels, proinflammatory signaling, and oncogenic activity in mice by facilitating viral GPCR endolysosomal trafficking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Beclin 2-dependent endolysosomal trafficking and degradation of an oncogenic viral protein may represent a broader and heretofore unappreciated role of the endolysosomal trafficking machinery in innate immunity (by defending against microbial virulence factors) and in tumor suppression (by degrading oncogenic cell surface receptors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ubiquitin-proteasome system degrades viral oncoproteins and other microbial virulence factors; however, the role of endolysosomal degradation pathways in these processes is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposis sarcoma, and a constitutively active viral G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) contributes to the pathogenesis of KSHV-induced tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that a recently discovered autophagy-related protein, Beclin 2, interacts with KSHV GPCR, facilitates its endolysosomal degradation, and inhibits vGPCR-driven oncogenic signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, monoallelic loss of Becn2 in mice accelerates the progression of vGPCR-induced lesions that resemble human Kaposis sarcoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings indicate that Beclin 2 is a host antiviral molecule that protects against the pathogenic effects of KSHV GPCR by facilitating its endolysosomal degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More broadly, our data suggest a role for host endolysosomal trafficking pathways in regulating viral pathogenesis and oncogenic signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Beclin_2_Interacts_with_KSHV_GPCR_(vGPCR)_and_Reduces_Its_Protein_Levels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated whether Beclin family members (21) interact with vGPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HEK293 cells transfected with HA-tagged vGPCR and Flag-tagged human Beclin 1 or Beclin 2, both human Beclin 1 and human Beclin 2 coimmunoprecipitated with vGPCR (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that endogenous Beclin 1 and Beclin 2 coimmunoprecipitated with HA-vGPCR (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Beclin 2, but not Beclin 1, overexpression appeared to result in a decrease in HA-vGPCR steady-state levels (Fig 1A), we examined whether there was a dose-dependent effect of Beclin 2 on vGPCR protein levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, increasing levels of Beclin 2 expression were associated with significant decreases in levels of steady-state vGPCR expression but not of an irrelevant transfected control protein, GFP; in contrast, overexpression of Beclin 1 had no effect on steady-state levels of vGPCR (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, siRNA knockdown of Beclin 2, but not the related autophagy protein Beclin 1 or another autophagy protein ATG7, resulted in an increase in steady-state levels of vGPCR (Fig 2B), although siRNA knockdown of Beclin 2, Beclin 1, and ATG7 resulted in a comparable defect in starvation-induced autophagic flux [as measured by p62 degradation reversed by the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1)] (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, siRNA knockdown of Beclin 2 also increased KHSV GPCR levels in body cavity lymphoma cells with lytic KSHV replication (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data show that Beclin 2, but not other autophagy proteins such as Beclin 1 or ATG7, regulates cellular levels of vGPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we investigated whether interaction with GASP1 is required for this function of Beclin 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, we found that Beclin 2 mutants lacking amino acids 6988 (6988) or with an I80S substitution mutation are unable to interact with GASP1 and mediate degradation of certain cellular GPCRs (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, these two Beclin 2 mutants coimmunoprecipitated with vGPCR and decreased vGPCR steady-state levels (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we rescued the increase in steady-state vGPCR levels upon Beclin 2 siRNA knockdown by expressing either wild-type siRNA-resistant Beclin 2 or mutant 6988 or I80S siRNA-resistant Beclin 2 (Fig S2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the increase in vGPCR steady-state levels with Beclin 2 knockdown is not a result of off-target siRNA effects and, unlike Beclin 2-dependent regulation of cellular GPCRs, Beclin 2-dependent regulation of vGPCR does not require its GASP1-interacting domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Beclin_2_Regulates_vGPCR_Protein_Levels_Through_a_Lysosomal_Degradation_Pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Beclin 2-dependent decrease in HA-vGPCR expression was partially reversed by treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor, Baf A1 (Fig 3A), suggesting that Beclin 2 may promote the degradation of KSHV GPCR through a lysosomal-dependent (but autophagy-independent) pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm these findings using an independent approach (Fig S3A), we followed the fate of fluorescently labeled surface HA-vGPCR (at 4 °C) at serial time points after internalization (incubation at 37 °C) in the presence or absence of enforced Beclin 2 expression and in the presence or absence of Baf A1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 90 min after internalization, the percentage of cells expressing vGPCR was significantly less when cotransfected with Beclin 2 versus empty vector control (Fig 3 B and C); this number dropped to almost 15% in the Beclin 2-transfected cells, but remained at 70% in the vector-transfected cells (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decrease in vGPCR+ cells upon cotransfection with Beclin 2 was completely blocked by treatment with Baf A1 (Fig 3C), confirming that Beclin 2 promotes the endolyososomal degradation of vGPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that endogenous Beclin 2 regulates the fate of internalized vGPCR, we compared the percentage of vGPCR+ cells treated with noncoding control or beclin 2 siRNA (Fig S4B) at 45 min and 180 min after receptor internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 45 min, no differences were observed and vGPCR was predominantly colocalized with the endosomal marker, early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) (Fig S3C); in contrast, at 180 min, very few (10%) vGPCR+ cells were observed in the nontargeting control siRNAs, whereas 70% cells were vGPCR+ in the beclin 2 siRNA-treated group (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that increased Beclin 2 expression facilitates the endolysosomal degradation of vGPCR, whereas Beclin 2 knockdown delays intracellular vGPCR degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Beclin_2_Suppresses_vGPCR-Induced_Oncogenic_Signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated whether Beclin 2-dependent regulation of KSHV GPCR levels affects its signaling functions (16, 2224), including activation of the NF-B transcription factor and the NF-Bdependent, proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, which is protumorigenic in KSHV-induced tumors (2529).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using NF-B and IL-6 promoter luciferase reporter assays, we found that enforced Beclin 2, but not Beclin 1, expression inhibits vGPCR-induced NF-B and IL-6 activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suppression of vGPCR-induced NF-B and IL-6 activation was reversed by the lysosomal inhibitor Baf A1 (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, expression of Beclin 2 mutants (6988 and I80S) that do not interact with GASP1 (20), suppressed vGPCR-induced NF-B and IL-6 activation as effectively as wild-type Beclin 2 (Fig S4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Beclin 2 enforced expression did not suppress TNF-induced NF-B activation (Fig S4 C and D), suggesting the regulation of vGPCR signaling by Beclin 2 is not a result of nonspecific global suppression of NF-B activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also found that knockdown of Beclin 2, but not of Beclin 1 or ATG7, enhanced vGPCR-mediated NF-B activation (Fig 4E and Fig S4E) and IL-6 activation (Fig 4F and Fig S4F), and this increase was reversed by cotransfection with either wild-type or GASP1 binding-defective Beclin 2 siRNA-resistant mutants (Fig 4 G and H and Fig S4 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that Beclin 2 regulates vGPCR-induced NF-B and IL-6 signaling in a lysosomal-dependent (but autophagy-independent) manner, which involves facilitating the endolysosomal degradation of vGPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this function of Beclin 2 does not require its interaction with GASP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Beclin_2_Suppresses_KSHV_GPCR-Driven_Oncogenesis_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given our observation that Beclin 2 regulates vGPCR-induced oncogenic signaling in vitro, we investigated whether Beclin 2 plays a role in regulating vGPCR-induced oncogenesis in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a previously established mouse model (referred to herein as ikGPCR+ mice) in which DOX-inducible expression of KSHV GPCR causes lesions in mice that strongly resemble human cutaneous KS (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed ikGPCR+ mice with previously described Becn2+/ mice that are deficient in autophagy and the degradation of certain cellular GPCRs (20) and with Becn1+/ mice that are deficient in autophagy (30), but not in the degradation of cellular GPCRs (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ littermates, ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ littermates had a significantly earlier onset of detectable skin lesions following the initiation of DOX administration in the drinking water (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was not caused by increased water intake (Fig S5A) or increased serum DOX levels in the ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ and ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice manifested the typical cutaneous lesions previously described in ikGPCR+ mice (with vascular and spindle cell proliferation and an admixture of inflammatory cells), most prominent on the tail, ear, and other exposed skin regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at the same time period after DOX treatment, the lesions in the ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice were more numerous and larger than those observed in ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ mice at the macroscopic level (see representative photos in Fig 5B) and they showed a higher density of lesional cells and more inflammatory cells upon histopathological examination (Fig 5C and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, staining with an antibody against the endothelial cell marker, CD34, revealed a significant increase in CD34+ spindle-shaped cells (Fig 5C), one of the hallmark features of human KS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunostaining with an antibody against the vGPCR transgenic protein also revealed higher levels of vGPCR immunostaining in lesions of ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice compared with ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ mice (see representative photomicrograph in Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with the earlier onset and increased severity of Kaposis sarcoma-like skin lesions in the ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice compared with the ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ mice, ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice had significantly shorter survival than ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ littermates (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were killed when they became visibly moribund with an inability to ambulate and manifested respiratory distress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though all mice were moribund at the time of autopsy, the ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ group had larger peritoneal serosanguinous effusions, more extensive diffuse lymphedema, and more visible pulmonary vascular lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscopically, upon random lung sectioning, a higher percentage of ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice had pathological evidence of pulmonary hemorrhagic KS than ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ (37 of 43 mice vs. 23 of 36 mice; P less_than 0.05; 2 test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to human pulmonary KS (31), pulmonary lesions displayed slit-like vascular spaces and extensive erythrocyte extravasation, and tended to be more extensive in the ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice also had a marked increase in serum levels of IL-6 at the time of death (Fig 6A) and at 2 and 4 wk after DOX treatment (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variability of IL-6 production among mice is likely a result of individual variation instead of leaky expression from the DOX-responsive ikGPCR allele, as the serum levels of IL-6 in untreated ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ and ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ littermate mice were undetectable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of serum IL-6 elevation in ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice inversely correlated with duration of survival (Fig S7), consistent with data from previous animal models and human studies, suggesting that IL-6 is an important pathogenic factor in KS-like disease (2529, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, allelic loss of beclin 2 significantly exacerbates KSHV GPCR-induced protumorigenic signaling and KSHV GPCR-induced neoplastic lesions in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects are unlikely to be related to autophagy, because ikGPCR+;Becn1+/ mice did not have accelerated onset of lesions, earlier mortality, or increased IL-6 production compared with littermate ikGPCR+;Becn1+/+ control mice (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, taken together with our in vitro findings, they most likely reflect a role for Beclin 2 in promoting the endolysosomal degradation of KSHV GPCR and, thereby, in blocking its protumorigenic signaling effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings demonstrate a crucial role for the endolysosomal degradation of a virally encoded cell-surface receptor in the suppression of proinflammatory signaling and neoplastic disease driven by a viral oncogenic protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of Beclin 2 (but not the related autophagy protein Beclin 1) results in accelerated degradation of vGPCR and decreased proinflammatory signaling that is blocked by lysosomal inhibition, whereas knockdown of Beclin 2 (but not the related autophagy protein Beclin 1) results in delayed degradation of vGPCR and increased proinflammatory signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, allelic loss of Becn2, but not of Becn1, in mice results in accelerated progression and enhanced severity of vGPCR-driven tumorigenesis, as well as increased IL-6 signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we propose that this Beclin 2-dependent endolysosomal trafficking and degradation of a KSHV oncogenic protein may represent a broader and heretofore unappreciated role of the endolysosomal trafficking machinery in innate immunity (by functioning as a defense against microbial virulence factors) and in tumor suppression (by degrading oncogenic cell surface receptors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considerable advances have been made in defining how oncogenic viral factors (e.g., vGPCR, vFLIP, vCyclin, and vIL-6) contribute to KSHV-induced oncogenesis (33, 34), and how onocogenic herpesviruses evade or manipulate host defense pathways (including autophagy) (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is still largely unclear what mechanisms the host uses to successfully defend against oncogenesis driven by -herpesviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although immune status (such as HIV-related or iatrogenic immunosuppression) and ethnicity (such as in classic KS and endemic KS) are important determinants of risk of KSHV-associated malignancies (34, 37), other unexplained factors likely play a role in determining the incidence and prevalence of KS in at-risk populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings in mice (i.e., the acceleration of disease in vGPCR transgenic mice with allelic loss of Becn2) lead us to speculate that genetic variations in BECN2 (or genes encoding other proteins that may regulate the trafficking of vGPCR) contribute to individual susceptibility to KSHV-associated malignancies in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanism by which Beclin 2 protects against KSHV GPCR-induced oncogenesis likely relates to a role in reducing vGPCR protein levels in endothelial cells harboring the transgene and subsequent reduction of IL-6 protumorigenic signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro studies demonstrate a lysosomal-dependent role for Beclin 2 in reducing vGPCR levels and vGPCR-induction of IL-6 signaling, and our in vivo studies show enhanced vGPCR expression and increased IL-6 production in mice with allelic loss of Becn2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the magnitude of IL-6 elevation in Becn2+/ mice inversely correlates with survival time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several lines of evidence suggest that IL-6 is a key pathogenic factor in KSHV-associated malignancies (2529, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, an IL-6 promoter polymorphism (G-174C), which leads to increased IL-6 expression (38, 39), is strongly associated with different types of KS, including those that occur in AIDS patients (epidemic KS) (28), renal transplant recipients (iatrogenic KS) (40), and a familiar cluster of classic KS (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, genetic deletion of IL-6 ablates KSHV-associated multicentric Castlemans disease (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our studies do not prove a causal relationship between increased IL-6 production and accelerated tumorigenesis and mortality in Becn2+/ mice, our observations are consistent with the paradigm that IL-6 is a key regulator of KSHV pathogenesis and provide definitive evidence that Beclin 2 regulates KSHV GPCR-induced IL-6 levels in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, our findings indicate that the endolysosomal degradation of viral (and potentially other microbial) virulence factors may serve as an important host antipathogen defense mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that the canonical autophagy machinery can function in antibacterial and antiviral host defense by delivering intracellular pathogens or components of intracellular pathogens to the lysosome for degradation (2, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Beclin 1 and the autophagy pathway has been proposed to function in controlling viral oncogenesis in at least two contexts: monoallelic deletion of Becn1 accelerates neoplastic lesions in the livers of mice that transgenically express hepatitis B envelope protein autophagy (30) and decreased autophagic degradation of a microRNA (miR-224) is postulated to contribute to hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma in mice and in humans (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that independently of the autophagy machinery, the delivery of viral oncoproteins to the lysosome for degradation (via an endolysosomal trafficking route) may play a crucial role in innate immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmid mixture and plasmids expressing HA-vGPCR, Flag-Beclin 1, wild-type Flag-Beclin 2, or mutant forms of Flag-Beclin 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter plasmid mixture consisted of plasmids expressing firefly luciferase under the control of an NF-Bresponsive element or mouse IL-6 promoter and a plasmid expressing -galactosidase from the phosphoglycerate kinase 1 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each group, the total plasmid amount was balanced with empty vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 24-h posttransfection, cells were collected and lysed with Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was used to quantify the firefly luciferase activity and -galactosidase activity according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mouse_Strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three mouse strains used in this study have been described previously: Becn1+/ (30), Becn2+/ (20), and the transgenic mouse strain that expresses tetracycline-inducible KSHV GPCR (ikGPCR+), known as iORF74 mice in previous studies (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All strains have been backcrossed more than 10 generations with C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse genotyping were performed by PCR using DNA isolated from the tail and the following primers: ikGPCR amplicon 501 bp; ikGPCR-forward, 5-GCTCCTGGGTATCTGCCTAAA-3; ikGPCR-backward, 5-CAGCACCACAGCAACAATCA-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Becn1 amplicons 1,060 bp (wild-type) and 1,180 bp (KO); Becn1 wt-forward, 5-CTGGACACGAGTTTCAAGATCCTG-3; Becn1 ko-forward, 5-GCTCCAGACTGCCTTGGGAAAAG-3; Becn1-backward, 5-GGGCATGGTAGCACACAGACCTC-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Becn2 amplicons 459 bp (wild-type) and 252 bp (KO); Becn2-forward, 5-CCCGGCTTAGACTTTTTTCTAAAGATG-3; Becn2 wt-backward, 5-GAGGTAAGCAGAGTAAAAGTGCAGAG-3; Becn2 ko-backward, 5- GTGAGTCGTATTAATTTCGATAAGCCAG-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Animal_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All mouse experiments were conducted in the Central Animal Barrier Facility of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animal protocol was approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 7- to 8-wk-old male mouse (ikGPCR;Becn2+/+, ikGPCR;Becn2+/, ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ and ikGPCR+;Becn2+/) littermates were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed with normal diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male mice were chosen for the animal experiments, as human KS occurs primarily in males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To induce vGPCR expression, mice were exposed to drinking water containing 1 mg/mL DOX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mask the taste of DOX, 1% sucrose was added in the water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude possibilities that either DOX or deficiency in beclin 2 per se leads to any lesions or mortality during the experimental period, we included four control groups: ikGPCR;Becn2+/+ and ikGPCR;Becn2+/ mice consuming DOX-containing water, and ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ and ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice consuming DOX-free water containing only 1% sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the experimental mice were examined daily and the vGPCR-induced lesions were scored (see details below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize animal discomfort, mice that manifested lesions were killed when they exhibited any of the following signs: (i) lack of responsiveness to manual stimulation; (ii) immobility; (iii) respiratory distress; or (iv) an inability to eat or drink.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse sera were collected for cytokine quantification and mouse tissues were collected for histological analyses (see details below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the control mice, such as those that do not carry an ikGPCR allele and consumed DOX-containing water and those that carry an ikGPCR allele and consumed DOX-free water, did not exhibit any lesions during the experimental period (100 d) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether heterozygous knockout of Becn1 leads to similar phonotype to that of heterozygous knockout of Becn2, we also performed similar experiments as described above using the ikGPCR+ mice crossed to Becn1+/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_Evaluation_of_vGPCR-Induced_Lesions_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantitatively assess the progression of vGPCR-induced lesions in DOX-treated ikGPCR+ mice, an objective scoring system was developed to evaluate lesion severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were examined and scored daily by an observer blinded to experimental group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  vGPCR-induced lesions on ears, abdominal and back skin, legs and feet, and tail were scored independently on a scale from 0 to 4: 0, none; 1, slight; 2, moderate; 3, marked; and 4, very marked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cumulative score of four sites served as a measure of the severity of lesions (scale 016).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first day when a mouse had a cumulative lesion score 3 was considered as the disease-onset date for the mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Assessment_of_Serum_IL-6_Levels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse sera were collected by retro-orbital bleeding every 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-6 levels in mouse sera were assessed using an ELISA-based kit (BD Bioscience) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absorbance was quantified using FLUOstar Omega microplate readers (BMG Labtech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mouse_Metabolic_Studies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study whether heterozygous knockout of Becn2 leads to increased water intake, four ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ and five ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ 12-wk-old male mice were placed in metabolic cages (MMC100, Hatteras Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were allowed to acclimate to the metabolic cages for 3 d before the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the baseline mouse water intake, all mice were fed ad libitum regular diet (Teklad global 16% protein rodent diet 2916, Harlan Laboratories), and tap water containing only 1% sucrose for 1 wk (week 0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, mice were fed regular diet and water containing 1 mg/mL DOX and 1% sucrose for 30 d. Water intake, food intake, and body weight were monitored daily for 3 continuous days in week 2 and week 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences in body weight or food intake were observed between ikGPCR+;Becn2+/+ and ikGPCR+;Becn2+/ mice during the experimental period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water volumes shown in Fig S5A were normalized to 30-g body weight per day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantification_of_Serum_DOX_Levels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse sera were collected by retro-orbital bleeding at week 2 of DOX treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten microliters of serum was diluted with 40 L of de-ionized H2O and processed by addition of 100 L of acetonitrile containing 0.15% formic acid and 300 ng/mL demeclocycline (internal standard, Sigma-Aldrich) to precipitate plasma proteins and release bound drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were vortexed for 15 s and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 × g and the final supernatant analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an AB/Sciex 4000 Qtrap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) coupled to a Prominence LC (Shimadzu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds (demeclocycline and DOX) were detected with a mass spectrometer in multiple reaction-monitoring mode by following the precursor to fragment ion transition 445.1  428.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instrument settings were as follows: Dwell time of 150 ms, DP (declustering potential) 71.0 V, EP (entrance potential) 10.0 V, CE (collision energy) 25 V, CXP (collision cell exit potential) 10 V, CUR (curtain gas) 25, CAD (collision gas) high, IS (ion spray voltage) 5000 V, TEM (turbo heater temperature) 650 °C, GS1 (nebulizing gas) 70 psi, GS2 (auxiliary gas) 50 psi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An Agilent XDB C18 column (50 × 4.6 mm, 5-m packing) was used for chromatography with the following conditions: Buffer A: de-ionized H2O + 0.1% formic acid, Buffer B: acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid; 01.5 min 3% B, 1.52.5 min gradient to 100% B, 2.53.5 min 100% B, 3.53.6 min gradient to 3% B, 3.64.5 min 3% B. Demeclocycline (transition 465.1  448.0) was used as an internal standard with the instrument settings described above with the following minor exception: DP: 41.0 V. DOX concentrations were determined in reference to a standard curve prepared by addition of DOX to 10 L of blank serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The serum was diluted with 40 L de-ionized H2O and processed with acetonitrile containing formic acid and internal standard as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A value of 3× above the signal obtained from blank plasma was designated the limit of detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limit of quantitation was defined as the lowest concentration at which back calculation yielded a concentration within 20% of theoretical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limit of quantitation for DOX was 10 ng/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, back calculation of points on the curve yielded values within 15% of theoretical over four orders of magnitude (10,00010 ng/mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histology_and_Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse tissue specimens were fixed in 4% PFA in PBS, and then were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-m sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histopathologic and phenotypic characterization of skin tumors was performed using H&E and immunohistochemistry-stained sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunohistochemical staining, paraffin-embedded sections were stained with rabbit anti-KSHV GPCR antibodies (10) and a rat monoclonal anti-CD34 antibody (Novus Biologicals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For comparisons of the means of two groups, an unpaired two-tailed t test was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparisons of multiple groups with a control group, one-way ANOVA with Dunnett method was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mouse lesion onset and survival datasets in Fig 5 and Fig S8, a log-rank test (Mantel-Cox test) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
