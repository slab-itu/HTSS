title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Germline Cas9 expression yields highly efficient genome engineering in a major worldwide disease vector, Aedes aegypti  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aedes aegypti is the principal vector of multiple arboviruses that significantly affect human health, including dengue, chikungunya, and zika.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Development of tools for efficient genome engineering in this mosquito will not only lay the foundation for the application of genetic control strategies, but will also accelerate basic research on key biological processes involved in disease transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report the development of a transgenic CRISPR approach for rapid gene disruption in this organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given their high editing efficiencies, the Cas9 strains we developed can be used to quickly generate genome modifications, allowing for high-throughput gene targeting, and can possibly facilitate the development of gene drives, thereby accelerating comprehensive functional annotation and development of innovative population control strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The development of CRISPR/Cas9 technologies has dramatically increased the accessibility and efficiency of genome editing in many organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, in vivo germline expression of Cas9 results in substantially higher activity than embryonic injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no transgenic lines expressing Cas9 have been developed for the major mosquito disease vector Aedes aegypti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe the generation of multiple stable, transgenic Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti strains expressing Cas9 in the germline, resulting in dramatic improvements in both the consistency and efficiency of genome modifications using CRISPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these strains, we disrupted numerous genes important for normal morphological development, and even generated triple mutants from a single injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also managed to increase the rates of homology-directed repair by more than an order of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the exceptional mutagenic efficiency and specificity of the Cas9 strains we engineered, they can be used for high-throughput reverse genetic screens to help functionally annotate the Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, these strains represent a step toward the development of novel population control technologies targeting Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti that rely on Cas9-based gene drives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Construction_of_a_Simple_Transgenic_CRISPR_Cas9_System_for_Ae_aegypti_Mutagenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To express Cas9 in the germline of Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti, we established transgenic mosquitoes harboring genomic sources of Cas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To promote robust expression of Cas9, we utilized promoters from six genes including AAEL010097 (Exuperentia), AAEL007097 (4-nitrophenylphosphatase), AAEL007584 (trunk), AAEL005635 (Nup50), AAEL003877 (polyubiquitin), and AAEL006511 (ubiquitin L40), due to their constitutive high levels of expression during many developmental life stages (AAEL003877, AAEL006511, AAEL005635), or high levels of expression in the ovary triggered by uptake of a blood meal (AAEL010097, AAEL007097, AAEL007584), as evidenced from previous promoter characterization experiments or developmental transcriptional profiling (5456) (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We inserted these various promoter fragments into a piggybac transposon upstream of the coding sequence for spCas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downstream to the promoter-driven Cas9 we included a self-cleaving T2A peptide and eGFP coding sequence, together serving as a visual indicator of promoter activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also included a baculovirus-derived Opie2 promoter (57) driving dsRed expression serving as a transgenesis marker (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The piggybac transgenes were injected into the germline of wild-type embryos (Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti genome sequence strain Liverpool) (58), and transgenic mosquitoes harboring these transgenes were readily identified by bright dsRed fluorescent expression in the abdomen (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We established stable transgenic strains and dissected the germline tissues from each strain to assess promoter activity, and found moderate levels of eGFP present in the 0- to 24-h postblood meal ovary of the AAEL006511-Cas9 and AAEL010097-Cas9 line, and very-weak yet detectable levels of eGFP present in lines AAEL007097-Cas9, AAEL007584-Cas9, and AAEL005635-Cas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AAEL010097-Cas9 and AAEL006511-Cas9 lines also exhibited very-weak expression in the 4-d-old testes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the AAEL003877-Cas9 line exhibited no detectable eGFP signal, consistent with previous work indicating this promoter does not express in the germline (55) (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we were able to establish homozygous stocks for each line, demonstrating that no significant toxicity is associated with high transgenic expression of Cas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Germline_Expression_of_Cas9_in_Ae_aegypti_Increases_Targeting_Efficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the efficacy of our transgenic Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti Cas9 strains, we first attempted to mutate the kynurenine hydroxylase (kh) gene (AAEL008879), which was previously characterized as having an easily detectable dominant mutant eye phenotype, as the loss of kh gene function leads to severe eye pigmentation defects (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we designed a sgRNA (Kh-sgRNA) targeting exon 4 of the kh gene, and to test its functionality we coinjected this in vitro-transcribed Kh-sgRNA into 450 wild-type embryos [referred to as generation 0 (G0)] along with purified recombinant Cas9 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following injection, complete white-eye and partial mosaic white-eye mutants were readily observed in adults (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The G0s had a survival rate of 35 ± 7% and a mutagenesis efficiency of 17 ± 3%, and a mutant heritability rate of 33 ± 7% in the G1 generation (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once we confirmed functionality of the Kh-sgRNA using purified recombinant Cas9 protein, we then injected this Kh-sgRNA separately into 450 embryos (three injections of 150 embryos in biological triplicate) collected from each of our transgenic Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti Cas9 strains without including recombinant Cas9 protein ;in the injection mix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete white-eye and mosaic white-eye mutants were readily observed in injected G0 mosquitoes from five of six lines, including AAEL010097-Cas9, AAEL007097-Cas9, AAEL007584-Cas9, AAEL005635-Cas9, and AAEL006511-Cas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, directly injecting Kh-sgRNAs into these transgenic Cas9 expression lines resulted in significantly higher G0 survival rates (61 ± 7%, 53 ± 4%, 63 ± 4%, 64 ± 6%, and 63 ± 4%, respectively), increased G0 mutagenesis efficiencies (85 ± 5%, 27 ± 6%, 52 ± 7%, 47 ± 3%, and 66 ± 4%, respectively), and increased overall heritable G1 mutation rates (60 ± 9%, 59 ± 6%, 59 ± 5%, 60 ± 6%, and 66 ± 3%, respectively) compared with when Kh-sgRNA was coinjected with recombinant Cas9 protein into wild-type embryos (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously, homozygous viable kh mutants have a dramatic eye pigmentation defect that can be visualized in larvae, pupae, and adults (31) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the phenotypic defects described above were due to mutagenesis of the kh gene, genomic DNA spanning the target site was amplified from homozygous mutant G1s (Fig 2A) and sequenced, confirming the presence of insertion/deletions (indels) in the Kh-sgRNA genomic DNA target site (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Kh-sgRNA injected directly into the AAEL003877-Cas9 strain failed to show any visible mutant phenotypes in the G0 generation, presumably due to lack of germline expression by this promoter (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that CRISPR/Cas9 targeting efficiency varies significantly between loci and even between target sites within the same locus (26, 27, 30, 36), we wanted to further investigate the efficacy of these transgenic Cas9 expressing strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore designed two additional sgRNAs targeting uncharacterized conserved genes that may be useful for developing future control methodologies Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One sgRNA (W1-sgRNA) was designed to target exon 3 of the white gene (AAEL016999) (SI Appendix, Fig S4A), which is the Aedes 1:1 ortholog to Drosophilia melanogaster white and functions as an ATP-binding cassette transporter important for red and brown eye-color pigmentation (59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another sgRNA was designed to target exon 2 of the yellow gene (AAEL006830) (SI Appendix, Fig S5A), which is the Aedes 1:1 ortholog to D. melanogaster yellow, a gene important for melanization of the cuticle (61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To initially test their functionality, we coinjected either in vitro-transcribed W-sgRNA or Y-sgRNA, separately, into 450 wild-type embryos (three injections of 150 embryos in biological triplicate), each along with purified recombinant Cas9 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following injection, complete white-eye and partial mosaic white-eye, or complete yellow-body and partial mosaic yellow-body mutants were readily observed in G0s, indicating that the sgRNAs are functional (Table 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once sgRNA functionality was confirmed using recombinant Cas9 protein, we then injected these sgRNAs separately into 450 embryos (three injections of 150 embryos in biological triplicate) collected from each of our transgenic Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti Cas9-expressing strains without including recombinant Cas9 protein in the injection mix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the Kh-sgRNA results described above, remarkably higher survival rates, mutagenesis efficiencies, and heritable mutation rates were also achieved for both W-sgRNA and Y-sgRNA when injected into all transgenic Cas9 lines, except AAEL003877-Cas9 (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in other Dipterans, homozygous G1 mutants for white have dramatic eye pigmentation defects, similar to the kh mutants, which can be visualized in larvae, pupa, and adults (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, homozygous G1 mutants for yellow have a striking yellow cuticle pigmentation defect that can be visualized in, larvae, pupae, adults, and even eggs (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the phenotypic defects from these sgRNAs were due to mutagenesis of the white and yellow genes, genomic DNA from homozygous mutant G1s (Fig 2A) was amplified spanning the target sites and sequenced confirming the presence of indels in both the W-sgRNA and Y-sgRNA genomic DNA target sites (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results indicate that the Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti transgenic Cas9 expression system that we generated can effectively express Cas9 protein, and direct injection of in vitro-transcribed sgRNAs is sufficient to rapidly disrupt function of target genes of interest and generate highly heritable mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of all of the transgenic lines, the AAEL010097-Cas9 line consistently showed the highest survival rate and efficiency of mutagenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we performed all subsequent experiments using this strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Precise_Gene_Disruption_in_Ae_aegypti  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further measure the efficacy of the AAEL010097-Cas9 line, we decided to target additional genes causing readily visible phenotypes in related organisms that have yet to be studied in Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we chose genes AAEL005793, AAEL009950, AAEL009170, and AAEL003240, which are conserved 1:1 orthologs with the D. melanogaster genes ebony, deformed, vestigial, and sine oculis, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ebony encodes the enzyme N--alanyl dopamine (NBAD) synthetase that converts dopamine to NBAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of ebony function increases black cuticle pigment in D. melanogaster (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deformed is a homeobox-containing (Hox) transcription factor, loss-of-function of this gene results in dramatic defects in derivatives of the maxillary segments, mandibular segments, and anterior segments in D. melanogaster (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vestigial encodes a nuclear protein that plays a central role in the development of the wings and loss of vestigial results in the failure of proper wing development in D. melanogaster (65, 66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sine oculis locus encodes a homeodomain-containing protein, which plays an essential role in eye development and loss of sine oculis function leads disruption of the eye disk formation in D. melanogaster (67, 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To disrupt these genes, a single sgRNA was designed (E-sgRNA, D-sgRNA, So-sgRNA, V-sgRNA) to target an exon in each of these genes (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6S9), and then individually injected into 200 AEL010097-Cas9 embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injection of E-sgRNA resulted in 82% of G0s showing pronounced dark coloration of the adult cuticle (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mutations were heritable and we established homozygous viable stocks by pairwise mating G1s (Fig 2A and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D-sgRNA injection resulted in the death of more than 72% of G0 mosquitoes before the pupal stage, indicating that this gene is critical for proper development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 87% of the mosquitoes that reached adulthood exhibited severe mutant phenotypes including an extra eye (triple eyes), mal-shaped proboscis, and even an extra maxillary palp (triple maxillary palps) (Fig 2C and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unsurprisingly, all surviving G0 mutant females failed to blood feed, preventing us from establishing homozygous mutant lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In So-sgRNA injected mosquitoes, 61% of the surviving G0s had clearly visible eye defects do to cell death in the primordium region (Fig 2D and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with the deformed mutants, we were unable to establish homozygous sine oculis mutant lines because these mutations were homozygous-lethal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, 70% of V-sgRNA-injected G0s died at the pupal stage, with many of the dead pupae showing deformed rudimentary wing appendages (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the few individuals that survived to adulthood, 75% had undeveloped wings or halteres (Fig 2E and Table 2), inhibiting their ability to fly or mate, making it impossible to establish homozygous mutant lines for this gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that the phenotypes described above were caused by disruption of the specific genes targeted by the sgRNAs (E-sgRNA, D-sgRNA, So-sgRNA, V-sgRNA), genomic DNA from the mutants (Fig 2 CE) was amplified spanning the target sites and sequenced confirming a selection of indels in both the genomic DNA target sites (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multiple_sgRNAs_Dramatically_Improve_Mutagenesis_Rates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if simultaneous injection of two sgRNAs into the embryos of the AAEL010097-Cas9 line could induce higher mutagenesis efficiencies and germline transmission rates, we designed another sgRNA (W2-sgRNA) also targeting exon 3 of the white gene (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially we tested functionality of the W2-sgRNA by coinjecting this guide with recombinant Cas9 protein into wild-type embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that this W2-sgRNA is efficient at generating mutations as 41 ± 7% of injected embryos survived to adult, 19 ± 6% of adult survivors showed the mosaic and white-eye mutant phenotypes, and 27 ± 5% G1s showed the mutant white-eye phenotype (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to results described above, directly injecting the W2-sgRNA into the embryos of the AAEL010097-Cas9 line, resulted in higher survival rates (62 ± 6%), greater mutagenesis efficiencies (67 ± 9%), and higher germline transmission rates (56 ± 9%) (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, when we coinjected W1-sgRNA (described above) and W2-sgRNA together into embryos of the AAEL010097-Cas9 line, white mutants were obtained in the G0s at an extremely higher frequency of 94 ± 3%, with a remarkable G1 transmission frequency of 96 ± 3% (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, genomic sequencing confirmed that some of the injections generated large deletions spanning the genomic distance (350 bp) between the W1-sgRNA and W2-sgRNA target sites (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that by simultaneous injection of multiple sgRNAs targeting the same gene, higher mutagenesis rates and large deletions can be readily achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Highly_Efficient_Multiplex_Gene_Disruption_from_a_Single_Injection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the laborious and time-consuming crossing required to generate Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti lines with mutations at multiple genes, we explored whether double- or triple-gene knockout strains could quickly be generated in one step by coinjecting a multiplexed combination of sgRNAs targeting different genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we made four mixes, including three combinations of two sgRNAs, including: W1-sgRNA and Y-sgRNA (mix 1); W1-sgRNA and E-sgRNA (mix 2); Y-sgRNA and E-sgRNA (mix 3); and one combination of three sgRNAs, W1-sgRNA, Y-sgRNA and E-sgRNA (mix 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We injected these four mixes separately into 200 embryos from the AAEL010097-Cas9 line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 90%, 87%, 93%, and 94% of the G0-injected survivors contained at least one mutant phenotype for the injection sets one to four, respectively (Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, 90%, 88%, and 92% of the G0 injected survivors had double-mutants when injected with sets one to three, respectively (Table 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we coinjected a combination of three sgRNA (mix 4), we found that 67% of the surviving G0 adults contained mutations in all three genes targeted (Table 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these mutations were heritable as homozygous viable mutant stocks following pairwise mating of G1 multimutants (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results demonstrate that simultaneous and heritable multiple gene disruptions can be efficiently achieved by using transgenic expression of Cas9 and this simple technique should facilitate the rapid understanding of gene function and help tease apart gene networks in this nonmodel organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Increased_Rates_of_HDR_with_dsDNA_Donors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the exceedingly high rate of NHEJ-induced mutation when using theAAEL010097-Cas9 line, we wanted to assess knock-in rates mediated by HDR via dsDNA donors in this line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our strategy was to employ two donor plasmids, a white-donor plasmid based on the W1-sgRNA and a kh-donor plasmid based on the Kh-sgRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these two donor plasmids was designed to contain a dominant fluorescent marker consisting of 3xP3-dsRed, expressing in the larvae and adult photoreceptors, flanked by 1-kb homology arms that were derived from the genomic sequence immediately flanking the target cleavage sites (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We directly compared two approaches: (i) coinjection of dsDNA donor combined with in vitro transcribed sgRNA and purified recombinant Cas9 protein into wild-type embryos; and (ii) coinjection of circular dsDNA donor combined with in vitro transcribed sgRNA injected into AAEL010097-Cas9 line embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the first approach, a total of 600 embryos were separately injected for both the white-donor and kh-donor, with a HDR rate of 0.15% and 0.14% (Table 5), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the second approach, a total of 600 embryos from the Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti AAEL010097-Cas9 line were separately injected for both the white-donor and kh-donor, with a HDR rate of 2.36% and 2.48% (Table 5), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we see a dramatic, yet consistent, 15- to 17-fold increase in rates of HDR when using the AAEL010097-Cas9 line compared with the nontransgenic method of supplying Cas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene-specific insertion of our donor cassettes into the intended target sites was confirmed by subsequent genomic PCR and sequencing (Fig 4 AC and SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies have demonstrated effective CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in the mosquito Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti (3034); however, these studies utilized a nontransgenic source of Cas9, limiting both survivorship and editing efficiencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome these previous limitations, and to reduce the complexity of injecting multiple components (i.e., Cas9 and sgRNA), herein we developed a simplified transgenic Cas9 expression system in Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti, similarly to what is routinely used in other organisms such as D. melanogaster (27, 41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, to achieve highly specific and consistent genome modifications, we demonstrate that embryos from these Cas9 strains need only be injected with easy-to-make sgRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using these Cas9 strains, we disrupted multiple genes that were either homozygous viable (kh, white, yellow, and ebony), or homozygous lethal (deformed, sine oculis, vestigial), resulting in dramatic phenotypes affecting viability, vision, flight, and blood feeding, and therefore may be useful for developing control strategies and genetic sexing techniques in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in a yellow mutant background, the endogenous gene encoding yellow could be linked to the male-determining locus (32), using CRISPR-mediated HDR, to generate a robust genetic sexing system by which male embryos/larvae/adults would be dark and female embryos/larvae/adults would be yellow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An appealing advantage of our Cas9 transgenic system is the ability to efficiently disrupt multiple genes simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated that we can efficiently generate large deletions, or even double- (yellow-white; ebony-white; yellow-ebony), or triple- (yellow-ebony-white) mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these multimutants can rapidly be generated in a single-step approach by injecting multiple sgRNAs into the embryos of the transgenic Cas9 strains, significantly reducing downstream efforts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rapid multiplex gene knockout approach will be instrumental for dissecting gene networks in this nonmodel organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the Cas9 strains were generated in the Liverpool genetic background, these strains can be introgressed into other genetic backgrounds if desired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The germline Cas9 strains developed here may also bring us one step closer to engineering an effective CRISPR/Cas9-homingbased gene drive system (47, 48) in this organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homing-based drive systems rely on HDR to convert heterozygous alleles into homozygous alleles in the germline, and have recently been successfully engineered in two Anopheline mosquito species (51, 69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these studies were fruitful at significantly biasing rates of Mendelian inheritance rates of the drive containing alleles, they were severely limited by the rapid evolution of resistance alleles generated by NHEJ, and are therefore not predicted to spread into diverse wild populations (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was hypothesized that these resistance alleles formed due to high levels of maternal deposition of Cas9 in the embryo, and by restricting Cas9 expression to the germline may subsequently increase rates of HDR and reduce rates of NHEJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to restricting expression to the germline, multiplexing of sgRNAs in the drive, and designing the drive to target a critical gene have also been proposed as innovative strategies to increase rates of HDR and reduce resistance caused by NHEJ (47, 48, 70); however, these hypotheses remain to be demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding, it will be interesting to determine if our Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti Cas9 strains, each with varying expression in the germline, will be effective in a gene drive system designed for Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would be straightforward to test in a molecularly confined safe split-gene drive design where the Cas9 and the drive are positioned at different genomic loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this split-design, the Cas9 strains we developed can be directly tested without further modification by simply genetically crossing with a split gRNA-drive component and measuring rates of inheritance (49, 7173).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the CRISPR/Cas9 transgenic system developed here is quite effective, it would be useful to have the ability to supply the sgRNAs transgenically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In D. melanogaster, polymerase-3 promoters have been utilized to express sgRNAs, and through genetic crosses with Cas9 strains mutation efficiency could be increased up to 100% (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, it should be noted, that a slight disadvantage of these Cas9 strains for some groups may result from the fact that these strains were generated in the Liverpool genetic background, which restricts genome modifications to only this background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this can easily be overcome by simply using genetics to introgress these promoter-Cas9 transgenes into other genetic backgrounds, or by generating new transgenic strains in the desired background using the plasmids generated here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, our results demonstrate that our simplified transgenic Cas9 system has improved capacity to rapidly induce highly efficient and specific targeted genome modifications, including gene disruptions, deletions, and insertions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given their high efficiencies, these Cas9 strains can be used to quickly generate genome modifications allowing for high-throughput gene targeting, thereby accelerating comprehensive functional annotation of the Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Generation_of_Ae_aegypti_Cas9_Transgenic_Lines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transgenic Ae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aegypti Cas9 mosquitoes were created by injecting 0- to 1-h-old preblastoderm-stage embryos with a mixture of piggybac vector containing the Cas9 expressing plasmid designed above (200 ng/L) and a source of piggyBac transposase [phsp-Pbac, (200 ng/L)] (7476).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
