Adult-born neurons boost odorreward association  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Odorreward association during appetitive learning is a fundamental process that requires multiple forms of plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the adult olfactory bulb, the continual production of newborn interneurons contributes to the functional plasticity of the system, placing the newcomers in a key position to participate in olfactory associative learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that adult-born neurons, but not preexisting ones, contain information about learned positive value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, specific heightening of this signal improves associative learning and odor value update and is enough in some cases to trigger behavior even without odor stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our findings show an important role of this adult-born interneuron population in odorreward association and unveil the relevance of odor value encoding at early stages of sensory processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Olfaction is an important sensory modality driving fundamental behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During odor-dependent learning, a positive value is commonly assigned to an odorant, and multiple forms of plasticity are involved when such odorreward associations are formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rodents, one of the mechanisms underlying plasticity in the olfactory bulb consists in recruiting new neurons daily throughout life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is still unknown whether adult-born neurons might participate in encoding odor value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that exposure to reward-associated odors specifically increases activity of adult-born neurons but not preexisting neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, adult-born neuron activation during rewarded odor presentation heightens discrimination learning and enhances the ability to update the odor value during reversal association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in some cases, activation of this interneuron population can trigger olfactory learning without sensory stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results show a specific involvement of adult-born neurons in facilitating odorreward association during adaptive learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult-Born_GCs_Overreact_to_Rewarded_Odors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the potential involvement of adult-born GCs in odorreward association by using a go/no-go operant conditioning paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this task, mice were trained to discriminate between a pair of stimuli: a reinforced odor associated with a water reward (positive stimulus: S+) and an unreinforced odor (negative stimulus: S) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used only difficult tasks in which mice required extended training to discriminate between the odors correctly (Fig S1A, Left) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this associative learning, we observed a simultaneous consolidation of a go response only for S+ (hits), and the appearance of no-go responses for S (correct rejections: CRs) (Fig S1A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, as we demonstrated with our odor replacement experiment, after learning, most of the animals had by default a no-go response to any stimulus different from S+ (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the S+ odor and its associated reward size (Fig S1C) became key factors to drive correct mouse performance, showing the relevance of rewarded odor perception for learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ascertain the contribution of adult-born and neonatal-born GCs in encoding odor value, they were labeled with BrdU at postnatal day (P)60 and P6, respectively; 2 mo later, a go/no-go task was conducted followed by passive odor exposure (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P60- and P6-injected mice were divided in two subgroups, the S+ group and the S group, according to the odorant to which the mice were exposed at the end of the learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all groups, performances were similar in terms of the learning rate (Fig 1C, Left) and the training blocks necessary to reach the learning criterion (85% of correct responses) (Fig 1C, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Once the task was learned, mice were passively exposed to either S+ or S without reward delivery (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediate early gene c-Fos expression was then used as a proxy for neuronal activity, and the density of BrdU-labeled cells expressing c-Fos protein was counted in the GC layer (Fig 1E, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate whether S+ or S odor exposure alters GC activation, the counted cell densities were normalized with respect to mean densities obtained from naive mice exposed to the same two odors but without previous learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid odor-specific effects, we used highly similar binary odor mixtures evoking both identical input patterns to the OB (34) and equal GC activation and odor-source approach (Fig S2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that S+ exposure significantly increased the density of adult-born GCs expressing c-Fos, compared with S exposure, when animals have previously associated S+ with the reward outcome (Fig 1E, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This differential activation was mainly due to an increase in the density of adult-born GCs activated by S+ exposure with respect to values obtained from naive mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, no difference in the density of activated neonatal-born GCs (Fig 1E, Right) or PGCs (Fig S2D) was found between the S+ and S odor-exposure groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our results show that adult-born GCs are specifically prone to react to reward-associated olfactory stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Activation_of_Adult-Born_GCs_Accelerates_Learning  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we sought to manipulate the differential activation of adult-born GCs during S+ and S odor presentation to probe whether this dissimilarity is sufficient to trigger appropriate behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we used channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to control neuronal activity exclusively in neurons born either at P60 or at P6 (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We injected a lentiviral vector encoding ChR2-YFP into the rostral migratory stream (RMS) of mice, resulting 10 wk later in comparable cohorts of light-sensitive fully mature GCs (Fig 2A and Fig S3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To stimulate these neurons in vivo, an LED (465 nm) was implanted over the OB, allowing 40-Hz light stimulation during the discrimination learning task (Fig 2B) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a first initiation task without light stimulation, controls and animals injected with ChR2 performed similarly (Fig S3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, a difficult task was conducted, with 40-Hz photoactivation delivered for 500 ms during either S+ or S presentations (S+ and S groups, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice expressing ChR2, discrimination learning was facilitated by simultaneous photoactivation of adult-born neurons with S+ but not with S presentations (Fig 2C, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected for a go/no-go task, this facilitation was reflected by an accelerated appearance of CRs during S trials (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals required fewer training blocks to learn to discriminate for both single and mixed odors when light was simultaneously provided with S+ (Fig 2C, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this change in learning rate, all groups eventually reached the same number of correct responses (last two blocks: P = 0.69, KruskalWallis test, n = 912).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this differential effect was specific to adult-born neurons, as there was no improvement in learning during photoactivation of neonatal-born neurons (Fig 2D and Fig S4 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P6-injected groups learned at comparable rates and reached a similar number of correct responses (last two blocks: P = 0.49, KruskalWallis test, n = 919).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, in previous work we showed that ChR2+ GCs born at P60 had an optical threshold to spike similar to those born at P6, and thus the two groups of neurons were activated by light with a similar regimen (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we observed that movement and discrimination times remained the same for all groups (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data showed that activating adult-born GCs specifically during rewarded odor presentation is sufficient to alter behavioral responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Mere_Activation_of_Adult-Born_GCs_Is_Sufficient_to_Trigger_Behaviors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Then, we investigated if activating adult-born GCs before reward delivery, even in the absence of an odor stimulus, was sufficient to drive appropriate behavioral responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question, 40-Hz photostimulation without odor presentation was associated with reward delivery for S+ trials but not for S trials (Fig 3A, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that GC photoactivation was sufficient to generate a reinforceable stimulus in a subgroup of P60-injected mice (three out of nine mice), whereas all P6-injected (n = 11) and control (n = 14) mice performed at the 50% chance level (Fig 3A, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This learning in the P60-injected group is again reflected by an appearance of CRs during S trials (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between groups persisted if all P60-injected mice were pooled together (Fig S6B), but variability in this group cannot be explain by ChR2-YFP+ cell density (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P60 learners still succeeded in learning the task even when the S stimulus was ambiguously photoactivated by a low-frequency stimulus (S+: 40 Hz vs. S: 10 Hz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their performance did not differ from that of the control group if the difference between GC activation during S+ and S trials was too small (40 Hz vs. 25 Hz) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a similar experiment, 40-Hz photostimulation associated with S unrewarded trials did not drive appropriate behavioral responses in any of the groups (controls: n = 8; P60: n = 9; P6: n = 12) (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that activation of adult-born GCs in association with a reward signal can drive the behavioral response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative explanation could be that GC activation is itself rewarding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, GC photostimulation without or with only a partial water reinforcement did not trigger learning (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, our data support the idea that adult-born neuron activation during rewarded odor presentation and preceding complete reward delivery might be sufficient for triggering the learning process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Adult-Born_GC_Activation_Improves_Reversal_Learning  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next asked if GC activation could differentially modify acuity in S+ or S trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, once the learning criterion was reached without photostimulation (Fig S8A), we observed that adult-born GC activation did not further improve discrimination acuity of an already established odorreward association (Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests a predominant role of adult-born GCs in the early phases of the odorreward association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To challenge this idea, animals were trained in a reversal version of the go/no-go task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice had to reverse the values associated with an odor pair that they had already learned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without light stimulation all mice reached similar learning performances (Fig 4A, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the odorant previously associated with a reward was unreinforced and vice versa (Fig 4A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, during the first few blocks of the reversal task (reset), all animals performed below the chance level, as they kept following the previous odorreward association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the adjustment to the new odorreward association was facilitated by photoactivation of adult-born neurons but not of neonatal-born neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased learning flexibility was demonstrated by those animals requiring fewer trials before switching to a go response to the newly rewarded odor (Fig S9A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full learning of the new task was also accelerated; however, the effect was smaller (Fig 4B, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this improvement in reversal learning, all groups eventually reached the same number of correct responses (last two blocks: P = 0.76, KruskalWallis test, n = 610).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were found when analyzing the number of blocks needed to reach the criterion with the new task rules (Fig 4B, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the dissociation between odor and reward outcome using an extinction protocol, in which no reward was delivered, was not affected by GC photoactivation (Fig 4C and Fig S9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reacquisition of the task after extinction was fast, indicating that the odorreward association was still partially stored (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results point to the specific involvement of adult-born GC activity in the initial positive value attribution to rewarded stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study demonstrates that in the OB the activity of adult-born GCs, but not of neonatal-born GCs, contains information about learned positive value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitant stimulation of ChR2-expressing adult-born neurons with rewarded stimulus presentation accelerates discrimination learning and improves the odor valence update that occurs during reversal learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, activation of this interneuron population, in the absence of odor stimulus, is enough to trigger reward-motivated behavior in some mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our study demonstrates that adult neurogenesis endows the olfactory system with the capacity to enhance odorreward association at early stages of sensory processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Contribution_of_Adult-Born_Neurons_in_Olfactory_Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is well established that adult-born neurons are involved in several behavioral processes (2233).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, reducing adult neurogenesis has produced mixed results, frequently not preventing odor learning (27, 28, 30, 31, 33, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, previous studies used approaches that were not completely selective and/or induce long-term ablation of adult neurogenesis, which may recruit homeostatic mechanisms and thereby introduce confounding factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an optogenetic approach, our recent study showed an immediate causal relationship between adult-born neuron activity and difficult (but not easy), odor discrimination learning (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the role of adult neurogenesis is extremely dependent on the behavioral task, as previously discussed (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how newborn neurons exactly impact the functioning of preexisting circuits is still unclear (10, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adding further complexity to this panel of adult neurogenesis-dependent behavioral responses, the present investigation describes a role of adult-born neurons in odorreward association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, we found that adult-born neurons activation can boost olfactory learning but only when it occurs during rewarded odor presentations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed that facilitated learning produced by photostimulation during S+ presentations did not modify the percentage of hits, but it was reflected by an accelerated appearance of CRs during S trials (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation of this apparent paradox may be the switch from programmed go to no-go responses observed in this task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During pretraining sessions, animals learn to exhibit by default a go response to obtain a reward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, once odor stimuli have been presented during the discrimination task, the mismatch detected between S presentation and reward outcome triggers a consolidation of a go response only for the rewarded odor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, at criterion level, S+ became the key signal, and most of the animals exhibited by default a no-go response for any other stimulus, as demonstrated with our odor-replacement experiment (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesize that adult-born neurons improve learning by facilitating the association of S+ with the reward, a process required to change the default response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the idea that adult-born GCs mostly participate in the associative learning process per se and not only in the ability to identify and distinguish between the two different odorants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although adult neurogenesis produces both GCs and PGCs, our present results indicate that PGCs are not involved in odorreward coding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As photostimulation of ChR2-positive neurons led to selective activation of GCs (32), future experiments will be required to elucidate the specific role of PGCs on associative learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, our gain-of-function approach reveals a role of adult-born GCs in odorreward association, but inhibition of GC activity would be essential to investigate their necessity for this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An inducible genetic approach for loss-of-function analysis will be required to target a large number of GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, an inhibitory opsin with higher conductance and a low-intensity level for activation will be critical to reach deeper regions of the OB using fiber optics or noninvasive illumination (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Different_Functions_for_Newly_Generated_and_Preexisting_GCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies demonstrated that predominant manipulation of preexisting GCs alters innate odor attractiveness (3), and their inactivation disrupts responses to innately aversive odors (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments therefore support the notion that preexisting GCs are typically involved in innate responses to odors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, our present findings unveil the unexpected role of adult-born neurons, but not neonatal-born neurons, in attributing early positive value to odorants that do not elicit reliable innate attraction or avoidance behavior (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this context, we propose that adult-born GCs could be more prone to participate in adaptive odor responses, while their preexisting counterparts would be dedicated to innate behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How can these functional differences between the two GC populations be explained?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have revealed distinct functional properties between adult-born and neonatal-born neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, young adult-born OB interneurons have been reported to be more excitable than preexisting ones (16) and to undergo different experience-dependent synaptic modifications (17) before losing these features once mature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, adult-generated neurons respond differently to novel odors (20) and are more prone to cell death compared with their neonatal counterparts (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, newly generated GCs were more than 10 wk old at the time the mice learned the task; therefore they had already reached their final excitability (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, it has been shown that OB adult-born neurons undergo experience-dependent plasticity long after maturation and integration, suggesting that the potential time window for plasticity of these neurons extends well into maturity (14, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the same line, we recently showed matching, robust structural plasticity in GCs and M/TCs of the OB, and computational modeling demonstrated this plasticity to be compatible with stable memory (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we have shown that mature adult-born neurons express unique features in their synaptic outputs that are distinctly sensitive to GABAB receptor modulation, leading to their escape from autoinhibition (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This last property could explain in part why photoactivation of adult-born neurons is more effective in accelerating learning than activation of preexisting ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Top-Down_Control_of_GC_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To be efficient, sensory processing requires a combination of external sensory inputs and top-down feedback provided by higher-order brain areas, which assign meaning to the sensory cue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the olfactory system, the OB is not a mere relay for olfactory information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to receiving sensory inputs from the olfactory epithelium, it receives numerous centrifugal inputs from different brain areas, such as regions of the olfactory cortex and limbic and neuromodulatory subcortical regions (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GCs are therefore perfectly located to integrate both sensory and top-down information, adapting sensory processing to the behavioral and/or internal context, which may include valence, sleep/arousal, stress, nutrition status, attention, and motivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coarse lesioning of centrifugal afferents to the OB impairs the animals ability to perform reward-associated olfactory discrimination tasks or perceptual learning (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along these lines, we recently found that olfactory associative learning promotes a selective synaptic plasticity of cortico-bulbar inputs to young adult-born GCs, resulting in the strengthening of top-down inputs (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future experiments will be required to decipher how top-down inputs could affect adult-born neuron activity during the olfactory learning process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the already identified discrepancies between the two GC subpopulations, the possibility of a unique functional connectivity within the OB circuit and/or with higher brain regions remains to be explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relevance_of_Coding_Odor_Value_at_Early_Stages_of_Information_Processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The associative features of reward outcome and the expectation following learning occur at early stages in several primary sensory cortices (4143).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the olfactory system, reward-outcome encoding has been characterized in different regions (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our present results show that odor value information is present in GC interneurons, specifically in those produced in the adult brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, light-induced activity of adult-born GCs, without odor stimulus, is enough to trigger reward-motivated behavior in a few blocks for a subgroup of animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difficulty with using GC photoactivation as the only stimulus could explain why only some animals are able to learn this task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because mere adult-born GC activation is able to drive behavioral responses, we propose that adult-born GCs could target spontaneous M/TC activity to generate relevant virtual olfactory information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then this information, instead of odor-evoked signals, could be conveyed to the cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated previously that in vivo GC 40-Hz photoactivation shapes spontaneous M/TC responses in favor of highly active M/TCs, thus enhancing the contrast between M/TC firing rates (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, as no odor stimulus was present, we hypothesized that M/TC spontaneous activity might be adjusted by anticipatory information, potentially mediated by top-down fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This anticipatory activity may thus help to produce regularity of the virtual olfactory information throughout learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, intertrial variability of this anticipatory information could also be one of the reasons why this learning is extremely difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, even if odor stimuli could be replaced in some cases by GC photoactivation to learn this task, the absence of reward cannot be replaced by light stimulation, indicating that GC activation is not itself rewarding and that a real reward is necessary to trigger this behavior (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experiments will be necessary to decipher which features of GC activity acting on M/TCs are used by downstream brain structures to trigger an adequate reward-motivated behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reward-outcome encoding in adult-born GCs, probably mediated by top-down inputs, might improve stimulus selection and information extraction, two processes required to cope with ambiguous sensory inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As proposed in other sensory modalities, odor-reward coding in adult-born neurons might change the state of the OB circuit to achieve rapid processing of olfactory stimuli during learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We and others have previously demonstrated that GC activation shapes M/TC firing, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (32, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, adult-born neurons might play a role in supporting coincident activity detection necessary to associate sensory inputs with reward values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although odor and reward are never coincident in our task, both M/TC and GC activity could be modulated in the long term by local and/or external inputs (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent results suggest the presence of strong sensory-evoked feedback projections from the anterior olfactory nucleus to the OB that mediate different brain states (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that preferential control of adult-born neurons by the top-down fibers carrying information about reward outcome could explain the differences between GC subpopulations (Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The odor-activated GCs might be endowed with a sensory experience-dependent tag that could be potentiated by top-down fibers containing reward information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned before, long-lasting GC activity could be the potential neural substrate of this tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, glomerulus-specific long-term potentiation (LTP) at GABAergic GC-M/TC synapses, requiring activity-dependent IGF1 signaling, was recently described to be essential for social memory formation in the OB (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, LTP at the synapses between centrifugal top-down fibers and adult-born GCs could be a potential mechanism capturing this sensory experience-dependent tag (13, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As was classically described for basal ganglia/midbrain dopamine neurons (48), after the association between a sensory cue and the presence of a reward, reward-predicting cues become capable of triggering reward expectation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reward signals in the adult-born GC population may be boosted by photoactivation, thereby increasing the likelihood of top-downmediated synaptic plasticity specifically in these neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further characterization of reward-signaling dynamics in the OB during the learning process as well as the top-down circuits implicated in their generation will be required to fully understand the circuit basis of olfactory-associative learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
