Paternal diet programs offspring health through sperm- and seminal plasma-specific pathways in mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parental health and diet at the time of conception determine the development and life-long disease risk of their offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the association between poor maternal diet and offspring health is well established, the underlying mechanisms linking paternal diet with offspring health are poorly defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possible programming pathways include changes in testicular and sperm epigenetic regulation and status, seminal plasma composition, and maternal reproductive tract responses regulating early embryo development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we demonstrate that paternal low-protein diet induces sperm-DNA hypomethylation in conjunction with blunted female reproductive tract embryotrophic, immunological, and vascular remodeling responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we identify sperm- and seminal plasma-specific programming effects of paternal diet with elevated offspring adiposity, metabolic dysfunction, and altered gut microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The association between poor paternal diet, perturbed embryonic development, and adult offspring ill health represents a new focus for the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains ill-defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have developed a mouse paternal low-protein diet (LPD) model to determine its impact on semen quality, maternal uterine physiology, and adult offspring health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that sperm from LPD-fed male mice displayed global hypomethylation associated with reduced testicular expression of DNA methylation and folate-cycle regulators compared with normal protein diet (NPD) fed males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, females mated with LPD males display blunted preimplantation uterine immunological, cell signaling, and vascular remodeling responses compared to controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate paternal diet impacts on offspring health through both sperm genomic (epigenetic) and seminal plasma (maternal uterine environment) mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extending our model, we defined sperm- and seminal plasma-specific effects on offspring health by combining artificial insemination with vasectomized male mating of dietary-manipulated males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All offspring derived from LPD sperm and/or seminal plasma became heavier with increased adiposity, glucose intolerance, perturbed hepatic gene expression symptomatic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and altered gut bacterial profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data provide insight into programming mechanisms linking poor paternal diet with semen quality and offspring health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paternal_LPD_Leads_to_Sperm_Global_DNA_Hypomethylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We fed male mice either a control normal protein diet (NPD 18% casein) or isocaloric low-protein diet (LPD; 9% casein) for a minimum of 8 wk (see SI Appendix, Table S1 for composition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with our previous studies (10, 11), LPD had no impact on male body weight, testis weight, or the total number of mature epididymal sperm collected (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, analysis of testicular histology revealed increased mean tubule and seminiferous epithelium area (Fig 1 AC; P  0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testes from LPD-fed males displayed reduced expression of the de novo and regulatory DNA methyltransferases Dnmt1 and Dnmt3L, respectively (Fig 1D; P = 0.023 and 0.05, respectively) and altered folate-cycle enzymes Dhfr (dihydrofolate reductase), Mthfr (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), and Mtr (methionine synthase) expression (Fig 1E; P = 0.036, 0.022, and 0.0012, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of sperm-DNA methylation status revealed LPD sperm to be comparatively hypomethylated compared with NPD sperm (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 972 hypomethylated loci in LPD sperm but only 99 hypermethylated loci (Log2 reads per million fold-change less_than0 or 1, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Dataset S1 file for all differentially methylated loci.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPD differentially methylated loci were present on all chromosomes (Fig 1F) and associated within several different classes of DNA-repetitive elements (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathway analysis identified calcium-signaling, GnRH-signaling, and apoptosis pathways to be the most enriched, with 24, 14, and 7 genes showing differentially methylated loci, respectively (P less_than 0.0001) (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, we identified differential transcript expression of several calcium-signaling, apoptosis, and metabolic regulators (Adcy5, Bcl2l1, Plcb, Prkcb, and Fto) in hearts of offspring derived from LPD-fed males (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each gene displayed differential methylation in LPD sperm (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in stud sperm, Adcy5 and Fto were the only genes with reduced expression (Fig 1I; P = 0.05 and 0.043, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we observed no impact of paternal LPD on sperm capacitation (SI Appendix, Fig S1) or seminal plasma cytokine levels (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

LPD_Semen_Blunts_Maternal_Uterine_Cytokine_and_Immunological_Responses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrated previously that paternal LPD reduced expression of multiple AMPK pathway genes in day 3.5 blastocysts (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if changes in embryonic gene expression were associated with an altered maternal uterine environment, we analyzed uterine cytokines at day 3.5 post coitus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we observed significant reductions in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in females mated with LPD-fed males (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we observed reductions in the levels of TNF, IL-1, CSF3 MIP-1, and IFN- (Fig 2 BF; P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression analysis of genes involved in the prostaglandin synthesis pathway revealed reductions in the expression of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), prostaglandin E synthase (Ptges), and thromboxane-A synthase (Tbxas1) in females mated with LPD males (Fig 2G; P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observed significant reductions in uterine expression of CD3 antigen, epsilon polypeptide (Cd3e), forkhead box P3 (Foxp3), and histocompatibility 2, class II antigen A, beta 1 (H2-Ab1) (Fig 2H; P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, analysis of uterine vascular morphology at day 3.5 post coitus revealed significant reductions in uterine blood vessel area and perimeter (Fig 2 I and J; P less_than 0.001) in females mated with LPD-fed males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sperm-_and_Seminal_Plasma-Specific_Effects_on_Offspring_Health  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results indicated paternal diet programs offspring development through both sperm (direct genomic or epigenetic effects on the embryo) and seminal plasma (perturbed maternal uterine environment) mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To define the relative sperm and seminal plasma programming contribution to offspring health, we combined artificial insemination and vasectomized male mating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated four groups of offspring mice termed NN (NPD sperm and NPD seminal plasma), LL (LPD sperm and LPD seminal plasma), NL (NPD sperm and LPD seminal plasma), and LN (LPD sperm and NPD seminal plasma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant difference in maternal gestational weight gain or gestation length, litter size, or weight at birth were observed between treatment groups (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all treatment groups, we observed that approximately one third of inseminated females did not become pregnant (as defined by sustained weight gain over the first 10 d of gestation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, only two thirds of pregnant females went on to deliver live offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both pregnancy and live birth rates were similar for all groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postnatally, LL, NL, and LN males all became significantly heavier then NN offspring from 5 wk of age and remained heavier for up to 16 wk of age (Fig 3A; P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Female offspring displayed a growth profile similar to that of the males, with the LL, NL, and LN offspring all becoming heavier than the NN females (Fig 3E; P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, LN females displayed a significantly heavier growth profile than LL females (P = 0.009).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of 15-wk-old offspring glucose tolerance revealed elevated responses in LL males and females at 30 min post bolus (P = 0.013 and 0.023, respectively); LL males, LN males, and LN females at 60 min (P = 0.04, 0.05 and 0.024, respectively); and LN males, NL males, LL females, LN females, and NL females at 120 min (P = 0.003, 0.004, 0.00, 0.001, and 0.0032, respectively) compared with NN offspring (Fig 3 B and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of mean area under the glucose tolerance test curve revealed increased responses in LL and NL males (P = 0.022 and 0.012, respectively) and females (P = 0.034 and 0.010, respectively) compared with NN offspring (Fig 3 C and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of cull (16 wk of age), male and female LL offspring displayed increased gonadal:body weight ratios compared with NN offspring (P = 0.021 and 0.046, respectively; Fig 3 D and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Increased obesity and poor glucose regulation are central markers for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we observed no impact of offspring sex on any of the NAFLD parameters measured, data for male and female offspring within each treatment group were combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liver Acetyl-CoA and serum IL-6 showed no difference between treatment groups (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NL and LN offspring displayed a reduced level of serum TNF compared with NN offspring (P = 0.011 and 0.002, respectively; Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NL and LN offspring also displayed increased hepatic expression of the central NAFLD-regulating genes adiponectin 1 receptor (Adipor1; P = 0.019 and 0.033, respectively), AKT serine/threonine kinase 2 (Akt2; P = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively), protein kinase, AMP-activated, alpha 1 catalytic subunit (Prkaa1; P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively), sirtuin 3 (Sirt3; P  0.001 for both), and sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1; P = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively) (Fig 4 DH) compared with NN offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, NL and LN offspring displayed reduced expression of the cellular tumor antigen p53 (Trp53; Fig 4I; P = 0.002 and 0.032, respectively) compared with NN offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, there were no significant differences between the LL and NN offspring for any of the genes studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, using universal primers, we observed no significant difference in mean total bacterial content between treatment groups or sexes (Fig 5 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, analysis of individual bacterial genus revealed LL males to have a higher Enterococcus profile compared with NN and NL males (P = 0.049 and 0.024, respectively; Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that LL offspring displayed higher levels of Lactobacillus compared with LN offspring (Fig 5A; P = 0.043).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of fecal Streptococcus levels revealed NN and LN males to have significantly higher profiles compared with LL and NL males (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, LL offspring displayed a significantly reduced profile of fecal Biffidobacterium compared with NL and LN offspring (Fig 5A; P = 0.041 and 0.024, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No difference in fecal Enterobacter or Bacteroides was observed between groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As only six specific bacterial groups within the total population were analyzed within the current study, further sequencing of the bacterial 16s ribosomal region would be required to determine fully how paternal diet affects offspring gut microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the association between poor paternal diet and offspring metabolic dysfunction is now established, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now show that feeding male mice an LPD results in perturbed testicular epigenetic status and globally hypomethylated sperm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in females mated with LPD males, we observe blunted uterine immunological signaling responses and vascular remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using artificial insemination with vasectomized male mating we show that offspring growth, metabolism, adiposity, and gut bacteria are programmed by paternal diet in a sperm- or seminal plasma-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, all offspring derived from either LPD sperm and/or seminal plasma developed phenotypic characteristics of metabolic dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide insights into links between poor paternal diet at the time of conception and the programming of metabolic health in his offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diets high in fat and/or protein (28% protein) have been shown to impair testicular steroidogenesis, increasing rates of apoptosis and sperm-DNA damage in rodents (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to LPD, we observed increased mean testicular seminiferous tubule and epithelium area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms underlying these changes in tubule morphology remain unknown at present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed paternal LPD perturbed testicular expression of the folate-cycle enzymes Dhfr, Mthfr, and Mtr and of the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt1, Dnmt3L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rodents, maternal LPD has been associated with elevated plasma homocysteine levels, modifying s-adenosylmethionine levels for epigenetic regulation of gene expression (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male Mthfr knockout mice display altered testicular histology, loss of germ cell number, and reduced sperm-DNA methylation profiles (15, 24), while pharmacological reduction in cellular Dnmt1/3L levels impact negatively on spermatogenesis and sperm-DNA methylation levels (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, disruption of the testicular folate cycle in LPD males may impact the provision of methyl donors for the establishment of appropriate epigenetic marks within the developing sperm, although this remains to be confirmed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the impact of paternal LPD on sperm epigenetic status, we performed global analysis of sperm-DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that sperm from LPD-fed males displayed global hypomethylation aligned within gene body locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, minimal changes in DNA methylation at promoter regions or CpG islands were detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar minimal impacts on promoter DNA methylation (as determined by MeDIP-Seq) have been observed in sperm from mice fed LPD (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, gene body methylation status was not reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sperm, DNA methylation at nonCpG-dense genebody regions has been reported and correlates positively with gene expression (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is believed to regulate gene transcription from alternative intragenic promoters (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, further studies are required to elucidate fully the impact of paternal diet on additional sperm epigenetic modifications including histone modifications (29) and RNAs (15) in addition to DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, we have shown offspring of LPD males display cardiovascular dysfunction associated with reduced cardiac expression of calcium-signaling (Adcy5, Plcb, and Prkcb), fat mass- and obesity-associated (Fto), and antiapoptotic (Bcl2l1) genes (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Adcy5, Bcl2l1, Plcb, and Fto displayed differential methylation in LPD sperm, we assessed their expression at the transcript level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Adcy5 and Fto expression were reduced in LPD sperm, no difference in Bcl2l1, Plcb, or Prkcb was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicate a nondirect association between DNA methylation and other epigenetic mechanisms in sperm (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will define further the associations between paternal diet, testicular function, and sperm epigenetic status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also observed that paternal LPD suppressed normal maternal uterine inflammatory responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following mating, deposition of seminal plasma within the female reproductive tract initiates secretion of embryotrophic and immune-modulatory cytokines as well as initiating regulatory T cell expansion and leukocyte infiltration (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption to the balance of oviductal and uterine-signaling molecules during preimplantation development has been linked to perturbed embryonic and offspring development (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed reduced uterine TNF, IL-1, IFN-, MIP-1, and CSF3 levels following mating with LPD males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-1 has been linked to embryo development with levels correlated to blastocyst cell number in humans (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uterine MIP-1 and CSF3 regulate paternal antigen-presenting cells, which are essential for uterine immune response suppression ahead of blastocyst implantation (32), while uterine natural killer cell-derived IFN- and TNF regulate the remodeling of the uterine vasculature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed significantly decreased uterine expression of Alox5, Ptgs2, Ptges, Tbxas1 genes in females mated with LPD males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALOX5 regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF (33) and IL-1 (34), while Ptges is involved in the maternal recognition of pregnancy (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations may be explained by blunted uterine inflammatory and regulatory T cell (Tregs) mediated responses post mating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation of significantly reduced uterine expression of Cd3e, Foxp3, and H2-Ab1 supports this interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H2-Ab1 is involved in the presentation of paternal antigens by dendritic cells to T cells via the T cell receptor (TCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signaling via Cd3e, a component of the TCR, results in the activation of Treg cells and the induction of Foxp3 gene transcription (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further studies are needed to characterize uterine Foxp3+ Treg cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data reveal the impact of paternal diet on both sperm epigenetic status and the preimplantation uterine environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As both mechanisms have the potential to program postfertilization development and offspring health, we define their respective impacts on adult offspring well-being.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combined artificial insemination with vasectomized male mating to generate four groups of offspring (NN, LL, NL, LN; where the first and second letters denote the diet of the sperm and seminal plasma, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All offspring generated using LPD sperm and/or seminal plasma displayed characteristics associated with metabolic syndrome including elevated adiposity, glucose intolerance, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and altered gut bacterial profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the greatest impacts on offspring phenotype occurred when the dietary origin of the sperm and seminal plasma are mismatched (NL and LN groups).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was most evident in our analysis of offspring nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAFLD is the most common form of chronic liver disease in Western societies and is characterized typically by increased levels of inflammatory markers, hepatic lipids, metabolites, and apoptosis (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed no impact of paternal diet on hepatic acetyl-CoA or serum IL-6 levels, while levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF were reduced in NL and LN offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies have shown that obese prepubescent children display lower levels of serum TNF than nonobese children (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies suggest that in younger individuals the relationship between obesity and inflammatory status may be different to that in adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As our offspring were only 16 wk of age, they may only be at an early stage of NAFLD before the chronic elevation of proinflammatory markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observed significantly increased expression of Adipor1, Akt2, Prkaa1, Sirt3, and Srebf1 in NL and LN offspring, while Tp53 was decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such patterns have been linked with obesity (38), increased hepatic fatty acid synthesis (39), and increased lipid deposition (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is increasing interest in the interaction between lifestyle, gut microbiota, and liver function (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our initial analysis of offspring gut bacterial profiles revealed significant changes in the levels of Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Biffidobacterium between groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively and individually, these bacteria are involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and bile acids (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probiotic treatment of obese children with Lactobacillus and Biffidobacterium has been shown to reduce the severity of NAFLD (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to speculate if the changes in offspring gut microbiota were established in early neonatal life or occurred in response to their perturbed metabolic status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have established seminal plasma possess its own microbiota, which can be modified by paternal high-fat diet (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the seminal microbiota can influence the maternal reproductive tract microbiota and so alter offspring gut microbiota at birth remains to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this identifies another mechanism by which paternal diet could influence the health and metabolism of offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to our previous study (10), we observed no effect of paternal LPD on weight at birth, but we did observe a significant effect on postnatal growth affecting both male and female offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One key difference between the current study and our previous studies is the use of superovulation and artificial insemination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ovarian hyperstimulation can impact negatively on embryo quality, endometrial receptivity, and perinatal outcomes (45, 46), masking or exaggerating offspring phenotypic effects in a sex-specific manner separate to other programming mechanisms, for example, paternal diet (10) and absence of seminal plasma (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study we are not able to define the potential impact of the superovulation and/or artificial insemination techniques used on offspring health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as all treatment groups were generated using the same manipulation techniques, we believe that differences in postnatal phenotype between treatment groups can be attributed to the dietary status of the male from which the sperm and/or seminal plasma originated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study provides insights into the mechanism linking paternal nutrition to the early origins of offspring health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate studies have shown that offspring metabolic health can be impaired either via sperm-specific programming of the preimplantation embryo (15, 47) or seminal plasma-specific modifications to the uterine environment (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study suggests that a mismatch in the origin of the sperm and seminal plasma between dietary treatments has a greater impact on offspring metabolic health than when both semen components originate from the same suboptimal dietary treatment group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that when both sperm and seminal plasma originate from the same dietary background, the seminal plasma-primed uterine environment is appropriate for the sperm-programmed preimplantation embryo, impacting minimally on offspring health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the seminal plasma-mediated programming of the embryo and uterus is mismatched, adaptive changes initiated within the embryo/fetus elevate metabolic disease risk in adult life (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further studies are needed to determine precisely how mismatched sperm and seminal plasma affect offspring metabolic health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We believe our study has relevance for both human- and large animal-assisted reproduction where embryos are routinely generated and develop in a seminal plasma-free environment and where embryos are transferred to a nonseminal plasma-primed uterus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an important context for this phase of our work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will, therefore, be of interest to determine in humans and large animals the extent to which a mismatch between the programming of the embryo and the optimal priming of the uterus direct the development and well-being of offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
