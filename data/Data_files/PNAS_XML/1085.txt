Early anthropogenic impact on Western Central African rainforests 2,600 y ago  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modern human societies live in strongly altered ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, anthropogenic environmental disturbances occurred long before the industrial revolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 2,600 y ago, a forestsavannah mosaic replaced dense rainforests in Western Central Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rainforest crisis was previously attributed either to the impact of climate change or, to a lesser extent, to the expansion of Bantu peoples through Central Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 10,500-y sedimentary record from Lake Barombi, Southwest Cameroon, demonstrates that the rainforest crisis was not associated with any significant hydrological change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on a detailed investigation of a regional archaeological database, we present evidence that humans altered the rainforest ecosystem and left detectable traces in the sediments deposited in Lake Barombi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A potential human footprint on Western Central African rainforests before the Common Era has become the focus of an ongoing controversy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 3,000 y ago and 2,000 y ago, regional pollen sequences indicate a replacement of mature rainforests by a forestsavannah mosaic including pioneer trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some studies suggested an anthropogenic influence on this forest fragmentation, current interpretations based on pollen data attribute the rainforest crisis to climate change toward a drier, more seasonal climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A rigorous test of this hypothesis, however, requires climate proxies independent of vegetation changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we resolve this controversy through a continuous 10,500-y record of both vegetation and hydrological changes from Lake Barombi in Southwest Cameroon based on changes in carbon and hydrogen isotope compositions of plant waxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13C-inferred vegetation changes confirm a prominent and abrupt appearance of C4 plants in the Lake Barombi catchment, at 2,600 calendar years before AD 1950 (cal y BP), followed by an equally sudden return to rainforest vegetation at 2,020 cal y BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D values from the same plant wax compounds, however, show no simultaneous hydrological change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the combination of these data with a comprehensive regional archaeological database we provide evidence that humans triggered the rainforest fragmentation 2,600 y ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that technological developments, including agricultural practices and iron metallurgy, possibly related to the large-scale Bantu expansion, significantly impacted the ecosystems before the Common Era.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Africa, 13CnC31 reflects the relative proportions of C3 and C4 plant waxes, which are produced by woody plants (trees/shrubs) and grasses, respectively (2628).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although variation in relative humidity and light exposure can result in large variability in the 13C values of C3 plants (28, 29), changes in 13CnC31 values in Lake Barombi sediments are positively correlated with the relative proportion of grass pollen and support their use to reconstruct the vegetation cover (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During most of the Holocene 13CnC31 remained stable, with values around 34 typical for an undisturbed, mature rainforest (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a major excursion toward higher 13CnC31 values (up to 29) occurred between 2,600 cal y BP and 2,020 cal y BP (age uncertainties lower than 200 y at 95% confidence level).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a time span of probably less than 100 y, the lake catchment experienced a significant increase in C4 plant cover mimicking the peak of grasses identified at lower resolution from pollen data (3) and bulk sediment 13C data (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our chronology indicates that the LHRC at Lake Barombi lasted 600 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its inception and duration were 300 y younger and 400 y shorter than previously proposed (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that the LHRC at Lake Barombi was strongly amplified in the sedimentary record due to the high sensitivity of this small lake catchment to local vegetation changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, 13CnC31 fell back to low values, although slightly higher than pre-LHRC values, suggesting that the rainforest recovered, but never reached the maturity levels of the early and middle Holocene (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, toward the present day, 13CnC31 values record an increasing trend starting at 500 cal y BP, which peaked during the last three decades, coeval with the recent acceleration of agriculture and deforestation in the lake catchment (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to 13C, which is a proxy indicator for vegetation, DnC31 values primarily record changes in the hydrogen isotope composition of precipitation (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable isotope ratios in meteoric water in southwestern Cameroon are controlled by the amount of precipitation and the recycling of continental moisture (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On decadal timescales, the D values of sedimentary plant waxes generally covary with the instrumental record of mean annual precipitation in West and Central Africa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34 and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, DnC31 values can be modified by changes in evapotranspiration, amplifying isotopic change during aridification (31), as well as by different isotope fractionations associated with the changing vegetation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter effect can be accounted for using 13CnC31 (3539) (see SI Appendix for more information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the resulting vegetation correction of DnC31 is rather small (of up to 5) and has little influence on the hydroclimate signal (see DnC31corr in Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the plant wax record, we detect the wettest conditions (lowest DnC31corr) between 10,500 cal y BP and 7,000 cal y BP, followed by an uninterrupted, gradual drying trend lasting until 2,000 cal y BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this, the hydrology stabilized until the present day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Lake Barombi plant wax record indicates a D enrichment during the Holocene interpreted as a drying signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No such drying trend was evident from former pollen-based precipitation reconstructions from this site (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This low-frequency variability suggests a dominant control of the Northern Hemisphere summer insolation on the isotopic composition of monsoon precipitation at orbital timescales (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing of the drying at Lake Barombi differs from that at Lake Bosumtwi (6° 30´ N) in West Africa, which recorded a reduction in precipitation from 9,000 cal y BP to 5,500 cal y BP, suggesting a regionally variable precipitation response to solar radiation (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the Lake Barombi area, modern precipitation reaches 2,500 mmy1, which is sufficient to enable rainforest growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the vegetation remained relatively insensitive to the drying trend during the Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although late Holocene drier conditions led to increasing sensitivity to disturbances and a sustained switch from forest to savannah at the periphery of the former rainforest (15, 44, 45), the absence of any coeval drying (i.e., increase in DnC31corr) during the LHRC at Lake Barombi combined with the rapid regeneration of rainforest after 2,020 cal y BP does not support the primary climatic control on the LHRC that was previously proposed (36, 10, 13, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional evidence for the absence of any abrupt climatic change comes from the SST record of the nearby marine core MD03-2707 (41) (Fig 2E and SI Appendix), since SST changes have been proposed as a potential trigger of a change in the seasonality of precipitationthat did not necessarily involve a change in the annual amount of precipitationleading to the LHRC (3, 5, 6, 13, 19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High temperatures of 30°C occurred from 9,800 cal y BP to 5,600 cal y BP, followed by a progressive decrease to values of 27.5 °C at 200 cal y BP in close agreement with the modern mean SST value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the drying trend started 1,500 y earlier than SST cooling, probably related to either different sensitivities of these records or spatial disparities between the integration areas of those signals, both climate proxies exhibit similar patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this regional reference SST record, we are unable to detect any evidence for an abrupt SST change in the Gulf of Guinea associated with the LHRC, ruling out an oceanic control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, marine records from the region do not show change in the hydrology at the time of the LHRC (41, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further indications for limited hydrological change (including change in precipitation seasonality) during the LHRC are presented in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results call for a reappraisal of the anthropogenic hypothesis (2, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To support this hypothesis, we reconstructed the temporal patterns of population dynamics and cultural change in WCA using a newly compiled database of 460 archaeological sites and 1,202 14C dates covering the last 10,500 y derived from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47 (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4; see SI Appendix for detailed information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before 4,000 cal y BP, dated archaeological sites were scarce and disparate in the study area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, coeval with the onset of the LHRC at Lake Barombi at 2,600 cal y BP, the number of dated archaeological sites increased abruptly (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the summed probability distribution (SPD) of calibrated 14C dates from this database (Fig 4C), we inferred a significant change (at 95% confidence level) in the archaeological record, highlighting a major positive deviation in population dynamics that occurred during the LHRC and that may be related to the Bantu expansion in WCA (7, 13, 19, 4850).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from 3,000 cal y BP, sedentary Neolithic populations making pottery and carrying out pit features settled in WCA (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 2,400 cal y BP, these populations began to cultivate pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), a C4 crop; perform iron metallurgy; and use oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The termination of the Lake Barombi LHRC at 2,000 cal y BP was synchronous with the disappearance of pearl millet in the archaeological record of WCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, from 2,000 cal y BP to 1,200 cal y BP, iron metallurgy as well as the use of oil palm culminated in WCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This period also coincided with the second significant positive deviation in the archaeological record, which may have ended in a major demise of the population (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13 and Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We note that the inception of the LHRC as recorded at Lake Barombi occurred 200 y earlier than the apparent establishment of technological developments in the whole of WCA (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in timing might either reflect chronological uncertainties or be an evidence of diffusion of people and/or technological developments related to the initial stage of the supposed expansion of Bantu-speaking peoples in WCA (51, 52) and associated disturbances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On a local scale, our data suggest that humans practiced land clearing in the Lake Barombi basin during a major positive deviation in population dynamics associated with technological developments occurring at a regional scale that resulted in a local rainforest decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent abandonment of the catchment or switch to agricultural practices with reduced impacts on vegetation could have fostered the regeneration of the rainforest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although humans probably triggered the LHRC in WCA, climate might have had an indirect role: In the drier regions north of the rainforest, concurrent late Holocene drying coupled with land degradation (56) may have encouraged populations to migrate southward, disseminating new technological developments into the rainforest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results provide additional temporal and causal constraints on the current models of Bantu expansionbased on human genetic and linguistic phylogenies (19, 50, 57)suggesting that the LHRC was the consequence rather than the cause of human dispersal in Central Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

This section presents the site description and a summary of methods, with full details provided in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Site_and_Regional_Climate  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lake Barombi is a 4.2-km2, 105-m-deep, and circular (diameter of 2,300 m) lake filling a volcanic maar crater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is located 334 m above sea level, 35 km to the northeast of Mt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cameroon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is an oligotrophic freshwater open lake overflowing into the Kumba River.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lake surface temperatures range from 26.7 °C to 29.5 °C (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below 20 m the lake develops an anoxic hypolimnia (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Barombi maar is a polygenetic structure that formed through three eruptive cycles between 510 kya and 80 kya (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phreatomagmatic explosions west of the Barombi maar resulted in the formation of an adjacent maar crater (59), which comprises most of the lake catchment area (10.4 km2) and is drained by a network of small perennial rivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lake occupies the Barombi maar to the east, which is bowl shaped with steep slopes and a flat bottom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The local vegetation comprises lowland evergreen rainforest with patches of semideciduous forest (3, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A forest reserve was created in 1940 to protect the vegetation in the vicinity of the lake (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since 30 y ago human impact related to farming and deforestation in the lake catchment strongly accelerated (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The farming practice relies on mixed crops such as cocoyam, plantain, and maize and monocrop systems such as cocoa, oil palm, and rubber (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional climate is controlled by the seasonal variability of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and its associated rain belt, which brings monsoonal precipitation from March to October.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean annual rainfall at Kumba (town bordering the Lake Barombi catchment) is 2,500 mmy1, with monthly precipitation less than 100 mmmo1 during 34 mo and a mean monthly temperature of 27 ± 2 °C (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sediment_Core  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In January 2014 core B14 was collected in the deepest (105 m deep) and central part of Lake Barombi from a UWITEC hybrid floating platform using a UWITEC percussion piston coring system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on previous studies of the Lake Barombi sediments (3, 30, 64, 65) we focused our analyses on the first 12 m of sediments, which represent the Holocene Epoch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A continuous 11.71-m-long composite sequence was constructed from holes B14-2 and B14-5 after core splitting based on lithological features (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Event deposits (turbidites and tephras) were excised from the original composite depth scale, resulting in an event-free 9.94-m-long depth scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on 21 210Pb dates and 35 14C dates (SI Appendix, Tables S1S3) we generated an age model for the Lake Barombi event-free sediment record (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3) using Bayesian approaches, as implemented in the freely available R statistical computing package Bacon v2.2 (66, 67) and using the Southern Hemisphere calibration curve SHCal13 (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_and_Isotopic_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Core B14 was sampled continuously with contiguous 1-cm slabs for the topmost 25 cm of the sequence and contiguous 5-cm slabs for the rest of the sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Components of terrestrial plant waxes were extracted from freeze-dried lacustrine sediments using an accelerated solvent extractor with a dichloromethane/methanol mixture of 9:1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The n-alkanes were isolated over a solid phase extraction on silica gel and then purified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry using a flame ionization detector and quantified by comparison with an internal standard and standard mixtures of n-C10-n-C40 alkanes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios (SI Appendix, Fig S4) were measured using gas chromatography coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer, using a combustion interface (for 13C) and a pyrolysis furnace (for D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon and hydrogen isotope values were corrected based on values of isotopic standards and are reported on the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite and Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water scales, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
