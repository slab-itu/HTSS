Increased nitrous oxide emissions from Arctic peatlands after permafrost thaw  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Arctic is warming rapidly, causing permafrost soils to thaw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vast stocks of nitrogen (67 billion tons) in the permafrost, accumulated thousands of years ago, could now become available for decomposition, leading to the release of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N2O is a strong greenhouse gas, almost 300 times more powerful than CO2 for warming the climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although carbon dynamics in the Arctic are well studied, the fact that Arctic soils store enormous amounts of nitrogen has received little attention so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that the Arctic may become a substantial source of N2O when the permafrost thaws, and that N2O emissions could occur from surfaces covering almost one-fourth of the entire Arctic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Permafrost in the Arctic is thawing, exposing large carbon and nitrogen stocks for decomposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gaseous carbon release from Arctic soils due to permafrost thawing is known to be substantial, but growing evidence suggests that Arctic soils may also be relevant sources of nitrous oxide (N2O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that N2O emissions from subarctic peatlands increase as the permafrost thaws.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, the highest postthaw emissions occurred from bare peat surfaces, a typical landform in permafrost peatlands, where permafrost thaw caused a fivefold increase in emissions (0.56 ± 0.11 vs. 2.81 ± 0.6 mg N2O m2 d1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These emission rates match those from tropical forest soils, the worlds largest natural terrestrial N2O source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of vegetation, known to limit N2O emissions in tundra, did decrease (by 90%) but did not prevent thaw-induced N2O release, whereas waterlogged conditions suppressed the emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that regions with high probability for N2O emissions cover one-fourth of the Arctic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results imply that the Arctic N2O budget will depend strongly on moisture changes, and that a gradual deepening of the active layer will create a strong noncarbon climate change feedback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
N2O_Fluxes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During thawing of the active layer, before the permafrost table was reached, all mesocosms released N2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest emissions occurred from bare mesocosms under the dry scenario (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These emissions matched in situ N2O fluxes measured from bare patches in subarctic peatlands, where the absence of vascular plants increases the N available for microbial processes (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thawing of permafrost caused a fivefold increase in N2O emissions from these bare, dry mesocosms compared with levels measured during active layer thawing (mean ± SE, 0.56 ± 0.11 vs. 2.81 ± 0.6 mg of N2O m2 d1; P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The postthaw emissions matched in situ fluxes from tropical forest soils (20), the largest terrestrial N2O source (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluxes from vegetated mesocosm were smaller, but thawing of permafrost almost doubled the emissions from vegetated, dry mesocosms as well (0.14 ± 0.01 vs. 0.20 ± 0.03 mg of N2O m2 d1; P = 0.034) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 and 2 and SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high postthaw N2O emissions persisted for several weeks after initiation of thawing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This significant increase in N2O emissions under simulated in situ conditions indicates the potential for a substantial noncarbon feedback to the climate when permafrost thaws.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this thaw-induced N2O pulse occurred only in the dry scenario, whereas peatland collapse, simulated by a raised water table in the wet scenario, did not result in obvious emission peaks (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that relatively dry conditions (water-filled pore space 5585%; SI Appendix, Fig S6), associated with gradual active layer deepening, trigger substantial postthaw N2O release, whereas high N2O emissions are unlikely to occur when the permafrost peatland collapses completely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of postthaw N2O release from vegetated surfaces is important, because these surfaces cover much larger areas in the Arctic than bare peat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Soil_Processes_Regulating_N2O_Emissions_to_the_Atmosphere  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The escape of N2O to the atmosphere after permafrost thaw can be attributed to two processes (13) (SI Appendix, Fig S5): direct release of (old) N2O, trapped during permafrost aggradation, and microbial production of N2O by nitrification (aerobic oxidation of NH4+ to NO3) or denitrification (anaerobic respiration using NO3 as an electron acceptor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production of N2O depends on the supply of the mineral N species NH4+ and NO3, either by direct release from permafrost or through postthaw organic matter mineralization and nitrification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the amount of net atmospheric N2O release will strongly depend on the reduction of N2O to dinitrogen (N2) during denitrification, a process that reduces the amount of N escaping from the soil as N2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain insight into these soil processes triggering the postthaw N2O release, we complemented our flux observations with detailed measurements of N2O, NO3, and NH4+ throughout the peat profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the dry mesocosms, peak emissions after permafrost thaw were preceded by an immediate accumulation of N2O in the deeper soil layers (bare, up to 160 ppm vs. the atmospheric concentration of 0.3 ppm; Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Tables S7 and S8), where moisture conditions (water-filled pore space 90%; SI Appendix, Table S2) were favorable for N2O production via denitrification (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N2O also accumulated within the wet mesocosms, especially in the lower active layer (40 cm; bare, up to 836 ppm; Fig 3A), and at the active layerpermafrost interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After permafrost thaw, however, gas concentrations in the active layer of the wet mesocosms were close to ambient, indicating effective N2O to N2 reduction during upward diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, complete denitrification likely explains the absence of emission peaks under wet conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that despite the large N2O production potential and availability of mineral N forms in thawing permafrost, observed in other studies as well (15, 2224), the emissions to the atmosphere can still be negligible when the active layer is water-saturated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Toward explaining the origin of the N2O, our data suggest that direct release of old N2O or nutrients from permafrost plays a role, given that high emission pulses occurred directly after thawing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, SOM mineralization from freshly thawed soil (24) seemed to be the key in providing an N source for N2O producers in peat; after thawing the permafrost, NH4+ accumulated at the active layerpermafrost interface (Fig 3B), indicating sustained mineralization until the end of the experiment, thereby demonstrating the potential for longer-term N2O emissions after permafrost thaws.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NO3 pool showed only minor changes (Fig 3C), indicating rapid turnover and consumption of NO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dry mesocosms displayed a larger nutrient accumulation than the wet ones (Fig 3 B and C), owing to oxygen-limited nitrification and mineralization processes under wet conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hyperspectral imaging of two intact mesocosms (bare and vegetated), coupled with peat quality analyses, add support to the foregoing conclusions above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The image analysis identified a complex stratified structure of the peat profile (Fig 4) typical of uplifted permafrost peatlands (25), reflecting the peatland transition from wet fen to uplifted permafrost bog.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower half of the profile consisted of minerotrophic fen peat, with a high potential for N2O release (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the permafrost part displayed by far the highest concentrations of dissolved N (SI Appendix, Fig S11 and Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the course of the experiment, the highest N2O pulses were observed when these layers thawed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, N2O peaks also occurred when thawing the surface soil (Fig 1), demonstrating a high potential for N2O production in the active layer as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analysis using linear mixed-effects models indicated that N2O production in the active layer might have added to the postthaw N2O release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentrations of N2O and NH4+ in the active layer and permafrost, as well as their interactions, were identified as significant model components explaining the N2O release (SI Appendix, Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the highest and most sustained N2O release was observed only after the permafrost part was completely thawed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Role_of_Soil_Moisture_and_Vegetation_in_Regulating_Arctic_N2O_Emissions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Undoubtedly, SOM quality is an important factor underlying N2O release from thawing permafrost peatlands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even if soil quality is optimal, moisture conditions at times of permafrost thaw crucially govern the rates of N2O emitted from tundra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether Arctic soils become wetter or drier following permafrost thaw depends largely on local hydrology and drainage conditions (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporating such postthaw landscape changes into ecosystem models still causes large uncertainties in the projections on the future C balance (9); however, it is known that even areas facing abrupt thaw and ground subsidence, initially leading to water-saturated soil conditions, often show improved drainage in the long term (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings imply that thawing of permafrost causes a considerable release of N2O under drier conditions when oxygen is sufficiently available for mineralization and nitrification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions prevail in permafrost peatlands, where the active layer is gradually deepening, but also in previously inundated peatlands, where permafrost thaw promotes drainage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Field studies show that the presence of vegetation reduces N2O emissions (1618), also observed here, by lowering the mineral N supply in the rooting zone of vascular plants (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, it is surprising that only a sparse vegetation cover so effectively reduced N2O release even after thawing the permafrost layer (Fig 1), located at 65 cm depth, since differences in peat quality and moisture content between bare and vegetated mesocosms were minor (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S6 and Tables S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, not only plant uptake, but also microbial N immobilization, seemed to limit the available substrate for N2O production in vegetated mesocosms (SI Appendix, Fig S11), indicating the importance of the rhizosphere in regulating microbial functioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although N immobilization was most pronounced in the top soil layer, the permafrost also displayed large microbial N pools (SI Appendix, Fig S11), suggesting that leaching from the top soil enhanced N immobilization at depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the presence of vegetation decreased, but did not prevent, thawing-induced N2O releasea mechanism that requires further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Potential_Pan-Arctic_N2O_Emissions_from_Thawing_Permafrost  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the spatial relevance of postthaw N2O emissions, we produced a vulnerability map of the Arctic regions most prone to N2O emissions from thawing permafrost (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this study and previous work on Arctic N2O emissions (1618) show that high N2O emissions occur particularly from N-rich soil deposits, such as peatlands, or soils with a disrupted vegetation cover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vegetation growth is disrupted particularly in thermokarst-affected soils, where the exposure of old permafrost N stocks and coexisting aerobic and anaerobic microhabitats also create favorable conditions for N2O production (14) and release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our geographic information system (GIS)-based approach revealed that areas with a high abundance of peatlands (15%) and landscapes vulnerable for thermokarst (30%) cover as much as one-fourth of the northern circumpolar permafrost region (SI Appendix, Table S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peatlands affected by thermokarst, the most probable Arctic N2O hot spots, cover more than 10% of the Arctic, corresponding to an area of 1.9 million km2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We refrain from presenting a pan-Arctic N2O emission budget, owing to uncertainties associated with the abundance of bare soils, wet vs. dry peatlands, and deep soil N stocks in the Arctic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, N2O emissions from bare soils in permafrost peatlands have been estimated to presently be as high as 0.1 Tg N y1 (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With increasing postthaw emissions from bare as well as vegetated surfaces, future pan-Arctic N2O emissions likely exceed this estimate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a global scale, this puts Arctic N2O emissions from thawing permafrost in the range of emissions from fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, and biomass burning, the second-largest anthropogenic N2O sources after agriculture (12, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relevance_of_Results_and_Long-Term_Implications_for_Future_N2O_Release_from_Permafrost  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With the current active layer deepening of 1 cm y1 in northern Scandinavia (30), thawing of the upper 15 cm of permafrost in a typical permafrost peatland provides a realistic near-term estimate for future N2O release under different thawing scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observed fluxes cannot be taken as the N2O release of one growing season with increased thaw depth; rather, thawing the upper 15 cm of permafrost would take 15 y under in situ conditions, and warming of the soil column would occur more gradually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As our results show, however, only part of the released N2O was trapped N2O directly released from permafrost, whereas organic matter mineralization at the active layerpermafrost interface continuously stimulated N2O production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, gradual thawing of permafrost, even at rates of 1 cm y1, and subsequent warming of the soil would provide a sustained N source, continuously fueling N2O production at depth for decades or even centuries, depending on the thickness of the organic layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This potential for long-term persistence in N2O production may be a unique property of permafrost peatlands, not sufficiently acknowledged so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results suggest that the magnitude of future N2O emissions depends mainly on landscape changes that alter soil moisture conditions, as well as on changes in vegetation coverage and growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports indicate a browning trend for the Arctic (31), seemingly reversing the enhanced plant growth referred to as Arctic greening predicted by the majority of carbon models (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arctic browning, triggered by factors such as winter warming, extreme weather events, tundra fires, and thermokarst development (31), may be an important driver promoting Arctic N2O emissions in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, our results show that N2O emissions in the Arctic are likely substantial and underestimated at present, and show high potential to increase with permafrost thaw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we present strong evidence for a substantial thawing-induced N2O release from Arctic peatlands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that vegetated peat soils may turn from a negligible to a small but significant N2O source, with significant implications for pan-Arctic emission budgets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the positive climate change feedback of N2O will be stronger under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because N2O has an almost 300 times stronger global warming potential than CO2 on a 100-y time horizon (12), a postthaw N2O release would further enhance the radiative forcing stemming from C gases (8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peat mesocosms for this study were collected from a palsa mire (68°89N, 21°05E; SI Appendix, Fig S1) located in the subarctic permafrost zone in Finnish Lapland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Underlain by discontinuous permafrost, the palsa complex was uplifted by frost heave 3 m above the surrounding mire area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vegetation cover on the palsa surface is dominated by dwarf shrubs and herbaceous plants, such as Empetrum nigrum subsp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hermaphroditum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea L., Betula nana L., Rubus chamaemorus L., lichens, and mosses (e.g., Dicranum spp., Polytrichum spp., Pleurozium spp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in the wetter areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patches of bare peat, naturally free of vascular plants, are scattered among the vegetated areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More details are provided in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sampling_and_Transport_of_Peat_Mesocoms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We sampled 16 intact peat mesocosms from vegetated and naturally bare (absent of vascular plants) parts of the palsa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A steel corer (1 m length) with a removable steel cap was hammered into the soil using a pneumatic drill (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The soil cores were collected within plastic tubes (polypropylene, 10 cm diameter; SI Appendix, Fig S3), which were inserted into the steel corer before drilling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A chain connected to a pulley and tripod was used to retrieve the peat cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sampling occurred at maximum seasonal thaw depth at the end of September 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peat cores were frozen immediately after sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Great care was taken to keep the cores frozen at gentle minus temperatures (5 °C minimum) at all times during the transport and the 5-mo preincubation period (= artificial winter), until the start of the experiment in March 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of mesocosm collection are provided in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Climate_Chamber_Setup_and_Replication  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cores were set up in a climate-controlled chamber (BDR16 Reach-in plant growth chamber; Conviron, Winnipeg, Canada), providing constant humidity and air temperature (+10 °C) and the ability to regulate the light level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simulate thawing, we placed the mesocosms in two replicate saltwater baths (water temperature 3 to 4 °C), and sequentially thawed the peat mesocosms from top to bottom, by gradually lowering the saltwater level, during six thawing stages (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One-half of the cores from vegetated and bare parts of the palsa were left under natural soil moisture conditions, and the water table level of the other half of the cores was artificially raised to 510 cm below the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four treatments that we used in this study, each with four replicates, are referred to as dry bare (DB), dry vegetated (DV), wet bare (WB), and wet vegetated (WV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details are provided in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

N2O_Fluxes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For gas flux measurements, the peat mesocosms were permanently covered with 6-mm transparent Plexiglas chambers (diameter, 120 mm; height, 250 mm; volume, 2.8 L), fixed around the plastic tubes with the peat monoliths with two rubber rings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A layer of distilled water on top of the rubber rings further ensured the gas tightness of the chambers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N2O samples were taken manually two to three times per week from each mesocosm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More information is provided in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Soil_Profile_Concentration_of_N2O  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the concentration of N2O along the soil profile, we installed five soil gas collectors horizontally in each core at the following depths: 5, 20, and 40 cm below the soil surface; 10 cm above the measured thaw depth (55 cm); and 5 cm below the measured thaw depth (70 cm) (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nutrient_Profile_in_Soil_Pore_Water  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For soil water sampling, we used Rhizon pore water samplers (Rhizosphere, Wageningen, The Netherlands) installed at depths of 510 cm, 3540 cm below the surface, and 05 cm below the maximum seasonal thaw depth (6570 cm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amounts of NO3 and NH4+ in the pore water were determined using spectrophotometric methods, as described in detail in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
