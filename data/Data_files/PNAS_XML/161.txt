First structure of full-length mammalian phenylalanine hydroxylase reveals the architecture of an autoinhibited tetramer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phenylketonuria and milder hyperphenylalaninemias constitute the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism, usually caused by defective phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a highly restricted diet prevents intellectual impairment during development, additional therapies are required to combat cognitive dysfunction, executive dysfunction, and psychiatric disorders that arise due to dietary lapses throughout life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New therapies can arise from thorough understanding of the conformational space available to full-length PAH, which has defied crystal structure determination for decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present the first X-ray crystal structure of full-length PAH, whose solution relevance is supported by small-angle X-ray scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current structure is an autoinhibited tetramer; the scattering data support the existence of an architecturally distinct tetramer that is stabilized by the allosteric activator phenylalanine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Improved understanding of the relationship among structure, dynamics, and function for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) can lead to needed new therapies for phenylketonuria, the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PAH is a multidomain homo-multimeric protein whose conformation and multimerization properties respond to allosteric activation by the substrate phenylalanine (Phe); the allosteric regulation is necessary to maintain Phe below neurotoxic levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recently introduced model for allosteric regulation of PAH involves major domain motions and architecturally distinct PAH tetramers [Jaffe EK, Stith L, Lawrence SH, Andrake M, Dunbrack RL, Jr (2013) Arch Biochem Biophys 530(2):7382].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we present, to our knowledge, the first X-ray crystal structure for a full-length mammalian (rat) PAH in an autoinhibited conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatographic isolation of a monodisperse tetrameric PAH, in the absence of Phe, facilitated determination of the 2.9 Å crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of full-length PAH supersedes a composite homology model that had been used extensively to rationalize phenylketonuria genotypephenotype relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) confirms that this tetramer, which dominates in the absence of Phe, is different from a Phe-stabilized allosterically activated PAH tetramer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of structural detail for activated PAH remains a barrier to complete understanding of phenylketonuria genotypephenotype relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the use of SAXS and X-ray crystallography together to inspect PAH structure provides, to our knowledge, the first complete view of the enzyme in a tetrameric form that was not possible with prior partial crystal structures, and facilitates interpretation of a wealth of biochemical and structural data that was hitherto impossible to evaluate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

PAH_Crystal_Structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study focuses on rat PAH, which is 96% similar (92% identical) to the human enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 15 most common disease-associated amino acids are fully conserved between rat and human, making the rodent protein an excellent model system for study of PKU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rat PAH, heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified via phenyl-Sepharose affinity chromatography (15), can be further fractionated on an ion-exchange column to partially resolve two tetrameric species (faster migrating and slower migrating) and one dimeric species, as determined by native PAGE (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fractionated PAH samples, the distribution of these species is stable over long time courses, suggesting that these fractions are good starting points for crystallization trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The faster-migrating tetramer is the predominant component in these preparations (12), and using the fraction most enriched in this species, we were able to produce well-diffracting crystals that yielded a 2.9 Å structure (Fig 1B and Table S2), to our knowledge, the first structure for any full-length mammalian PAH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full-length structure and the previously used composite homology model are compared in Fig 1C [with the caveat that the composite model combined a two-domain rat PAH structure (regulatory plus catalytic) with a two-domain human PAH structure (catalytic plus multimerization) (6, 14, 16), whereas the three-domain crystal structure is rat PAH].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The crystal asymmetric unit contains one tetramer, which adopts an autoinhibited form in which the autoregulatory region partially occludes the enzyme active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous electron density can be observed for residues 20136 and 143450 within each of the four protomers in the tetramer (with some variation at each termini), as well as for one iron ion per chain and two waters at the active site of each chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catalytic domains of the four protomers are arranged in approximate 222 symmetry, where each catalytic domain occupies one corner of a rectangle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrangement can be described as a dimer-of-dimers, where the dimers with the greatest buried surface area lie along the short edge of the rectangle (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although each short-edge dimer (the BD dimer or the AC dimer) is intimately assembled, the spacing between these two dimers is large, resulting in very little dimerdimer interaction along the long edge of the tetramer, and hence a rectangular rather than square arrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ACT domains extend above and below the plane of this rectangle (Fig 1B, Bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four C-terminal multimerization domains contain -helices that assemble into an antiparallel bundle in the center of this tetrameric arrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catalytic domain of each protomer contains an active site that is partly occluded by the autoregulatory region and a partially disordered active-site lid (residues 130150).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformations of the catalytic and regulatory domains of the four protomers are highly similar, with RMS deviations of 0.3 Å across C atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal helices of the four protomers adopt two distinct orientations with respect to the catalytic domain, differing by a tilt of 10° (Fig 1C); protomers situated across the diagonal of the tetramer contain similarly positioned helices (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1C and 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This asymmetry is unexpectedly different from the tetramer apparent in the two-domain human PAH structure, where similarly positioned helices are within each short-edge dimer (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the C-terminal helices form a four-helix bundle in the center of the PAH tetramer, these differences in their positions give rise to asymmetry and cause the architecture of the tetramer to twist and deviate significantly from the bona fide 222 symmetry found in the two-domain tyrosine hydroxylase structure (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The short-edge dimers form extensive interfaces (buried areas of 6,512 and 7,033 Å2 for the BC and AD dimers, respectively) between the catalytic domain of one subunit and the regulatory domain of the adjacent subunit; this interface also includes that portion of the multimerization domain that precedes the C-terminal helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the short-edge dimer interface involves 8 aa whose substitutions are disease-associated, including three of the most common PKU-associated variants, I65T, R68S, and R413P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The twist between the short-edge dimers means that the other dimers (long-face and diagonal) interact predominantly through the C-terminal helices and are characterized by significantly smaller buried interfaces [the long-edge (AB and CD) and the diagonal (BC and AD) dimers bury 1,412, 766, 435, and 258 Å2, respectively].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This twist also causes the distance between the ACT domains to differ on the two faces of the tetramer; the ends of the C-terminal helices extend toward this space between the ACT domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the chains are ordered all of the way to their most C-terminal residue, but the helices on the side of the tetramer with the closer ACT spacing contain more order (the C-terminal three and four residues are disordered on chains A and D, respectively, whereas the C-terminal six residues are disordered on chains B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in the two-domain human PAH structure (2PAH), the C-terminal helices are fully ordered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the twist between the short-edge dimers in the structure of full-length PAH is accompanied by a shift in the environment at the ends of C-terminal helices that no longer favors ordered packing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The C-terminal helices form an antiparallel four-helix bundle that is the central point of tetramer association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These helices are conformationally flexible, which is evident in the nonisomorphism we observe among multiple PAH crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have partially refined two additional structures for full-length PAH at lower resolution, using crystals grown under essentially identical conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these structures, the position of the C-terminal helix varies, changing the relative positions of the two dimers within the tetramer (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If one superposes all B subunits, the BD short-edge dimers align well, but different twists about the C-terminal helices cause positions of the AC dimers to vary by as much as 7 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unusual level of flexibility in the PAH four-helix bundle may be responsible for some of the enzymes unusual kinetic characteristics, which caused us to initially identify it as a putative morpheein (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PAH_Active-Site_Access  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two structural elements govern PAH active-site access, the autoregulatory region and the active-site lid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our PAH structure, residues 2025 of the autoregulatory region lie across the opening to the active site; we have postulated that this occlusion is relieved by a Phe-modulated formation of an ACT domain dimer (Fig S2A) (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insight that regulatory domain positioning may govern active-site access sheds new light on deciphering the order of catalytic events, because previous mechanistic studies have uniformly used PAH that lacks the regulatory domain (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other structural element governing active-site access is an active-site lid or loop (approximately residues 130150) (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all 15 structures of the isolated human PAH catalytic domain, the lid is fully ordered and exists in one of two different conformations (open vs. closed), dependent upon active-site occupancy (color coded in Table S1, illustrated in Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lid is open unless three different ligands are all present: iron, a Phe analog, and a pterin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in all structures of multidomain rat and human PAH (including our structure of the full-length enzyme), the lid is partially disordered, specifically at amino acids 137142 (e.g., Fig 3D), which is the portion of the lid that differs most between the open and closed conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these multidomain structures, most of the portions of the lid that can be seen align best with the open-lid conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at one point (immediately N-terminal to the disordered portion of the lid), the backbone in the multidomain structures is more closed-like than open (Fig 3E, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the single-domain structures where the lid is fully ordered, B factors for lid residues are higher than those for the rest of the structure (Fig S3), consistent with the notion that this region is a mobile element that can change conformationopening and closing the active siteas part of the enzymes catalytic function, perhaps in response to regulatory signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A notable difference between the structure of full-length rat PAH and those of the isolated human PAH catalytic domain is the conformation at Phe131 (Fig 3E, Right, and Fig S4A), which is poised to act as a hinge for the active-site lid; differences in Phe131 conformation can help rationalize the lid disorder in the full-length enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all of the single-domain structures, the backbone at Phe131 adopts one of two conformations, depending on whether the active-site lid is open or closed; however, the side-chain position remains more or less invariant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the full-length protein, the backbone position of Phe131 is more like the closed-lid conformation, but the side chain is in a position not seen in any of the single-domain structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This side-chain position is stabilized by a cation interaction between Phe131 and Arg111 (Arg111 is not ordered in any of the single-domain structures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the Phe131 side chain adopts this same position in the two-domain (regulatory plus catalytic) structures 1PHZ and 2PHM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Careful scrutiny of the iterative-build composite omit electron density (19) for our full-length enzyme structure suggests that a minor alternate conformation might be present for Phe131, wherein the side chain occupies the same position seen in the single-domain structures (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resolution of our data are not sufficient to confidently model minor conformers in any detail, so the map is at best suggestive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a 2mFo-DFc map calculated for the high-resolution PAH structure 1J8U also shows density for a potential alternate conformer for Phe131 (Fig S4B), which would position the side chain similarly to Phe131 in the full-length structure (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we propose that the side chain of Phe131, regardless of the open/closed status of the active-site lid, is able to sample two positions, one of which is stabilized by an interaction with Arg111.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Arg111 lies at the C terminus of the ACT domain, this suggests Phe131 may serve as a hinge or toggle controlling the conformation of the active-site lid, allowing the regulatory domain to modulate access to the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Key_Interdomain_Interactions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The full-length protein structure allows us to evaluate interdomain and intersubunit interactions essential to the observed PAH tetrameric assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interdomain interactions include all three PAH domains and involve (i) an H-bonding network between Lys113, Asp315, and Asp-27 (Fig S5A); (ii) cation interactions between both Arg123 and Arg420 and Phe80 (Fig S5B); (iii) an H bond between Asn30 and Gln134 (Fig S5C); and (iv) a cation interaction between Arg111 and Phe131 (Fig 3E, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these interactions are seen in the two-domain (catalytic plus regulatory) rat PAH structure (1PHZ and 2PHM), although they were not explicitly discussed (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these interdomain interactions are dependent on the position of the regulatory domain, and we predict they will be forfeited in the transition to an allosterically activated tetramer containing dimerized ACT domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SAXS_Correlates_the_PAH_Crystal_Structure_with_the_Solution_Structure_in_the_Absence_of_Phe_and_Confirms_the_Existence_of_an_Architecturally_Distinct_Tetramer_in_the_Presence_of_Phe  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the relationship between the full-length crystal structure and the oligomers of PAH that exist in solution in the absence of Phe, we performed SAXS analysis on the PAH preparations used for crystallography using size-exclusion chromatography in-line with synchrotron SAXS (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental radius of gyration (Rg), maximum interatomic distance (Dmax) (Tables S3 and S4), and pairwise shape distribution (Fig 4A) closely match those calculated from the tetrameric crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modeling of missing amino acids as beads on each chain was necessary for the best correlations in the higher scattering angles (CRYSOL = 1.11.3 for each of 10 independent CORAL calculations) (Fig 4A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results allow us to conclude that the crystal structure is consistent with the solution structure of the PAH tetramer in the absence of Phe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the resolution of this approach does not preclude the existence of other, equally consistent, tetramer conformations under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the presence of 1 mM Phe (sufficient for full allosteric activation of PAH), the shape of tetrameric PAH changes significantly (Fig 4C, Fig S6, and Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Invariant analyses (Fig S6 and Tables S3 and S4) suggest that the Phe-stabilized conformation is not due to significant differences in flexibility and disorder, but rather differences in the configurations of structural domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A discrete peak feature appears in the primary data at q  0.1 Å1 (Fig 4C) upon Phe addition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would correlate to a 60 Å length scale, which would be expected to strongly correlate with changes in interatomic distances between globular domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By P(r) analysis, these differences coincide with increases in Rg and a redistribution of interatomic vectors to greater values (Fig 4D and Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Dmax between the two states does not differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspection of the difference P(r) [P(r)] plot between these two states (Fig 4D, Lower) shows a redistribution from vectors at 30 and 90 Å to vectors at 60 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The longest dimensions of the full-length PAH tetramer are defined by the arrangement of its catalytic domains approximated by a planar rectangle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Dmax does not change between autoinhibited and activated states, we can conclude that the overall arrangement of catalytic domains is not significantly altered, allowing us to surmise that the observed structural changes instead correlate with discrete rearrangements of the regulatory (ACT and autoregulatory) domain in each state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Full-length mammalian PAH has defied determination of a crystal structure for decades, which is not uncommon for multidomain multimeric allosteric proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some instances, such proteins can accommodate alternate multimeric architectures with varying interdomain orientations (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13, 17, 21, and 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One well-studied example, PBGS, taught us that alternate conformers in a slow (or metastable) equilibrium can be separated on the basis of surface charge using ion exchange chromatography (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method was applied to PAH and allowed isolation of a single tetrameric species (Fig S1), which, we believe, facilitated crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting structure allows the field to progress beyond a reliance on composite homology models (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Significant differences between the structure of full-length PAH and the composite homology model are shown in Fig 1C, which is an overlay of the four chains of the full-length structure with the two truncated structures used to construct the composite model (1PHZ and 2PAH) (6, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composite homology model correctly predicts the relative orientation of the catalytic and regulatory domains, which allows the autoregulatory region to partially occlude the enzyme active site (Fig 1B, Top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This orientation also allows Arg111 to modulate the position of Phe131 and control the conformation of the active-site lid (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the composite homology model incorrectly predicted the C-terminal helix positions (Fig 1C) and the overall asymmetry of the tetramer (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Careful attention to the homology model predicted a rarely referenced steric clash between one helix position and Leu72 in the ACT domain (Fig 1C, arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure reveals no such clash.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, steric interactions around Leu72 may still prove relevant, because Phe-modulated activation is predicted to include the ACT domain rotating away from the clash point (Fig S2B); hence this site may serve as a conformational switch serving allosteric activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure of full-length PAH raises previously unasked questions, in addition to addressing some previously outstanding ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we still lack information on the conformational space available to the first 20 residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both NMR and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the mobile N-terminal peptide can sample two distinct conformations in the absence of Phe, but prefers one of these when phosphorylated (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mobility in this region is lost upon addition of sufficient Phe to fully activate PAH (25), suggesting that a structure of the fully active enzyme may reveal more information about this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, although our structural work reveals how conformational variability in the C terminus drives differences in tetramer geometry, we have not yet deciphered the precise determinants controlling why the C-terminal helix adopts the positions it does in the two-domain PAH structure (2PAH, Fig 2B), the tyrosine hydroxylase tetramer (1TOH, Fig 2C) (16), or the full-length PAH structure (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A related question is whether the positioning of the C-terminal helices seen in the two-domain tetramer (2PAH) reflects other tetrameric conformations of full-length PAH, for which structures are not yet known (e.g., the slower-migrating tetramer, phosphorylated PAH, and/or the allosterically activated tetramer).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that some of the conformational differences between the full-length and 2PAH structures derives from sequence differences between rat and human PAH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One significant difference between mammalian PAH and the other aromatic amino acid hydroxylases is the sequence of the C-terminal helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region of tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase contains classic leucine heptad repeats, which are absent in PAH (26); neither of which shows any propensity for tetramer dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of a classic leucine zipper may explain not only why PAH can dissociate to dimers but also the conformational variability in the C-terminal helices (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most significant gap in our knowledge is the structure of the activated PAH tetramer, which can putatively be stabilized by allosteric Phe binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we introduced the idea that an activated tetramer contains an ACT domain dimer and that this dimer interface is the site of allosteric Phe binding (12), several new studies have provided support for this concept (2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest a model for the activated PAH tetramer (Fig S2A) that includes such an ACT domain dimer, similar to that of the regulatory domain of tyrosine hydroxylase (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other architectures are possible, such as that of the tyrosine-binding ACT domain dimer of 3-deoxyheptulosonic acid 7-phosphate synthase (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, as noted above, several possible geometries are possible for the C-terminal four-helix bundle in the activated tetramer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A third unknown regarding an activated PAH structure is the conformation of the autoregulatory region (amino acids 132).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our SAXS data confirm that the shape of PAH changes significantly between low and high Phe concentrations, and are consistent with a redistribution of the ACT domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of the candidate models for the high-activity PAH tetramer provides a satisfying correlation with the SAXS data at higher scattering angles, even when modeled using CORAL, emphasizing the need for additional structural efforts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our crystal structure of full-length PAH occupies an important position along the continuum of different PAH structures, and replaces a composite homology model as an improved context for understanding PKU-associated PAH variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A full understanding of genotypephenotype relationships will likely await the details of the Phe-stabilized activated PAH tetramer structure, which we have demonstrated differs significantly from that of the autoinhibited tetramer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the autoinhibited structure identifies key interdomain interactions that are likely to change in the transition between autoinhibited and activated PAH tetramer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Protein_Expression_and_Purification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Full-length rat PAH was expressed in BLR-DE3 cells using a 2-d expression as described (31), with the exception that ferrous ammonium sulfate (0.2 mM) was added for the expression phase of the procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein was purified as previously described (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenyl Sepharose-purified protein (28 mg) was applied to a 1-mL HiTrap Q column preequilibrated with 30 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4, 20 mM KCl, 15% (vol/vol) glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a 20 column-volume wash, PAH assemblies were resolved using a linear 30 column-volume gradient to a salt concentration of 0.4 M KCl, keeping other buffer components the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-milliliter fractions were collected (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crystal_Growth_and_Crystal_Structure_Determination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The protein used for crystallization was taken from a HiTrap Q column fraction highly enriched in the faster-migrating tetramer (e.g., fraction 15, Fig S1); details for crystallization, model building, and refinement are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure was determined from the diffraction data collected from a single crystal at 100 K at the National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phases were obtained by molecular replacement using the highest-resolution two-domain (regulatory and catalytic) structure of rat PAH [1PHZ (6)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SAXS_Data_Analysis_and_Modeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The details of data acquisition for SAXS measurements are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modeling of the full-length PAH tetramer against its solution scatter was performed using the program CORAL (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The known structure was fixed and inventory not resolved by crystallography were modeled using beads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten independent calculations in each state were performed and yielded comparable results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final models were assessed using the program CRYSOL (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crystallization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rat PAH (fraction 15 from the HiTrap Q column; Fig S1), which had been stored at 80 °C, was thawed in a water bath at 25 °C for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of this protein was 9.4 mg/mL; it was diluted with 30 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 116 mM KCl, 15% glycerol to 5.5 mg/mL and left at 4 °C for 2 h, then at room temperature for 20 min, before preparing the crystallization tray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protein solution was added 1:1 with reservoir to make a 2-µL hanging drop over a 1-mL reservoir containing 140 mM Na-acetate, 70 mM Na-citrate, 100 mM Na-cacodylate (pH 6.5), and 31.5% PEG 1000 (Hampton Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals were grown using vapor diffusion in VDX 24-well plates (Hampton Research) at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals grew to full size (100 µm in longest dimension) within 2 d and were harvested on the third day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals were cryoprotected by submerging (on-loop for 3 s) in a solution containing 0.5 µL of reservoir solution and 0.5 µL of a solution containing a final concentration of 50% ethylene glycol and 25% sucrose in reservoir solution before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen for storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Collection_and_Processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over 120 crystals (grown using the same method and crystallization conditions) were screened with synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The data used to determine this structure were collected at 100 K from a single crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffraction data were collected via the mail-in service supported by the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS), at beamline X25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were integrated and scaled using XDS (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data collection statistics are reported in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Molecular replacement was performed with the program Phaser (36) using the two-domain rat PAH structure as the search model [PDB ID code 1PHZ (6)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refinement and all map calculations were done using the PHENIX suite (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, coordinates and group B factors (two per residue) were refined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, individual B factors and occupancies of all nonprotein atoms were refined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NCS restraints were applied throughout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter stages of the refinement, two TLS groups were included per monomer and were defined as follows: group 1, N terminus through residue 115; group 2, residue 116 through C terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative weights of the X-ray and stereochemistry targets were optimized using protocols provided in the PHENIX suite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model building was performed using Coot (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feature-enhanced maps (40) were used for initial model building, and iterative-build composite omit maps (19, 41) were used for subsequent model building.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stereochemical restraints affecting the active-site iron ions were generated using PHENIX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Waters around the metals were placed into positive Fo-Fc density using the 1PAH structure (42) as a guide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometries of the active-site metal centers were examined using the CheckMyMetal Web server (csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/ (43), which informed manual rebuilding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fe geometry is borderline (having a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement) at chains A, B, and D, and acceptable (having a tetrahedral arrangement) at chain C; Fe occupancy varies between 0.55 and 0.86, which is borderline for all chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrogens and conformation-dependent library restraints were added in the last stages of refinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model refinement statistics are reported in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cation interactions were identified using the program CaPTURE (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All molecular images were prepared using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, version 1.7.6.2, Enhanced for Mac OS X (Schrödinger).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SAXS_Data_Acquisition_and_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)-SAXS data were obtained at the Australian Synchrotron SAXS/WAXS beamline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were collected from this 120-m point source at a wavelength of 1.033 Å, providing an accessible scattering angle where 0.0086 less_than q less_than 0.64 Å1 (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred microliters of 4.5 mg/mL fraction 15 PAH in 30 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4, 116 mM KCl, and 15% glycerol was injected onto a 3-mL Superdex 200 5/150 GL column (GE Healthcare Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer solution, sans glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was eluted isocratically at 0.15 mL/min and 25 °C into a 1-mm capillary for subsequent X-ray exposures recorded at 2-s intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scattering profiles recorded at the peak size-exclusion UV intensity were chosen for subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activated protein was prepared by adding 1 µL of 100 mM Phe to 100 µL of protein sample and incubating overnight at 4 °C before SEC-SAXS analysis; 1 mM Phe was included in the SEC column buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis, data were truncated to a qmax of 0.2 to use the strongest intensity data for comparisons (I/I  1 for q less_than 0.17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rotating anode data were recorded on a Rigaku S-Max3000 SAXS system located at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The instrument is equipped with Osmic mirror optics, a three-pinhole enclosed preflight path, an evacuated sample chamber with customized sample holder cryostatted at 4 °C, and a gas-filled multiwire detector; the instrument is served by a Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF microfocus rotating anode generator (Rigaku America).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein samples (in 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4, 116 mM KCL, and 515% glycerol) were spun at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C in tabletop centrifuge immediately preceding 40-min X-ray exposures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The forward scattering from the samples studied was circularly averaged to yield one-dimensional intensity profiles as a function of q (q = 4sin/, where 2 is the scattering angle, in units of per angstrom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were reduced using SAXSGui v2.05.02 (JJ X-Ray Systems ApS), and matching buffers were subtracted to yield the final scattering profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample-to-detector distance and beam center were calibrated using silver behenate and intensity converted to absolute units (per centimeter) using a known polymer standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
