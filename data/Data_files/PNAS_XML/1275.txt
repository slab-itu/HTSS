Relational mobility predicts social behaviors in 39 countries and is tied to historical farming and threat  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biologists and social scientists have long tried to understand why some societies have more fluid and open interpersonal relationshipsdifferences in relational mobilityand how those differences influence individual behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure relational mobility in 39 societies and find that relationships are more stable and hard to form in east Asia, North Africa, and the Middle East, while they are more fluid in the West and Latin America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results show that relationally mobile cultures tend to have higher interpersonal trust and intimacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploring potential causes, we find greater environmental threats (like disease and warfare) and sedentary farming are associated with lower relational mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our society-level index of relational mobility for 39 societies is a resource for future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biologists and social scientists have long tried to understand why some societies have more fluid and open interpersonal relationships and how those differences influence culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study measures relational mobility, a socioecological variable quantifying voluntary (high relational mobility) vs. fixed (low relational mobility) interpersonal relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure relational mobility in 39 societies and test whether it predicts social behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  People in societies with higher relational mobility report more proactive interpersonal behaviors (e.g., self-disclosure and social support) and psychological tendencies that help them build and retain relationships (e.g., general trust, intimacy, self-esteem).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we explore ecological factors that could explain relational mobility differences across societies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relational mobility was lower in societies that practiced settled, interdependent subsistence styles, such as rice farming, and in societies that had stronger ecological and historical threats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cross-Cultural_Validity_of_Measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One concern in cross-cultural studies is whether we can measure constructs accurately across cultures and languages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from scales used in our multicountry survey evidenced reliability, measurement equivalence, and validity across societies (SI Appendix, section 1.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All scales showed partial scalar invariance, indicating that participants in different countries responded to survey items in similar ways and that we can meaningfully compare scale averages across societies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relational mobility scale (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 and SI Appendix, Table S1) showed high within-nation agreement [Mrwg(j) = 0.92, SD = 0.02, Min = 0.87], high variability between different societies [ICC(1) = 0.09], and highly reliable society-level means [ICC(2) = 0.98] (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, these results suggest that people within each society tended to agree about how mobile their society is and that societies differ meaningfully in how relationally mobile they are.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relational_Mobility_s_Convergence_and_Antecedents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Below, we use publically available data and our own in-survey data to run a battery of exploratory tests examining the convergent validity and antecedents of relational mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all exploratory analyses, we provide bootstrapped (5,000 samples) bias-corrected confidence intervals (BCaCI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values are also given to identify potential research goals for follow-up studies but do not indicate confirmatory hypothesis testing results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Relational_Mobility_s_Consequences  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on previous dual-country studies, we tested a number of confirmatory hypotheses about the psychological and behavioral outcomes of relational mobility in the 39-society dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We theorize that generalized trust (10, 24) and self-esteem (25) should be higher in relationally mobile societies, because they give people confidence to approach new desirable people in an open and competitive interpersonal marketplace (3, 7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, trust and self-esteem help people achieve the task of acquiring desirable relationships (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another consequence is that friends tend to be more similar to each other (higher homophily) in relationally mobile societies, because there are more opportunities to find like-minded friends and leave relationships if peoples interests diverge (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is some prior evidence that people in relationally mobile societies also share personal information more quickly (self-disclosure) (27), give social support more frequently (8), and report higher intimacy with romantic partners (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pro-active tendencies help bind partners together, increasing the cost for either partner to pursue attractive alternatives (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, these tendencies help people retain relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In low relational mobility societies, relationships are stable and more difficult to change, and therefore, the task of retaining relationships is less important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In societies with higher relational mobility, people had more trust in strangers [r = 0.36 (95% BCaCI = 0.03, 0.63), P = 0.046] and higher self-esteem [r = 0.66 (95% BCaCI = 0.28, 0.83), P less_than 0.001] (SI Appendix, Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relational mobility also explained up to 30% of between-country variance in respondents individual-level similarity between friends and romantic partners (SI Appendix, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-disclosure and intimacy toward a close friend or romantic partner were also much higher in relationally mobile societies, with relational mobility explaining up to 54% of the variance between societies in these two dependent variables (SI Appendix, Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relationally mobile societies also reported more willingness to help out a close friend in times of personal crises (social support), explaining 23% of variance in social support between societies (SI Appendix, Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Multilevel_Structural_Equation_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We brought the causes, relational mobility, and the interpersonal outcomes together in a confirmatory multilevel structural equation model (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model allows us to test the unique effect that each antecedent has on relational mobility as well as relational mobilitys unique effect on each interpersonal outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, we used subsistence style and threat variables adjusted for current gross domestic product per capita to test effects independent from societies differences in wealth (SI Appendix, section 1.6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also took into account individual-level variables, such as gender, age, and household income.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The models nested societies within geographical regions, which accounts for the fact that countries are not always truly independent observations (SI Appendix, section 1.3.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results for these confirmatory analyses confirmed the simple correlations presented above (SI Appendix, Table S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relational mobility was predicted independently by subsistence style ( values  greater than  0.475, P values less_than 0.001) and threats ( values  greater than  0.273, p values less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the outcomes, relational mobility predicted generalized trust, self-esteem, similarity, self-disclosure, intimacy, and social support (SI Appendix, Table S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Actual_Vs_Potential_Relational_Movement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One question that underpins this research is the distinction between actual movement and relational mobility, which measures how much choice and opportunity there are for movement between relationships in a society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure potential for relational movement using the relational mobility scale, which relies on peoples perceptions of relational choice and opportunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reported in Convergent and Concurrent Validity of the Relational Mobility Measure that perceptions of relational mobility were correlated with actual relational movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, why not use these measures of actual movement, which should be more objective and accurate?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we could measure how many new acquaintances people have made in the last month or how often people move homes (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least for the relationship acquisition and retention behaviors that we measure in this study, we argue that relational mobility is critical and that actual movement does not adequately measure choice and opportunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an illustration, imagine that your friend is a naval officer who could be ordered to transfer to another city at any time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The knowledge that your friend may soon be transferred to another city (quite possibly against his/her own preference) will probably not increase the likelihood that you will try to work harder to retain that friend, such as by increasing intimacy or self-disclosing more.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If your friends moving away is determined by an outside force, then trying harder to retain the friendship would be useless.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, however, it is entirely up to your friends choosing whether s/he moves away or not, then why not try to convince him/her to stay through expressions of intimacy or disclosing secrets?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If there is choice, the relationship retention behaviors are adaptive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If there is no choice, investment is for naught.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested whether relational mobility is a stronger predictor of proactive relationship behaviors than measures of actual movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we reran the multilevel model, replacing relational mobility with measures of actual movement (residential mobility and self-reported number of acquaintances met in the last month).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relational mobility more reliably predicted the outcomes in the model (SI Appendix, Table S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, relational mobility was more reliably predicted by the theoretical antecedents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Naturally, relational mobility and actual movement between relationships will be correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this result suggests that freedom and choice in relationships are adding something beyond movement alone (SI Appendix, section 1.8 has more discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Where_Does_Relational_Mobility_Sit_in_the_Causal_Chain?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A critical reader might ask why we need to talk about relational mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The field already has concepts and measures for individualism, tightnesslooseness, and hierarchy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Does relational mobility add anything beyond these established concepts?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we argue that (i) relational mobility is a stronger predictor of certain interpersonal outcomes and that, (ii) as a socioecological factor, relational mobility can help explain why societies have certain cultural characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we tested whether relational mobility predicted the interpersonal outcomes measured in this study better than previously established cultural variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did this by predicting self-disclosure, intimacy, and trust from relational mobility vs. cultural variables, such as individualism, cultural tightness, and cultural self-construals (SI Appendix, section 1.11.10 reports the full multilevel results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, relational mobility held up well against these other variables, predicting the outcomes more consistently and strongly (SI Appendix, Table S16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that relational mobility holds unique predictive power beyond established dimensions of cultural variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we asked whether relational mobility sits higher in the causal chain of culture or if it is more of a downstream outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that relational mobility sits higher in the causal chain and can help explain why previous studies have found that threats (22, 29) and subsistence styles (18) affect culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that, in response to threats and different subsistence styles (distal social ecologies), humans form community structures that afford varying degrees of opportunity and freedom in relationships (i.e., relational mobility, a proximal social ecology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variance in relational mobility then impacts the self-concepts and other cultural characteristics of people who live in those environments (SI Appendix, section 1.11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test this, we ran mediation models where threats and subsistence style cause relational mobility, which then causes interdependent self-construals (18) and cultural tightnesslooseness (22, 29) (SI Appendix, section 1.11.9 and Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results showed a significant indirect effect of threats and subsistence style on self-construals and tightnesslooseness, via relational mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also compared that with competing mediation models where threats and subsistence styles cause self-construals and tightnesslooseness, which then cause relational mobility (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data did not support models where relational mobility was a downstream consequence (SI Appendix, Table S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the model results support the theory that relational mobility is a socioecological variable, impacting how humans think and act.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, we readily accept that relational mobility is not the only important feature of the social environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, interdependent self-construals, norms, and other cultural settings influence behavior as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, the findings are consistent with the theory that relational mobility makes certain behaviors and psychological tendencies more adaptive in any given society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the findings suggest that, as relational mobility increases, it becomes more adaptive to actively invest in building interpersonal relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One particularly noteworthy finding was that Latin America was high in relational mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Latin Americans reported behavior and psychological tendencies (such as high self-esteem) that tend to occur with relational mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is noteworthy, because data suggesting that Latin America is collectivistic (30, 31) would not have predicted this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding might inspire researchers to delve deeper into how Latin America fits into the spectrum of human culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ultimately, these results are correlational; they cannot prove that relational mobility causes these outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, reverse causality is also plausiblefor example, trusting strangers could also make societies more relationally mobile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can get more insight into cause and effect through experimental research [such as studies that manipulate relational mobility or peoples perception of it (32)] and studies that track changes in the environment and mobility indicators over time (examples are in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25 and 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Agent-based simulations can also help clarify whether these behaviors are adaptive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Future large-scale studies on relational mobility can use data that are more representative of the population in each society to test the generalizability of our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This applies not only to the exploratory nature of many of our analyses but also, to our samples heavy skew toward females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional analysis showed that gender explains only 0.04% of the variance in relational mobility scores (SI Appendix, section 1.1.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual-level age and income explained even less variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is plausible, because participants describe the mobility of their society, not their own mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the small samples of men make it difficult to fully test for gender differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This 39-society study presents a large-scale survey of relational mobility around the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings suggest that subsistence styles and environmental threats can explain some of the differences across societies in relationship style.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results also suggest that free agent relationship markets encourage proactive social behaviors, like self-disclosure, intimacy, and generalized trust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that future studies can continue to bring together research in biological sciences, sociology, and cross-cultural psychology to better understand how humans structure their relationships, even while people move more of their social networks into the digital world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measured relational mobility by recruiting 16,939 people from 39 societies to a web survey between 2014 and 2016 (Table 1); the survey was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Center for Experimental Research in Social Sciences at Hokkaido University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recruitment was via Facebook advertisements (SI Appendix, section 1.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were directed to a landing page, where they could inform themselves about the survey and provide their consent before continuing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sampled societies based on (i) Facebook penetration rate (to maximize diversity in respondents within each country) and (ii) capturing as much variance as possible in geography and cultural blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants rated the relational mobility of their immediate society using the relational mobility scale of Yuki et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (10) (SI Appendix, Table S1), reported the number of new acquaintances met in the last month and how many romantic partners they have had, and completed demographic questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also completed measures of interpersonal intimacy (34), self-disclosure (27), similarity (26), and social support in their relationship with either their closest friend or their romantic partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants completed the survey in the majority language of their society (Table 1 and SI Appendix, section 1.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We collected societal variables, such as gross domestic product per capita, cultural variables, romantic partner poaching frequency, and other psychological and behavioral variables, from public sources (SI Appendix, Tables S6, S8, and S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
