X-ray crystal structure of a reiterative transcription complex reveals an atypical RNA extension pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under certain conditions during transcription, a single base of the template DNA specifies multiple bases in the RNA transcript due to slippage between the transcript and template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This noncanonical form of RNA synthesis is called reiterative transcription, and it plays key regulatory roles in bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we determined the crystal structure of a bacterial RNA polymerase engaged in reiterative transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study found a completely unexpected RNA extension pathway during reiterative transcription and uncovered an atypical mechanism for the transition from the open promoter complex to the transcription elongation complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings represent a major advancement in understanding the mechanics and flexibility of transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reiterative transcription is a noncanonical form of RNA synthesis in which a nucleotide specified by a single base in the DNA template is repetitively added to the nascent transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we determined the crystal structure of an RNA polymerase, the bacterial enzyme from Thermus thermophilus, engaged in reiterative transcription during transcription initiation at a promoter resembling the pyrG promoter of Bacillus subtilis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure reveals that the reiterative transcript detours from the dedicated RNA exit channel and extends toward the main channel of the enzyme, thereby allowing RNA extension without displacement of the promoter recognition -factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nascent transcripts containing reiteratively added G residues are eventually extended by nonreiterative transcription, revealing an atypical pathway for the formation of a transcription elongation complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Preparation_and_Structure_of_a_Reiterative_Transcription_Complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We chose the readily crystallized Thermus thermophilus RNAP A holoenzyme to examine the structure of a reiterative transcription complex (RTC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate reiterative transcription with the T. thermophilus RNAP, we performed in vitro transcription using a double-stranded DNA fragment containing the pyrG promoter of B. subtilis as template (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result showed that the T. thermophilus RNAP was capable of producing poly-G transcripts up to eight bases in length in the presence of GTP (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of both GTP and CTP, a single C residue was incorporated at the 3 end of the G38 transcripts, and the extent of C-residue incorporation was directly proportional to the concentration of CTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the T. thermophilus RNAP is proficient at reiterative transcription and that this reaction is comparable to that observed naturally at the pyrG promoter (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the formation of the RTC, we designed a synthetic DNA scaffold corresponding to the transcription bubble and downstream double-stranded DNA of the pyrG promoter (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm reiterative transcription with the synthetic scaffold as template, it was transcribed in vitro with T. thermophilus RNAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the same reaction conditions as described in Fig 1B, reiterative transcription was essentially the same as that observed with the natural pyrG promoter (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained when the synthetic scaffold was transcribed by the primary RNAPs of B. subtilis and E. coli (Fig 1C), indicating the universal nature of the reiterative transcription reaction in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using T. thermophilus RNAP and the synthetic DNA scaffold, we formed and crystallized an open complex (RPpyrG-O) as described in Experimental Procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of the RPpyrG-O was determined at 2.8-Å resolution to use as a reference in the structural analysis of the RTC (Table S1, Fig S1, and see description in SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify that the RPpyrG-O remained transcriptionally active in the crystalline state, as observed with other crystals of T. thermophilus RNAP (17, 18), we performed in crystallo reiterative transcription by soaking GTP into the RPpyrG-O crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that the crystals produced and retained poly-G transcripts up to 8 nt in length (Fig S2), similar to the transcripts produced in solution (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then soaked a crystal of RPpyrG-O in GTP to trigger reiterative transcription and determined the structure of the resulting RTC at 3.3-Å resolution (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure shows continuous electron density from the RNAP active site that corresponds to a de novo synthesized poly-G transcript containing eight residues (Fig 2B; hereafter, RNA residues are counted 1, 2, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from the 3 end), which is the same length as the longest poly-G transcript synthesized in solution (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electron density of poly-G transcript is gradually decreased from positions 5 to 8, presumably due to less RNA extension beyond a 5-mer transcript in the RTC crystal (Fig S2) and/or thermal motion of single-stranded RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3 end of the RNA is in a posttranslocated state (i.e., in the i site), forming a base pair with template DNA residue +3C, whereas the +4G base is positioned at the i+1 site, waiting for a molecule of CTP to extend the nascent RNA by nonreiterative transcription (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Viewing the overall structure of the RTC reveals the location of the reiterative transcript within RNAP (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the nascent RNA does not extend toward the dedicated RNA exit channel; instead, it extends toward the main channel of the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA residues 5G and 6G are located near the downstream DNA and fork loop 2 of the -subunit (residues 414424), which appears disordered (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA residues pass beneath -region 3.2 (3.2), and the 5 end of the RNA approaches the entrance of the RNAP main channel (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The terminal RNA residue (8G) is surrounded by the lobe domain (-subunit), the rudder, and the clamp head (-subunit), the N terminus of -region 1.2, and the major groove of the downstream double-stranded DNA (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The opening into the main channel that would allow the RNA to escape from RNAP is only 14 Å wide and 11 Å high (Fig 3B), which could present a barrier to further RNA extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test this barrier hypothesis, we performed in vitro transcription using as template DNA two variants of the pyrG-like DNA scaffold in which the initially transcribed sequence was changed from C3 to either T3 or G3 (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of only the corresponding initiating nucleotides ATP or CTP, T. thermophilus RNAP efficiently synthesized reiterative transcripts with both promoter variants (Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the T3 promoter, a ladder of poly-A transcripts up to 8 residues in length was produced, the same maximum length observed with the standard template and poly-G transcripts (Fig S3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, with the G3 promoter, a ladder of poly-C transcripts with lengths easily exceeding 40 residues was produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results, and the fact that pyrimidines are smaller than purines, suggest that the maximum length of reiterative transcripts was defined by steric restrictions imposed by the narrow opening into the main channel (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

An_Alternative_RNA_Extension_Pathway_During_Reiterative_Transcription  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The extension strategy of nascent RNA in the RTC (Fig 4C) is strikingly different from that exhibited by previously described crystal structures of comparable transcribing complexes containing nonreiterative transcripts (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, RNA is directed toward and eventually into a dedicated RNA exit channel located underneath the flap domain (-subunit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in an initially transcribing complex containing a 6-mer RNA, the 5 end of RNA abuts 3.2 [Fig 4A, Protein Data Bank (PDB): 4G7H] (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clash causes the tip of 3.2 to become disordered, which presumably marks the beginning of -release from RNAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further RNA extension would completely displace 3.2, thereby clearing the way for RNA to enter the RNA exit channel (Fig 4B, PDB: 2O5J) (13, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the importance of the 5-triphosphate group in transcript extension during reiterative transcription, we used the dinucleotide pGpG, which contains a 5-monophosphate group, to initiate reiterative transcription at the scaffold pyrG promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcript ladder produced was identical to that obtained by transcription with GTP as sole substrate (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In both the initially transcribing (Fig 4A) and elongation complexes (Fig 4B), the 5 end of RNA is guided toward the RNA exit channel by an extended DNA/RNA hybrid (i.e., 6 bp and an 9 bp, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the case of a RTC containing the synthetic pyrG promoter, the DNA/RNA hybrid is only 3 bp long (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining nonbase-pairing residues of the RNA are turned perpendicular to the DNA/RNA hybrid and directed toward the main channel, without displacement of 3.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA residue 4G is inserted into a pocket on the surface of the -subunit known as the rifampin-binding pocket (also known as the rifampin-resistance determining region I) (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the importance of the interaction between RNA and the rifampin-binding pocket during reiterative transcription, we measured reiterative transcription from the pyrG promoter in solution with three rifampin-resistant mutants of E. coli RNAP having amino acid substitutions either at D516V, H526Y, or S531L of the -subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D516V and H526Y mutants alter the electrostatic potential and the shape of the rifampin-binding pocket, respectively, whereas the S531L mutant replaces a hydrophilic with a hydrophobic side chain in the rifampin-binding pocket (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that all mutants synthesize equal amounts of reiterative transcripts and that the efficiencies of CMP incorporation to the 3 end of poly-G transcripts are equally dependent on CTP concentration in mutant and wild-type RNAPs (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the rifampin-binding pocket functions merely to shelter an unpaired RNA base after the transcript changes its direction from the dedicated RNA exit to the main channels of RNAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The typical transcription elongation complex is optimally stabilized by an 9-bp DNA/RNA hybrid (13, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the RTC at the pyrG promoter demonstrates that a 3-bp hybrid, with a calculated Tm of 17 °C (OligoCalc, in the presence of 100 mM Na+) (21), is sufficient to maintain the RNA in the transcription complex and to allow its extension one base at a time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3-bp hybrid does this while still being weak enough to allow the upstream slippage of the RNA, which is a central feature of reiterative transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA residues from 3G to 5G interact with amino acid residues Q390, R409, and N448 of the -subunit, which presumably would limit diffusion of the nonbase-paired region of the RNA (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Text  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We crystallized the T. thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme bound to the synthetic DNA scaffold (RNAPpyrG promoter open complex, RPpyrG-O) and determined its structure at 2.8-Å resolution (Table S1) to use as a reference in the structural analysis of the reiterative transcription complex (RTC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall shape of RPpyrG-O is identical to previously reported T. thermophilus RNAPpromoter open complex (RPO) structures (17, 27), having the straight conformation of the bridge helix and the open conformation of the trigger loop with a disordered tip (residues 1,2381,253) (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-resolution electron density map of the RPpyrG-O resolved individual DNA bases, which unambiguously determined the register of DNA sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The +1C and +2C bases of the template DNA are positioned at the i and i+1 sites, respectively, ready to base pair with two molecules of GTP (Fig 2A and Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The +3C base of the template DNA is located at the i+2 site (Fig S1B), which is on the opposite side of the bridge helix and at the edge of downstream dsDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the previously described RPO structures, the +3 bases of the template and nontemplate strands were base paired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the RPpyrG-O, the +3 base of the nontemplate DNA is unwound and disordered (which is also observed with the +1 and +2 bases of the nontemplate DNA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The R422 side chain of fork loop 2 is located in front of +3C of the template DNA and forms WatsonCrick-like hydrogen bonds and a cation interaction with +4G of the nontemplate DNA, which facilitates positioning of downstream DNA (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of an unwound +3 position and the interaction between R422 and +3C in terms of reiterative transcription remains to be elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study reports the structure of a bacterial RNAP in the process of reiterative transcription, revealing a unique mechanism for extending RNA within the transcription initiation complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process includes an atypical RNA extension pathway, a stably maintained 3-bp DNA/RNA hybrid, and extension of the nascent RNA without displacement of 3.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Elucidating the mechanism of reiterative transcription at the pyrG promoter in solution is difficult because reiterative transcripts are quickly released from the initiation complex, only a minor fraction of transcription complexes contain the longest 8-mer poly-G transcript at any given time (Fig 1 B and C), and the stochastic nature of RNA slippage prevents control of reiterative transcript length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, using in crystallo transcription, we were able to prepare a stable reiterative transcription complex containing poly-G transcripts up to 8 nt in length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct analysis of the composition of the RNA transcripts in crystals shows a mixed population varying in length from 2 to 8 nt (Fig S2), similar to transcripts produced during reiterative transcription in solution (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this heterogeneity results in a gradual decrease of the RNA electron density from residues 5 to 8, all transcripts appear to follow the atypical exit pathway as evidenced by the lack of any electron density along the canonical RNA exit pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the summation of RNA electron densities from somewhat heterogeneous reiterative transcription complexes in a single crystal provides a means for establishing the location of an otherwise unstable reiterative RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystalline state of T. thermophilus RNAPpromoter DNA complex has a high solvent content (60%), is fully hydrated to allow nucleotide access to the enzyme active site, and can produce either a canonical RNA transcript with 6-bp DNA/RNA hybrid (17) or a reiterative transcript with a 3-bp DNA/RNA hybrid (this study) depending on only the initially transcribed region of the DNA template and the nucleotide(s) soaked into the crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unique, ideal, and near physiological environment of RNAP in crystallo captures a hitherto undetected and unstable intermediate by freezing crystals, the structure of which reveals an atypical RNA extension pathway at atomic resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alternative_Pathway_for_Transcription_Elongation_Complex_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because pyrG transcripts containing extra G residues at their 5 ends are eventually fully extended by canonical transcription in B. subtilis, our results reveal an alternative pathway for the formation of a transcription elongation complex (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During reiterative transcription at the pyrG promoter, only a 3-bp DNA/RNA hybrid forms, and the first 5-end RNA base not included in the DNA/RNA hybrid fills the rifampin-binding pocket (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 5-end RNA is redirected away from 3.2 and toward the main channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At some point during further RNA extension up to approximately eight bases, there can be a switch to nonreiterative transcription (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This switch is accompanied by an increase in the length of the DNA/RNA hybrid, which would displace 3.2 to expose the dedicated RNA exit channel of the core enzyme (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possibly, the 5 end of the nascent RNA transcript is then redirected toward the RNA exit channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that reiterative transcription pauses when the 5-end RNA reaches the narrow opening of the main channel of RNAP (Fig 3C and Fig S3), providing time for CTP to be incorporated at the 3 end of RNA and the switch from reiterative to canonical transcriptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the length of the DNA/RNA hybrid triggers the eventual displacement of  from core enzyme (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without -factor, the main and RNA exit channels are separated only by a weak interaction between the lid region (-subunit) and the inner surface of the flap domain (-subunit) (22), which can be disrupted by opening of the RNAP clamp and/or flap (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, disruption of this interaction during the transition from reiterative to nonreiterative transcription might be involved in redirecting the RNA toward the dedicated RNA exit channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our studies also suggest that the maximum length of reiterative pyrG transcripts is established when an 8-mer RNA collides with a narrow opening into the main channel of RNAP (Fig 3 and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apparently, this opening is too small for further extension of poly-G (and poly-A) transcripts, but not for poly-C transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Establishing the general nature of this restriction will require structural studies of RTCs, including other promoters and RNAPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our study provides a detailed view of reiterative transcription at the molecular level, much remains to be known about the mechanism of RNA slippage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, we intend to apply time-dependent soaktriggerfreeze X-ray crystallography (24) to visualize RNA slippage during reiterative transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also important to note that the fates of reiterative transcripts from other promoters are fundamentally different from that of the pyrG transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most notably, during transcription initiation at some bacterial promoters (e.g., the pyrBI promoter of E. coli), once extra nucleotides are added to a nascent RNA by reiterative transcription, there is no switch to canonical transcription (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, these reiterative transcripts are released from the transcription initiation complex, resulting in reduced gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, in all known examples of reiterative transcription leading to release of transcripts during initiation, the promoters involved differ from the pyrG promoter in a similar way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these promoters include an initially transcribed region in which the homopolymeric tract at which reiterative transcription occurs is located one or two bases downstream from the transcription start site (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at the start of reiterative transcription, the DNA/RNA hybrid will be one or two base pairs longer than that observed at the pyrG promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This small difference might be sufficient to prevent a switch from reiterative to canonical transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the RNAP structural features controlling these alternative fates are not known, it is possible that the presence of the 5 end base(s) preceding the homopolymeric tract causes nascent transcripts to be directed into a pathway within RNAP that precludes transcribing downstream DNA sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirming such a model will require structural comparisons of reiterative transcription complexes that differ in transcript fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Experimental_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preparation_and_Purification_of_T_thermophilus__E_coli__and_B_subtilis_RNAPs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
T. thermophilus, E. coli, and B. subtilis RNAP holoenzymes were purified as described previously (2527).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rifampin-resistant E. coli RNAPs were purified as described (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_pyrG_Promoter_DNA_Scaffold_for_the_Crystallization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The promoter DNA scaffold that resembles B. subtilis pyrG promoter region was constructed by using two oligodeoxynucleotides and used for the crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences of the nontemplate strand and template strand were 5-TATAATGGGAGCTGGCTCTGATGCAGG -3 and 5- CCTGCATCAGAGCCCAAAATAC-3, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two oligonucleotides were annealed in 40 L containing 5 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.7), 200 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2 to the final concentration of 0.5 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solution was heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and the temperature was gradually decreased to 22 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crystallization_of_the_T_thermophilus_RNAP_Promoter_DNA_Complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The crystals were prepared by mixing the purified T. thermophilus RNAP holoenzyme (18 M) and the pyrG promoter DNA scaffold (27 M) in the crystallization buffer [20 mM TrisHCl (pH 8 at 4 °C), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1% glycerol, 1 mM DTT].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full-sized crystal in the hanging drop containing 0.1 M TrisHCl (pH 8 at 22 °C), 0.2 M KCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 9.5% PEG4000 was harvested and cryoprotected by stepwise transferring in the solutions 0.1 M TrisHCl (pH 8 at 22 °C), 0.2 M KCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 15% PEG4000, and 15% butanediol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystals were frozen by liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prepare the crystals of the RTC, the RNAP and pyrG promoter complex crystals were transferred to the cryosolution containing 2 mM GTP and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Reiterative_in_Vitro_Transcription_Assay_with_CTP_Concentration_Titration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The same DNA scaffold used in crystal formation was used as template DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro transcription assays were performed in 10 L containing 250 nM RNAP holoenzyme, 250 nM DNA scaffold, 40 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0 at 25 °C), 30 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 15 M acetylated BSA, 1 mM DTT, 100 M GTP, 1 Ci (1 Ci = 37 GBq) [-32P]GTP, and various concentrations of CTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C (B. subtilis and E. coli) or 55 °C (T. thermophilus), and the reactions were stopped by adding 10 L of 2× stop buffer (90% formamide, 50 mM EDTA, xylene cyanol, and bromophenol blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction products were electrophoretically separated on a denaturing 24% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel and visualized with a phosphorimager (Typhoon 9410; GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
