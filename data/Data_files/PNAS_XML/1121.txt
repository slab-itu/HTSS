title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accelerated wound healing in mice by on-site production and delivery of CXCL12 by transformed lactic acid bacteria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chronic wounds comprise a growing clinical problem that represents 3% of the health care budget in industrialized countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drug development is hampered by the proteolytic nature of the wounds, which greatly limits drug bioavailability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a technology that circumvents this by on-site production and reduced chemokine degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lactobacilli bacteria were transformed into CXCL12-producing vectors to bioengineer the wound microenvironment after topical application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the immune cells driving the healing process were reinforced, which greatly accelerated wound closure in healthy mice, in mouse models of hyperglycemia and peripheral ischemia, and in a wound model using human skin disks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial safety studies demonstrated that neither bacteria nor the chemokine produced was detected in systemic circulation following application to open wounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Impaired wound closure is a growing medical problem associated with metabolic diseases and aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immune cells play important roles in wound healing by following instructions from the microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we developed a technology to bioengineer the wound microenvironment and enhance healing abilities of the immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in strongly accelerated wound healing and was achieved by transforming Lactobacilli with a plasmid encoding CXCL12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXCL12-delivering bacteria administrated topically to wounds in mice efficiently enhanced wound closure by increasing proliferation of dermal cells and macrophages, and led to increased TGF- expression in macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria-produced lactic acid reduced the local pH, which inhibited the peptidase CD26 and consequently enhanced the availability of bioactive CXCL12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, treatment with CXCL12-delivering Lactobacilli also improved wound closure in mice with hyperglycemia or peripheral ischemia, conditions associated with chronic wounds, and in a human skin wound model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, initial safety studies demonstrated that the topically applied transformed bacteria exerted effects restricted to the wound, as neither bacteria nor the chemokine produced could be detected in systemic circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Development of drugs accelerating wound healing is limited by the proteolytic nature of wounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our technology overcomes this by on-site chemokine production and reduced degradation, which together ensure prolonged chemokine bioavailability that instructed local immune cells and enhanced wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specific_and_Efficient_Plasmid_Expression_in_Transformed_L_reuteri  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bacterial production and secretion of CXCL12 following transformation with pSIP_CXCL12 depended completely on addition of the promoter induction peptide [induced CXCL12-producing Lactobacilli (LB_CXCL12); Fig S1B], and no CXCL12 was detected in the supernatant from noninduced bacteria or bacteria carrying the luciferase plasmids (pSIP_Luc, LB_Luc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of the activation peptide to LB_Luc resulted in immediate luciferase expression that peaked during the first 2 h and lasted for 10 h (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following topical application to cutaneous wounds in mice, the bacteria were restricted to the wound surface and plasmid expression was high for the first 1 h (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of wounds with CXCL12-producing L. reuteri resulted in increased CXCL12 levels in adjacent skin 2 d after wound induction independent of bacterial dose (Fig 1 CG), indicating that bacterial adhesion to the wound is a dose-limiting factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CXCL12-Producing_L_reuteri_Accelerates_Wound_Healing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Daily administration of CXCL12-producing L. reuteri (2 × 107 cfu) to wounds resulted in accelerated wound closure compared with untreated wounds or wounds treated with control L. reuteri, in which the effect was most prominent during the first 24 h (Fig 2 A and B) and wound area over time (area under the curve) was reduced (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time to complete or partial wound closure was reduced for wounds treated with CXCL12-producing L. reuteri compared with untreated wounds or wounds treated with control L. reuteri (Fig 2D and Fig S2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No additional effect on wound healing was demonstrated by increasing the dose of CXCL12-producing L. reuteri (Fig S2 D and E), which agrees with measured levels of bacteria-delivered CXCL12 (Fig 1 DG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXCL12 delivered by a different bacterial strain, Lactococcus lactis, also accelerated wound healing (Fig S2 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

On-Site_Production_of_CXCL12_and_Lactic_Acid_Increases_Bioavailability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When fresh supernatants from CXCL12-producing L. reuteri or different concentrations of recombinant CXCL12 (rCXCL12) were applied topically to wounds once daily, wound closure was not accelerated (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, rCXCL12 (0.2 µg) given every 10th minute for 1 h once daily to mimic continuous delivery accelerated wound closure (Fig 3B), demonstrating that sustained CXCL12 delivery is needed to promote wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CXCL12 is processed at the NH2 terminus to an inactive form [CXCL12(3-68)] by membrane-bound CD26 (dipeptidylpeptidase IV) expressed in wounds (2123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity of CD26 is pH-dependent (24, 25), and enzymatic activity of CD26 was higher at pH 8.3 than pH 7.3, as described before, whereas there was no enzymatic activity at pH 6.3 or pH 5.3 (Fig S3 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, CXCL12 was totally inactivated by CD26 at pH 8.3 within 30 min and inactivated to a partial extent at pH 7.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CXCL12 was not processed at pH 6.3 and pH 5.3 (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lactic acid produced by L. lactis and L. reuteri causes a decrease in pH of 0.20.5 over the cultured period despite strain-specific differences in growth (Fig S3 EH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate if pH-dependent degradation of CXCL12 within the wound affects healing, rCXCL12 (0.2 µg) was administered in buffers with different pH (pH 7.35, pH 6.35, pH 5.35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, only at pH 6.35 did CXCL12 induce rapid wound closure (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data provide evidence that concomitant lactic acid production by the bacteria enhance bioavailability of the delivered chemokine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CXCL12_Induces_Proliferation_and_Increases_Macrophage-Produced_TGF-_and_CXCL12  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wound induction increased the number of proliferating cells in the dermis and epidermis at the wound edge at 24 h, in addition to increased density of macrophages and TGF-expressing macrophages (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When wounds were treated with CXCL12-producing L. reuteri, the number of proliferating cells increased further (Fig 4 A and B and Fig S4A), as did the levels of TGF- in the dermis closest to the wound and the number of wound-associated macrophages (Fig 4 C and D and Fig S4B), of which an increased fraction expressed TGF- (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 50% of the TGF-+ macrophages within wounds expressed the mannose receptor 1 (MMR), a marker for macrophages involved in tissue remodeling (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wound-associated macrophages also expressed the CXCL12 receptor CXCR4, and the density but not the fraction of CXCR4+ macrophages were increased by CXCL12-producing L. reuteri treatment (Fig 4 G and H and Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the density and fraction of CXCL12-expressing wound-associated macrophages increased with treatment of CXCL12-producing L. reuteri (Fig 4 I and J and Fig S4C), demonstrating an autocrine feedback previously described (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of macrophages in wound healing was elucidated by depleting mice of macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocol used resulted in impaired wound healing at 48 h (Fig 4 K and L) and 40% reduction of dermis macrophages at the wound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of CXCL12-expressing L. reuteri on accumulation of wound macrophages and acceleration of healing was abolished (Fig 4 M and N), illustrating the causal correlation between wound macrophages and accelerated healing by CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whereas the density of collagen I or fibronectin in the dermis closest to the wound remained unaltered (Fig S4 DF), CXCL12-expressing L. reuteri increased the amount of laminin present at this site (Fig S4 D and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Improved_Reepithelialization_of_Wounded_Human_Skin_Disks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effects of CXCL12-producing L. reuteri was tested on healthy human skin in an in vitro model of wound reepithelialization, whereby newly formed epidermal sleeves partly cover the exposed dermis in wounded skin disks cultured in 10% FCS medium (positive control) while being barely detectable in disks cultured in 2% FCS medium (negative control; Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells in the epidermal sleeves expressed keratin (Fig S5A), and keratinocytes migrated over the exposed dermis toward the wound center (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of the epidermal sleeves (i.e., reepithelialization) was increased after treatment with L. reuteri expressing human CXCL12 for 14 d (Fig 5B), and more keratinocytes in the basal layer within 250 µm from the wound edge proliferated (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Few cells were found to proliferate in the dermis beneath the wounds irrespective of conditions (Fig 5D and Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skin morphology was maintained by L. reuteri treatment, and epidermis thickening at the wound edge, a hallmark of healing tissues, was macroscopically detected (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of L. reuteri to the cultured skin disks lowered the pH of the medium after 24 h (Fig 5E), which did not impact sleeve length or epidermal proliferation (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, MHC II+ cells detected in cultured skin disks increased in numbers by hCXCL12-expressing L. reuteri (Fig 5 F and G), demonstrating macrophage proliferation also in the wound model of human skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Improved_Wound_Healing_During_Peripheral_Ischemia_or_Hyperglycemia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After induction of hind-limb ischemia (a model of peripheral ischemia), the cutaneous perfusion was reduced by 50% at the day of wound induction (Fig S6A), which resulted in impaired wound healing and prolonged mean time to complete healing (to 10 d; Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2C and S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri again accelerated wound closure compared with untreated or LB-treated wounds, which was most prominent during the first day following wound induction (Fig 6A), resulting in reduced wound area and faster wound healing (Fig 6 B and C and Fig S6 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice that were rendered severely hyperglycemic before wound induction had altered wound healing and basal skin blood perfusion (Fig S6 E and K), and remained hyperglycemic (16.7 mmol/L) with maintained body weight during the experiment (Fig S6 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the severely hyperglycemic mice, treatment with L. reuteri-delivering CXCL12 accelerated wound closure at 2 d after wound induction (Fig 6D) but not at later time points (Fig 6 E and F and Fig S6 HJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the moderate hyperglycemic model (11.1 mmol/L), the wound healing was impaired (Fig S6L) and mice remained moderately hyperglycemic during the experiment (Fig S6 M and N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, treatment with L. reuteri-delivering CXCL12 accelerated wound closure at day 1 after wound induction (Fig 6G), but not at later time points (Fig 6 H and I and Fig S6 OQ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Normalized_Wound_Blood-Flow_Response_in_Hyperglycemic_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Blood flow at the site of injury is characterized by rapid vasoconstriction followed by transient hyperemia during the inflammatory phase (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, the hyperemic phase seen in the skin around the wound (0300 µm) lasted for 3 d (Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hyperemia was absent in mice with hind-limb ischemia and also after treatment with control and CXCL12-expressing L. reuteri (Fig S7 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the severely hyperglycemic mice, the basal skin perfusion was reduced already before wound induction (Fig S6K), and the wound-induced hyperemia was absent (Fig S7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, treatment with CXCL12-expressing bacteria in hyperglycemic mice normalized the blood-flow increase around the wound (Fig S7F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Initial_Safety_and_Stability_Studies_Support_Drug_Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
No systemic exposure was detected, as circulating CXCL12 did not increase with treatment with CXCL12-producing bacteria (2 × 109 lactobacilli per wound) to open wounds (Fig 7A) despite increased dermal CXCL12 close to the wound (Fig 1 DG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, no translocation of lactobacilli from wound to circulation was detected, even with a 100-fold higher dose (blood cultures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Topical application of L. reuteri to wounds did not increase local inflammation-induced hyperemia; in fact, the hyperemic phase was abolished by the treatment (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the inflammatory response of wound induction is reduced by L. reuteri treatment, and that addition of the bacteria to open wounds does not cause local inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To facilitate off-the-shelf use, freeze-dried formulations of CXCL12-producing bacteria were developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following bacterial resuspension and induction, maintained plasmid expression was detected in vitro (Fig 7C) and in vivo (Fig 7D) in wounds, and maintained biological effect was demonstrated as accelerated wound closure compared with untreated wounds or wounds treated with control L. reuteri (Fig 7 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, freeze-dried formulations demonstrated maintained stability and efficacy on wound healing and therefore represent an attractive approach for future pharmaceutical development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study demonstrates efficient means to accelerate cutaneous wound healing through bioengineering of the wound microenvironment by local overexpression of CXCL12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this, a system that generates sustained chemokine delivery and increases chemokine bioavailability within the wound was developed by using genetically modified Lactobacillus bacteria as vectors (described in Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transformed Lactobacillus expressed and released high levels of CXCL12 for 1 h following induction and topical administration to cutaneous wounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, these bacteria enhanced chemokine bioavailability by producing lactic acid, which reduced local pH and thereby prevented CXCL12 degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach resulted in greatly accelerated wound healing in a macrophage-dependent manner in the skin of healthy mice, as well as in mice with reduced skin perfusion or hyperglycemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accelerated wound healing was also confirmed in a human skin wound model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wound healing is a complex biological process, and therapeutic enhancement has proven difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with large and chronic wounds rely on removal of necrotic tissue, changes of wound dressings, and frequent antibiotic therapies to avoid systemic spread of infectious bacteria that colonize the wound (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boosting the signals that stimulate healing within the local microenvironment has been explored by using topical administration of certain growth factors and chemokines alone or coupled to different biomaterials (18, 2730).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In preclinical models, local overexpression or administration of chemokine-loaded hydrogels (CXCL12 or CCL2) have been reported to improve wound healing (18, 28, 30, 31), and CXCR2/ mice were shown to exhibit impaired healing (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite promising experimental effects, clinical translation is hampered at least in part by high levels of proteolytic enzymes within the wound (33), which limits protein bioavailability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of these proteolytic enzymes (DPP4/CD26) has yielded interesting results, and improved wound healing was observed in CD26/ mice (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DPP4/CD26 inhibition is already in clinical use to lower blood glucose levels, and a recent review reports positive effects of this treatment on healing of diabetic foot ulcers (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another way to override local protein degradation is to deliver protein-producing cells to the wound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells expressing the chemokine CXCL12 have been reported to accelerate cutaneous wound healing following injection in the wound edge (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is excellent for experimental delivery of CXCL12, but faces significant difficulties when clinical feasibility and regulatory aspects are taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study uses the probiotic (i.e., health-promoting, nonpathogenic) bacteria L. reuteri as local protein-producing bioreactors, which normally are sparsely present on the skin (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of lactobacilli as vectors to deliver protein has been reported in models of colitis, in which IL-10 delivered by Lactobacillus casei was shown to ameliorate inflammation (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, L. lactis producing active IL-22 is a promising system as a living vaccine adjuvant (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lactobacilli produce lactic acid and thereby reduce local pH when applied to wounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local pH regulates biological actions of chemokines by affecting their combination and conformation, but also their degradation by extracellular enzymes (25, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The superior effect on wound healing by our genetically modified Lactobacillus compared with rCXCL12 depended on the local pH reduction by bacterial lactic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced pH increased chemokine bioavailability by preventing peptidase CD26 from cleaving and inactivating CXCL12, as previously shown (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Macrophages are key players in wound healing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They dynamically change function throughout the healing process, as they phagocytose cellular debris, apoptotic cells, and invading organisms, as well as instruct epithelial and endothelial cells, fibroblasts, stem cells, and other immune cells by releasing multiple paracrine factors (14, 3941).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, macrophage depletion at early stages of wound healing attenuated epithelialization, granulation tissue formation, and wound contraction (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TGF- is a central signaling molecule in tissue restoration, as it stimulates chemotaxis, wound contraction, angiogenesis, and deposition of ECM (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antiinflammatory macrophages fuel tissue restoration by being the main source of TGF- (9, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, the most prominent effect on wound healing by the CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri was during the first 24 h following wound induction and treatment, which coincided with increased TGF- levels in the dermis and higher numbers of TGF-+ macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the observed accelerated wound closure by bacteria-delivered CXCL12 is at least partly the result of an amplified repair program by the increased population of TGF-producing macrophages, which further instruct other cells involved in the wound healing process (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wound healing is a metabolically active process, and sufficient blood supply is a prerequisite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basal blood flow and vasomotion are reduced in limbs in persons with peripheral ischemic diseases or diabetes, and these conditions are highly associated with development of chronic wounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, the effect of the CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri on wound healing was investigated in models of peripheral ischemic disease and diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skin perfusion was demonstrated to be reduced in both of these models, and treatment with CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri again accelerated wound closure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the initial hyperemic response to wound induction was absent in mice with induced peripheral ischemia or hyperglycemia, but was restored in the hyperglycemic mice treated with CXCL12-delivering L. reuteri.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have developed a technology platform of local CXCL12 delivery and prolonged bioavailability in wounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the use of this approach, bioengineering of the wound microenvironment resulted in reprogramming of wound macrophages into the restitution phenotype and thereby a unique efficacy on acceleration of cutaneous wound healing in three different mouse models and human skin biopsy specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The delivery system was confirmed to be clinically and commercially feasible in preclinical models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
