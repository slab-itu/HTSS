Thioredoxin-like2/2-Cys peroxiredoxin redox cascade supports oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ensure efficient photosynthetic carbon gain, plant chloroplasts have to adjust their own physiology toward changes in light environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific chloroplast proteins are reversibly activatedinactivated during lightdark cycles by switching the reductionoxidation states of their Cys residues, which is termed redox regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A long-standing issue in plant biology is the manner in which redox-regulated proteins are reoxidized upon the interruption of light exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we identified the thioredoxin-like2 (TrxL2)/2-Cys peroxiredoxin (2CP) redox cascade as a molecular basis for oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding dissects the dark side of chloroplast redox regulation, providing an insight into how plants rest their photosynthetic activity at night.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thiol-based redox regulation is central to adjusting chloroplast functions under varying light conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A redox cascade via the ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (FTR)/thioredoxin (Trx) pathway has been well recognized to mediate the light-responsive reductive control of target proteins; however, the molecular basis for reoxidizing its targets in the dark remains unidentified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a mechanism of oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We biochemically characterized a chloroplast stroma-localized atypical Trx from Arabidopsis, designated as Trx-like2 (TrxL2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrxL2 had redox-active properties with an unusually less negative redox potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By an affinity chromatography-based method, TrxL2 was shown to interact with a range of chloroplast redox-regulated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct discrimination of thiol status indicated that TrxL2 can efficiently oxidize, but not reduce, these proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A notable exception was found in 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (2CP); TrxL2 was able to reduce 2CP with high efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We achieved a complete in vitro reconstitution of the TrxL2/2CP redox cascade for oxidizing redox-regulated proteins and draining reducing power to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further addressed the physiological relevance of this system by analyzing protein-oxidation dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Arabidopsis plants, a decreased level of 2CP led to the impairment of the reoxidation of redox-regulated proteins during lightdark transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A delayed response of protein reoxidation was concomitant with the prolonged accumulation of reducing power in TrxL2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest an in vivo function of the TrxL2/2CP redox cascade for driving oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TrxL2_Is_Localized_to_Chloroplast_Stroma  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic and phylogenic studies have identified multiple Trx-like proteins in plants (14); however, their biochemical or physiological characteristics remain largely unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we noted one type of Trx-like proteins possessing a putative active site motif of WCRKC (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This atypical Trx motif is marked by two positively charged hydrophilic amino acids (Arg and Lys) between the Cys residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protein was previously termed WCRKC Trx (15) or TrxL2 (14); we adopted the latter name in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Arabidopsis, TrxL2 is encoded by two genes (At5g06690 for TrxL2.1 and At5g04260 for TrxL2.2) (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both isoforms have been previously shown to be targeted to chloroplast stroma by in vitro protein import assays (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated whether TrxL2 is physically associated with the thylakoid membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intact chloroplasts were isolated from Arabidopsis leaves and then fractionated into stroma and thylakoid membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblotting analyses using antibodies against TrxL2.1 and TrxL2.2 indicated that both TrxL2 isoforms are exclusively localized to chloroplast stroma (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TrxL2_Is_a_Redox-Mediator_Protein_with_an_Unusually_Less_Negative_Redox_Potential  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain biochemical clues into TrxL2 functions, we prepared recombinant proteins of two TrxL2 isoforms from Arabidopsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Redox state discrimination using the thiol-modifying reagent 4-acetamido-4-maleimidylstilbene-2,2-disulfonate (AMS) indicated that both TrxL2 isoforms form an intramolecular disulfide bond in the WCRKC motif, which is cleaved upon reduction (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrxL2.2 partially formed a homodimer linked by the intermolecular disulfide bond under oxidative conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be caused by its additional Cys residue (Cys82), which is not conserved in TrxL2.1 and other plant orthologs (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that TrxL2 has a DTT-dependent insulin reduction activity (SI Appendix, Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that, as in the case with Trx, TrxL2 can perform a dithioldisulfide exchange reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the midpoint redox potential (Em) of TrxL2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By fitting the reduction level under several redox buffers to the Nernst equation, the Em of TrxL2.1 and TrxL2.2 at pH 7.5 was determined to be 258 ± 2 mV and 245 ± 2 mV, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Em of Arabidopsis chloroplast redox-mediator proteins, including FTR catalytic subunit (FTR-C) (16), 10 Trx isoforms (11, 16), and NADPH-Trx reductase C (NTRC) (17), are summarized in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It became evident that the Em of TrxL2 is substantially higher (less negative) than those of other redox-mediator proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TrxL2_Has_a_Cross-Talk_with_Various_Redox-Regulated_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We explored TrxL2-interacting proteins in chloroplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we applied an affinity chromatography-based screening method (18) using TrxL2 monocysteinic mutants (TrxL2CS) as bait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chloroplast soluble proteins extracted from spinach leaves were loaded onto a TrxL2CS-immobilized affinity chromatography column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins associated with TrxL2CS via the mixed-disulfide bond were eluted by DTT and then identified using mass spectrometry (SI Appendix, Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some proteins, including Rubisco activase (RCA) and 2CP, were identified as possible TrxL2-interacting partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analyses of protein elution patterns by immunoblotting indicated that fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase), NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH), ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), and peroxiredoxin Q (PrxQ) were also bound to TrxL2CS (SI Appendix, Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noticed that most of these are already known to be Trx-targeted proteins that exhibit dynamic redox shifts in response to changes in light intensity (12, 13, 1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TrxL2_Fails_to_Reduce_FBPase__SBPase__and_RCA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The capture of several Trx-targeted proteins by TrxL2CS (described above) raised the possibility that TrxL2 has an overlapping function with Trx as a reductive regulatory factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus examined whether TrxL2 can reduce the proteins captured by TrxL2CS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For use as targets, three recombinant proteins involved in the CO2 fixation (FBPase, SBPase, and RCA) were prepared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with earlier studies (10, 11, 22), these three proteins were specifically (for FBPase) or favorably (for SBPase and RCA) shifted from oxidized to reduced forms by f-type Trx (Trx-f) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, FBPase, SBPase, or RCA was not efficiently reduced by TrxL2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TrxL2_Reduces_2CP_with_High_Efficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further addressed the reduction ability of TrxL2 using other target candidate proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two different types of Prx (2CP and PrxQ) serve in the antioxidant defense system by detoxifying H2O2, a byproduct of photosynthesis (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike other Trx-targeted proteins subject to redox-dependent activity control, these Prxs require reducing power for their catalytic processes directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Arabidopsis has two isoforms of 2CP, 2CPA and 2CPB, with almost identical amino acid sequences; the former was used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxidized form of 2CP exists as a homodimer linked by the intermolecular disulfide bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Trxs, TrxL2 converted 2CPA from oxidized to reduced forms (Fig 2B, Upper), indicating the ability of TrxL2 to transfer reducing power to 2CP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrxL2 could reduce PrxQ as well (Fig 2B, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compared the efficiencies of TrxL2 and Trx-f in reducing these Prxs in more detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The redox shift pattern of 2CPA was analyzed with changing the concentration of DTT, a source of reducing power (Fig 2C and SI Appendix, Fig S6A) or the reaction time (Fig 2D and SI Appendix, Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, TrxL2 showed much higher efficiency in reducing 2CPA than that of Trx-f. By contrast, such dominant reducing function of TrxL2 was not observed toward PrxQ (Fig 2 E and F and SI Appendix, Fig S6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have previously shown that Trx-f has a comparatively high 2CP-reducing activity among five Trx subtypes (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the present finding has important implications for quite efficient coupling of TrxL2 to 2CP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further monitored the H2O2-detoxifying activity of 2CP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the conditions tested here, the activity of 2CP was low in the absence of TrxL2, but largely promoted by the addition of TrxL2 (SI Appendix, Fig S6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TrxL2_May_Utilize_Reducing_Power_from_Glutathione_and_NADPH_Pools__but_Its_Efficiency_Is_Low  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the next important issue, we attempted to identify the reducing power donor of TrxL2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A poplar TrxL2 ortholog has been reported to receive reducing power from reduced glutathione (GSH) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this report, we detected a GSH-dependent shift from oxidized to reduced forms in TrxL2, but its redox change was limited to only a slight level (SI Appendix, Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated whether glutaredoxin (Grx) can promote TrxL2 reduction in the presence of GSH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two types of chloroplast Grx, GrxC5 and GrxS12, were prepared (25), both of which exhibited GSH-dependent insulin reduction activity (SI Appendix, Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither GrxC5 nor GrxS12 facilitated TrxL2 reduction significantly (SI Appendix, Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also addressed NTRC, a notable redox-mediator protein that uses NADPH as a source of reducing power (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrxL2.1, but not TrxL2.2, was able to be partially reduced in an NTRC-dependent manner (SI Appendix, Fig S7 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further assessed the possibility that FTR acts as the transmitter of reducing power to TrxL2 (SI Appendix, Fig S7 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, FTR could reduce Trx-f (SI Appendix, Fig S7F) and other all subtypes of chloroplast Trx (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, FTR failed to reduce TrxL2 (SI Appendix, Fig S7 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, it was shown that TrxL2 has the potential to use reducing power from GSH and NADPH pools, but its efficiency is low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, therefore, considered that TrxL2 needs other sources of reducing power to achieve adequate activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TrxL2_Efficiently_Oxidizes_RCA__FBPase__and_SBPase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A remarkably less negative redox potential (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S4) and a physical interaction with several redox-regulated protein (SI Appendix, Fig S5) led us to wonder whether TrxL2 may have an ability to oxidize redox-regulated proteins; we next addressed this possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RCA was first tested as an example of oxidation targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RCA was precedently reduced using DTT and Trx-f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, DTT and Trx-f were removed by gel filtration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RCA in the highly reduced state was incubated with an equimolar concentration of TrxL2 in the oxidized state (2 M each), and time-dependent changes in their redox states were analyzed (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of TrxL2, RCA maintained its reduced state for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, RCA was gradually oxidized in the presence of TrxL2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this oxidation response was concomitant with TrxL2 reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strongly suggest that TrxL2 can receive reducing power directly from RCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed similar experiments using other redox-regulated proteins (FBPase and SBPase) as oxidation targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A whole set of the resulting SDS/PAGE profiles and the quantitative data on the redox changes are described in SI Appendix, Fig S8 and Fig 3 BD, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RCA, FBPase, and SBPase were commonly oxidized in a TrxL2-dependent manner, although their extents and kinetics were not uniform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we investigated whether Trxs can oxidize these proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trx-f oxidized each target, but its efficiency was lower than that of TrxL2 in all cases (Fig 3 BD and SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S9 shows the target reduction levels upon incubation with other Trx subtypes (m, x, y, and z) for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Trxs were also less effective in oxidizing each of the targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these results let us conclude that TrxL2 is an efficient oxidation factor of several redox-regulated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_TrxL2_2CP_Redox_Cascade_Oxidizes_Target_Proteins_and_Drains_Reducing_Power_to_H2O2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The estimated in vivo amounts of TrxL2.1 and TrxL2.2 were 1.4 ± 0.1 and 2.4 ± 0.8 nmol/g leaf protein, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S10), which are roughly 10-fold lower than that of FBPase (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a variety of redox-regulated proteins coexist in chloroplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thus unlikely that TrxL2 can function as the final acceptor of reducing power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, TrxL2 must continue to drain reducing power to ensure an efficient oxidation reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong candidates for the acceptor are 2CP and its downstream molecule H2O2 (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the basis of this hypothesis, we attempted to reconstitute a redox cascade from redox-regulated proteins to H2O2 (SI Appendix, Fig S11 for the raw data on the SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting images, and Fig 4 for the quantitative data on the redox changes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, each redox-regulated protein (RCA, FBPase, or SBPase), TrxL2, and 2CPA were incubated at a molar ratio of 5:1:2 (in micromoles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An excess of H2O2 (100 M) was added to the reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein bands of RCA, FBPase, and SBPase overlapped with that of oxidized 2CPA in the SDS/PAGE, making it difficult to discriminate their redox state precisely; therefore, they were detected by immunoblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RCA was largely maintained in the reduced form even in the presence of 2CPA and H2O2 (Fig 4A, Left and SI Appendix, Fig S11A), indicating that the redox state of RCA is hardly affected by 2CPA or H2O2 directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, TrxL2 by itself could oxidize RCA only slightly, possibly due to the limited molar amount of TrxL2 compared with that of RCA (one to five).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when 2CPA and H2O2 were incubated together, TrxL2 exerted a drastically elevated activity to oxidize RCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, TrxL2 was present in a nearly completely oxidized form (Fig 4A, Right and SI Appendix, Fig S11A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that 2CPA and H2O2 robustly withdrew reducing power from TrxL2, conferring strong oxidative force on TrxL2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, we have attained an in vitro reconstitution of the TrxL2/2CP redox cascade for oxidizing RCA and draining reducing power to H2O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TrxL2/2CP redox cascade was capable of oxidizing FBPase and SBPase as well, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig 4 B and C and SI Appendix, Fig S11 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_TrxL2_2CP_Redox_Cascade_Functions_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown the biochemical basis for oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another important issue is the physiological relevance of this system; we addressed this using Arabidopsis mutant plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained T-DNA insertion mutants in the 2CPA and 2CPB genes (2cpa and 2cpb, respectively) and their double mutant (2cpa 2cpb).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These plants were cultivated under long-day conditions (16-h day/8-h night) (SI Appendix, Fig S12A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-PCR analysis indicated that both of the 2CPA and 2CPB transcripts were largely lowered to an almost undetectable level in the corresponding mutants (SI Appendix, Fig S12B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblotting analysis indicated that 2CP protein was lowered to 2530%, 5055%, and 1015% of the wild-type level in 2cpa, 2cpb, and 2cpa 2cpb, respectively (SI Appendix, Fig S12C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, there was no clear difference in the protein levels of Trxs, TrxL2, NTRC, and PrxQ between wild-type and mutant plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aboveground biomass, chlorophyll content, and chlorophyll a/b ratio were also unchanged in all of the mutants (SI Appendix, Fig S12 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some proteins involved in photosynthetic electron transport, including the light-harvesting complex protein LHCA1, PSII core D1 protein, and cytochrome b6, normally accumulated in mutants as in the wild type (SI Appendix, Fig S12C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further evaluated photosynthetic electron transport efficiency (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggested that all mutants could perform photosynthetic electron transport comparable to that of wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From all of these data, we conclude that the lack of 2CP does not result in drastic phenotypic changes in Arabidopsis, at least under the growth conditions tested in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using these plants, we studied protein-oxidation dynamics during lightdark transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were dark adapted for 12 h, irradiated with high light (HL) (700 mol photons m2s1) for 30 min, and then returned to the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The redox state of Trx-targeted proteins, Trxs, and TrxL2 was sequentially determined under this experimental scheme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photosynthetic electron transport parameters were almost identical among plants during the analysis (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 5A illustrates the redox behavior of the ATP synthase CF1- subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CF1- was fully reduced upon HL and gradually reoxidized during the subsequent dark incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the wild type, CF1- was nearly completely reoxidized 30 min after the onset of the dark period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, approximately half of the CF1- remained in the reduced form in 2cpa 2cpb at the same time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other Trx-targeted proteins, including RCA, FBPase, and SBPase, also showed the dynamic redox shift from reduced to oxidized forms during lightdark transitions (Fig 5 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the case of CF1-, the reoxidation of these proteins was partially impaired in mutant plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of such impairments was correlated to the accumulation level of 2CP (SI Appendix, Fig S12C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly indicate that 2CP is a key factor in oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 6 AD shows the redox behavior of four Trx isoforms in chloroplasts (Trx-f1, Trx-m2, Trx-x, and Trx-y2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accord with our earlier observations (11, 13, 17), Trxs were partially reduced upon HL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When plants were transferred back to the dark, the redox state of Trxs rapidly returned to the original dark-adapted level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, Trx-f1, Trx-m2, and Trx-y2 recovered their redox states within 2 min of dark incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no clear change in the redox behaviors of Trxs between wild-type and mutant plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that reducing power transfer via Trxs is dependent on the light-driven electron transport chain and is unaffected by the presence or absence of 2CP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two TrxL2 isoforms showed different redox behaviors by HL/dark treatments (Fig 6 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrxL2.1 was entirely converted from oxidized to reduced forms upon HL (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike Trxs, TrxL2.1 was maintained in a fully reduced state even 10 min after the onset of the dark period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the wild type, TrxL2.1 then began to be reoxidized, reaching a completely oxidized state after 30 min in the dark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrxL2.1 reoxidation was slightly delayed in 2cpa and 2cpb single mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More remarkably, dark-responsive TrxL2.1 reoxidation was nearly completely blocked in 2cpa 2cpb double mutant; namely, the lack of 2CP resulted in the accumulation of massive reducing power in TrxL2.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide direct evidence of in vivo cross-talk between TrxL2.1 and 2CP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, TrxL2.2 did not shift the redox state during lightdark transitions (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein signal detected here corresponded to AMS-unlabeled TrxL2.2 (SI Appendix, Fig S15), indicating that TrxL2.2 existed constitutively in the disulfide bond-forming oxidized state irrespective of light conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was common to wild-type and mutant plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thus likely that TrxL2.2 was strongly oxidized by as yet unidentified factors other than 2CP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We finally characterized the redox change of 2CP itself in the wild-type plant (Fig 6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the dark-adapted state, almost all 2CP was present in the oxidized form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 20% of 2CP was converted to the reduced form upon HL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this 2CP redox state was maintained even after dark treatment for 30 min, indicating that 2CP sustained to be supplied with reducing power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the data on protein redox dynamics are in line with the idea that (i) redox-regulated proteins are oxidized by TrxL2 and (ii) 2CP continuously transfers reducing power from TrxL2 to H2O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore conclude that the TrxL2/2CP redox cascade is a functional system for oxidative thiol modulation in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thiol-based redox regulation allows chloroplast proteins to flexibly and appropriately tune their enzymatic functions in response to changes in light environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FTR/Trx redox cascade is well recognized to support the light-dependent reductive response of target proteins (1, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the mechanism underlying their reoxidation process, which is observed during lightdark transitions, has been a matter of debate for a long time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we clarified a redox cascade that enables oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_TrxL2_2CP_Redox_Cascade_Can_Oxidize_Various_Redox-Regulated_Proteins_in_Chloroplasts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the course of biochemical characterization of Arabidopsis TrxL2, we noticed that this protein has the potential as an oxidation factor for redox-regulated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, TrxL2 showed a quite less negative redox potential (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S4) and a proteinprotein interaction with various redox-regulated proteins via the mixed-disulfide bond (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This potential activity of TrxL2 was experimentally demonstrated to be true; TrxL2 could oxidize RCA, FBPase, and SBPase efficiently (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be mentioned that Trx-f (and some of other Trx subtypes) was also able to oxidize these proteins to some extent (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is to be expected, given that Trx-f is a preferred partner for the redox regulation of these three proteins (10, 11, 22) and the redox potential of Trx-f is comparable to those of FBPase and SBPase (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular functions of TrxL2 are crucially different from those of Trxs in the following aspects: First, TrxL2 shows higher protein-oxidizing efficiency (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S8); second, TrxL2 has little or no activity to reduce redox-regulated proteins (Fig 2A); and third, TrxL2 fails to receive reducing power from FTR (SI Appendix, Fig S7 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrxL2 is thus a redox-mediator protein specialized for oxidizing redox-regulated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another biochemical feature of TrxL2 is underlined by the high catalytic rate in transferring reducing power to 2CP (Fig 2 E and D and SI Appendix, Fig S6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to its high affinity to H2O2 (e.g., micromolar range of Km value) (23, 29), 2CP can easily consume reducing power supplied by TrxL2, thus allowing TrxL2 to continuously oxidize redox-regulated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the in vitro reconstitution experiment demonstrated that the protein-oxidizing activity of TrxL2 is strongly dependent on 2CP and H2O2 (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The involvement of 2CP in protein oxidation has already been proposed (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to these studies, the atypical Cys His-rich Trx (ACHT) serves as the oxidative thiol modulator and the transmitter of reducing power to 2CP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, its oxidation target reported so far is limited to AGPase (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, TrxL2 was shown to extensively oxidize RCA, FBPase, and SBPase (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides, NADP-MDH and AGPase may be additional oxidation targets of TrxL2 (SI Appendix, Fig S5), although they are still candidates for further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these data, we can consider the TrxL2/2CP redox cascade to be a previously unreported system for oxidizing a range of redox-regulated proteins in chloroplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies are needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the high protein-oxidizing ability of TrxL2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the structural information on a poplar TrxL2 ortholog, which has been recently reported (32), is helpful to attain this goal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

It is of great importance to understand the in vivo dynamics of oxidative thiol modulation in chloroplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In living plants, the protein redox state is determined by the balance of reduction and oxidation rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TrxL2/2CP redox cascade certainly works even under light conditions, as evidenced by the fact that TrxL2.1 and 2CP were reduced upon HL (Fig 6 E and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, redox-regulated proteins, including CF1-, RCA, FBPase, and SBPase existed in almost fully reduced forms under identical conditions (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the protein-reducing rate by the FTR/Trx pathway overwhelmed the oxidizing rate (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When light is interrupted, the TrxL2/2CP redox cascade becomes dominant and thereby triggers the apparent oxidative thiol modulation (Fig 7B); this scenario is well supported by the dataset of redox dynamics in vivo (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrxL2 is widely conserved in land plants (SI Appendix, Fig S1), but not in cyanobacteria and some algae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the TrxL2/2CP pathway is thought to be an elaborate system acquired during adaptation to terrestrial environments, allowing chloroplasts to turn off the photosynthetic metabolism at night.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A delayed response of protein reoxidation (Fig 5) and a prolonged accumulation of reducing power in TrxL2.1 (Fig 6E), which were observed in 2CP-less mutants, underpin the significant impact of the TrxL2/2CP pathway on oxidative thiol modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the data on these mutants also provide implications of a more complicated protein-oxidizing network in chloroplasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that protein reoxidation occurred even in 2cpa 2cpb double mutants (Fig 5), other redox-mediator proteins and Prxs may redundantly serve in the protein-oxidizing pathway (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the in vitro study, Trxs possessed partial activity to oxidize some redox-regulated proteins (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Trxs were immediately reoxidized in the dark (Fig 6 AD), indicating that they mainly function in transmitting the light-dependent reductive signal to redox-regulated proteins, as is classically accepted (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it is highly possible that some Trx-like proteins with high redox potentials (such as ACHT) (33) participate in the protein-oxidizing network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that TrxL2.2 was stably present in the oxidized form irrespective of light conditions or plant genotypes (Fig 6F), some unidentified factors are also likely to reside in TrxL2.2 downstream and constitutively oxidize this protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, NTRC may indirectly affect the protein-oxidizing rate by modulating the redox state of the 2CP pool (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate that the dark side of chloroplast redox regulation is supported by the TrxL2/2CP redox cascade, but also open the door for exploring its overall regulatory network and functional coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preparation_of_Expression_Plasmids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana as described previously (36) and used as a template for RT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene fragments encoding the predicted mature protein region of TrxL2.1 (At5g06690.1; Met77-Val210), TrxL2.2 (At5g04260; Ala56-Thr192), RCA (At2g39730.1; Ala59-Phe474), GrxC5 (At4g28730; Ser64-Ser174), and GrxS12 (At2g20270; Ser69-Thr206) were cloned into the pET-23c expression vector (Novagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmids for TrxL2.1 and TrxL2.2 were designed to express N-terminal His-tagged fusion proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primers and restriction enzymes used for expression plasmid construction are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequences of expression plasmids were confirmed to be correct by DNA sequencing (3730xl DNA Analyzer; Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other expression plasmids were prepared in our earlier studies (11, 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Point mutations in TrxL2CS (Cys133 to Ser in TrxL2.1; Cys113 to Ser in TrxL2.2) were introduced using the PrimeSTAR Mutagenesis Basal Kit (Takara) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primers used for site-directed mutagenesis are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Expression_and_Purification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each expression plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (for TrxL2.1, TrxL2.2, GrxC5, and GrxS12) or Rosetta (DE3) pLysS (for RCA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio--d-galactopyranoside followed by overnight culture at 21 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were disrupted by sonication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After centrifugation (125,000 × g for 40 min), the resulting supernatant was used to purify the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  His-tagged TrxL2.1 and TrxL2.2 proteins were purified using a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column as described previously (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RCA, GrxC5, and GrxS12 proteins were purified by a combination of anion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic-interaction chromatography, and size-exclusion chromatography, as described previously (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other recombinant proteins were prepared as described previously (11, 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay (Pierce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discrimination_of_Protein_Redox_State_Using_Thiol-Modifying_Reagents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The redox state of proteins was determined by discriminating the thiol status with the use of thiol-modifying reagents AMS or N-ethylmaleimide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMS has a molecular mass of 536.44 and thereby lowers protein mobility on SDS/PAGE, allowing the determination of protein redox state from an observable band shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the in vitro reaction, proteins were precipitated with 10% (wt/vol) trichloroacetic acid and then washed with ice-cold acetone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitated proteins were labeled with the thiol-modifying reagents described in each figure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were subjected to nonreducing SDS/PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB) unless otherwise specified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Insulin_Reduction_Activity_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insulin reduction activity was measured as described previously (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For TrxL2.1 and TrxL2.2, 0.5 mM DTT was added as the reductant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For GrxC5 and GrxS12, 2 mM GSH was added as the reductant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Em_Determination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Em of TrxL2.1 and TrxL2.2 was determined under the same conditions as those of our previous assays (11, 16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of reduced DTT (DTTred) to oxidized DTT (DTTox) used for the titration ranged from 1 × 105 to 5 × 102.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assays were performed at pH 7.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Screening_for_TrxL2-Interacting_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The method of Trx affinity chromatography (18) was applied to screen for TrxL2-interacting proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrxL2 monocysteinic mutants (TrxL2.1CS and TrxL2.2CS) were used as baits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chloroplast soluble proteins were obtained by collecting intact chloroplasts from spinach leaves and disrupting these by osmotic stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent procedures were similar to those described previously (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reducing_Power_Transfer_Reactions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proteins were reacted under the indicated conditions in medium containing 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mM NaCl at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All reactions were conducted under aerobic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The redox state of proteins was determined as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For protein-oxidizing experiments, target proteins (RCA, FBPase, or SBPase; 50 M each) were incubated with 25 M Trx-f1 and 5 mM DTT for 30 min before the assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduced target proteins were then collected by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

H2O2-Detoxifying_Activity_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
H2O2-detoxifying activity was measured according to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38. with modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For monitoring 2CP activity, 2CPA (2 M) was incubated with 0.5 mM DTT, 1 M TrxL2, and 0.1 mM H2O2 in a medium containing 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mM NaCl for the indicated time at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of H2O2 was then determined by the ferrous oxidation of xylenol orange assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimation_of_TrxL2_Amount_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The in vivo amount of TrxL2 was estimated by an immunoblotting-based method, as previously described (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the regression line of signal intensity was generated on a dilution series of the recombinant protein, which was used as a reference for calculating the amount in Arabidopsis leaf extracts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plant_Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A. thaliana wild-type plant (Col-0) and homozygous T-DNA insertion mutants in 2CPA (At3g11630) and 2CPB (At5g06290) genes (2cpa, Salk_118663C; 2cpb, Salk_017213C) were used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2cpa 2cpb double mutant was obtained by crossing each single mutant and screening from the F2 generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping was performed by genomic PCR using the primers listed in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were grown in soil in a controlled growth chamber (60 mol photons m2s1, 22 °C, 16-h day/8-h night) for 4 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isolation_and_Subfractionation_of_Arabidopsis_Chloroplasts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the isolation of intact chloroplasts, Arabidopsis wild-type plants were dark incubated overnight to promote starch breakdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 25 g of leaves were homogenized in a blender with 600 mL of grinding solution containing 50 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 330 mM sorbitol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM sodium ascorbate, and 0.05% (wt/vol) BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homogenate was filtered by four layers of gauze and centrifuged at 500 × g for 6 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting precipitates were suspended in wash solution containing 50 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 330 mM sorbitol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM MnCl2, and 1 mM MgCl2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intact chloroplasts were isolated by centrifugation with a discontinuous gradient of 40% (vol/vol) and 70% (vol/vol) Percoll in wash solution at 3,200 × g for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intact chloroplasts were then washed twice by centrifugation with wash solution at 1,300 × g for 2 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intact chloroplasts were osmotically ruptured in solution containing 20 mM Tricine-NaOH (pH 8.0), 5 mM MgCl2, and the cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ruptured chloroplasts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting supernatants and precipitates were collected as stroma and thylakoid membrane fractions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures were conducted at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RT-PCR_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis wild-type and mutant plants as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcript abundance of 2CPA and 2CPB genes was analyzed using primer pairs specific to each gene (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actin 2 (ACT2; At3g18780) was used as the control gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunoblotting_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total leaf protein was extracted as described previously (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies against TrxL2.1 and TrxL2.2 were prepared using each recombinant protein as the antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other antibodies used in this study were prepared previously (11, 13, 17) or commercially available (Agrisera).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chlorophyll_Content_and_a_b_Ratio  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chlorophyll content and a/b ratio were determined after extraction with 80% (vol/vol) acetone according to the method described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Photosynthetic_Electron_Transport_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chlorophyll fluorescence and absorbance change at 830 nm were measured simultaneously using a Dual-PAM-100 (Walz) with the intact leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A saturating pulse of red light (800 ms,  greater than 5,000 mol photons m2s1, 635 nm) was applied to calculate several parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantum yields of PSII [Y (II), Y (NO), and Y (NPQ)] and PSI [Y (I), Y (ND), and Y (NA)] were calculated as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative electron transport rates of PSII (ETR II) and PSI (ETR I) were calculated as Y(II) × light intensity and Y (I) × light intensity, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
