Unique growth strategy in the Earths first trees revealed in silicified fossil trunks from China  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The evolution of trees and forests in the MidLate Devonian Period, 393359 million years ago, profoundly transformed the terrestrial environment and atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oldest fossil trees belong to the Cladoxylopsida.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their water-conducting system is a ring of hundreds of individual strands of xylem (water-conducting cells) that are interconnected in many places.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using anatomically preserved trunks, we show how these trees could grow to a large size by the production of large amounts of soft tissues and new wood around the individual xylem strands and by a controlled structural collapse at the expanding base.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have discovered a complex tree growth strategy unique in Earth history, but with some similarity to that of living palms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cladoxylopsida included the earliest large trees that formed critical components of globally transformative pioneering forest ecosystems in the Mid- and early Late Devonian (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  393372 Ma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Well-known cladoxylopsid fossils include the up to 1-m-diameter sandstone casts known as Eospermatopteris from Middle Devonian strata of New York State.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cladoxylopsid trunk structure comprised a more-or-less distinct cylinder of numerous separate cauline xylem strands connected internally with a network of medullary xylem strands and, near the base, externally with downward-growing roots, all embedded within parenchyma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the means by which this complex vascular system was able to grow to a large diameter is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstratebased on exceptional, up to 70-cm-diameter silicified fossil trunks with extensive preservation of cellular anatomy from the early Late Devonian (Frasnian, ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  374 Ma) of Xinjiang, Chinathat trunk expansion is associated with a cylindrical zone of diffuse secondary growth within ground and cortical parenchyma and with production of a large amount of wood containing both rays and growth increments concentrically around individual xylem strands by normal cambia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The xylem system accommodates expansion by tearing of individual strand interconnections during secondary development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mode of growth seems indeterminate, capable of producing trees of large size and, despite some unique features, invites comparison with secondary development in some living monocots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the structure and growth of cladoxylopsids informs analysis of canopy competition within early forests with the potential to drive global processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results indicate that the large size of Xinicaulis on a scale equivalent to Eospermatopteris was accomplished by a unique form of secondary development, facilitated primarily by a long-acting cylindrical zone of diffuse secondary growth in ground and inner cortical tissues of the base and main trunk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although similar to some monocots in general behavior (23), secondary growth in the stems of Xinicaulis did not produce distinctive radial files of parenchyma or additional vascular strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, continued activity served only to increase overall volume of the stem via mostly unordered parenchyma and created patterned fracturing of the vascular strands at primary xylem dichotomies in both proximal and distal directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since increase in tissue volume has important consequences, both physiological and structural, it seems very likely that all cladoxylopsid plants of tree size using this mode of growth of necessity would have a hollow pith (Fig 3B and Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Xinicaulis is also associated with an equally unusual form of secondary development in which radial files of secondary xylem are produced by cambia around individual cauline strands, medullary strands, and roots rather than forming a single solid cylinder as generally expected in seed plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary xylem greatly increased both conductive capacity and support presumably to keep pace with increasing size of the plant during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that cell walls of the secondary xylem in Xinicaulis are unusually thick, for example, compared with Callixylon (the trunk of the progymnosperm tree Archaeopteris) from the same locality (Fig S7), possibly indicating relatively greater importance of support over conductive capacity in a fibrous plant body overall (and suggesting a significant capacity for cladoxylopsids to drawn-down atmospheric carbon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The manner of secondary development in Xinicaulis seems potentially indeterminate and thus capable of producing trees of very large size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This invites close comparison with Eospermatopteris, with stumps showing similar size and taper as our largest Chinese specimen and with a similar construction of the xylem system including longitudinal cauline xylem strands, anastomosing medullary xylem strands, central pith, and external adventitious roots (1214).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fragmentary coalified, but clearly formerly woody, xylem strands have also been found preserved within Eospermatopteris casts (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike in the large Xinjiang Xinicaulis specimen, the very bottom of the trunk is clearly represented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations of Eospermatopteris suggest the initially upright, upward-dichotomizing, upward-expanding part of the vascular system produced during early development may end up as a radially expanded horizontally almost flattened disk (Fig 1D) in larger trees due to continued lateral diffuse secondary growth combined with longitudinal structural failure with increasing size over time (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By contrast, other cladoxylopsid trees such as Pietzschia so far exhibit only primary growth and retain an intact, partially vascularized pith (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If representative of determinate development, it seems likely that these examples adopted a tree fern strategy (18) whereby upward increasing complexity and size of the primary body (epidogenesis) was supported by an ever-enlarging root mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given what we know at this point in time, there is no reason to preclude intermediate conditions with various degrees of secondary development and a concomitant shift in support strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Most intriguing, perhaps, is the obvious convergence in form and development between Xinicaulis, and by implication some other cladoxylopsids, and living tree-form monocot angiosperms, such as palms, to be contrasted with true secondary development via a single well-organized vascular cambium as seen in most lignophytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although unique in significant respects (production of secondary xylem around each vascular strand via a normal vascular cambium and patterned fracture of the primary xylem architecture during secondary development), the general mode of development of Xinicaulis is nevertheless eminently recognizable among modern forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model of both primary and secondary development in cladoxylopsids that we propose closely follows a long-standing view by Eckhardt (24; also cited in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19, p. 390), so much so that nothing ad hoc seems necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although strikingly similar, it is also reasonably clear that cladoxylopsids and palms evolved these features independently (7), so an analogy in growth can be carried only so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the fact that palms, Xinicaulis, likely Eospermatopteris, and, for that matter, at least some cormose tree lycopsids all share significant structural similarities including few apical meristems, a strong central axis, and many roots of nearly equal size (usually termed rootlets) may indicate what is possible, but perhaps also limiting, in plants of tree size lacking a standard single cylindrical vascular cambium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We predominantly studied thick transverse and longitudinal sections of the silicified trunks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were cut by saw and then polished by hand on a grinding wheel or on a vibrating lap to give a uniform black finish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exposed surfaces were etched for 4590 s in hydrofluoric acid (HF) in a dedicated HF fume hood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testing of these samples showed that there was no need to pretreat the material in HCl to remove carbonates as none were present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction with HF resulted in the carbonized cell walls being clearly visible against the white frosted silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were subsequently rinsed in water with the runoff neutralized in supersaturated sodium carbonate solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After neutralization, the specimens were further washed in running water for several hours and then air-dried.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard protocols and personal protective equipment for HF work were adopted while handling HF and HF-contaminated specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dry specimens were photographed with a Nikon D800 camera and 60-mm macro lens or Leica M12 microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some small thin sections were ground by hand using traditional techniques to study histological details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were photographed using a Leica DMR compound microscope and Leica cameras.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were made using Leica LAS software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All specimens were deposited in the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China, with the prefix PB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
