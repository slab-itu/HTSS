Ancient DNA reveals the Arctic origin of Viking Age cod from Haithabu, Germany  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A rich archaeological record of fish-bone remains testifies to the millennia-long human exploitation of the natural resources of the oceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Europe, historical evidence demonstrates that an extensive international industry developed during the Middle Ages that exported preserved cod from the Lofoten Archipelago, northern Norway, to expanding urban centers around the North and Baltic Sea regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early origins of this iconic exchange, however, have long been debated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We genetically trace the ancestry of Viking Age fish from mainland Europe to the North East Arctic cod population that supports the modern Lofoten fisheries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This application of genome-wide analyses from ancient fish bone reveals an early origin of what became an economically important trade, with implications for archaeology and environmental history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Knowledge of the range and chronology of historic trade and long-distance transport of natural resources is essential for determining the impacts of past human activities on marine environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the specific biological sources of imported fauna are often difficult to identify, in particular if species have a wide spatial distribution and lack clear osteological or isotopic differentiation between populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that ancient fish-bone remains, despite being porous, brittle, and light, provide an excellent source of endogenous DNA (1546%) of sufficient quality for whole-genome reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing ancient sequence data to that of modern specimens, we determine the biological origin of 15 Viking Age (8001066 CE) and subsequent medieval (10661280 CE) Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) specimens from excavation sites in Germany, Norway, and the United Kingdom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Archaeological context indicates that one of these sites was a fishing settlement for the procurement of local catches, whereas the other localities were centers of trade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fish from the trade sites show a mixed ancestry and are statistically differentiated from local fish populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Viking Age samples from Haithabu, Germany, are traced back to the North East Arctic Atlantic cod population that has supported the Lofoten fisheries of Norway for centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results resolve a long-standing controversial hypothesis and indicate that the marine resources of the North Atlantic Ocean were used to sustain an international demand for protein as far back as the Viking Age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Approximate sampling locations of Atlantic cod in the northern Atlantic region in Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) specimens (sample size is indicated between brackets) were obtained from modern populations (black) and archaeological excavations (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NEA sample was obtained in winter, when this population migrates southwards from the Barents Sea to the Lofoten Archipelago to spawn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Lofoten population was sampled during summer when the NEA cod are absent from this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modern range of Atlantic cod is indicated by blue shading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Archaeological Atlantic cod jaw-bone (premaxilla) from Orkney.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We obtained 1,013 million paired reads (average read length 4078 bp) that contained 1546% endogenous DNA and resulted in 1- to 3.4-fold nuclear coverage for 15 of 19 ancient cod samples (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of postmortem degradation patterns showed the typical fragmentation and elevated deamination rates as expected from authentic ancient DNA (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the modern data (Fig 1), an average of 47 million paired reads were obtained per specimen, resulting in ninefold individual coverage of the nuclear genome (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After SNP calling and filtering, we obtained a dataset of 156,695 SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we compared the genome-wide diversity of ancient samples and modern samples using principal component (PCA) and ADMIXTURE analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We excluded the four chromosomes [linkage group (LG)01, 02, 07, and 12] that contain the large inversions (3133), as these distort genetic analyses that assume linkage equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCA shows that three modern populationsNorth East Arctic (NEA), Lofoten and North Seaform a large, overlapping group, with Iceland clustering near the NEA (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the ancient samples cluster with this large group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modern eastern Baltic and Øresund form two distinct groups, with one ancient specimen from Schleswig clustering with the Øresund.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lack of strong genetic population structure between most modern samples is supported by ADMIXTURE, for which the best fit [based on lowest cross-validation (CV) error] is two populations (k = 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, Iceland and eastern Baltic have distinct ancestry, whereas the other modern populations show a more mixed ancestry (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Øresund has a higher level of Baltic ancestry than the other admixed populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All ancient individuals have mixed ancestry, with the one Schleswig sample having a similar level of Baltic ancestry as the modern Øresund.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a lower optimal fit, ADMIXTURE estimates biologically plausible ancestry for k = 3 (identifying an Øresund component) and k = 4 (identifying a North Sea component).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, for k = 5, the model separates the original eastern Baltic cluster rather than differentiating either NEA or Lofoten cod (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these analyses show that the ancient individuals are genetically most related to four modern populations: one Schleswig individual is genetically more similar to the Øresund and all other individuals clearly classify to the NEA, Lofoten, or North Sea population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further differentiate the origins of the ancient individuals, we determined their genotypes for the inversion loci on LG01, 02, 07, and 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern populations can have divergent allele frequencies for these loci (31, 32), and the NEA population is set apart by having inverted alleles near fixation at all four loci (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCAs of these inversions for the four modern populations show the typical trimodal clustering of a biallelic locus with heterozygote genotypes clustering intermediate to the two divergent homozygotes (46) (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All ancient individuals cluster within this trimodel pattern, allowing for the decisive determination of their genotypes at each inversion locus (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collinear alleles dominate in the Orkney samples, while inverted alleles dominate in Haithabu (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bjørkum sample has a predominantly inverted composite genotype, whereas Schleswig and Oslo show a mixed pattern, with one specimen having a collinear and the other having a more inverted composite genotype, in each location, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on their inversion genotypes, we investigated if ancient individuals statistically differed in their resemblance toward a particular modern population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of obtaining an inversion genotype follows a binomial distribution given the underlying allele frequency in a population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can assume independence between loci since the inversions are located on different chromosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thus straightforward to calculate the overall probability of obtaining a composite ancient inversion genotypebased on the four modern populations respective allele frequenciesas a measure of an individuals affinity toward a specific population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this probability, we find that, apart from a single Haithabu specimen, the ancient samples show two types of affinity (Fig 3C); individuals with a predominantly collinear composite genotype have a  greater than 99% probability of being drawn from the Lofoten, the North Sea, or the Øresund population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, individuals with a predominantly inverted composite genotype have a  greater than 99% probability of being drawn solely from the NEA population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atypical Haithabu specimen has a  greater than 99% probability of coming from either the NEA or Lofoten population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By investigating genome-wide patterns of variationincluding four megabase-scale inversions (3134)we show that ancient cod specimens from Viking Age (Haithabu and Bjørkum) and early medieval (Schleswig and Oslo) trading sites have a genomic affinity to the modern North East Arctic population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding has archaeological and evolutionary implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, this study provides a unique genome-wide study of archaeological fish bone and demonstrates its potential as an archive of ancient DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained short reads (less_than100 bp), with the typical fragmentation and cysteine deamination patterns expected after postmortem degradation (4749).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are therefore fully consistent with the extraction and analysis of authentic ancient Atlantic cod DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not all types of animal bone preserve DNA equally well, and significantly higher proportions of endogenous DNA have been found in dense and heavy bone types such as the petrous bone (5052).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is presumed that it is the high density of the bone that leads to reduced bacterial and chemical-mediated decay and improved DNA preservation (50, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis would suggest that fish bonesthat are porous, brittle and lightshould be a poor source of DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we find surprisingly high levels (1546%) of endogenous DNA preservation in 15 of 19 fish bone specimens up to 1,300 y old from five different archeological sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding the use of a recently developed extraction protocol aimed to maximize endogenous DNA (54), this rate of success compares favorably to results from mammalian bones whereby the majority of samplesexcluding petrous bonestypically yield a few percent endogenous DNA at most (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our positive results agree with studies using PCR-based methods that have reported successful amplification from fish bones (5660) in some cases up to 10,000 y old (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation that porous, light fish bones can yield whole genome shotgun libraries with high levels of endogenous DNA underscores our lack of understanding of DNA preservation in different types of animal bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results also illuminate the potential of the large reservoir of archaeological fish bone as a source for aDNA of sufficient quantity and quality to study long-term evolutionary processes in the marine environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, we identify polymorphic chromosomal inversions in ancient Atlantic cod specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromosomal inversions are expected to play a major role in ecological adaptation (62, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cod, these regions contribute to elevated genomic diversification between modern populations and ecotypesdespite low overall levels of divergence (25, 3134, 64)and they have been suspected to be under selection (22, 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high genomic divergence of these alleles, in combination with their wide geographic distribution, suggests that these have been maintained as a polymorphism for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of years (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we directly observe the millennium-long maintenance of such inversions, which provides an opportunity to investigate their temporal stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although speculative due to the currently small samples sizes from Orkney (n = 5) and Haithabu (n = 5), our results suggest that the divergent frequency distributions of these inversions indeed have remained stable in their respective populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the low overall genomic differentiation outside of these inversions in modern populations (3133), it appears that this divergence is sustained despite ongoing gene flow, which further supports a hypothesis that these alleles are maintained as a balanced polymorphism (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we solve a long-standing hypothesis generated by history, archaeology, and stable isotope analysis that dried cod from northern Norway were transported during the Viking Age to Haithabu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the NEA cod feeds in the Barents Sea and its spawning grounds are restricted to the northern coasts of Norway, especially (although not exclusively) in the area around Lofoten (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One could argue that this population spawned in the Skagerrak or Kattegat during the Viking Age, but such a scenario is implausible; historical records of the Norwegian fisheries since the 12th century show that spatial fluctuations in the distribution of fishing effort targeting these spawning aggregations have been restricted (43, 66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our ancient data are also consistent with observed long-term spawning fidelity in the North Sea region (67, 68); the genetic affinity of the ancient Orkney population, a focus of fishing since the Viking Age (69), agrees with those of modern individuals living in the North Sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we observe the specific affinity of one ancient Schleswig specimen toward a distinct population in the Øresund (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation also suggests local spawning fidelity and agrees with fine-scale population structure reported for this region (7073).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, by identifying their most likely source population, we conclude that the ancient Haithabu cod were not caught locally, but around the Norwegian coast during historic spawning aggregations of NEA cod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since climatic conditions restrict the production of dried cod without salt to the north of Norway (66), we can further constrain their source to this northern region, implying transportation over large spatial distances during the Viking Age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salting of cod did not begin in Norway until the 1690s, when klipfish was introduced to compete with new international products from locations such as Newfoundland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before that, Norwegian farmers, Sami hunters, and sometimes immigrant fishermen instead produced air-dried stockfish without salt, a practice limited to the north, especially Lofoten (43, 74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot yet infer conclusions about the scale of cod transport and/or trade in the Viking Age, potentially ranging from providing travelers rations to supplying an urban staple, whichtogether with obtaining a more refined chronologyshould be a subject of future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, knowing the Haithabu results, it becomes important to ask whether cod bones from even earlier trading sites in the western Baltic region (e.g., Groß Strömkendorf) might also represent fish from a distant source (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our discovery of distinctive genomic inversions in ancient cod specimens has made it possible to answer the long-standing question of whether dried cod was transported from northern Norway during the Viking Age (8001066 CE), solving a mystery epitomized by the ninth-century account of an Arctic Norwegian chieftains voyage to Haithabu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that distant requirements for Arctic protein had thus already begun to influence the economy and ecology of the north over the chronology under consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study highlights the potential of coupling modern genomics with ancient DNA to study the origins of historic trade routes in fish and other taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ancient samples (n = 19) are from the archives of excavations conducted at Haithabu (39), Schleswig (76), Bjørkum (77), Oslo (78), and Orkney (26) and are dated based on archaeological context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They come from waterlogged (Haithabu, Schleswig, and Oslo) and free-draining (Bjørkum and Orkney) deposits and have been stored dry and unfrozen in fluctuating ambient temperatures after excavation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bones were morphologically identified as Atlantic cod and selected from different archaeological layers, from fish of differing size and/or from the same element to avoid multiple samples from individual fish (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extraction_and_Library_Creation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA from ancient samples was extracted in a dedicated aDNA laboratory at the University of Oslo by following strict precautions (79, 80) using a combined bleach and predigestion (BleDD2) protocol (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ancient DNA libraries were created by using a blunt-end ligation protocol (81) with minor adjustments (20) (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA from modern samples (n = 168, Fig 1 and Table S2) was extractedin a separate laboratory from the ancient samplesusing a DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen) and sheared to an approximate insert size of 350 bp (82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern libraries were created by using a TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Preparation Kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ancient read data were processed by using PALEOMIX (83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, forward and reverse reads were collapsed with AdapterRemoval v1.5 (84) and aligned to the Gadmor2 reference (85, 86) by using BWA aln v.0.7.5a-r405 (87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modern data were aligned by using BWA mem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads that aligned with a minimum quality score (MapQ) of 25 used for subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aDNA damage patterns were investigated by using mapDamage v.2.0.6 (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SNP genotypes were obtained by using GATK v. 3.4.46 (88), after duplicate removal (Picard Tools v. 1.96) and indel realignment (GATKs IndelRealigner).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotypes were jointly (GATKs Genotypecaller) called for modern and ancient samples separately with default settings, allowing a maximum of three alternate alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modern data were filtered with BCFTOOLS v. 1.3 (89) by using filter -e FS greater than 60.0 || MQRankSumless_than-12.5 || ReadPosRankSumless_than-8.0 || QDless_than2.0 || MQless_than40'SnpGap 10 and VCFTOOLS v.0.1.14 (90), keeping biallelic loci with a maximum average read depth of 30 and a minimum MAF of 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The filtered modern and ancient dataset were intersected (BCFTOOLS isec), after which genotypes with a quality below 15 and read depth below 3 were set as missing and all C  greater than  T and G  greater than  A SNPs were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final dataset consisted of 156,695 SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For inferring genome-wide population structure, SNPS were pruned (indep-pairwise 100 10 0.5) for linkage disequilibrium (LD) by using PLINK v1.90p (91) and LG01, 02, 07, and 12 were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCA was performed with smartPCA, EIGENSOFT v.6.1.4 (92) whereby ancient individuals were projected by using lsqproject to account for missing data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model-based clustering was performed using ADMIXTURE v1.3 (93).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCA plots for the inverted regions (LG01, 9.126.2 Mbp; LG02, 18.524 Mbp; LG07, 13.623 Mbp; LG12, 1.313.6 Mbp) were generated without LD pruning (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the probability of obtaining the ancient individuals composite inversion genotype from the allele frequency distribution of the four modern populations was calculated by binomial sampling of genotypes and scaling these probabilities to one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All extraction and library protocols for archaeological Atlantic cod samples were performed in a dedicated laboratory at the Department of Biosciences, University of Oslo, following strict aDNA precautions (79, 80).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a laboratory that is physically separated from the modern DNA laboratories and in which no modern samples have ever been processed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extraction of ancient Atlantic cod bones (n = 19) used a combined bleach and predigestion protocol (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was exposed to UV for 10 min on each side, resulting in a total dosage of 4,800 J/m2 before being cut and milled to powder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, for each sample, two times 150200 mg of bone powder (milled in a Retsch MM400) was incubated in 0.5% bleach solution for 15 min (94).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were subsequently washed with H2O, and the remaining bone powder was exposed to a 30-min predigestion treatment followed by an overnight, second digestion by using a freshly prepared digestion buffer (95).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the second digestion, the two eluates were combined and concentrated (Amicon-30kDA Centrifugal Filter Units) after which DNA was extracted by using Qiagen Minelute columns according to manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was eluted in 60 L of preheated (60 °C) EB buffer with a 15-min incubation at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative controls were included in all extraction experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blunt-end Illumina libraries were built (81) with minor adjustments (20), and ligated DNA was amplified by using sample-specific 7-bp indexes in the P7 primer to allow multiplexing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCRs were done in 15 µL [2.5 U PfuTurbo Cx Hotstart DNA Polymerase (Agilent Technologies), 1× buffer, 0.2 mM per dNTP, 0.2 M P7 index primer, 0.2 M P5 IS4 primer, and 0.4 mg/mL BSA] for 13 cycles (2 min at 95 °C, 13 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 70 s at 72 °C with a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplified products were cleaned by using Agencourt AMPure XP beads at a 1:1.7 ratio, eluted in 30 µL in EB buffer and quantified by using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (125 bp paired-end) and demultiplexed allowing zero mismatches in the index tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
