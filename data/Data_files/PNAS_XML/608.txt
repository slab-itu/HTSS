Loss of the golgin GM130 causes Golgi disruption, Purkinje neuron loss, and ataxia in mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been known for many years that the Golgi apparatus, the central organelle of the secretory pathway, is fragmented upon neurodegenerative disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has remained an open question whether Golgi disruption contributes to neuronal death, as seen in disease, or is simply a consequence of this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that knocking out the Golgi protein GM130 in mice causes Golgi fragmentation and impaired secretory trafficking in Purkinje neurons, resulting in cell death and ataxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell death and ataxia are first observed in postnatal development, but worsen with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that targeted disruption of the Golgi apparatus can result in neuronal loss in vivo, supporting the view that Golgi dysfunction can contribute to neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Golgi apparatus lies at the heart of the secretory pathway where it is required for secretory trafficking and cargo modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of Golgi architecture and function has been widely observed in neurodegenerative disease, but whether Golgi dysfunction is causal with regard to the neurodegenerative process, or is simply a manifestation of neuronal death, remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that targeted loss of the golgin GM130 leads to a profound neurological phenotype in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global KO of mouse GM130 results in developmental delay, severe ataxia, and postnatal death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that selective deletion of GM130 in neurons causes fragmentation and defective positioning of the Golgi apparatus, impaired secretory trafficking, and dendritic atrophy in Purkinje cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cellular defects manifest as reduced cerebellar size and Purkinje cell number, leading to ataxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purkinje cell loss and ataxia first appear during postnatal development but progressively worsen with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data therefore indicate that targeted disruption of the mammalian Golgi apparatus and secretory traffic results in neuronal degeneration in vivo, supporting the view that Golgi dysfunction can play a causative role in neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generation_of_GM130_KO_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the physiological importance of GM130 in vivo, we generated a global KO mouse (GM130/) by homologous recombination (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GM130/ mice, which lacked detectable GM130 (Fig 1A), were born at a normal Mendelian ratio, indicating GM130 is not essential for embryonic development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, deletion of GM130 resulted in reduced growth (Fig 1 B and C) and death before postnatal day 35 (P35) (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore how loss of GM130 causes growth retardation and death, the temporal expression of GM130 in different mouse organs was examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that GM130 is highly expressed in the brain of newborn mice (P3), and although widely expressed, it is particularly abundant in liver, pancreas, and lung during postnatal development (P14) (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine how organ-specific loss of GM130 affects postnatal development, we generated conditional KO mice in which GM130 was selectively knocked out in brain, pancreas, or lung (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postnatal development and survival of mice were not affected in mice lacking GM130 in either the pancreas or lung (Fig 1F), although GM130 was highly expressed in these organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when GM130 was deleted in the brain by crossing GM130fl/fl with mice bearing a Nestin-Cre transgene, which is expressed throughout the nervous system (29), the neuron-specific KO offspring (GM130-nKO mice) showed significant growth retardation (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that GM130 expression in the brain is required for normal growth in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GM130-nKO mice were able to breed and did not show reduced survival relative to GM130fl/fl [control mice (Ctrl)] littermates up to 1.5 y of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth retardation observed in GM130-nKO mice was less than that in GM130/ mice, suggesting that GM130 has functions in cell types beyond those in which Nestin-Cre is active.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Motor_Defects_in_GM130_KO_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The GM130/ mice displayed a striking ataxia phenotype (Movie S1 and Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice staggered and could not stand steady on their hind legs, indicating GM130 is required for proper motor control during postnatal development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the ataxia phenotype seen in GM130/ mice, GM130-nKO mice also displayed motor coordination defects (Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were mild in young animals but progressively worsened with age (Movie S3), and tremor was obvious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GM130-nKO mice also displayed a limp reflex when lifted by their tail (Fig 2A), consistent with a neurodegenerative defect (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A footprint assay revealed an ataxic walking gait and diminished stride (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, both Nestin-Cre transgenic mice and GM130fl/fl mice did not display any motor abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess motor coordination quantitatively, the GM130-nKO mice and control littermates were subjected to rotarod testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In multiple trails, GM130-nKO mice showed a slight reduction in time spent on the rotarod at 3 wk of age (Fig 2D), which was much more profound at 8 and 12 wk of age (Fig 2E and Fig S3 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GM130-nKO mice also needed a longer time to cross balance beams of multiple sizes (Fig 2 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that deletion of GM130 in the central nervous system leads to severe neurological dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Progressive_Cerebellar_Atrophy_and_Purkinje_Cell_Loss_in_GM130-nKO_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To reveal the basis of the motor phenotype of GM130-nKO mice, adult brains from GM130fl/fl and GM130-nKO mice were analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No gross changes in brain architecture were observed in the forebrain or midbrain of GM130-nKO mice; however, the cerebellar size was dramatically reduced (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we focused our attention on the cerebellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological analysis by Nissl staining revealed a dramatic loss of Purkinje cells in adult GM130-nKO cerebellum (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing the cerebellum at different ages, we found that loss of Purkinje cells, marked by antibodies to calbindin-D28K, began in the third postnatal week, most noticeably from lobules X and IX (Fig 3 DF), with Purkinje cell degeneration occurring in other regions as the mice became older (Fig S4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to Purkinje cells, there was no degeneration of neurons within the molecular or granule layers of the cerebellum (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicate a progressive cerebellar atrophy and degeneration of Purkinje cells in the GM130-nKO mice, as opposed to a neurogenesis defect occurring early in development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The progressive degeneration of Purkinje cells correlated with impaired motor function, which was also progressive in nature (Fig 2 and Fig S3 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of Purkinje cells in the GM130-nKO mice also correlated with a significant decrease in the thickness of the molecular layer (Fig 3F) and increased staining of the astrocyte marker GFAP, consistent with neuronal damage, in cerebellar regions where Purkinje cell loss occurred (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining for the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase 3 indicated that there was significant apoptotic cell death of Purkinje neurons in the GM130-nKO mice (Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the Purkinje cell loss observed in the GM130-nKO mice, the global deletion of GM130 also resulted in dramatically reduced numbers of Purkinje cells (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Disruption_of_Golgi_Architecture_and_Positioning_upon_GM130_KO  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies in cultured cells have revealed a role for GM130 in maintaining mammalian Golgi ribbon organization and pericentrosomal positioning (25, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GM130 also participates in vesicle tethering during ER-to-Golgi traffic (24, 26, 27), and can function as a scaffold for activation of Cdc42 or Stk25 that is relevant for cell migration (3234).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To elucidate the cellular basis of the ataxic phenotype and Purkinje cell degeneration of GM130-nKO mice, we used antibodies to golgin-84 and TGN38, markers of the cis and trans-Golgi respectively, to analyze Golgi structure in Purkinje cells from mice at ages of P8, P14 and P28 by immunostaining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purkinje cells from control mice at all ages had an elaborate Golgi ribbon, with Golgi elements extending around the nucleus of the cell soma, whereas loss of GM130 resulted in a compaction of the Golgi apparatus at P14 and P28 (Fig 4 A and B and see Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in Golgi ultrastructure in the Purkinje cells were clearly observed using transmission electron microscopy with a loss of cisternal stacking and cisternal length and an accumulation of vesicular profiles localized to the perinuclear region (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with our observations in GM130/ mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar disruption of Golgi architecture was seen in granule cells within the cerebellum of the GM130-nKO mice, and also in nonneuronal cell types in the GM130/ mice, indicating that GM130 is important for maintaining Golgi organization in many cell types in vivo (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In WT mice at P8 we observed Golgi outposts in primary dendrites of Purkinje cells, as expected from other studies (810, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outposts were absent from Purkinje cells lacking GM130, which is consistent with results in Drosophila (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Golgi outposts were not observed in Purkinje cell dendrites at P14 and P28, even in WT mice (Fig 4A), suggesting that the Golgi apparatus undergoes dynamic changes in its dendritic localization during neuronal development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, we found that loss of GM130 altered the position of the Golgi apparatus in the soma of Purkinje cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control mice, although the Golgi ribbon extended around the nucleus, it was enriched at the apical pole and extended to the initial segment of the primary dendrite, close to the molecular layer (Fig 4 A, B, and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Golgi was predominantly found at the opposite side of the soma to the primary dendrite in GM130-nKO mice at P14 and P28, indicating a loss of apical polarity of the Golgi apparatus (Fig 4 A, B, and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with the loss of Golgi polarity seen upon shRNA-mediated depletion of GM130 from hippocampal granule cells (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pericentrosomal positioning of the mammalian Golgi apparatus helps determine its polarized distribution in various cell types (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether loss of GM130 results in altered association of the Golgi with the centrosome in Purkinje cells, Golgi and centrosome positioning were analyzed in parallel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4F, in control mice the Golgi apparatus was closely associated with the Purkinje cell centrosome, labeled with -tubulin, which was located apically near the base of the primary dendrite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In GM130-nKO mice, the centrosome retained its apical polarity, but the Golgi apparatus was completely dissociated from it (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A likely explanation for this effect is the loss of GM130 binding protein A kinase anchoring protein of 450 kDa (AKAP450), which helps link the Golgi apparatus to the centrosome (35), from the Golgi in the GM130-nKO Purkinje neurons (Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Golgi association of Stk25, which has been implicated in Golgi polarity (32), was retained in the absence of GM130 (Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these results indicate that although GM130 is not required for initial Golgi polarization, it is essential to maintain the polarized distribution of the Golgi apparatus in Purkinje cells, most likely through its association with AKAP450 and the centrosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Deficient_Secretory_Cargo_Trafficking_upon_GM130_KO  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The polarized distribution of the Golgi apparatus in neuronal cells is required for directed trafficking of secretory cargos into the dendrite, which is important for dendritic growth during development (810, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GM130 participates in ER-to-Golgi traffic (24, 26), functioning as a tether for ER-derived transport vesicles (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secretory trafficking was therefore analyzed in GM130 KO cells, using the model cargo vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) fused to GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cultured primary MEFs and cerebellar neurons, deletion of GM130 led to a reduced rate of trafficking of VSVGGFP from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Fig 5 A and B and Fig S9), indicating a role for GM130 in this trafficking step in these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then analyzed the morphology of dendrites in Purkinje cells of the KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT mice, an elaborate dendritic tree was obvious at P9, and by P30 there was a dramatic expansion of dendritic arbors, as expected (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendritic morphology was relatively normal at P9 in GM130-nKO mice (Fig 5C), indicating that GM130 is dispensable for initiation of dendrite formation and initial growth of the dendritic tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, strikingly, there was a dramatic reduction both in dendritic size and arborization in GM130-nKO Purkinje cells at P30 compared with WT (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed the dendrite was smaller than that seen at P9, indicating not only a failure to expand but also significant amount of dendritic atrophy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these results indicate impaired secretion and defective dendritic maintenance upon loss of GM130.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further assess secretory trafficking in the cerebellum of GM130-nKO mice, we focused on synaptic receptors that have to transit the Golgi apparatus on their way to the neuronal plasma membrane, where they function in neurotransmission (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of plasma membrane AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunits were assessed by blotting the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction isolated from the cerebellum of GM130-nKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were decreased amounts of both GluR1 and GluR2 in the PSD fraction of the GM130-nKO mice compared with control, even though total abundance was not affected (Fig 5 D and E), consistent with impaired secretory traffic to the synaptic membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this conclusion, we found soma to dendritic trafficking of GluR1 was reduced in GM130-nKO Purkinje neurons (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that decreased abundance of the GluR2 subunit can lead to high Ca2+ influx (38), which can result in Purkinje cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also reduced PSD95, which scaffolds several types of neurotransmitter receptors including NMDA and AMPA-type glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic membrane (39), in the PSD fraction (Fig 5 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced PSD95 can cause reduced AMPA receptor abundance at the synapse and longer NMDA-mediated long-term potentiation (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, defective neurotransmission as a consequence of reduced neurotransmitter receptor abundance and stability at the synapse is likely to contribute to impaired functionality and long-term survival of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum of GM130-nKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_Golgins_and_GRASP65_in_the_Cerebellum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the particular sensitivity of Purkinje neurons to loss of GM130, it was of interest to assess relative levels of GM130 and related golgins, in different neuronal types, both in control and GM130-nKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S8C, GM130 is expressed in Purkinje cells and in neurons within the granule and molecular layers of control cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The staining for GM130 was stronger in Purkinje cells, reflecting the increased abundance of Golgi membranes in this cell type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same was true for two other golgins, golgin-84 and TMF1, which are localized to the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi, respectively (Fig 4A and Fig S8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, staining for the cis-Golgi golgin Golgi microtubule-associated protein of 210 kDa (GMAP210), which, like GM130, also functions in ER-to-Golgi transport (27, 41), was strong in Purkinje neurons, although harder to detect in other neuronal types present within the cerebellum (Fig S8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In GM130-nKO mice, the levels of the golgins studied were unaffected (Fig 4A and Fig S8D), although there was a slight reduction in abundance of GMAP210 (Fig S8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Golgi reassembly and stacking protein of 65 kDa (GRASP65), which is anchored to the Golgi membrane via association with GM130 (25, 42), was present in Purkinje cells and other neuronal types within the cerebellum of control mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In GM130-nKO mice, it was lost from the Golgi, as expected (Fig S8F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these results suggest that the particular sensitivity of Purkinje cells to loss of GM130 is not due to a deficit in expression of other golgins or GRASP65 in this cell type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study we report that targeted KO of the golgin GM130 in mice leads to degeneration of Purkinje neurons within the cerebellum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within Purkinje neurons, GM130 is required for Golgi positioning via association with the centrosome, and for efficient ER-to-Golgi trafficking (Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both processes are required for polarized delivery of secretory cargo to the dendrite, which is required for growth and maintenance of the dendritic tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of GM130 leads to dendrite atrophy, Purkinje cell degeneration, and generation of an ataxic phenotype in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous work has shown that the polarized distribution of the Golgi apparatus is required for dendritic initiation from the soma and subsequent growth, a process that requires the delivery of large amounts of newly synthesized plasma membrane components via the secretory pathway (8, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockout of GM130 did not affect initiation or early growth of the Purkinje cell dendrite, but was required for maintenance of the dendritic tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests there is a higher requirement for directed secretory traffic for the expansion and maintenance of the dendritic tree, as opposed to its initial formation, at least in Purkinje cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GM130 impairs membrane delivery into the apical dendrite in two ways: loss of Golgi positioning and lower rates of ER-to-Golgi traffic, most likely due to defects in vesicle tethering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A recent study reported that RNAi-mediated depletion of GM130 in hippocampal neurons results in mild impairment of dendritic initiation (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we find that in Purkinje neurons, dendritic initiation still occurs in the absence of GM130.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we find that Purkinje neurons are particularly susceptible to loss of GM130 in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for this is currently unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation is redundancy in golgin function, which may vary between different types of neurons (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the abundant Purkinje cell expression of other cis-Golgi golgins that could in theory compensate for loss of GM130 argues against this possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, we favor the hypothesis that Purkinje cells are particularly susceptible to perturbations of secretory traffic due to their extremely large dendritic tree, which requires a significant input of material for both its growth and its maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively large amounts of Golgi in Purkinje cells would be consistent with this idea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, knockout of the GM130 binding partner GRASP65 in mice fails to elicit a phenotype (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been attributed to compensation by the related protein GRASP55 (43), which does not interact with GM130 in vivo (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, even though loss of GM130 resulted in a failure to recruit GRASP65 to the Golgi, the phenotypes we observe are likely independent of GRASP65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell-culturebased studies have implicated GM130 in a number of cellular processes in addition to secretory trafficking, including cytoskeletal regulation, which is important for cell migration and cell division (4, 31, 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was therefore surprising that the GM130 KO mice did not display any overt developmental phenotype; pups were born at normal weight and looked morphologically normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings would appear inconsistent with a major role for GM130 in cell migration or cell division in vivo, processes that are particularly important during embryonic development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an alternative explanation is that GM130 function in these processes is redundant, possibly with another golgin, or that the developing animal can compensate for loss of GM130 in a way not possible in cultured cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies will be required to discriminate between these possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a human patient with a loss-of-function GM130 mutation has recently been described (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This patient lacked any neonatal phenotype, but developed neuromuscular defects in the first year of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, in humans, it would seem GM130 is also dispensable during embryonic development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would also appear that an important role for GM130 in the nervous system is conserved between mice and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How similar the neuronal degeneration we observe upon GM130 KO is to that observed in progressive neurodegenerative disease is currently unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of Purkinje cells in the GM130 KO mice starts around 3 wk into postnatal development and progressively worsens as the mice age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most common neurodegenerative diseases typically manifest only later in life, although the spinocerebellar ataxias, in which Purkinje cell death is commonly observed, can appear much earlier in life (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cellular phenotypes we observe in the GM130 KO mice could be considered neurodevelopmental.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Purkinje neurons are born and specified before the time when phenotypes start to manifest, in mice they continue to develop their dendritic tree for up to 3 wk following birth (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, a failure of Purkinje cells to properly grow or maintain the dendritic tree during the first weeks of postnatal development could explain the neurological defects we observe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is different from an inability to maintain a fully formed dendritic network, as occurs when mature neurons undergo degeneration in later onset disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the demonstration that Golgi dysfunction causes neuronal loss in vivo, combined with the observation that neuronal loss and ataxia worsen with age upon loss of GM130, indicates that this process could, in principle, result in or at least contribute to the neurodegeneration that occurs in human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this possibility, it has been shown that -synuclein can perturb ER-to-Golgi traffic in Parkinsons disease models (49), and that the A-fragment of APP that causes Alzheimers disease, and the pathogenic form of ataxin-2 that causes SCA2, both disrupt Golgi organization (19, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, Golgi dysfunction and defective secretory trafficking, which could be attributable to a number of primary causes, may represent a significant pathogenic mechanism of neurodegenerative disease in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A 6.5-kb genomic fragment containing exon 14 of the mouse GM130 gene was subcloned from the BAC DNA rp23-373-N23 purchased from the Childrens Hospital Oakland Research Institute and used to construct the targeting vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One loxp site was inserted upstream of exon 14 and a neomycin cassette flanked by a pair of FRT sites and another pair of loxp sites was inserted downstream of exon 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For negative selection, the MC1TK gene cassette was added to the 3 end of the genomic fragment in the targeting vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All processes were done by homologous recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 100 µg of targeting construct was linearized and transfected into male 129/SvJ-derived ES cells by electroporation (800 V, 3 F) that were maintained on a feeder layer of MEF cells in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant ES cell clones resistant to neomycin were selected in medium supplemented with G418 (250 µg/mL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ES cell clones were screened by PCR analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correctly targeted clones were expanded and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts for injection into pseudopregnant female mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting male chimeras were bred to C57BL/6 mice and analyzed by PCR for germ-line transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterozygous offspring were bred with FlpE-expressing mice to remove the Neo cassette and generate GM130fl/+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GM130fl/fl mice were bred with Zp3 mice to derive female GM130fl/fl Zp3-cre mice, the offspring of which will be GM130+/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GM130fl/fl mice were crossed with nestin-Cre mice, pdx1-cre mice, spc-rtTA/teto-cre mice to generate neural-specific, pancreas-specific, and bronchioalveolar epithelium-specific GM130 deficient mice, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, to get conventional and conditional KO mice in the C57BL/6 background, male mice with the GM130-mutant allele were backcrossed with female C57BL/6 mice at least six times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the following primers to detect WT GM130 and GM130fl alleles: A (P9) 5-GGCACACAGTCTCTGGTTCC-3 and B (P12) 5-CTGTTCCGCTGCAGTGCTC-3; and we used the following primers to detect cre alleles: C (cre819), 5-GCATTGCTGTCACTTGGTCGT-3 and D (cre531), 5-CGATGCAACGAGTGATGAGG-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Neurobehavioral_Tests  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the rotarod performance test, mice were first placed on a stationary rotarod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before recording in each trial, mice were trained using a slow speed (4 rpm over 2 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rod was then set to accelerate from 4 to 40 rpm over 5 min, and the time that the mouse fell from the rod was recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a mouse held onto the rod and rotated completely three times it was treated as fallen from the rod at that time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mouse was tested four times a day for 2 consecutive days with a 20- to 30-min interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before recording in each trial, mice were trained using a slow speed (4 rpm over 2 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the beam walk balance test, mice were trained to walk across elevated 75-cm-long beams of variable diameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were initially trained on a round wooden rod 18 mm in diameter for three trials, followed by three more trials on a round rod 11 mm in diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time required for the mouse to traverse 75 cm of each beam was recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the footprint assay, forepaws were stained in red ink and hindpaws were stained in blue ink.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice ran in one narrow tunnel lined with white paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stride length is the distance between successive points of initial contact of the same hind or forefoot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Step length is the distance between points of initial to successive foot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Histological_and_Immunohistochemical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were transcardially perfused with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were postfixed and embedded in paraffin or frozen in TBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Nissl staining, 25-m-thick cryostat sections were stained with 0.1% cresyl violet and examined by light microscopy (Nikon) used at room temperature (RT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunohistochemical examination, antibodies were used with 6-m paraffin sections, which were deparaffinized and rehydrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antigen retrieval was performed using the microwave method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After blocking, sections were incubated with diluted primary antibodies in 1% BSA overnight at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation with selected secondary antibodies and counterstained with DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, fluorescence was detected under a confocal microscope (Olympus) at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunohistochemical examination of frozen sections, 30-m-thick cryostat sections were pretreated with 1% Trion X-100 for 0.5 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After blocking, sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies and counterstained with DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, fluorescence was detected using a confocal microscope (Olympus) at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were processed using Photoshop software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EM_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were perfused with 1% PFA/2.5% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were dissected and fixed in 2.5% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde, then postfixed in 1% OsO4 for 2 h on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After dehydration with graded acetone solutions, tissues were embedded in EMbed812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 65-nm ultrathin sections were stained with 2% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate for 30 min and lead citrate for 10 min at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were visualized using a 120 kV electron microscope (JEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EM quantitation of Golgi morphology was performed according to Sato et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitation_of_Neurons_in_the_Cerebellum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Midsagittal brain sections were prepared from three to four animals for each group at one age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After anti-calbindin staining, the number of Purkinje cells per random field taken from lobule IV and the nodular lobes (lobules IX and X) were counted separately and divided by the total length of the lobules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitation of neurons within the molecular and granule layers of the cerebellum was performed by counting the number of cell bodies per micrometer squared in images taken randomly from the molecular and granule layers of lobules IV and X. Purkinje cell death was quantified by counting the percentage of total Purkinje cells in lobules X and IX that stained positive for cleaved caspase 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

VSVGGFP_Transport_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Infection of cerebellar neurons or MEF cells with adenovirus expressing the ts045 temperature-sensitive mutant of the VSVGGFP fusion protein was performed as described (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells grown in six-well plates were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) FCS and high-titer adenovirus for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified incubator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prewarmed DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FCS was added, and the cells were shifted to 40 °C for 16 h. To induce anterograde trafficking, cells were shifted to 32 °C into prewarmed CO2-independent medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.1 mg/mL cycloheximide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were incubated in a water bath at this temperature various times, and subsequently chilled on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were solubilized in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, containing a protease inhibitor mixture), and half of the clarified lysates were incubated with 0.5 µL Endo H (5 units/mL; Calbiochem) overnight at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were analyzed by Western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Primary_Culture_of_Cerebellar_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neurons from P0 mice cerebella were dissociated with 0.5% trypsin for 15 min and plated on glass slides coated with poly-d-lysine in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hour after plating, the medium were replaced by maintenance medium containing Neurobasal A (GIBCO) and a modified B27 supplement, with a change of medium every third day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VSVG assay was carried out at 14 days in vitro (DIV14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_Cerebellum_Membrane_Fractions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Postnuclear supernatant and PSD fractions from mouse cerebellum were prepared using the previously described procedure (54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, cerebella were dissected and weighed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cerebella from GM130-nKO mice weighed 0.0350.037 g. Cerebella from control mice weighed 0.0420.045 g. Cerebella were homogenized on ice using a Teflon-glass homogenizer for 30 strokes in 1 mL of Hepes-buffered sucrose (0.32 M sucrose, 4 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) containing freshly added protease inhibitors, and then centrifuged at 8001,000 × g at 4 °C to remove the pelleted nuclear fraction (P1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postnuclear supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to obtain supernatant (S2) and crude synaptosomal pellet (P2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pellet P2 was washed once in 1 mL Hepes-buffered sucrose and lysed by hypoosmotic shock in 900 µL ice-cold ddH2O with rapid adjustment to 4 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors, homogenized by pipetting and rotating for 30 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to yield supernatant (S3, crude synaptic vesicle fraction) and pellet (P3, lysed synaptosomal membrane fraction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prepare the PSD fraction, P3 was resuspended in 900 µL of ice-cold 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, plus protease inhibitors and 0.5% Triton X-100, rotated for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 32,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the supernatant (S4) and PSD pellet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PSD pellets were resuspended in RIPA buffer containing 1% SDS and protein concentration was measured with the Bradford assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto SDS/PAGE gels and analyzed by Western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
