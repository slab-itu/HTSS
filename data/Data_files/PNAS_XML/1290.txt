Inverted allosteric coupling between activation and inactivation gates in K+ channels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In K+ channels, an allosteric coupling between their activation gate and selectivity filter underlies C-type inactivation coupled to activation gating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have found that the second Threonine within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels is a crucial player for this allosteric communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, an Alanine substitution at this position in K+ channels from bacteria to humans removed C-type inactivation gating and strikingly inverted the allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channels selectivity filter, closed-state inactivation gating).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channels selectivity filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The selectivity filter and the activation gate in potassium channels are functionally and structurally coupled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An allosteric coupling underlies C-type inactivation coupled to activation gating in this ion-channel family (i.e., opening of the activation gate triggers the collapse of the channels selectivity filter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have identified the second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for this allosteric communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Threonine to Alanine substitution at this position was studied in three representative members of the K+-channel family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, all of the mutant channels exhibited lack of C-type inactivation gating and an inversion of their allosteric coupling (i.e., closing of the activation gate collapses the channels selectivity filter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A state-dependent crystallographic study of KcsA-T75A proves that, on activation, the selectivity filter transitions from a nonconductive and deep C-type inactivated conformation to a conductive one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we provide a crystallographic demonstration that closed-state inactivation can be achieved by the structural collapse of the channels selectivity filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Modifying_AG__SF_Allosteric_Coupling_in_K+_Channels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested the hypothesis that the second Threonine is an essential component of the allosteric network that mediates the AG  SF coupling, which is associated with C-type inactivation in KcsA as well as in the prototypical Shaker channel and its human homolog the hKv1.5 delayed rectifier voltage-gated channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, a unique multipronged approach was applied, which involved modifying the AG  SF coupling by introducing a perturbation by site-directed mutagenesis at the second Threonine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was followed by a systematic evaluation at the functional level by electrophysiology and at the structural level by X-ray crystallography in a state-dependent manner (i.e., in the closed and open states of KcsA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We reasoned that the simplest perturbation that could modify KcsAs AG  SF coupling without compromising protein folding was to substitute the second Threonine with an Alanine residue (T-to-A) at position 75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T75A mutant abolished KcsA C-type inactivation as a consequence of perturbing the channels AG  SF coupling (Fig 1E) (n = 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, this mutant, after activating, displayed a time-dependent increase in current amplitude (Fig 1E) (n = 10) and an 17 drop of the single-channel conductance (Fig 1 FI) [chord conductance at 100 mV, WT KcsA = 120 ± 7 pS (n = 6) and T75A = 7.1 ± 1 pS (n = 5)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the high degree of structural conservation at the PD of the Kv-channel family (16) and the bacterial K+ channel KcsA (17, 18), we reasoned that a T-to-A mutation at the second Threonine of delayed rectifiers Kv channels (Fig 1D) should alter the channels AG  SF coupling in the same manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the human delayed rectifier hKv1.5 and the Shaker channels, prolonged depolarization induces a time-dependent reduction of the macroscopic current amplitude due to the developing of C-type inactivation (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A conditioning test pulse to 0 or 80 mV allowed us to quantify the decrease in current amplitude by measuring the currents elicited by a subsequent test pulse to +60 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reduction in current amplitudes (C-type inactivation) for these two Kv channels of about 5080% was observed (n = 5) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, a T-to-A mutation at the second Threonine of this subset of delayed rectifier Kv channels did not display the typical time-dependent reduction of current amplitude as if C-type inactivation has been removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paradoxically, the mutant channels displayed an increase in the current amplitudes elicited by a +60-mV test pulse after the conditioning pulse (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T-to-A mutation was well-tolerated, yielding WT-like voltage-dependent channels (SI Appendix, Fig S1)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The activation of the hKv1.5 T-to-A mutant macroscopic currents was biphasic, with a highly voltage-dependent fast component and a virtually voltage-independent slow component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the second slow component of these mutants could be the manifestation of structural changes similar to C-type inactivation given that the kinetics of both processes are virtually voltage independent (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the kinetics of the T-to-A mutants activation and of the WT channel C-type inactivation are very similar (Fig 2), which can be interpreted as if an inversion of the AG  SF coupling had occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the dramatic changes in gating behavior, the T-to-A mutant channels remained highly K+ selective (SI Appendix, Fig S3 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_K+_Channel_Mutant_with_Inverted_Allosteric_Coupling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A possible explanation for the increase in current amplitude in the T-to-A mutants is that their SF converts from a C-type inactivated state to a conductive and noninactivating conformation on AG opening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this idea, we used the hKv1.5-T480A mutant and applied the following pulse protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied a test pulse to +60 mV for 5 s (which elicited a noninactivating, biphasic macroscopic current with a fast increase in current amplitude followed by a slower one) (black trace in Fig 3A) and then a 15-s repolarizing pulse to close the channels AG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a subsequent second test pulse to +60 mV (red trace in Fig 3A), the amplitude of the fast component was increased and equaled the final amplitude of the first current trace (Fig 3A) (n = 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prolonging the interpulse duration at 80 mV from 2 to 600 s reversed the hKv1.5-T480A mutant current amplitude back to its initial value (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strongly suggested the presence of a use-dependent conversion of the channel SF from a nonconductive to a conductive conformation and vice versa: a conversion that is associated with the channels activation gating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reversion of the SF to its nonconductive conformation was essentially voltage independent (Fig 3C) (n = 5), which further suggests that the slow increase in current amplitude on prolonged depolarization presented by the T-to-A mutant channels is likely caused by structural changes similar or related to C-type inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If the slow increase in current amplitude displayed by T-to-A mutant channels is caused by the conversion of their SF from a C-type inactivated to a conductive conformation, then it should depend on the external K+ concentration [K+o] (a hallmark of the C-type inactivation mechanism).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this possibility using a pressurized fast perfusion system and titrating the [K+o] in a stepwise fashion from 4 to 148 mM and measured the current amplitude elicited by a prolonged depolarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hKv1.5 WT channel, the increase of the [K+o] produced the expected reduction of the current amplitude due to the decrease of K+ chemical gradient (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the hKv1.5-T480A mutant displayed a robust increment in current amplitude, despite the decrease of the K+ chemical gradient (Fig 4B and SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dependence of the current amplitude on the [K+o] displayed by the hKv1.5-T480A channels strongly suggests that this process is related to C-type inactivation gating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, we hypothesize that most of the T480A channels are inactivated in their closed state (a collapsed SF in the closed state); then, augmenting the [K+o] biases the conformation of the T480As SF to the conductive conformation, which causes the observed increase in current amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To provide further support to the notion of closed-state inactivation in the hKv1.5-T480A mutant, we decided to study the effect of Rb+ on the T480A increase in current amplitude on prolonged depolarization given its well-known effect relieving C-type inactivation in K+ channels (10, 19, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S5 shows a statistically significant 35% reduction of the hKV1.5 WT C-type inactivation rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this result, we reasoned that an increase in the [Rb+o] should relieve the T480A closed-state inactivation; hence, the augmentation in current amplitude should be more evident.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S6A shows that an increase of the [Rb+o] (510 mM), as predicted, triggered a more pronounced surge of the current amplitude, which is dependent on the [Rb+o].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SI Appendix, Fig S6B, it is shown that increasing the [Rb+o] to 10 mM produced a 2.7-fold increase of the T480A steady-state current on activation at +50 mV (n = 5), which strongly suggests that extracellular rubidium has biased the channels SF conformation from a C-type inactivated to a conductive one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, these results strongly suggest that substituting the second Threonine within the signature sequence of K+ channels with an Alanine triggered the inactivation of the channels SF in the closed state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It follows that the T-to-A mutants seem to invert the allosteric coupling between AG and SF in this subset of K+ channels that undergo C-type inactivation gating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is to say, the SF is inactive in the closed state and becomes conductive and noninactivating in the open state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An important condition to show that the T-to-A mutant channels have an inverted AG  SF coupling is that their AG must display a normal gating process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A close inspection of the macroscopic currents deactivation of the T-to-A mutants indicated that their AG closes completely, albeit displaying slower kinetics (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A clearly showed that a 15-s interpulse time was more than sufficient to totally shut the hKv1.5-T480As AG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, we directly tracked the pH-dependent conformational changes of KcsAs AG by continuous-wave EPR (CW-EPR) spectroscopy and site-directed spin label at the position G116, which is located at the channels AG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KcsA-T75As AG on intracellular acidification undergoes conformational changes that are indistinguishable from those displayed by the WT channel (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the pKa of activation and the pKa of deactivation of the T75A mutant were identical as has been evidenced in other noninactivating mutants of KcsA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In KcsA WT, the opening and closing of the AG display a hysteretic behavior, which is absent when C-type inactivation gating is removed (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that a T-to-A mutation causes the inversion of the AG  SF coupling in K+ channels that undergo C-type inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our data unambiguously show that the AG can close independent of the SFs status and provide strong support for the proposed four-state kinetic model for KcsA gating (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Crystallographic_Demonstration_of_KcsA_s_Allosteric_Coupling_Inversion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the structural changes that regulate the functioning of a K+ channel, it is necessary to trap the channels conformation as it changes along its gating cycle and solve the structures of these kinetic intermediates at atomic resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, we have reported the generation of a disulfide-bridged locked open state for the KcsA channel (locked open KcsA) that allowed us to solve the structures of KcsAs open gating intermediates (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the functional equivalence between bacterial (KcsA), fruit fly (Shaker), and human (hKv1.5) potassium channels shown in this work, we pursued the structural basis of the functional effects of the T-to-A mutation by crystallizing and obtaining the X-ray crystal structures of the KcsA-T75A mutant in the closed and open states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure of the closed KcsA-T75A mutant [T75A-closed; Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 6BY2] diffracted X-rays to 2.4-Å Bragg spacing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure was solved by molecular replacement, and the final refined model retained appropriate stereochemistry: Rwork = 0.22 and Rfree = 0.24 (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T75A-closed structure represents the atomic description of closed-state inactivation in a K+ channel and provides a structural snapshot at an unknown kinetic intermediate within the KcsA gating cycle: the closed and deep C-type inactivated conformation (closed inactive state) (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T75As AG, which is normally the narrowest region of the permeation pathway (4 Å in diameter), is tightly closed, precluding the flow of K+ ions across the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in total agreement with our CW-EPR measurements that indicated a closed AG at basic pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, it has been shown that the structures of the closed KcsA in high-K+ concentration (PDB ID code 1K4C) (23) and of the open noninactivating mutant (E71A) (1) reveal four K+ bound to the SF, which correspond to the overlap of two isoenergetic ion configurations within the crystal lattice: S1S3 and S2S4, respectively (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure of the T75A-closed structure, although solved in the presence of 300 mM [K+], contains only two K+ ions, which are bound to positions S1 and S4 (the K+ bound to the fourth binding site is exclusively coordinated by the alanine 75 main-chain carbonyl groups) (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the T75A-closed structure shows an SF collapsed or deep C-type inactivated (mostly due to a 2-Å constriction at the level of Gly-77) (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T75A-closed structure SF is similar to the one found in the low-K+ concentration (PDB ID code 1K4D) (23) and in KcsA with the AG open and an SF in a deep C-type inactivated conformation (1, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A structural alignment of the T75A-closed state (PDB ID code 6BY2) and the KcsA low-[K+] (PDB ID code 1K4D) SF shows that they are essentially identical: rmsd 0.22 Å (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most remarkable difference is 2-Å reduction of the interatomic distance between the K+ bound at the S1 and S4 ion binding sites of the T75A SF-closed structure (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crystallization trials using the locked open KcsA mutant with the T-to-A mutation at position 75 (T75A-open; PDB ID code 6BY3) yielded crystals in the I4 space group that diffracted X-rays at 2.4 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A structural model was generated by molecular replacement and refined until obtaining adequate Rwork and Rfree of 0.20 and 0.22, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AG of the T75A-open structure spans about 24 Å, which is about five times the size of a hydrated K+ ion, and hence, it should allow free diffusion down its electrochemical gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The functional analysis of the T-to-A mutants revealed fully K+-selective (SI Appendix, Table S1) noninactivating channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experimental results strongly suggest that the second Threonine is an essential component of the allosteric network that communicates the AG and the SF in K+ channels, since by replacing it, we surgically removed C-type inactivation gating (inactivation from the open state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KcsA T75A-open structure displayed two very important features of a nonC-type inactivating K+ channel: first, an SF displaying no detectable constriction at the level of Gly-77 and second, the presence of at least three consecutive K+ bound to the channels SF (we proposed that two consecutive ion vacancies within a K+ channels SF represent an insurmountable energetic barrier for ion permeation) (2) (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An SF with a suboptimal three K+-bound configuration produced a profound impact in the turnover rate of K+ transport for all of the T-to-A mutants studied here as was evidenced in a 2- to 17-fold drop in the mutant channels unitary conductance (Fig 1 H and I and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, all T-to-A mutants remained highly K+ selective, albeit having only three K+ bound to their SF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experimental findings argue against the idea that high ion selectivity in K+ channels is only possible in the presence of the canonical four K+-bound configuration as previously proposed (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In potassium channels, an allosteric coupling between their AG and SF is responsible for C-type inactivation coupled to activation gating (i.e., opening of the AG triggers the collapse of the channels SF) (7, 8, 10, 11, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have identified the second Threonine residue within the TTVGYGD signature sequence of K+ channels as a crucial residue for this allosteric communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A T-to-A mutation at this position produces an inversion of this allosteric mechanism in three representative members of the K+-channel family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6 shows a four-state kinetic model for KcsAs gating cycle as it has been described before (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It illustrates an alternative path that is likely transited by the T-to-A mutant in KcsA, hKv1.5, and the Shaker channel when undergoing activation gating (Fig 6, blue arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A T-to-A mutation at the second Threonine of the signature sequence of K+ channels is inactive in the closed state, and during activation gating, their SF slowly transitions from a deep inactivated conformation to a conductive (which is reflected in the increase in current amplitude on long depolarizations) and noninactivating state (as seen in macroscopic currents of the T-to-A mutant Kv channels reported in here and the structure of the T75A-open structure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, if the AG is closed for a very brief period of time, the channels SF remains conductive (Fig 6, red arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, if the T-to-A mutants are kept in the closed state for longer periods (Fig 3B), their SFs undergo C-type inactivation in the closed state (with their AG closed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, based on functional and crystallographic evidence, it is clear that the T-to-A mutation in the subset of K+ channels studied in this work not only uncoupled C-type inactivation from activation gating but also caused an inversion of the allosteric communication between the channels AG and SF (i.e., AG closure triggers the SF collapse, and its opening does not cause C-type inactivation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a T-to-G mutation also induced the collapse of the SF in the closed state (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our results provide structural snapshots that enrich the proposed four-state kinetic model for the PD of K+ channels (1, 8) as well as the structure of the closed and C-type inactivated states of an ion channel (2830).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electrophysiological recordings for Shaker-IR and Shaker-IR-T442A [IR indicates fast inactivation removed (31)] were obtained from expression in HEK293 cells, since the Shaker construct expresses poorly in Ltk cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  External solutions with elevated K+ concentration or 10 mM Rb+ used to study the speed of selectivity filter conversion from its inactivated and collapsed state to its conducting open conformation as a function of external K+ or Rb+ concentration were obtained by replacing NaCl with KCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different external bath solutions were applied to the cells with a custom-built pressurized fast switching perfusion system (valves were purchased from the Lee Company) and a quartz micromanifold (ALA Scientific), allowing rapid exchange of the external bath solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Channels composed of the Alanine for Threonine substitution were recruited in their conducting configuration with repetitive depolarizations before applying the pulse protocol used for nonstationary noise analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both WT and mutant channels, only cells that did not display current rundown during the train of repetitive depolarizations were used for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current recordings were analyzed using the built-in nonstationary fluctuation analysis tool of Pclamp10 software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis tool calculates the ensemble current variance (2) of the 100 tracings and plots it as a function of total current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KcsA T75A in the closed (32) or locked open scaffold [with KcsA activation locked open by disulfide bonds (1)] was transformed into Escherichia coli-XL10-Gold cells and grown overnight at 37 °C in LB media supplemented with 1% glucose and 0.4 mg/mL ampicillin (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KcsA was extracted from E. coli membranes with Buffer A + 20 mM dodecyl maltoside (DDM) + protease inhibitors for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solubilized protein was separated from the insoluble material by spinning down at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a cobalt resin column, washed with Buffer A supplemented with 10 mM imidazole and 1 mM DDM, and eluted with Buffer A supplemented with 1 mM DDM and 400 mM imidazole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of KcsA properly folded was performed by size exclusion chromatography on an ENrich SEC 650 10 × 300 column (Bio-Rad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal trials were set up by the sitting drop method in 2427% (vol/vol) PEG 400, 50 mM magnesium acetate, and 50 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.46.0) at 19 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals regularly appeared within a 2-wk period, and they were immediately cryoprotected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural models for the closed and open conformations of the T75A mutant were built from scratch using coot (34) and refined iteratively with Phenix (35), including rigid body, energy minimization, simulated annealing, and individual B-factor refinements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details are described in SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
