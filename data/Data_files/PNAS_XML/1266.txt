Confining electrodeposition of metals in structured electrolytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electrochemical cells based on lithium and sodium metal anodes are considered among the most versatile platforms for high-energy electrical energy storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, unstable dendritic metal deposition at currents below the diffusion limit lead to premature cell failure by internal short circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a volatile electrolyte, the ohmic heat generated by these shorts pose significant safety risks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The article reports that electrodeposition of metals can be stabilized by confining ion transport to length scales below a few hundred nanometers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also shown that dendrite growth can be arrested in electrolytes with mechanical moduli well below that of the metal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding contradicts current orthodoxy, which holds that solid-state electrolytes with moduli higher than the metal are required for preventing dendrite growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electrochemical cells based on alkali metal (Li, Na) anodes have attracted significant recent attention because of their promise for producing large increases in gravimetric energy density for energy storage in batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate stable, long-term operation of such cells a variety of structured electrolytes have been designed in different physical forms, ranging from soft polymer gels to hard ceramics, including nanoporous versions of these ceramics that host a liquid or molten polymer in their pores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In almost every case, the electrolytes are reported to be substantially more effective than anticipated by early theories in improving uniformity of deposition and lifetime of the metal anode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations have been speculated to reflect the effect of electrolyte structure in regulating ion transport to the metal electrolyte interface, thereby stabilizing metal electrodeposition processes at the anode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we create and study model structured electrolytes composed of covalently linked polymer grafted nanoparticles that host a liquid electrolyte in the pores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrolytes exist as freestanding membranes with effective pore size that can be systematically manipulated through straightforward control of the volume fraction of the nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By means of physical analysis and direct visualization experiments we report that at current densities approaching the diffusion limit, there is a clear transition from unstable to stable electrodeposition at Li metal electrodes in membranes with average pore sizes below 500 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that this transition is consistent with expectations from a recent theoretical analysis that takes into account local coupling between stress and ion transport at metalelectrolyte interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Lithium rods, ethylene carbonate, dimethylene carbonate, lithium hexafluorophosphate, anhydrous copper chloride, dimethyl sulfoxide, glass fibers Ludox SM30 colloidal silica (d = 10 ± 2 nm), poly(propylene glycol)-toluene-2,4-diisocyante were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydoxy terminated poly (ethylene oxide)-silane was obtained from Gelest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Copper foil was obtained from Alfa Aesar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the chemicals were used as received after rigorous drying in an 0-ppm water level and less_than5-ppm oxygen glove box.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Linear_Stability_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The details regarding the linear stability analysis were presented in a previous paper by Tikekar et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (38)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cross-Linked_Hairy_Nanoparticles_Synthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reaction procedure for cross-linking between the grafted silica nanoparticles and functionalized PPO polymer was given in a previous work (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different cross-linked nanoparticles with varying pore sizes were synthesized by adjusting the ratio between the silica nanoparticles and the PPO polymer as given in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio between the liquid electrolyte and the cross-linked composite was kept constant at 2:1 by weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dielectric_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dielectric spectroscopy measurements were done using a Novocontrol N40 Broadband Dielectric instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-linked hairy nanoparticles as well as neat PPO (without liquid electrolyte) were casted at the center of a teflon o-ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were done in a frequency range from 103 to 107 Hz at various temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TEM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The TEM measurements were performed to understand the nanostructure of the cross-linked hairy nanoparticles using an FEI T12 Spirit TEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A thin layer of the materials was casted onto the TEM grid using chloroform as the solvent and it was allowed to cross-link in the TEM grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the measurements, the samples were dried overnight at 60 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SEM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SEM analysis was done using the LEO155FESEM instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this experiment, symmetric lithium coin cell was constructed using the cross-linked electrolyte (r.c.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 20 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plate-strip measurements were performed at a current density of 0.1 mA/cm2 for 100 h, with each cycle comprising 3 h; thereafter, the lithium electrode was extracted and dried in the antechamber of a glove box overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanical_Properties  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cross-linking process was studied mechanically by casting the precursor materials in the rheometer with parallel-plate geometry of diameter 25 mm using an ARES Rheometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, for time-sweep measurements, a constant strain amplitude of 5% and fixed frequency of 10 Hz was applied until the storage modulus reached a fixed value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency-sweep measurements were performed at a fixed strain amplitude of 5% between 1 and 100 Hz for all materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the measurements were done without any addition of liquid electrolytes and at the same temperature value of 60 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Direct_Visualization_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The visualization experiment was carried out for understanding the electrodeposition process with various forms of electrolytes mentioned in the text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all of the measurements the ratio between the weight of the composite material and liquid electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 EC/DMC) was kept constant at 1:2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the visualization cell for lithium deposition measurements were presented in a previous paper (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dendrite growth was done using a semiautomatic analysis in MATLAB, where the sizes of the focused dendrites are measured over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
