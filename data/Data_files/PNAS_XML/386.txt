miR-322/-503 cluster is expressed in the earliest cardiac progenitor cells and drives cardiomyocyte specification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compared with microRNAs (miRNAs) enriched in cardiac and skeletal muscles, little is known about miRNAs expressed in early cardiac progenitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that mesoderm posterior 1 (Mesp1) transactivates a large number of miRNAs that may promote cardiomyocyte formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The miR-322/-503 cluster has the highest enrichment in the Mesp1 lineage of cardiac progenitor cells, is specifically expressed in the developing heart tube, and drives precocious cardiomyocyte formation by targeting an RNA-binding factor, CUG-binding protein Elav-like family member 1 (Celf1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study fills a gap in our knowledge about miRNAs acting early in the cardiac program and identifies previously unreported candidates in promoting cardiac regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding the mechanisms of early cardiac fate determination may lead to better approaches in promoting heart regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a mesoderm posterior 1 (Mesp1)-Cre/Rosa26-EYFP reporter system to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) enriched in early cardiac progenitor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these miRNA genes bear MESP1-binding sites and active histone signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a calcium transient-based screening assay, we identified miRNAs that may promote the cardiomyocyte program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An X-chromosome miRNA cluster, miR-322/-503, is the most enriched in the Mesp1 lineage and is the most potent in the screening assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is specifically expressed in the looping heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ectopic miR-322/-503 mimicking the endogenous temporal patterns specifically drives a cardiomyocyte program while inhibiting neural lineages, likely by targeting the RNA-binding protein CUG-binding protein Elav-like family member 1 (Celf1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, early miRNAs in lineage-committed cells may play powerful roles in cell-fate determination by cross-suppressing other lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miRNAs identified in this study, especially miR-322/-503, are potent regulators of early cardiac fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Using_Mesp1_Genetic_Tracing_to_Identify_miRNAs_Enriched_in_Early_CPCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify miRNAs that regulate early cardiac cell fate, we used a genetic tracing strategy to label early CPCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed the Mesp1Cre/+ and Rosa26EYFP/EYFP mouse strains to obtain Mesp1Cre/+; Rosa26EYFP/+ embryos in which Mesp1 promoter-driven Cre mediates recombination in the Rosa26 locus and permanently marks the Mesp1 lineage with YFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with previous reports (16, 18), Mesp1-lineage cells contributed to the primitive streak, cardiac crescent, and head folds at E7.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They localized to the developing heart, head mesenchyme and intersomatic vessels at E9.5 and to the heart and surrounding structures at E11.5 (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated an Mesp1 lineage-tracking ESC line (genotype Mesp1Cre/+; Rosa26EYFP/+), UH3 cells (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YFP+ signal was absent in undifferentiated UH3 cells and started to appear from day 3 in a standard hanging-drop protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal reached 2.9% at day 5 and did not increase thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Rosa26EYFP/+ ESCs did not express YFP at any time points, indicating that the reporter activity is contingent on Cre expression (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously determined that MESP1 protein peaked at day 5 and that day 5 YFP+ cells possessed an early CPC signature (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we identified early CPC-enriched small RNAs by next-generation sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained 9,461,773 usable reads, of which 2,465,814 were aligned to miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an arbitrary cutoff of fold change  greater than 2 (YFP+ vs. YFP) and reads  greater than 1,000 to obtain a list of early CPC-enriched miRNAs (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most miRNAs on the list do not have established roles in cardiac development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A cluster of miRNAsmiR-322 and miR-503had the highest enrichment (25-fold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of the miR-17miR-92 family and its paralogs, the miR-106bmiR-25 family and miR-106amiR-363 family, were among the highly enriched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This superfamily is essential for cardiac development: The loss of both the miR-17miR-92 and miR-106bmiR-25 clusters led to severe cardiac defects and embryonic death (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The miR-302/-367 cluster also was highly enriched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cluster reprograms somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), whereas miR-302 promotes mesendoderm at the expense of neuroectoderm in human ESCs (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high enrichment of these clusters attests to successful capturing of important regulatory miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heart- and skeletal muscle-specific miRNAs, namely, miR-1, -133, -206, -208, and -499, were not expressed at this stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MESP1_Transactivates_Early_CPC-Enriched_miRNAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the identified miRNAs, we examined our recently reported datasets of MESP1 ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) and histone 3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) ChIP-seq in day 5 CPCs (23) and histone 3 acetylated at lysine 27 (H3K27ac) ChIP-Seq in enriched mesoderm cells (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because miRNA transcription start sites (TSS) are not well defined, we focused on two classes of upstream regulatory regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 140 miRNAs enriched in Mesp1-lineage cells, 85 fall within a long transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overlapping MESP1 and H3K4me3 peaks were present within 1.5 kb of the TSS in 64 (45.7%) of these miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the remaining 55 that do not fall within a long transcript, overlapping MESP1 and H3K4me3 peaks were present in 28 (20.0%) within a distance of 10 kb of the miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, 65.7% of CPC-enriched miRNAs have both MESP1 and H3K4me3 signatures on their TSSs (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frequently, these signatures also overlap with H3K27ac peaks (alignment of representative findings are shown in Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a Tet-On tetracycline conditional gene-expression system, we induced MESP1 in ESCs and detected increased expression of the putative downstream miRNAs (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strongly suggest that MESP1 directly transactivates miRNAs enriched in early CPCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the function, the targets of the top 25 MESP1-activated miRNAs were predicted using miRanda (www.microrna.org/microrna/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we compared their fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) expression profiles in day 5 YFP+ and YFP cells (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched in the down-regulated genes (796 counts) (Fig S1A) include neuroectoderm and some endoderm derivatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, terms related to the recently expanded Mesp1 lineages (heart, skeletal muscle, and blood) were not enriched (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that Mesp1 drives miRNAs to suppress non-Mesp1 lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Using_Calcium_Transient-Based_Screening_to_Identify_Cardiomyocyte-Promoting_miRNAs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we set up a screening assay for miRNAs that drive cardiomyocyte differentiation in ESCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because calcium transients can be recorded in immature cardiomyocytes (29) and in CPCs when pulsed (30), we designed the following screening procedure: (i) monolayer wild-type E14 ESCs were transduced with miRNA lentiviral vectors; (ii) at a series of time points, Fluo-4 fluorescent calcium indicator was loaded; (iii) an electric pulse was applied to the culture; and (iv) calcium transients were recorded (Fig 1 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wild-type and miRNA-transduced E14 ESCs were cultured as a monolayer in serum-free medium, yielding little spontaneous cardiac differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No calcium transients were recorded in wild-type ESCs at day 5 and 6 and were rare at day 7 and 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from day 5, ESCs transduced with miR-322/-503 or miR-17miR-92 showed multiple (more than four) calcium transients after pulse (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other miRNAs which consistently displayed calcium transients at any time point include the miR-130b/-301b cluster, the miR-23amiR-24-2 cluster, miR-340, -378, -335, -31, -708, -542, -152, and -382, but fewer than four transients were recorded in any of these miRNAs (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We concluded that the miR-322/-503 and miR-17miR-92 clusters have the strongest cardiomyocyte-promoting activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S2 summarizes selected CPC-enriched miRNAs, their folds in enrichment, the presence of MESP1-transactivating sites, and activities in the screening assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The calcium-transient screening did not include myomiRs, because they are not enriched in the early CPCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we used the hanging-drop method to validate our screening, with miR-1 and miR-208 as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-322/-503, miR-1, and miR-208 all induced higher expression of Tbx5, Nkx2-5, and -MHC and increased formation of cardiomyocytes (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the relative potential of these miRNAs can be addressed only when they are expressed in their natural timing and cell types; that investigation is beyond the scope of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

miR-322_-503_Specifically_Drives_a_Cardiomyocyte_Differentiation_Program  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The miR-322/-503 cluster is encoded in an intergenic region on the X-chromosome [miR-322 stemloop, chromosome X: 5305425553054349 (); miR-503 stemloop, chromosome X: 5305398453054054 ()].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coding sequences for both miRNAs are highly conserved among placental mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are additional miRNAs in this locus, but they either lack placental mammal conservation (miR-351) or were enriched to a much lower degree (miR-542/-450b) in CPCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first used a LacZ-knockin reporter allele (31) to determine the expression pattern of miR-322/-503.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Galactosidase activity was detected in the truncus arteriosus, bulbus cordis, the wall of common ventricular chamber, and sinus venosus of the primitive heart at E8.5 and E9.5 and in the heart and somites at E10.5 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To decide if miR-322/-503 persists in later stages, we microscopically dissected E14.5 organs and assayed miR-322/-503 expression by real-time RT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both miRNAs had the highest expression in the heart and tongue and the lowest expression in the brain (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that the miR-322/-503 cluster initially expresses in the Mesp1 lineage of progenitor cells and persists in the heart and some skeletal muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we used an ESC differentiation model to study the cardiogenic function of miR-322/-503.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we determined that endogenous miR-322 and miR-503 levels started to rise at day 3 and peaked at day 5 (Fig 2C), following a pattern similar to that of Mesp1 (23, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mimic this temporal pattern, we generated stable miR-322/-503 Tet-On ESC lines in which a single dose of doxycycline (dox) increased miR-322 and miR-503 expression by more than 10-fold within 24 h (Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Day 3 dox supplementation resulted in precocious cardiomyocyte formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 6.5, spontaneously contracting clusters with well-formed sarcomeric structures were widely present in cultures with dox but were absent in cultures without dox (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 10, when the cultures were further differentiated, cultures with dox showed significantly increased cardiac troponin T (cTnT)-positive cardiomyocytes compared with the dox-free cultures (23.4 vs. 7.6% by FACS) (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assayed developmental markers at a series of time points: Dox induced significantly increased levels of cardiomyocyte markers (Tbx5, Mef2c, Nkx2-5, and -MHC) but had little effect on pluripotency (Oct4 and Sox2) or mesendoderm markers (Eomes, T, Gsc, and Mesp1) (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, miR-322/-503 acts at a specific developmental stage and is a potent inducer of the cardiomyocyte program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We asked if ectopic miR-322/-503 also affects other lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skeletal muscle progenitor markers Myf5 and Pax3 were significantly up-regulated, indicating that miR-322/-503 induce skeletal muscle differentiation (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endothelial cell markers Flk1 and Pecam1 showed modest increases, but the prevalence of positive VE-Cadherin staining was indistinguishable in cultures with and without dox (Fig 3 B and C), suggesting that the role of miR-322/-503 in endothelial cell differentiation is complex and perhaps is not as powerful as in cardiomyocyte differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no differential expression of the smooth muscle marker SM-actin in cultures with and without dox (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if inhibition of miR-322 or miR-503 impairs cardiac differentiation, we generated miR-Zip-expressing E14 ESCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control culture showed evident cardiomyocyte formation at day 8, with expression of cardiac factors (Tbx5, Mef2c, Nkx2-5, and -MHC) and sarcomeric -actinin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either miR-322 or miR-503 miR-Zip down-regulated these markers significantly, suggesting an obligatory role of miR-322/-503 in cardiomyocyte formation in ESCs (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Global_Assessment_of_Transcriptome_upon_miR-322_-503_Induction_Indicates_Specific_Inhibition_of_Ectoderm_Lineages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain a global picture of reactive transcriptome changes upon miR-322/-503 expression, we surveyed the mRNA in day 4 (24 h after dox induction) cultures with and without dox by microarray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 618 genes were up-regulated, and 892 genes were down-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most significant GO terms enriched in up-regulated genes were heart development and skeletal system development (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most significantly up-regulated cardiac genes include Hand2, Wnt2, Isl1, Tbx20, Foxc1, and Tbx5, among others (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, blood vessel development and vasculature development were enriched in both up- and down-regulated genes, supporting a complex role of miR-322/-503 in vascular endothelial cell differentiation (Fig 3 D and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most significantly enriched GO terms in down-regulated genes were ectoderm development and neural tube development, strongly suggesting that miR-322/-503 drives the cardiomyocyte program at the cost of neuroectoderm lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most suppressed genes pertinent to the neuroectoderm were Cdh2, Zic3, Msx1, Sox2, Sox3, Rcor2, Otx2, and Neurod1 (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Celf1_Is_a_Direct_Target_of_miR-322_-503  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our search for the miR-322/-503targeted cell-fate regulators, our attention was drawn to a family of Celf proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every member of this family except Celf3 was down-regulated upon miR-322/-503 induction (Fig 3H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Celf binds RNA and regulates RNA decay, alternative splicing, and translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Celf proteins are stage- and lineage-specific, implying that they have roles in lineage determination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied the expression patterns of the relatively abundant members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In E7.5 embryos, Celf1, Celf2, and Celf4 were localized in the ectoderm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In E9.5 and E10.5 embryos, they were located predominantly in neural tissues (Fig 4A and Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among a range of E14.5 embryonic organs, all Celf proteins had the highest expression in the brain (Fig 4 B and C and Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that although all Celf members may be targets of miR-322/-503, Celf1 is a chief candidate, because (i) it is widespread but differentially expressed among organs; (ii) it is regulated mainly through posttranscriptional mechanisms; (iii) it inhibits skeletal muscle differentiation and induces muscle wasting in myotonic dystrophy (33, 34); and (iv) it was biochemically determined to be a degradation target of miR-503, although the biological significance of this finding is unclear (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using several computational programs (www.microrna.org/microrna/), including Miranda and TargetScan, we predicted the putative miR-322/-503 target sites on the Celf1 3 UTR (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the seed sequences of miR-322 and miR-503 differ by only 1 nt, they likely share the same target site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cloned a fragment containing Celf1 3 UTR into pmirGLO for luciferase reporter assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When miR-322/-503 was present, the pmirGLO-Celf1 3 UTR showed more than 50% decrease in luciferase activity, but mutations in the target site showed little decrease (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During ESC differentiation, a reverse correlation between the expressions of Celf1 and miR-322/-503 was evident (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Celf1 protein was reduced by dox-induced miR-322/-503 in miR-322/-503 Tet-On ESCs (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, endogenous Celf1 was down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner by increasing amounts of ectopic miR-322/-503 in 293T cells (Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings strongly suggest that Celf1 is a direct target of miR-322/-503.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We reasoned that, if Celf1 is one of the chief targets of miR-322/-503, inhibition of Celf1 should mimic the function of ectopic miR-322/-503.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked if Celf1 knockdown would promote the cardiomyocyte program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of shRNA against Celf1, which showed high efficacy in inhibiting Celf1 protein expression (Fig 4I), the cardiac program was significantly enhanced, as evidenced by increased expression of cardiac transcription factors (Tbx5, Mef2c, and Nkx2-5) and cardiac structure genes (-actinin and -MHC), whereas pluripotent genes (Oct4 and Sox2) and mesoderm genes (Eomes and T) were largely unaffected (Fig 4 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Celf1_Drives_Neuroectoderm_and_Inhibits_Cardiac_Differentiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Celf1 expression drops sharply at day 5 when both miR-322 and miR-503 peak during ESC differentiation (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked how cell fates are affected if the Celf1 expression pattern is perturbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated Celf1-Flag Tet-On ESCs and induced Celf1-Flag with dox (1 g/mL) at day 4 (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 8, spontaneous contractility was evident in control cultures but was rare in cultures containing dox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By straining -actinin, we observed well-formed sarcomeric structures in control cultures but not in cultures containing dox (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the early neural marker Tuj1 was frequently present in cultures containing dox, which also contained well-formed Tuj1+ neurites (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Survey of lineage markers showed that Celf1 inhibited cardiac transcription factors (Tbx5, Mef2c, and Nkx2-5) and the structure gene -MHC, whereas it promoted early neural markers (Notch3, Sox1, Nestin, and Pax6) (Fig 5 E and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test further the notion that miR-322/-503 targets Celf1 and impacts cell-fate decisions, we induced simultaneous miR-322/-503 and Celf1 expression in miR-322/-503/Celf1 Tet-On ESCs (Fig 5 HJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ectopic Celf1 does not contain the original 3 UTR and thus is not subjected to miR-322/-503 targeting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-322/-503 and Celf1 coexpression largely reproduced the results of Celf1 expression alone (Fig 5 J and K), but the effect of miR-322/-503 was abolished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a slight delay in differentiation even in the uninduced culture, suggesting low-level (undetectable) leakage of Celf1, but induction of both miR-322/-503 and Celf1 led to reduced cardiac myocyte formation (Fig 5K) and expression of cardiac genes (Fig 5L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study we used a lineage-tracking system to isolate the Mesp1 lineage of CPCs and captured their enriched miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reprogramming human somatic cells to cardiomyocytes often involves Mesp1 (30, 36, 37), justifying the identification of effectors downstream of Mesp1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The miRNAs identified here represent early regulators of cardiac fate, likely at the stages of cardiac mesoderm formation and cardiac program initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this notion, miRNAs that specify mesoderm (let-7, miR-18, and miR-302) and/or are essential for cardiac development (the miR-17miR-92 superfamily) were among the most highly enriched (25, 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously identified heart- and skeletal muscle-specific miRNAsmiR-1, -133, -208, -499, and otherswere not expressed in Mesp1 CPCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mesp1 lineage-enriched miRNAs represent a valuable resource for dissecting early cell fate and cardiomyocyte differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it will be critical to distinguish which miRNAs act at prerequisite steps, and which are directly involved in cardiac fate establishment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our epigenetic data suggest that Mesp1 directly transactivates a number of miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A majority of predicted targets of the top 25 miRNAs were down-regulated in the Mesp1 lineage, with GO terms outside Mesp1-regulated lineages, supporting a hypothesis that Mesp1 uses miRNAs to inhibit other lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best candidate, the miR-322/-503 cluster, exemplifies this notion by a strong inhibitory effect on neural differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a role has not been previously appreciated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-322(-424; miR-424 is the human ortholog of miR-322)/-503 is implicated in angiogenesis (40, 41), mammary epithelial involution after pregnancy (42, 43), cancers (acting as a tumor suppressor) (44, 45), and myotube formation (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that its primary role during embryogenesis is regulating cardiac muscle differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that null mutants of miR-322/-503 were not embryonically defective but had adult-onset anomalies (white fat accumulation) (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such phenotypes may be the outcome of masking by multiple miRNAs (e.g., the miR-15 family) sharing the same seed sequence (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identification of a cardiac- and skeletal muscle-specific X-chromosome locus is of fundamental importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the future directions is to determine if miR-322/-503 and other miRNAs in this locus contribute to gender differences in cardiac development and diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the immediate upstream gene, Plac1, is paternally imprinted (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-322/-503 and other miRNAs in this locus also may be imprinted and subjected to tight dose control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Celf1 may be one of the important targets that mediate the function of miR-322/-503.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its best-known function is in the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1), a common multisystem disorder that chiefly affects the skeletal and cardiac muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In DM1, the disease gene DMPK1 harbors an expansion of CUG triplet repeats on its 3 UTR which misregulate the RNA-binding factors MBNL1 and Celf1 (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both MBNL1 and Celf1 contribute to DM1 pathogenesis, but only Celf1 is responsible for muscle wasting and weakness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ectopic Celf1 impairs myoblast differentiation (50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurite overgrowth was recently observed in DM1 ESCs, suggesting uncontrolled neural differentiation (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that Celf1 impairs cardiomyocyte differentiation but promotes neural lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a function agrees with Celf1s high expression in the neural lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Celf1 binds to mRNAs of muscle genes and regulates their stability, as assayed in C2C12 myoblasts (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, understanding the lineage-specification mechanisms of Celf1 will require a full-scope future study in an unbiased system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have identified miRNAs downstream of Mesp1 that may suppress non-Mesp1 lineages during differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These miRNAs are a valuable resource and a significant addition to the network of early cardiac-fate regulators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The miR-322/-503 cluster, which specifically regulates the cardiomyocyte program, is the most promising candidate of these miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further study of these miRNAs may lead to new drug candidates for treating cardiac and skeletal muscle injuries, such as myocardial ischemia and muscular dystrophies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

ESC lines bearing the Mesp1Cre/+; Rosa26EYFP/+ genotype produced from a crossing of Mesp1Cre/+ and Rosa26EYFP/EYFP mouse strains were established using an E3.5 blastocyst outgrowth method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E14 wild-type ES line was obtained from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (MMRRC) repository.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All ESCs were cultured feeder-free in ESC medium [DMEM (high glucose; Gibco) supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) FBS (HyClone), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) nonessential amino acids, 1 × 103 U/mL murine leukemia inhibitory factor (ESGRO-LIF; Gibco), 0.1 mM -mercaptoethanol, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 µg/mL streptomycin].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medium was changed daily (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ESC differentiation was performed under serum-free conditions (17, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ESCs were cultured on collagen IV (0.5 mg/mL)-coated dishes (Sigma) in serum-free differentiation medium [a 3:1 mixture of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (Gibco) and Ham's F-12 Nutrient Mix (Gibco), 0.05% BSA, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin, 0.45 mM 1-thioglycerol, 2 mM l-glutamine, 0.5× B27 supplement (Gibco), and 0.5× N2 supplement (Gibco)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cardiac differentiation, activin (10 ng/mL) (R&D Systems) was added for the first 4 d. For neural differentiation, SB431542 (10 M) (TOCRIS) and FGF2 (12 ng/mL) (R&D Systems) were added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To induce ectopic gene expression, doxycycline (1 g/mL) (Clontech) was supplemented at a variety of time points as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
293FT cells were cultured in DMEM (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 g/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM l-glutamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Construction_of_miRNA-Expressing_Clones_and_Calcium_Transient-Based_Cardiogenic_Screening  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
miRNA inserts were amplified by PCR from the G4 mouse genome using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primer sequences are available upon request.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The backbone vector chosen was pLL3.8, in which we replaced the original pCMV promoter with the pGK promoter (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single miRNA inserts were cloned into the HpaI/XhoI sites of pLL3.8, and miRNA clusters were cloned into the EcoRI site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All clones were verified by Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then produced lentiviruses from the miRNA clones using the method described in the following section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E14 cells were infected with lentiviruses and sorted for GFP+ cells by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During screening, the stable cell lines were cultured in cardiac differentiation medium in glass-bottomed 96-well plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medium was changed every 48 h. On differentiation days 58, the cells were loaded with Fluo-4 NW calcium dye (1:1,000) (Life Technologies) and scanned by a high-throughput microscope (Vala Sciences) to monitor calcium transients following an electrical pulse (6 v, 2 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Construction_of_the_Inducible_Expression_Vector__Preparation_of_Lentiviral_Vectors__and_Selection_of_Stable_Expression_Clones  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a Tet-On advanced lentiviral vector system (Clontech) for inducible gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To construct pLVX-miR-322/-503, the miR-322/-503 insert was PCR amplified as above and ligated into the pLVX-Tight-Puro (Clontech) vector at the EcoRI cloning site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For pLVX-Celf1-Flag, we isolated the Celf1-Flag insert from a pcDNA3.1-CUGBP1-Flag plasmid (contributed by Thomas A. Cooper, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston) with NheI/NotI and blunt ligated it into the BamHI/NotI sites of pLVX-Tight-Puro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All clones were verified by Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To prepare lentiviral infectious particles, the aforementioned plasmids were cotransfected with packaging plasmid psPAX2 and envelope plasmid pMD2.G at a ratio of 3:2:1 into 293FT cells using FuGENE HD transfection agent (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The culture supernatant was collected 48 h and 72 h after transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatants containing lentiviruses were stored as aliquots at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For inducible expression, E14 cells were first infected by pLVX-Tet-On Advanced lentivirus and were selected for Neomycin (200 g/mL) resistance to generate E14 Tet-On Advanced cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E14 Tet-On Advanced cells were next infected with pLVX-miR-322/-503 or pLVX-Celf1Flag lentiviruses and were selected with puromycin (1 g/mL) to generate stable E14 Tet-On Advanced/pLVX-miR-322/-503 or E14 Tet-On Advanced/pLVX-Celf1 cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

miRNA_Inhibitor_Lentiviral_Vectors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We purchased miRZip-424 (miR-424 is the human ortholog of miR-322 with identical sequences) and miRZip-503 (System Biosciences) inhibitors of miR-322 and miR-503.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmids were used for lentivirus production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E14 cells were individually infected with lentiviruses and were selected for puromycin (1 g/mL) resistance to generate stable cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Real-Time_RT-PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to assess gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For miRNA measurement, the Taqman MicroRNA Assay system (Life Technologies) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miRNA expression levels were normalized to 18s rRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For protein-coding gene expression, total RNA (100 ng) was subjected to quantitative RT-PCR using Taqman One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix reagent (Eurogentec) and a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The copy number for each transcript is expressed relative to that of GAPDH as a constitutive control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences of primer sets and probes are provided in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunostaining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were fixed with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 10% (vol/vol) normal goat or donkey serum (determined by the source of the primary antibodies) in 0.1% Triton-100/PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the samples were incubated overnight in the following primary antibodies at 4 °C: mouse monoclonal antibody to sarcomeric -actinin (1:100; Novus Biologicals), mouse monoclonal antibody to SM-actin (1:100; Santa Cruz), goat antibody to VE-Cadherin (1:50; Santa Cruz), and mouse monoclonal antibody to TuJ1 (1:100; Thermo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the next day the cells were incubated in the following fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies for 90 min at room temperature: Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (1:500; Life Technologies), Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-goat IgG (H+L) antibody (1:300; Life Technologies), and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibody (1:500; Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the cells were stained with DAPI for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were captured with a Nikon fluorescence microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

FACS_Analysis_and_Sorting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Embryoid bodies or cells cultured as monolayers were first washed with PBS and were dissociated in 0.25% trypsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, ESC medium was used to neutralize the reaction, and cells were collected by centrifuge (1,000 × g for 5 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were suspended in 12 mL of ESC medium and were passed through a cell strainer and into a conical FACS tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used cTnT immunostaining (Fisher Scientific) followed by FACS to assess cardiomyocyte differentiation, as previously described (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sorting was performed on a FACSAria II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and FACS data were processed with the FlowJo software (Tree Star).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blots  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer [50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS], and the proteins were separated on a 412% Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membranes were incubated with overnight the following primary antibodies at 4 °C: mouse monoclonal antibody to Celf1 (1:1,000; Santa Cruz), mouse monoclonal antibody to FLAG (1:1,000; Sigma), and goat monoclonal antibody to HRP-conjugated -actin (1:2,000; Santa Cruz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the next day the membranes (except -actin) were incubated with the secondary antibody rabbit anti-mouse HRP-conjugated IgG (1:2,000; Life Technologies) for 90 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were used to generate signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Actin was used as an internal control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Luciferase_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To construct luciferase assay vectors, we first prepared a cDNA library from total RNA collected from E14 as the template for PCR amplification of predicted miR-322/-503 target regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cDNA library was obtained using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed PCR amplification with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the primer pair GCTCGCTAGCCTCGAGGCAGATGTTTATGCCCTTTG and CGACTCTAGACTCGAGGGCTGCTCTGAGACAGTTAC for the Celf1 3 UTR (approximately nucleotides 16612261 in Celf1 mRNA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ligated the amplified fragments into Promegas pmirGLO vector using Clontechs In-Fusion HD Cloning kit to generate luciferase reporter plasmids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Celf1 3 UTRmut was created by replacing the putative target sequence GACTGCT with CTGACGA using the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The luciferase assay was performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Whole-Mount_in_Situ_Hybridization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole-mount in situ hybridization against Celf1, Celf2, Celf4, and Celf6 was performed on E7.5, E8.5, E9.5, and E10.5 embryos (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ probes of Celf1, Celf2, Celf4, and Celf6 were prepared using customized primers (Celf1 forward: 5-GGGAAACCTTGCTGGTCTAA-3, Celf1 reverse: 5-GACATTCCCAAAGGGCATAAAC-3; Celf2 forward: 5-CAGGGTGATGTTCTCTCCATTT-3, Celf2 reverse: 5-CGCCATACCTGAGAGCATTT-3; Celf4 forward: 5-ATGTCTGGATGGAGCTGTTTAG-3, Celf4 reverse: 5-GAGTGAAGCAGAGGTGAGAAG-3; Celf6 forward: 5-GGAAGCCCAGACTTACTTTGT-3, Celf6 reverse: 5-TCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCT-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR amplification with Taq enzyme (Life Technologies) was performed, and the resulting DNA was ligated into the pGEMT-easy vector (Promega) according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in situ probes of Celf1, Celf2, Celf4, and Celf6 were produced using the following promoterrestriction enzyme combinations: Celf1, Sp6 promoter and ApaI site; Celf2, T7 promoter and NdeI site; Celf4, Sp6 promoter and SacII site; and Celf6, Sp6 promoter and ApaI site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Salmon-Gal_Staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A LacZ-knockin miR-322/-503 reporter mouse strain was developed by Michael McManus, University of California, San Francisco (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LacZ gene was placed 200 bp upstream of the miR-322 stemloop sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the low level activity of the locus, we chose a sensitive Salmon-gal method to stain -galactosidase activity (55) in E8.5 and E9.5 embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryos were fixed for 15 min in the fixation buffer consisting of 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 2% (wt/vol) formalin, 5 mM EGTA, and 2 mM MgCl2 in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The embryos then were washed three times for 20 min with wash buffer [0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% IGEPAL (Sigma), 2 mM MgCl2, and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.3)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next the embryos were stained at 37 °C with staining solution: 1 mg/mL Salmon-gal and 0.4 mM tetranitroblue tetrazolium in wash buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The staining was checked every 10 min for optimized signal-to-noise ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Whole-Genome_Microarray_and_Next-Generation_Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy reagents (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integrity and concentration of RNA samples was determined using RNA 6000 Nano LabChip kits and an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples for next-generation sequencing were prepared using the Small RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturers protocol and were quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were adjusted to 3 pM and sequenced on the Illumina Solexa 1G Genome Analyzer at the University of Houston.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing reads with a 3 adapter were picked out and subjected to further filters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reads falling into the following categories were removed: (i) failing the chastity or no-calls test; (ii) copy number 4; (iii) read length 10 nt; (iv) containing more than 10 consecutive single nucleotide repeats; (v) matching the Escherichia coli genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining reads were mapped to miRNA hairpin sequences (miRbase v13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We allowed up to three mismatches in the mapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When dealing with mismatches, we used the SmithWaterman algorithm (gap penalty, 3; match score, 2; mismatch penalty, 1; cutoff, 1.46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole-genome microarray analysis was performed on the OneArray Mouse Whole Genome Array (Phalanx Biotech Group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The raw data were rescaled to account for the differences in individual hybridization intensities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GO analysis using DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) was performed on genes falling within the condition P less_than 0.01, fold change  greater than 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data were processed using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 5.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All values are expressed as mean ± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons between two groups were determined using unpaired two-tailed Students t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
