A natural product inhibits the initiation of -synuclein aggregation and suppresses its toxicity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parkinsons disease is characterized by the presence in brain tissues of aberrant aggregates primarily formed by the protein -synuclein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been difficult, however, to identify compounds capable of preventing the formation of such deposits because of the complexity of the aggregation process of -synuclein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By exploiting recently developed highly quantitative in vitro assays, we identify a compound, squalamine, that blocks -synuclein aggregation, and characterize its mode of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that squalamine, by competing with -synuclein for binding lipid membranes, specifically inhibits the initiation of the aggregation process of -synuclein and abolishes the toxicity of -synuclein oligomers in neuronal cells and in an animal model of Parkinsons disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The self-assembly of -synuclein is closely associated with Parkinsons disease and related syndromes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that squalamine, a natural product with known anticancer and antiviral activity, dramatically affects -synuclein aggregation in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We elucidate the mechanism of action of squalamine by investigating its interaction with lipid vesicles, which are known to stimulate nucleation, and find that this compound displaces -synuclein from the surfaces of such vesicles, thereby blocking the first steps in its aggregation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that squalamine almost completely suppresses the toxicity of -synuclein oligomers in human neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting their interactions with lipid membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further examine the effects of squalamine in a Caenorhabditis elegans strain overexpressing -synuclein, observing a dramatic reduction of -synuclein aggregation and an almost complete elimination of muscle paralysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that squalamine could be a means of therapeutic intervention in Parkinsons disease and related conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Squalamine_Displaces_-Synuclein_from_Lipid_Membranes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study whether or not squalamine can affect the binding of -synuclein to lipid bilayers, we first used small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) with diameters of about 30 nm composed of 30% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS), 50% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), and 20% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), which represent the most abundant lipids found in the membranes of synaptic vesicles (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titrating squalamine into a solution of -synuclein bound to DOPS:DOPE:DOPC (30:50:20) vesicles was observed to reduce the -helical content of -synuclein in an approximately linear manner with squalamine concentration, as measured by circular dichroism (CD) (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that squalamine is able to displace -synuclein from the surface of lipid bilayers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The physiological concentration of -synuclein in neuronal synapses is estimated to be about 50 µM (27, 28), a concentration of protein that can be studied by NMR spectroscopy (27, 2932).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore used this technique to probe potential interactions between -synuclein and squalamine in the absence of lipids and to characterize the displacement of the protein from lipid membranes by squalamine, as suggested by the CD experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is based on the fact that even very weak interactions typically generate measurable shifts in the NMR signals of interacting molecules and often broaden the resonances to an extent that is determined by the rates involved in the binding process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first incubated free monomeric -synuclein in the absence of lipids and in the presence of increasing concentrations of squalamine and observed small chemical shift changes in the resonances of residues in the C-terminal region of the protein (Fig S1), consistent with those associated with the weak binding of -synuclein to other polyamine compounds (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction involves two regions between residues 85 and 140, where the NMR spectra reveal two distinct types of behavior; the resonances of residues 88106 show only very small effects, but those of residues 113139 are affected in a much more pronounced manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe the stoichiometry of the interaction of -synuclein and squalamine and to estimate the binding constant, we performed a series of dilutions on a sample containing 80 µM -synuclein and 240 µM squalamine, monitoring the intensities of the -synuclein resonances (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This experiment shows that when the squalamine concentration becomes lower than about 100 µM, the spectral changes characteristic of the interaction are no longer visible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Then, we investigated further the displacement of -synuclein from the membrane by squalamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been previously demonstrated that addition of DOPE:DOPS:DOPC (50:30:20) vesicles to a sample of -synuclein results in attenuation of the main-chain amide signals of its about 100 N-terminal residues in the 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) NMR spectrum (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This attenuation is attributable to the binding of these residues to the large, slowly tumbling vesicles, whereas the secondary structure becomes -helical, as indicated by CD measurements and by indirect transferred nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) in the spectra (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the resonances of the 40 C-terminal residues retain almost their full intensity and experience only very minor changes in chemical shifts (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present work we prepared an NMR sample containing a sufficient quantity of lipid vesicles to cause a large attenuation of the signals of -synuclein and then titrated increasing amounts of squalamine into the sample (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the addition of about 200 µM of squalamine resulted in an almost complete recovery of the intensity of the -synuclein signals (Fig 1F) and found that signals from residues 101120, which are affected to a much smaller extent than residues 1100 by the presence of lipids, were restored to their free intensities at a much lower concentration of squalamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, even though the squalamine:-synuclein ratios and the absolute squalamine concentrations in the presence of DOPE:DOPS:DOPC vesicles (Fig 1 C and D) were comparable to those in the lipid-free experiments (Fig S1), there was no evidence in the former experiments for the interaction of squalamine with the C-terminal residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, when the squalamine concentration was increased to 80 µM in the absence of -synuclein, the sample became highly opaque, suggesting that the lipid vesicles in the sample undergo fusion within seconds, an effect likely to be due to the change in the electrostatic properties of the lipid vesicles upon squalamine binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the presence of -synuclein the samples were stable and no precipitation occurred within the time scales of either the CD or the NMR experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, these observations demonstrate that, in a system containing -synuclein and negatively charged lipid membranes, squalamine partitions to the membrane surface, thereby inducing the displacement of the protein from the membrane rather than remaining free in solution and interacting directly with -synuclein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Squalamine_Inhibits_Lipid-Induced_Aggregation_of_-Synuclein_by_Competing_for_Binding_Sites_at_the_Surface_of_the_DMPS_Vesicles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the light of these results, we explored the effects of squalamine on the binding and aggregation of -synuclein in the presence of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DMPS)-containing vesicles, which have been shown to be particularly effective in enhancing the rate of aggregation and amyloid formation by -synuclein (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first incubated the protein under conditions where effectively all of the -synuclein molecules present in the sample were bound to the vesicles and in the presence of increasing concentrations of squalamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed in the experiments with the DOPS:DOPE:DOPC (30:50:20) vesicles (Fig 1 CF), the presence of squalamine progressively decreased the -helical content of -synuclein (Fig 2A), again indicating that squalamine displaces the protein from the vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus used the same competitive binding model (Fig 2B) as the one describing the displacement of -synuclein from the vesicle by -synuclein (22), where both -synuclein and squalamine compete for binding sites at the surface of the DMPS vesicles, in order to analyze the CD data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model, together with previously determined binding constants for the -synuclein/DMPS system (12), described the data very closely and yielded values for both the binding constant and the stoichiometry of the binding of squalamine to DMPS vesicles, KD,S = 67 nM and LS = 7.3, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the positively charged squalamine binds strongly to the anionic head groups of the lipid bilayers, progressively coating the surfaces of the lipid membrane, thereby decreasing the electrostatic forces and competing for the sites on the lipid vesicles that are required for the binding of -synuclein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further monitored the effects of increasing concentrations of squalamine on the size and the fluidity of the DMPS vesicles, using dynamic light scattering and differential scanning calorimetry (Fig S2), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of squalamine caused an increase in the diameter of the DMPS vesicles from about 20 nm to values in excess of 100 nm at squalamine:lipid ratios greater than 0.1 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) traces of the DMPS vesicles in the absence and presence of 50 µM squalamine show that the molecule induced a decrease in the melting temperature by 10 °C (Fig S2), an effect similar to that observed upon binding of -synuclein to DMPS vesicles (12), suggesting that squalamine interacts with the membrane surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, however, these results indicate that at squalamine:DMPS ratios below 1:10 the integrity of the vesicles is not compromised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then studied the aggregation of -synuclein in the presence of DMPS vesicles and increasing concentrations of squalamine and observed that the overall rate of amyloid formation under such conditions decreases dramatically in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that the observed change in the rate of lipid-induced aggregation of -synuclein is not likely to be due to a change in the vesicle morphology; as discussed above, at the squalamine:lipid ratios used here the diameter of the vesicles ranges from 20 nm to 100 nm (Fig S2), and this size variation has been shown not to affect significantly the kinetics of amyloid formation by -synuclein in the presence of DMPS vesicles (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify further the effects of squalamine on -synuclein aggregation, we analyzed the early stages of the kinetic traces (Fig 2C) (12) (SI Materials and Methods for details) and determined the rate of -synuclein aggregation at each concentration of squalamine (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in the relative rate of lipid-induced aggregation of -synuclein with increasing concentration of squalamine is well described by a competitive binding model, with the binding constants determined here for squalamine (KD,S and LS) and previously for -synuclein (KD, and L) (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results are consistent with the conclusion that squalamine inhibits the lipid-induced aggregation of -synuclein via competitive binding at the surfaces of the vesicles, as observed for -synuclein (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we probed the interaction of squalamine with -synuclein fibrils by incubating squalamine in the presence of the fibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then centrifuged the sample and separated the supernatant from the pellet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we assessed the quantity of squalamine in the supernatant before and after incubation with fibrils using, mass spectrometry (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, after incubation, the signal corresponding to squalamine in the supernatant was reduced (85%), suggesting a degree of binding to -synuclein fibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction may also play a role in the observed inhibition of squalamine on the lipid-induced aggregation of -synuclein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control we performed the same experiment, using A42 fibrils (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, we observed a lower binding signal (66%), indicating stronger binding to -synuclein fibrils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Squalamine_Suppresses_the_Toxicity_of_-Synuclein_Oligomers_in_Human_Neuroblastoma_Cell_Lines_by_Inhibiting_Their_Binding_to_Cellular_Membranes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have recently developed a protocol to isolate oligomers of -synuclein shown to be toxic to human cells (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exposed cultured human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma culture cells to such oligomers at a concentration of 0.3 M (monomer equivalent of -synuclein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the oligomers were indeed toxic to the cells, as demonstrated by the decreased ability of the cells to chemically reduce 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were also treated with -synuclein oligomers (0.3 µM) in the presence of increasing concentrations of squalamine (up to 3.0 µM) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that squalamine decreases markedly the mitochondrial damage induced by the -synuclein oligomers, as indicated by MTT reduction data, with the protective effect increasing with squalamine concentration (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained from analyzing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production within SH-SY5Y cells; the -synuclein oligomers (0.3 µM) induced a sharp increase in ROS levels in this cell model, indicating increased ROS-induced cellular damage (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon treatment of the cells with -synuclein oligomers (0.3 µM monomer equivalent) and increasing concentrations (0.03 µM, 0.3 µM, and 3 µM) of squalamine, the degree of ROS-derived fluorescence was observed to decrease steadily with increasing squalamine concentration (Fig 3B), and at the highest ratio of squalamine:-synuclein concentrations it was found to suppress almost completely the increase of intracellular ROS levels caused by the oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then investigated the mechanism by which squalamine inhibits -synuclein oligomer toxicity by analyzing the interactions between the oligomers (0.3 µM) and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells at increasing concentrations (up to 3.0 µM) of squalamine, using confocal microscopy and anti-synuclein antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images were scanned at apical planes to detect oligomers (green channel) interacting with the cellular surface (red channel) (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large numbers of -synuclein oligomers bound to the plasma membrane were observed in cells exposed to oligomers, but their number was markedly decreased as the squalamine concentration was increased (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we have shown previously, the toxicity caused by protein oligomers can be correlated with membrane binding (34) and this finding provides an explanation for the inhibition of the cellular damage induced by -synuclein oligomers by squalamine and is consistent with a competitive binding model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Squalamine_Reduces_-Synuclein_Aggregation_and_Related_Paralysis_in_a_Worm_Model_of_PD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We extended our in vitro observations that squalamine can suppress the aggregation and toxicity of -synuclein to a living system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a well-studied model of PD in the nematode worm C. elegans, which is based on the overexpression of -synuclein tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in the muscle cells of the nematode worms (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model organism, in which the presence of -synuclein causes characteristic phenotypic changes (25), has been successfully used to probe the nature of a range of neurodegenerative conditions and has been used in high-throughput screens to identify novel genes that modify the course of disease (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Motility in C. elegans declines during aging and it can be measured in liquid media by counting the number of body bends per unit of time (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenotypic readout has been used extensively for identification of genes and pathways connected to age-related protein homeostasis, as well as for the definition of modifiers of protein aggregation (25, 35, 36); both of these processes are closely associated with the onset and development of neurodegenerative diseases (5, 7, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first tested different approaches to optimize the effects of squalamine in vivo and found that the best treatment regime was to administer the compound at the larval stage L4, when the worms were fully developed, and to maintain the worms on plates seeded with squalamine for their whole lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By carrying out standard body bend assays (37), we observed a very significantly improved motility of the PD worms treated with squalamine (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the motility of a C. elegans strain expressing only YFP, used here as a control, was not detectably affected by squalamine (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As standard body bend assays monitored by manual means can be prone to errors and are not always reproducible, many digital tracking platforms have recently been proposed to characterize worm behavior in a more quantitative and rigorous way (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To improve the reproducibility of the results, we have developed a high-throughput microscopic screening procedure that allows robust C. elegans phenotypic screening with improved statistics, coupled with automated analysis of the motility of the animals (SI Materials and Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Movies of swimming worms were recorded using a high-performance imaging lens and a machine vision camera at a high number of frames per second (fps) for 30 s or 1 min, and the platform enabled us to image simultaneously up to 200 swimming animals over the whole surface of a 6-cm agar plate (SI Materials and Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this method, we confirmed with statistical confidence the observed improved motility (Fig S5) of the PD worms upon squalamine administration (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4A, 5, and 6 and Movies S1S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Automated analysis of the velocities of the movements of the worms further confirmed a significant difference between treated and untreated PD worms, and indeed those animals exposed to 50 µM squalamine showed motility levels that were essentially the same as those of the control worms (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then explored the effects of squalamine on the aggregation of -synuclein in PD worms by fluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the addition of squalamine to the medium in which the animals were maintained, we observed a substantial decrease in -synuclein inclusion formation in aged PD worms (day 12 of adulthood) (Fig 4 C and D), despite the fact that the levels of -synuclein expression in the PD worms in the absence and in the presence of squalamine were found to be closely similar (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrated that no effects could be detected on the intensity or the distribution pattern of YFP expressed within the body-wall muscle of the control worms (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore the protective effect of squalamine was apparent throughout the study, as shown by recovery of motility (thrashing and speed), decrease in paralysis rate, and the decrease in the number of inclusions (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to assess whether or not the observed effects of squalamine in suppressing inclusion formation and toxicity were specific to the -synuclein worms, we tested squalamine in a worm model of A42-mediated dysfunction (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this system, where the presence of lipids is not required for the initiation of A42 aggregation (41, 42), we observed that squalamine, at concentrations that completely restored the pathological phenotype in the Abeta42 worms, showed no significant protective effects (Fig S5), thereby indicating the specificity of squalamine against -synuclein aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown by using a variety of biophysical techniques that squalamine can inhibit in vitro the aggregation of -synuclein induced by lipid membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore we have shown by using a cellular model and an animal model of PD that squalamine dramatically reduces in vivo the toxicity associated with -synuclein aggregation (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study the binding of -synuclein to lipids, we first used SUVs composed of DOPS, DOPE, and DOPC, which are the most abundant lipids found in the membranes of synaptic vesicles (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titrating squalamine into a solution of -synuclein bound to SUVs caused the -helical content of -synuclein to decrease in an approximately linear manner with squalamine concentration, as measured by CD and NMR, thus suggesting that squalamine displaces -synuclein from lipid membranes, as observed for a range of other protein/lipid systems (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further explored the effects of squalamine on the binding and aggregation of -synuclein in the presence of DMPS-containing vesicles, which have been shown to be particularly effective in enhancing the rate of aggregation and amyloid formation of -synuclein (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of squalamine progressively decreased the -helical content of -synuclein, again indicating that this compound displaces the protein from the vesicles, as recently observed for -synuclein (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze these data, we thus used the same competitive binding model as the one describing the inhibitory effect of -synculein on -synuclein lipid-induced aggregation (22), where both -synuclein and squalamine compete for binding sites at the surface of the DMPS vesicles, which validated the model in a quantitative manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, we have shown that squalamine does not interact directly with monomeric -synuclein in free solution, except at very high concentrations and in the absence of lipids, and that it affects the size and the thermotropic properties of lipid vesicles only at high squalamine:DMPS ratios (0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we have observed that the overall rate of lipid-induced -synuclein aggregation in vitro decreases dramatically and in a dose-dependent manner upon incubation with squalamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then extended this study by using SH-SY5Y cells treated with oligomers of -synuclein previously shown to be toxic to cells in culture (23, 24) and found that squalamine inhibits completely the mitochondrial dysfunction and the cellular ROS production induced by the oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of binding of toxic -synuclein oligomers to neuronal cells also decreased with increasing squalamine concentration, and based on our results, we proposed a competitive binding model, where toxic oligomers of -synuclein and squalamine compete for binding sites at the surface of neuronal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that squalamine drastically decreases not only the neurotoxicity caused by the intracellular accumulation of -synuclein aggregates but also the cellular damage induced by aggregates interacting with the membrane of neuronal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then provided further evidence for a protective effect of squalamine observed in vitro and in cells by using a well-studied C. elegans model of PD (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When worms were exposed to squalamine from an early stage in their development, we observed an almost complete recovery of the motility dysfunction induced by -synuclein together with a substantial decrease in inclusion formation in treated PD worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, these results suggest that squalamine inhibits the initial step in the lipid-induced aggregation of -synuclein through competitive binding at the surface of the lipid vesicles and also drastically reduces the toxicity of oligomeric forms of -synuclein in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that it is also possible that other secondary mechanisms of action, such as direct interactions with fibrils, may be present and could work in synergy with the principal mechanism of action of squalamine that we have described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown that in vitro and in cell cultures squalamine suppresses the initial events in the aggregation of -synuclein by displacing the protein from lipid membranes, where such events preferentially take place, and also acts to reduce the interactions of oligomeric aggregates with the membrane surfaces (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate the mechanisms by which squalamine significantly inhibits the aggregation of -synuclein in vivo and also reduces dramatically its associated toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest, therefore, that squalamine, and by extension other molecules that can compete effectively with -synuclein for lipid membrane binding, could have the potential to act as therapeutic agents for PD and other conditions associated with the pathogenic aggregation of -synuclein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We built a simple, robust, compact, cost-effective and high-throughput setup to track C. elegans during swimming and crawling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An LED backlight illuminator with long life span and flicker-free and shadow-free illumination was used to illuminate worms moving in M9 buffer on a thin agar plate or in multiwells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The swimming worms were visualized by using a high-performance imaging lens and a machine vision camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The movies of the swimming worms were taken at a high number of fps for 30 s or 1 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different fields of view were obtained simply by changing the distance between the sample and the lens, for a fixed focal length of the lens and camera sensor size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this setup we were able to image successfully at the same time up to 200 swimming animals over the whole surface of a 6-cm agar plate or inside multiwells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze the worm movement from the movies, the first step was to detect and subtract the background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If all worms are alive, this procedure can be carried out by temporally averaging the movies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If some of the worms are dead, however, this method will skew the final statistics because the dead worms will be taken as part of the background and thus not be included in the signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly important for high-throughput testing of drugs, because certain drugs might influence the life-to-death ratio and paralysis rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the background must be estimated without using temporal information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our method we begin by defining a Gaussian adaptive threshold of the image in such a way that all worms are identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a threshold that ensures detection of all worms will also incorrectly elaborate some of the background signal as worms and so is not a completely reliable detection mechanism in itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All pixels marked as worms are then recalculated by interpolating from pixels not marked as worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure avoids removing the dead worms as part of the background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method requires the movie to be quite regular, however, and hence other items, such as the edge of a Petri dish, must first be masked by other methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After background subtraction a second (nonadaptive) thresholding procedure is performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphological operations are next used to remove speckles (morphological opening) and to close holes that can appear in the worms after the thresholding (morphological closing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We label all separated regions of the thresholded image and remove all regions that have an area too small or big to be a single worm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining labeled regions are identified as individual worms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positions of said regions are then stored for each frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently these regions are linked across the frames by standard tracking algorithms, even taking into account a worm disappearing or overlapping in a few frames.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eccentricity, a measure of the ratio of the minor and major ellipse axes, of each tracked worm can then be used to estimate the worm bending as a function of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detection_of_the_Interaction_of_Squalamine_with_Monomeric_-Synuclein_at_High_Concentrations_in_the_Absence_of_Lipids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The changes in the NMR spectrum indicate that the -synucleinsqualamine interaction is in the fast exchange regime, as the residues of -synuclein that are affected by the binding progressively shift their resonance positions as the concentration of squalamine is increased; as a consequence of the broadening a loss of intensity is also observed (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An indication that the interaction involves an aggregated state of squalamine comes from the observation that at a high squalamine concentration some of the C-terminal residues of -synuclein (e.g., Y136) experience a large degree of line broadening despite showing only modest changes in chemical shifts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resonance broadening is likely to result from two factors: a chemical exchange contribution, caused by perturbations in chemical shifts, and an increase in the dipolar contribution to the transverse relaxation rate, R2, caused by the increased size of the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the chemical shift change for Y136 is small, the R2 contribution must dominate, suggesting that the complex is significantly larger in size than the monomer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with the involvement of multimeric squalamine in the interaction, analogous to the interaction between -synuclein and micellar Congo Red (CR) (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
