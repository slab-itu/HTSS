Arabidopsis thaliana GH3.5 acyl acid amido synthetase mediates metabolic crosstalk in auxin and salicylic acid homeostasis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plants require precise control over growth regulators during development and in their responses to biotic and abiotic stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One strategy for modulating levels of bioactive phytohormones is to conjugate these molecules to amino acids using acyl acid amido synthetases of the Gretchen Hagen 3 (GH3) protein family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, GH3 proteins modify one type of phytohormone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural studies, along with in vitro and in planta biochemical analyses, reveal that the GH3.5 protein from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana conjugates multiple molecules from various phytohormone pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activity mediates crosstalk between auxin developmental and pathogen response pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Arabidopsis thaliana, the acyl acid amido synthetase Gretchen Hagen 3.5 (AtGH3.5) conjugates both indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and salicylic acid (SA) to modulate auxin and pathogen response pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the molecular basis for the activity of AtGH3.5, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with IAA and AMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical analysis demonstrates that the substrate preference of AtGH3.5 is wider than originally described and includes the natural auxin phenylacetic acid (PAA) and the potential SA precursor benzoic acid (BA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues that determine IAA versus BA substrate preference were identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dual functionality of AtGH3.5 is unique to this enzyme although multiple IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins share nearly identical acyl acid binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In planta analysis of IAA, PAA, SA, and BA and their respective aspartyl conjugates were determined in wild-type and overexpressing lines of A. thaliana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study suggests that AtGH3.5 conjugates auxins (i.e., IAA and PAA) and benzoates (i.e., SA and BA) to mediate crosstalk between different metabolic pathways, broadening the potential roles for GH3 acyl acid amido synthetases in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

3D_Structure_of_AtGH35  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous work described AtGH3.5 as a dual-function protein that accepts IAA and SA as substrates and is involved in auxin- and SA-mediated plant responses (7, 16, 17, 2123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the molecular basis of the substrate specificity of AtGH3.5, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of this protein with IAA and AMP bound (Fig 1B and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of AtGH3.5 with other GH3 protein structures using DALI reveals the highest similarity with VvGH3.1 (7) (PDB ID code 4B2G; Z = 59.8; 0.9 Å2 rmsd for 552 C atoms; 68% identity), AtGH3.12 (9, 14) (PDB: 4EG4; 1.8 Å rmsd for 545 C atoms; 50% identity), and AtGH3.11 (9) (PDB: 4EPL; 3.7 Å rmsd for 546 C atoms; 40% identity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GH3 protein structure, like that of other adenylating enzymes, is defined by a large (450 aa) N-terminal / fold domain that provides a platform for ligand binding and a smaller (160 aa) C-terminal domain that is conformationally flexible (9, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal domain centers on a four-stranded -sheet flanked by two pairs of -helices and can adopt two conformations that differ by a 180° rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rotation allows different sets of residues to interact with substrates during the adenylation and transferase half-reactions (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal domain of the AtGH3.5 structure in complex with AMP and IAA reported here adopts the closed active site conformation associated with the second half-reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AtGH35_Nucleotide_and_Acyl_Acid_Binding_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Clear electron density for AMP and IAA in the AtGH3.5 structure (Fig 2A) defines the location of the active site along the interface of the N- and C-terminal domains (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the active site, a canonical P-loop (residues 109119), the 8-turn-9 loop (residues 338342), and multiple residues that surround the adenine ring contribute to nucleotide binding (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The architecture of the AMP binding site is nearly identical to those described for previously reported GH3 protein structures (9, 13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence comparison of AtGH3.5 with the IAA-conjugating AtGH3.1, AtGH3.2, AtGH3.17, and VvGH3.1, the JA-Ile biosynthesis enzyme AtGH3.11, and the benzoate-conjugating AtGH3.12 emphasizes the similarity of this site across GH3 proteins that recognize diverse acyl acid substrates (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The position of IAA defines the acyl acid binding site of AtGH3.5 as a pocket formed by multiple residues from 5, 6, 8, and 9 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leu127, Arg130, Tyr134, and Leu137 from 5 form the back wall of the site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Val174, Leu175, and Tyr179 from 6, Met337 from 8, and Tyr344 from 9 sandwich the indole ring of IAA with Val231, Phe232, and Ile312 providing additional van der Waals contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carboxylate group of IAA is oriented toward 6 and away from the phosphate group of AMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This orientation would be a catalytically nonproductive binding orientation and likely results from charge repulsion between the negatively charged carboxylate of IAA and the phosphate of AMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peat et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13) reported the structure of VvGH3.1 in complex with an inhibitor (adenosine-5-[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]phosphate; AIEP) that mimics the IAA reaction intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An overlay of VvGH3.1 and AtGH3.5 highlights the similarity in IAA binding (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For clarity, the protein structure of VvGH3.1 is not shown, but, as discussed below, the acyl acid binding site of VvGH3.1 is nearly identical to that of AtGH3.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positions of AMP and the AMP-derived portion of AIEP in the two structures are nearly superimposable, but the indole ring of AIEP in VvGH3 binds deeper in the active site toward Met337 and Ala339 than in IAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The acyl acid binding sites of the IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins from Arabidopsis that have been biochemically characterized to date (i.e., AtGH3.5, AtGH3.1, AtGH3.2, and AtGH3.17) and VvGH3.1 are nearly invariant (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variations occur in residues along 5, with AtGH3.17 having the largest number of differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of AtGH3.5 with other GH3 proteins highlights multiple differences throughout the acyl acid binding site (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The varied acyl acid binding sites accommodate different substrates for a common chemical reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the AtGH3.5 acyl acid site (Fig S1A) is more constrained than the same region of AtGH3.11 (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence differences in AtGH3.11 deepen the active site to provide space for the oxylipin tail of JA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a physiological substrate for AtGH3.12 remains to be identified (9), binding of the inhibitor SA in the acyl acid site suggests that a larger, but as yet unidentified, molecule may be the substrate of this protein (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AtGH35_Amino_Acid_and_Acyl_Acid_Specificity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A spectrophotometric assay was used to quantify the substrate specificity of AtGH3.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AtGH3.5 displayed a clear preference for aspartate (211 ± 20 nmolmin1mg protein1) as the amino acid substrate but also had appreciable rates for cysteine (33 ± 4 nmolmin1mg protein1), glutamate (17 ± 1 nmolmin1mg protein1), methionine (34 ± 4 nmolmin1 mgprotein1), and tryptophan (31 ± 1 nmolmin1mg protein1) (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AtGH3.5 was active with a range of auxin and benzoate substrates (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the natural auxins IAA and PAA, AtGH3.5 had comparable catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthetic auxin naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) was a substrate but had a twofold lower catalytic efficiency than IAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, SA was a poor substrate with a 17-fold lower kcat/Km than IAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, conjugation of BA occurred with a catalytic efficiency 18-fold higher than that of SA but similar to that of IAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonphysiological substrate 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), previously used to monitor the activity of AtGH3.12 (9), showed a kcat/Km similar to that of NAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No activity was detected with JA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AtGH35__IAA_Versus_BA_Specificity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To probe IAA versus BA specificity, a series of point mutants (Y134W, V174L, L175F, V231L, F232W, M337L, A339V, and Y344W) were generated by PCR to introduce changes that reduced the size of the acyl acid binding site pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the mutants except L175F and F232W were expressed and purified as soluble monomeric proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetic parameters of the Y134W, V174L, V231L, M337L, A339V, and Y344W mutants were determined using IAA and BA as substrates (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the mutants displayed decreased catalytic efficiency with IAA compared with the wild-type enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Y134W, V174L, V213L, and Y344W substitutions also reduced kcat/Km with BA by 9- to 43-fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the M337L and A339V mutants were less efficient with IAA, both retained comparable kcat/Km using BA as a substrate versus wild-type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both mutants showed a three- to fourfold preference for BA over IAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the positions of Met337 and Ala339 in the acyl acid site (Fig 3B), the longer side chains of M337L and A339V likely sterically occlude the indole ring of IAA compared with the phenyl ring of BA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IAA_and_BA_Specificity_in_Other_Arabidopsis_GH3_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequence comparison of AtGH3.5 with other IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins (Fig 3C) suggests that the acyl acid binding site is highly conserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if the substrate profile of AtGH3.5 is similar to other IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins from Arabidopsis, AtGH3.1, AtGH3.2, and AtGH3.17 were expressed in Escherichia coli and were purified for kinetic analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AtGH3.6 and AtGH3.9 were also cloned but were not assayed because of protein stability issues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AtGH3.1, AtGH3.2, and AtGH3.17 favored IAA over BA as a substrate by 14-, 70-, and 50-fold, respectively (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three enzymes were not active with SA using the spectrophotometric assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each enzyme also conjugated PAA with varying efficiency (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the acyl acid sites of the IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins from Arabidopsis are highly conserved, there are distinct preferences for the acyl acid substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AtGH35__In_Planta_Conjugation_of_IAA__PAA__SA__and_BA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Earlier studies of AtGH3.5 in A. thaliana used an activation tagging line and focused on IAA homeostasis and pathogen-related responses (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the substrate preference of AtGH3.5 (Table S2), its in vivo function was reexamined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AtGH3.5 was expressed as an N-terminal FLAG-tagged protein under control of the 35S promoter in Arabidopsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent T2 lines (OE14) were used for analysis of free and conjugated IAA, PAA, SA, and BA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overexpression lines displayed the same severely dwarfed phenotype (Fig S3A) described for the activation-tagged wes1-D line (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblot analysis confirmed the expression of FLAG-tagged AtGH3.5 protein in each line (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mass spectrometry determined free and aspartyl-conjugated IAA, PAA, SA, and BA levels in leaves from A. thaliana AtGH3.5-overexpressing lines (Fig 4 and Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified AtGH3.5 was used to generate PAA-Asp, BA-Asp, and SA-Asp for quantification by mass spectrometry using multiple reaction monitoring; other metabolites were commercially available (Fig S4 and Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AtGH3.5 overexpression resulted in approximately twofold lower IAA and up to sixfold higher IAA-Asp than in wild type (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More striking results were observed with PAA and PAA-Asp (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreased levels of PAA (up to fivefold) and 15- to 70-fold higher accumulation of PAA-Asp than in wild-type plants were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro assays of AtGH3.5 indicate that the enzyme is also active on SA and BA but favors BA (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with IAA and PAA, overexpression of AtGH3.5 alters the levels of benzoates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SA levels varied in the overexpression lines but were generally lower than in wild-type plants (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes corresponded with varied levels of SA-Asp in the overexpressing lines (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One line (OE1) showed 30-fold elevation in SA-Asp, but the other lines displayed approximately threefold increases in the conjugate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of BA were moderately reduced (Fig 4G) but showed up to 60-fold higher BA-Asp (Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GH3 proteins catalyze the conjugation of amino acids with acyl acids to regulate levels of active and inactive forms of JA and IAA (2, 3, 7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigations of the biological action of GH3 proteins from a variety of plants have focused largely on JA and IAA; however, biochemical and structural studies suggest that the functional diversity of the GH3 protein family may be wider than previously understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 19 GH3 proteins in A. thaliana, one is required for JA-Ile biosynthesis, six are associated with conjugation and inactivation of IAA, and the rest either lack a physiological substrate or remain to be characterized (3, 7, 1520).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these proteins, AtGH3.5 was proposed to have a dual role in IAA and SA homeostasis (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses of AtGH3.5 support this hypothesis but also suggest an even broader role for this enzyme in the metabolism of auxins and benzoates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand better the molecular basis for the substrate preference of AtGH3.5, the X-ray crystal structure was determined for comparison with other structurally characterized GH3 acyl acid amido synthetases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of AtGH3.5 (Fig 1B) shares a common ANL superfamily scaffold and a nucleotide binding site nearly invariant with other GH3 proteins (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conservation of this site, which includes residues with catalytic roles in the adenylation and transferase reactions (9), indicates a common reaction mechanism for the GH3 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure of AtGH3.5 highlights the differences in the acyl acid binding site compared with other structurally resolved GH3 proteins (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early sequence comparisons led to the proposal that GH3 proteins form three subfamilies with substrate preferences for JA, IAA, and other (3, 7, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later, structural studies of AtGH3.11 and AtGH3.12 and comparison of residues forming the acyl acid binding site suggested up to eight distinct subfamilies, many of which include proteins that remain to be characterized (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are clear differences in the size and shape of the phytohormone binding sites in AtGH3.5 and VvGH3.1, both of which conjugate IAA, versus AtGH3.11 from JA-Ile biosynthesis and AtGH3.12, which is implicated in SA action through an unidentified substrate (Fig S1) (9, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies will elucidate the biochemical and physiological roles of other GH3 proteins with distinct acyl acid binding sites and determine whether they also exhibit broader specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein crystallography of AtGH3.5 and VvGH3.1 (13) revealed the structural conservation of the IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal domain in each structure adopts the closed active-site conformation that opens the amino acid binding site to allow the transferase step of the reaction sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of IAA in the AtGH3.5 structure differs slightly from the adenylated intermediate analog AIEP in the VvGH3.1 structure (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the reaction catalyzed by AtGH3.5, IAA likely binds deeper in the acyl site in a position analogous to the indole-ring of AIEP and with the carboxylate oriented toward the phosphates of ATP for the chemistry of the first half-reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Mg2+ ion, which is catalytically essential but crystallographically unresolved, in the active site would provide the counter ion for the adenylation reaction (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Within the AtGH3.5 active site, binding of AMP and IAA identifies residues forming the acyl acid binding site, which accepts a range of substrates (Table S2), including the natural auxins IAA and PAA, along with the synthetic auxin NAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SA is a substrate for AtGH3.5 (7) but is a poor one in comparison with the auxins and BA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutagenesis of residues in the AtGH3.5 acyl acid binding site and kinetic analysis (Table S3) suggest that the benzoate substrates are accommodated similar to the auxins, because most mutants altered kinetic parameters for both IAA and BA (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steady-state kinetic parameters of the mutants also suggests that the larger substrates fit into the pocket defined by Met337 and Ala339 (Fig 3C), because the M337L and A339V substitutions did not change the kinetics with BA significantly but altered IAA preference (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies provide a starting point for comparisons with other documented IAA-conjugated GH3 proteins and GH3 proteins that modify other phytohormones and will help resolve the mystery of IAA specificity versus the dual IAA/BA specificity exhibited by AtGH3.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The residues contacting either IAA in the AtGH3.5 structure or the indole moiety of AIEP in the VvGH3.1 structure are identical and also are nearly invariant in other IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins (Fig 3 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical comparison of AtGH3.5, AtGH3.1, AtGH3.2, and AtGH3.17 reveal commonalities, but also key differences, in substrate preferences (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all these enzymes prefer IAA, PAA is not as efficient a substrate with AtGH3.1 as the other enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only AtGH3.5 shows comparable kcat/Km values for both IAA and BA; the rest distinctly prefer IAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, AtGH3.5 was the only GH3 tested that was active with SA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the common acyl acid binding site, what accounts for substrate preferences of IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One possibility is that differences in residues of 5 alter the orientation of residues in the acyl acid binding site (Fig 3C); however, with the exception of AtGH3.17, changes in this motif are conservative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second option is that the ping-pong kinetic mechanism (12), which involves multiple steps in the reaction sequence, may account for variations in steady-state parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described for other adenylating enzymes (2628), the conformational transition between two distinct half-reactions provides a proofreading mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural change can lead to the release of noncognate adenylated intermediates into solution or their hydrolysis within the active site before the transferase step (2628).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in the kinetics of the reaction sequence, in particular movement of the C-terminal domain, of the IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins may affect substrate preference, even though these enzymes retain conserved acyl acid binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous work suggests that AtGH3.5, unlike other IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins in A. thaliana, works in both IAA and SA homeostasis (7, 16, 17, 2123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of the Arabidopsis gain-of-function mutants wes1-D and gh3.5-1D revealed dwarf phenotypes consistent with lower IAA levels and increased AtGH3.5 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar phenotype was observed in the 35S-driven overexpressing lines here (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wes1-D and gh3.5-1D plants displayed enhanced pathogen resistance, which was attributed to the SA-conjugating role of AtGH3.5 and the lower IAA levels that activate pathogen responses (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the biochemical analysis of AtGH3.5 (Table S2) and earlier in planta studies focused on IAA, IAA-amino acid conjugates, and SA levels (16, 17, 2123), we decided to examine the effect of AtGH3.5 overexpression on IAA, PAA, SA, and BA levels in Arabidopsis (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in vivo data indicate that AtGH3.5 modifies metabolites in auxin and SA-related pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As described for the AtGH3.5 gain-of-function mutants and overexpression of other IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins in Arabidopsis and rice (16, 17, 20, 2931), AtGH3.5 overexpression decreased IAA and increased IAA-Asp levels (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the AtGH3.5 substrate profile, overexpression altered PAA and PAA-Asp levels (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report describes the formation of PAA-Asp and PAA-Glu in plants overexpressing either AtGH3.6 or AtGH3.9 (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although IAA is considered the predominant auxin in plants, PAA functions as a growth-regulating molecule (1, 32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PAA is present at levels similar to that of IAA in plants, it functions through the same TIR1/AFB auxin receptor-mediated pathway as IAA, and it regulates the same auxin-responsive genes as IAA (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two auxins show distinct distribution patterns, and, unlike IAA, PAA is not actively transported to form polar gradients in plant cells (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that multiple IAA-conjugating GH3 proteins (7, 12, 32) as well as AtGH3.5 display significant activity with PAA, the physiological role of these enzymes as mediators of auxin responses likely extends to PAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accumulation of PAA-Asp versus IAA-Asp in the Arabidopsis AtGH3.5-overexpressing lines also suggests that the subsequent metabolism of these molecules may differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conjugation of IAA with acidic amino acids is believed to lead to the inactivation and degradation of IAA (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low levels of IAA-Asp in the AtGH3.5-overexpressing lines (Fig 4 A and B) are consistent with rapid turnover through the degradation pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, overexpression of AtGH3.5 results in a striking accumulation of PAA-Asp (Fig 4 C and D), suggesting either that degradation of this conjugate may not be as efficient as that of IAA-Asp or that the amino acid conjugate serves as a storage form for PAA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the results reported here and by others (32, 33) highlight the parallels and differences in IAA and PAA metabolism in plants, further investigation is required to understand the roles of PAA and its conjugates in plant growth and development; however, it is likely that AtGH3.5 plays a key role in IAA/PAA homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analysis of AtGH3.5 indicates, as described previously (7), that this protein can conjugate SA but is more efficient using BA as a substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In plants, SA is a major phytohormone that mediates plant disease resistance and abiotic stress responses (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overexpression of AtGH3.5 in Arabidopsis led to changes in SA levels in some overexpressing lines but not in others; however, SA-Asp increased in all lines (Fig 4 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the wes1-D and gh3.5-1D gain-of-function mutants indicated elevated SA content, although not to the levels as observed during pathogen infection (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SA-Asp levels were not analyzed in the gain-of-function mutants, although total SA conjugates, including glycosylated forms, increased (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AtGH3.5 may serve to attenuate SA activity by conjugation in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that other Arabidopsis GH3 proteins do not accept SA as a substrate, this SA conjugation appears to be a specialized role for AtGH3.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overexpression of AtGH3.5 resulted in even greater changes in BA and BA-Asp (Fig 4 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological role for altered BA content is unclear at this time, but it is possible that BA-Asp provides a precursor pool for SA during pathogen challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two routes have been proposed for SA synthesis, one through isochorismate and another through metabolism of benzoic acids (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plant benzoic acids can be modified and converted to other compounds, including SA (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolically, BA-2-hydroxylase, a soluble P450 monooxygenase, which has been partially purified and characterized, can convert BA to SA (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in tobacco suggest that BA conjugates, in particular BA-glucose, may contribute to SA synthesis in plant defense responses (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For BA-Asp to function as an SA precursor, a hydrolase would be needed to release the free acid from the conjugate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of BA-Asp accumulation in wild-type plants compared with the overexpressing lines suggests that hydrolysis of BA-Asp may occur slowly and that increased AtGH3.5 causes a bottleneck in this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extensive studies of the wes1-D and gh3.5-1D gain-of-function mutants in A. thaliana indicate that these plants have higher SA levels than wild-type plants during pathogen challenge (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the increased levels of SA are derived from BA-Asp, which may provide a precursor pool for SA synthesis, in addition to induction of the isochorismate route (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AtGH3.5 can inactivate SA by conjugation but does so less efficiently than with BA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased disease resistance in the wes1-D and gh3.5-1D gain-of-function mutants is linked to the lower IAA levels but also may be tied to reduced PAA levels and a pool of BA-Asp for mobilization to SA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies on benzoate metabolism and SA biosynthesis are required to untangle these hypotheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, structural and biochemical studies of the GH3 acyl acid amido synthetases help define their roles in plant hormone responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The coding region for AtGH3.5 was PCR-amplified from an ORF clone inserted in pENTR223 [The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) accession no G18499] and was ligated into pET-28a (Novagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The construct was transformed into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells and was grown in Terrific broth containing 50 g/mL kanamycin and 34 g/mL chloramphenicol to A600nm 0.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight at 18 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant protein was purified using Ni2+-affinity chromatography (9, 11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For protein crystallization, the His-tagged protein was incubated with thrombin in 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol overnight at 4 °C and then was passed over a mixed nickel/benzamidine Sepharose column to remove uncut protein and the protease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flow-through was purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-200 26/60 HiLoad FPLC column equilibrated with 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM MgCl2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay with BSA as the standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Point mutants of AtGH3.5 were generated using the QuikChange PCR method with proteins expressed and purified as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constructs for AtGH3.1 (TAIR accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AT2G14960), AtGH3.2 (TAIR accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AT4G37390), AtGH3.6 (TAIR accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AT5G54510), AtGH3.9 (TAIR accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AT2G47750), and AtGH3.17 (TAIR accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AT1G28130) were generated as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Crystallography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AtGH3.5 was crystallized using the hanging-drop, vapor-diffusion method at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 1:1 ratio of protein (6 mg/mL) and 20% (vol/vol) PEG-8000, 0.1 M 2-Cyclohexylaminoethanesulfonic acid (CHES) (pH 9.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), 5 mM IAA, and 5 mM AMP was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen with mother liquor supplemented with 25% (vol/vol) glycerol as a cryoprotectant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffraction data were collected at beamline ID23-2 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, indexed and integrated with XDS, and scaled with XSCALE (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular replacement was performed with PHASER (39) using a homology model of AtGH3.5 generated in SWISS-MODEL (40) with the AtGH3.12 structure (9) (PDB ID code 4EQL; 50% identity) as template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial structure was refined with BUSTER (41) and COOT (42) used for model building.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent refinement was performed in PHENIX (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallographic statistics are summarized in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Enzyme_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assays of GH3 protein activity used a coupled-enzyme assay with a standard reaction buffer of 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 1 mM MgCl2, as previously described (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the amino acid screen, IAA and ATP were held constant (1 mM) with each amino acid at 5 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetic analysis of acyl acid substrates used ATP (1 mM) and aspartate (5 mM) with varied concentrations of acyl acid (up to 10 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data then were fit to the MichaelisMenten equation using SigmaPlot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Arabidopsis_AtGH35-Overexpressing_Lines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A. thaliana ecotype Col-0 seeds were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Research Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Arabidopsis transformation, the coding region was PCR-amplified from pET28a-AtGH3.5 and cloned into the pENTR/d-TOPO vector (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coding region then was transferred into the pEARLY GATE-202 (35S promoter, N-terminal FLAG tag) vector (44) using a recombinase kit (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting vector was electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were transformed by floral dip and grown to maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After T1 seeds were selected and harvested, multiple herbicide-resistant lines were isolated for the generation of T2 seeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T2 seeds exhibiting a 3:1 segregation ratio on plates with glufosinate ammonium (50 mg/L) were used for isolation of independent homozygous lines whose identity was confirmed by immunoblot analysis for expression of FLAG-tagged AtGH3.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For protein analysis, seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein amount was quantified by Bradford assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) with immunoreactive bands visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mass_Spectrometry_of_Free_and_Conjugated_Acyl_Acids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For analysis of free and conjugated acyl acids, standard curves were generated for IAA, PAA, SA, and BA and their respective conjugates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the commercially available molecules, 1-mM solutions in 50 mM Tris (pH 8) were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enzymatic conversion of PAA, SA, and BA to PAA-Asp, SA-Asp, and BA-Asp, respectively, used purified AtGH3.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions contained 1 mM acyl acid, 1 mM ATP, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM aspartate, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) (15 min at 25 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis used a protocol similar to previous work on IAA conjugates (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metabolites were analyzed on a Shimadzu LC with an Applied Biosystems 4000 Q-TRAP mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source and with a C18 column (Onyx; 4.6 mm × 100 mm; Phenomenex) using a gradient of 40% solvent A (0.1% acetic acid) held for 2 min to 100% solvent B [90% (vol/vol) acetonitrile and 0.1% acetic acid] for 8 min at a rate of 1 mL/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acyl acid forms were used to select multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions and to optimize the compound-dependent parameters (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaction mixtures then were analyzed using the disappearance of the free acid to calculate conjugate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard curves were generated for each compound (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For analysis of free and conjugated acyl acids, leaf tissue was collected from 1-mo-old A. thaliana Col-0 and four independent AtGH3.5-overexpressing lines (OE14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each line, 50150 mg of plant tissue was collected in triplicate from four to six plants per line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground for 30 s with ice-cold methanol/acetonitrile (1:1; 900 L) added to each sample before the sample was homogenized again for 2 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were centrifuged (16,000 × g; 5 min; 4 °C), and the supernatant was collected and transferred to fresh tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellet was resuspended in methanol/acetonitrile (1:1; 500 L), homogenized for 2 min, and centrifuged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was combined with previous supernatant and then was dried.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were dissolved in 30% (vol/vol) methanol (200 L) and were analyzed by LC-MS/MS, as described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
