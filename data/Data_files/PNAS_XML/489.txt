Twisted light transmission over 143 km  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Light is the main carrier of information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its spatial mode allows the encoding of more than 1 bit per photon, and thus can increase the information capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For communication purposes, these modes need to be transmitted over large distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nowadays, fiber-based solutions are in their infancy, which renders free-space transmission the only possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present an experiment where we investigate the behavior of the spatial modes after a distance of 143 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the help of an artificial neural network, we distinguished different mode superpositions up to the third order with more than 80% accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that with state-of-the-art adaptive optics systems, both classical communication and entanglement transmission is feasible over distances of more than 100 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spatial modes of light can potentially carry a vast amount of information, making them promising candidates for both classical and quantum communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the distribution of such modes over large distances remains difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intermodal coupling complicates their use with common fibers, whereas free-space transmission is thought to be strongly influenced by atmospheric turbulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show the transmission of orbital angular momentum modes of light over a distance of 143 km between two Canary Islands, which is 50× greater than the maximum distance achieved previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a demonstration of the transmission quality, we use superpositions of these modes to encode a short message.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the receiver, an artificial neural network is used for distinguishing between the different twisted light superpositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The algorithm is able to identify different mode superpositions with an accuracy of more than 80% up to the third mode order and decode the transmitted message with an error rate of 8.33%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using our data, we estimate that the distribution of orbital angular momentum entanglement over more than 100 km of free space is feasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the quality of our free-space link can be further improved by the use of state-of-the-art adaptive optics systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

(A) Sketch of the experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sender is located on the roof of the Jacobus Kapteyn telescope on the island of La Palma and consists of a 60-mW laser with a wavelength of 532 nm modulated by an SLM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different phase holograms on the SLM encode different spatial modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modes are magnified with a sending telescope and sent over 143 km to the receiver at the island of Tenerife.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extra mirrors used in the actual sending setup are not shown for simplicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of received modes is observed on the wall of the Optical Ground Station telescope owned by the ESA and recorded with a camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Photo of the sender taken during extremely turbulent conditions on La Palma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Inset) Small vortices and eddies formed by the water vapor in the air are clearly visible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the sending lens an  = ±1 can be seen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modes sent under these conditions were not discernible at the receiver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Long-time exposure photo showing an OAM superposition of  = ±1 being transmitted over the Caldera de Taburiente (silhouetted in black) from La Palma to Tenerife.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Insets) Note that the double-lobed modal structure of the beam is clearly visible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A theoretical plot of the mode superposition cross-section is shown for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cross-talk matrix from Fig 3A for  = ±1 modes with different rotations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(AD) Examples of OAM mode superpositions received on the wall of the telescope Observatorio del Teide after propagating through 143 km of free space between the islands of La Palma and Tenerife.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diameter of the observatory is roughly 11 m. The lobed modal structure is clearly visible for mode superpositions with  = ±1, ±2, and ±3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images C and D show the rotation of an  = ±3 mode superposition by /3 when the relative phase  is changed by .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (EH) Examples of pure OAM (vortex) modes observed at the receiver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity null at the center of the modes is clearly visible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mode diameter gets larger as the OAM quantum number  is increased, and is seen to approach the size of the telescope wall for  = 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of the modes clearly increases for higher orders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that these images were taken at a time when atmospheric conditions were stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Details for measurements of cross-talk matrices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cross-talk matrices showing the success probability with which the transmitted OAM mode superpositions were correctly identified at the receiver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (AC) Results for superpositions of  = ±1, ±2, and ±3 modes with relative phases of =/4,/2,and, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different relative phases correspond to different rotations of the superposition structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The received modes were correctly identified by our detection algorithm with an average success probability of 82%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) During a turbulent night, eight modes consisting of superpositions of  = ±1 were identified with a success probability of only 22.7%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we restrict ourselves to a subset of these modes with =/2 or  (highlighted with red squares and reanalyzed by the neural network each time), the success probability increases significantly (E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to resolve all eight of these modes is required for device-independent quantum key distribution (violation of a Bell inequality), four modes are necessary for entanglement-based quantum key distribution (violation of an entanglement witness), and two modes can be used for classical communication with 1 bit per mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Encoding and decoding of a short message with twisted light superpositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The message Hello World!  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is sent letter by letter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every letter is encoded into three  = ±1 superpositions with four different relative phase settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the letter H is encoded as 0, 2, and 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, every mode corresponds to 2 bits of information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 143 km of transmission, the modes are recorded and characterized with an artificial neural network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same alphabet is used to decode the letter from the mode superpositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final recorded message is Hello WorldP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last letter is a P (which is encoded as 1,0,0) instead of an !  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (which is encoded as 0,0,0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This error is due to one incorrectly detected mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Calculation_of_the_Cross-Talk_Matrix  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We will explain the artificial neural network characterization based on the measurement results shown in Fig 3A (Table S1 for the full data, Table S2, column c for the measurement details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed explanation of the network itself is presented in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We accumulate 250 images of  = ±1 modes with 8 different relative phases, which correspond to 8 different spatial orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty of those images (five per orientation) are used for training of the neural network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The network consists of 40 neurons which self-organize to represent the features of the 40 training images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the training phase, 12 of the neurons do not represent any modes and are automatically removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the remaining 28 neurons corresponds to 1 of the 8 different mode orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After the training phase, the remaining 210 images are analyzed by the neural network, one after another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each image, one neuron will be activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As every neuron corresponds to a specific mode orientation, we can build a cross-talk matrix from the sent modes and the characterized mode orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From 210 images, 79.7% have been identified correctly by their intensity structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Further_Characterization_of_Mode_Quality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a set of recorded superposition structures with =/2 to estimate whether a future quantum experiment is limited by the turbulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the method described in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37, 40, 41), we evaluated the intensity distribution depending on the angular position from which we can estimate the achievable visibility of the two mutually unbiased superposition bases and thus if the state is separable or not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that even over a measurement time of around 2.5 s per mode an average visibility per basis would be around 60%, thus entanglement would be detectable (if the two-photon coherence is not destroyed in any other way).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
