Essential protective role of tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 in neurodegeneration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TNF is known to play an important role in various neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, anti-TNF therapeutics failed in clinical trials of neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This failure is most likely due to antithetic effects of the TNF receptors in the central nervous system, whereby TNFR1 promotes inflammatory degeneration and TNFR2 neuroprotection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that novel TNFR-selective therapeutics, i.e., a TNFR1 antagonist and a TNFR2 agonist, block neuroinflammation and promote neuronal survival in a mouse model of neurodegeneration related to Alzheimer disease as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most important, neuroprotection mediated by the TNFR1 antagonist is abrogated by simultaneous blockade of TNFR2 activation, revealing that neuroprotection requires TNFR2 signaling and uncover why anti-TNF drugs failed in treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the recognized role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in inflammation and neuronal degeneration, anti-TNF therapeutics failed to treat neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal disease models had revealed the antithetic effects of the two TNF receptors (TNFR) in the central nervous system, whereby TNFR1 has been associated with inflammatory degeneration and TNFR2 with neuroprotection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We here show the therapeutic potential of selective inhibition of TNFR1 and activation of TNFR2 by ATROSAB, a TNFR1-selective antagonistic antibody, and EHD2-scTNFR2, an agonistic TNFR2-selective TNF, respectively, in a mouse model of NMDA-induced acute neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coadministration of either ATROSAB or EHD2-scTNFR2 into the magnocellular nucleus basalis significantly protected cholinergic neurons and their cortical projections against cell death, and reverted the neurodegeneration-associated memory impairment in a passive avoidance paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneous blocking of TNFR1 and TNFR2 signaling, however, abrogated the therapeutic effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results uncover an essential role of TNFR2 in neuroprotection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the therapeutic activity of ATROSAB is mediated by shifting the balance of the antithetic activity of endogenous TNF toward TNFR2, which appears essential for neuroprotection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also explain earlier results showing that complete blocking of TNF activity by anti-TNF drugs was detrimental rather than protective and argue for the use of next-generation TNFR-selective TNF therapeutics as an effective approach in treating neurodegenerative diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Generation_and_Characterization_of_a_TNFR2_Selective_Agonist  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Efficient activation of TNFR2 requires receptor oligomerization by the membrane form of TNF (tmTNF) or oligomerized soluble forms of tmTNF mimicking receptor activation via tmTNF (11, 25) such as a TNFR2-selective TNF mutein, fused to the trimerization domain tenascin C (TNCscTNFR2) recently developed by the authors (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We here describe a TNFR2-selective TNF mutein, which consists of a covalently stabilized human TNFR2-selective (D143N/A145R) (25) single-chain TNF (scTNFR2) fused to the dimerization domain EHD2 derived from the heavy chain domain CH2 of IgE (26), constituting a disulfide bonded dimer that is, with respect to TNF domains, hexameric (EHD2scTNFR2; Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purity of the recombinant protein was confirmed by SDS/PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under reducing conditions, the TNF variant exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa, matching the calculated molecular mass of 68.35 kDa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under nonreducing conditions the expected dimer of 130 kDa was observed (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oligomerization state of EHD2scTNFR2 was further characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC; Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EHD2scTNFR2 eluted as a single major peak, indicating high purity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TNF receptor selectivity of EHD2scTNFR2 was analyzed by binding studies with immobilized huTNFR1Fc and huTNFR2Fc fusion proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas EHD2scTNFR2 did not interact with huTNFR1, the fusion protein efficiently bound to huTNFR2 (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, soluble human TNF (huTNF) efficiently bound to huTNFR1, whereas it just weakly interacted with huTNFR2 (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, EHD2scTNFR2 did not activate TNFR1-dependent cell death in L929 (Fig 1E), verifying that EHD2scTNFR2 had lost affinity for TNFR1 due to the mutations D143N/A145R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, EHD2-scTNFR2 efficiently induced cell death in Kym-1 cells, which endogenously express both TNF receptors and are highly sensitive to endogenous TNF-induced TNFR1 mediated cytotoxicity (27) (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, induction of cell death was not enhanced by addition of the cross-linking TNFR2-specific monoclonal antibody 80M2, which in concert with soluble TNF is able to mimic the action of tmTNF (11, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differently, the bioactivity of scTNFR2, a covalently stabilized huTNFR2-selective TNF trimer, was strongly enhanced in the presence of 80M2 (Fig 1G), indicating that dimerization of scTNFR2 via EHD2 is necessary and sufficient to fully activate huTNFR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ATROSAB_and_EHD2scTNFR2_Are_Neuroprotective_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess both EHD2scTNFR2 and ATROSAB in an in vivo model of neurodegeneration, hu/mTNFR-knock-in mice (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S4) were generated and used in the nucleus basalis lesion model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hu/mTNFR knock-in (k/i) mice express a chimeric TNFR, where the extracellular part of the human receptor is fused to the transmembrane- and intracellular region of the mouse TNFR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This chimeric hu/mTNFR was introduced into the germline of C57BL/6 mice by knock-in technology, replacing the endogenous mouse TNFR, thereby using the regulatory elements from the wild-type mouse TNFR; this should lead to an expression pattern of the hu/mTNFR comparable to the wild-type mouse TNFR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression and functionality of the chimeric hu/mTNFR in hu/mTNFR-k/i mice was investigated using primary cells isolated from different tissues and in vivo experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using primary immune cells, neurons, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we demonstrated that expression of chimeric hu/mTNFR1 and hu/mTNFR2 resemble the expression pattern of the wild-type TNFRs (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 and S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we demonstrated the functionality of the chimeric hu/mTNFRs both using in vitro experiments with primary MEFs and thymocytes as well as in vivo experiments showing TNF sensitivity of hu/mTNFR1-k/i mice (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By stereotactic NMDA injection, lesions in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) were generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lesioning of the NBM resulted in a decrease of body weight (Fig S8), reduction of cholinergic fibers of the parietal cortex (Fig 2 B and F), and macrophage/microglial activation within the NBM (Fig 2 D and H and Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These symptoms can be assessed to determine the lesion size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both EHD2scTNFR2 and ATROSAB show a strong protective effect in this in vivo model when simultaneously injected with NMDA into the NBM (Fig 2 B, D, F, and H and Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injection of a control IgG (anti-huEGFR), however, did not significantly alter NMDA-mediated neurodegeneration (Fig 2 F and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ATROSAB_and_EHD2scTNFR2_Improve_Memory_Performance_in_the_NBM_Lesion_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Memory was evaluated as parameter for the protective effects of EHD2scTNFR2 in the hu/mTNFR2-k/i mice and ATROSAB in the hu/mTNFR1-k/i mice against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity in the nucleus basalis and subsequent cholinergic fiber loss in parietal cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of memory tests performed in hu/mTNFR2-k/i and hu/mTNFR1-k/i mice are depicted in Fig 3A and in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10 and S11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NMDA-induced NBM lesion and the compounds tested had no significant effect on short-term memory performance in the spontaneous alternation task (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10B and S11B) or number of entries recorded (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10C and S11C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anxiety-like behavior assessed by the elevated plus maze showed no significant changes in the total number of entries (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10D and S11D), entries into the open arms (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10E and S11E), and time spent in the dark and light arms and center of the maze (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10F and S11F) in all of the mice tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from the passive avoidance paradigm showed that NMDA, EHD2scTNFR2, and ATROSAB did not result in differences of the preshock latency to enter the dark compartment in the hu/mTNFR2-k/i mice (Fig 3B) and hu/mTNFR1-k/i mice (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NBM injection of NMDA caused a significant impairment in the postshock latency in all of the mice tested (Fig 3 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both EHD2scTNFR2 and ATROSAB obliterated NMDA-mediated memory impairment (Fig 3 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EHD2scTNFR2 and ATROSAB when given without NMDA had no effect on postshock latency (Fig 3 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate the lack of neurotoxicity of EHD2scTNFR2 and ATROSAB and accentuate their protective effects against NMDA toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Emergence_of_Neuroprotective_TNFR2_Signaling_in_Vitro_and_in_Vivo_upon_ATROSAB-Mediated_Inhibition_of_TNFR1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously we have shown that the PI3KPKB/Akt pathway mediates TNFR2-promoted neuroprotection from excitotoxic cell death (10, 15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the molecular pathways underlying the neuroprotective effects of ATROSAB, we isolated primary neurons from hu/mTNFR1-k/i mice and investigated TNF-induced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt (Ser473).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, stimulation with a nonreceptor- selective wild-type mouse variant of EHD2scTNFR2, with tmTNF-mimetic activity (EHD2-scmTNF), induced phosphorylation of PKB/Akt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, phosphorylation was enhanced in the presence of the TNFR1 antagonist ATROSAB (Fig 4A), suggesting that PKB/Akt activation occurs via TNFR2, and concomitant TNFR1 signaling interferes with this pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, TNF was shown to protect primary neurons from glutamate-induced cell death in a TNFR2-dependent manner (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we could show that the mouse TNFR2-specific variant (D135N/A137R; 13) of the human TNFR2-selective EHD2scTNFR2 (EHD2-scmTNFR2) protects primary hu/mTNFR1-transgenic neurons from excitotoxic cell death (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with ATROSAB-mediated increase of PKB/Akt phosphorylation, ATROSAB enhanced the neuroprotective effect of EHD-scmTNF at lower concentrations (10 ng/mL; Fig 4B) in this in vitro cell model, too.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To prove the essential role of TNFR2 signaling in the in vivo NBM lesion model, we simultaneously injected NMDA, ATROSAB, and the mouse TNFR2-specific antagonist MAB426 (Fig 4 CF) into hu/mTNFR1-k/i mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the protective effect of ATROSAB on both cholinergic innervation and macrophage/microglial activation was completely reverted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TNF can exert opposite effects via its two receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dual role of TNF signaling becomes particularly obvious in the central nervous system (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the cuprizone-induced mouse model of demyelination, it was shown that TNFR2 is critical for oligodendrocyte regeneration, whereas TNF signaling via TNFR1 promoted nerve demyelination (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar, investigations in a mouse model of retinal ischemia revealed that TNFR1-deficient animals were protected from ischemic lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, TNFR2/ mice showed enhanced neuronal loss and a more severe pathology compared with wild-type animals, indicating an antagonistic function of the two TNFRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the retinal ischemia model, TNFR2s neuroprotective activity in vivo was associated with PI3K-PKB/Akt activation, which was counterbalanced by the neurodegenerative action of TNFR1 (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same principle applied to cortical neurons, where TNFR2 mediated in vitro protection from glutamate-induced cell death in a PI3K-PKB/Akt-dependent manner (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We here show in an in vivo model of NMDA-induced cellular degeneration and loss of neuronal functions that both a TNFR2 selective agonist (EHD2scTNFR2) and a TNFR1 antagonistic antibody (ATROSAB) protect from loss of cholinergic fibers and associated neurologic deficits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exacerbated activation of glutamate receptor-coupled calcium channels and subsequent increase in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i), followed by sustained disturbances in the [Ca2+]i homeostasis, are established hallmarks of neuronal cell death in acute and chronic neurological diseases (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, activation of potassium intermediate/small conductance calcium-activated channel KCa2 prevented [Ca2+]i deregulation and reduced neuronal death following glutamate toxicity and cerebral ischemia (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect of TNFR2 against a glutamate challenge was associated with an increased expression of KCa2.2 channels (16), outlining a potential molecular mechanism of TNFR2-mediated protection of neurons from death during exposure of a priori excitotoxic stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studies on lovastatin actions further support TNFR2 involvement in neuroprotection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lovastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug with reported neuroprotective properties that can reduce the incidence of stroke and progression of Alzheimer's disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lovastatin increased the expression of TNFR2 in cortical neurons in vitro (32) and was neuroprotective in TNFR1/neurons, whereas lovastatins protection was lost in neurons from TNFR2/ mice (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, lovastatin-mediated neuroprotection led to an increase in PI3K-dependent PKB/Akt phosphorylation, whereas inhibition of PKB/Akt activation entirely abolished lovastatin-induced neuroprotection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is in line with previous findings that TNFR2-mediated neuroprotection is dependent on the PI3K-PKB/Akt pathway (15), and suggests that lovastatin-induced neuroprotection is dependent on TNFR2 signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration of lovastatin protected cholinergic neurons and their cortical projections against NMDA-induced excitotoxic damage in vivo (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block activation of PKB/Akt resulted in a strong reduction of lovastatin-mediated neuroprotection (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present report, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the TNFR2 agonist EHD2scTNFR2 and the TNFR1 antagonistic antibody ATROSAB in this mouse model of NMDA-induced neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to lovastatin, both EHD2scTNFR2 and ATROSAB reduced the extent of areas of macrophage/microglia activation at the site of the lesion and protected cholinergic neurons and the neocortical innervations against NMDA-induced excitotoxic damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional consequences of NMDA-induced lesions and the therapeutic activity of TNFR targeting reagents became phenotypically apparent in behavioral performance studies: damage to the NBM selectively affected neocortical cholinergic denervation and its memory functions, while leaving particular hippocampal innervation and functions unaffected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of such animals with either EHD2scTNFR2 or ATROSAB fully restored the affected cholinergic memory function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ATROSAB-induced protection from excitotoxicity induced neurodegeneration was found to be linked to an enhancement of TNFR2 signaling leading to PKB/Akt activation; this is evident from abrogation of neuroprotection in vivo upon cotreatment with TNFR2 blockers and from in vitro studies showing increased phosphorylation of PKB/Akt as well as enhanced resistance of primary cortical neurons toward excitotoxic insult by a tmTNF mimetic TNF in the presence of a TNFR1 blockade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the neuroprotective activity of ATROSAB is accomplished by simultaneous action on two different cellular targets: (i) as a consequence of the excitotoxic insult, activated macrophage/microglia promote, via soluble TNF production, the expansion of the degenerative tissue response in an autocrine TNFR1-dependent way; and (ii) inhibition of TNFR1 limits this process both at the level of microglia/macrophage activation and at the level of neurons of TNFR1-mediated degenerative signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, for neuronal cells, it was shown previously that proper TNFR2 activation induces protection from excitotoxicity in vitro (15, 16); in the in vivo model analyzed here, in neurons in the vicinity of the acute insult and not immediately succumbing to excitotoxic death, competition of TNFRs for limiting amounts of endogenously produced membrane form of TNF exists, which results in suboptimal activation of TNFR2 of this cell population under a nontreatment condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, at the level of intracellular signaling, it is known that signal cross-talk between TNFR1 and 2 exists in terms of competition for common signal transducers such as TRAF2 (3335), with TNFR1 outperforming TNFR2 pathways in the case of abundance of soluble TNF, which triggers exclusively TNFR1 (3, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of ATROSAB, neuronal response is shifted toward neuroprotective TNFR2 signaling because of blocked neuronal TNFR1, allowing the induction of a resistant state by endogenous tmTNF (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The therapeutic activity of TNFR2 activation by treatment with EHD2scTNFR2 without interfering with TNFR1 signaling supports the view of limited TNFR2 activation by endogenous TNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, TNFR2s role as an important neuroprotective pathway emerges when TNFR1 ligand binding is stalled and/or when TNFR2 activation is optimized by application of exogenous TNFR2-selective ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, initial studies with anti-TNF therapeutics showed that TNF blocking drugs cannot be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this finding, we here provide compelling evidence in an in vivo model of NMDA-induced acute neuronal lesions that abrogation of complete TNF signaling by blocking both TNFRs is not protective, because mounting of a neuroprotective TNFR2-dependent response is prevented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, preclinical studies in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model (3638) or a mouse model of spinal cord injury (39) revealed that selective neutralization of sTNF/TNFR1 signaling is neuroprotective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in the EAE model, systemic application of TNFR1-blocking antibodies proved to be therapeutically effective (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, TNFR1 antagonists such as ATROSAB should be superior to conventional anti-TNF drugs in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, as they spare TNFR2 and even enhance TNFR2 signaling but still block detrimental signals transmitted via TNFR1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the potential therapeutic use of TNFR1-specific antagonistic antibodies, TNFR2-selective agonists seem to be particularly suitable to treat inflammatory, demyelinating diseases, because next to the direct neuroprotective effects shown in this report, data from different laboratories outline that TNFR2 is also involved in immune suppression via expansion and stabilization of regulatory T cells (4147), and induces remyelination (9, 13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, like TNFR1 antagonists, TNFR2 agonists might promote therapeutic effects via multiple cellular targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limiting for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is the bloodbrainbarrier (BBB), which restricts the transport of therapeutics into the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under physiologic conditions, antibodies, e.g., ATROSAB, do not cross the BBB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, of relevance, the BBB undergoes rapid changes in permeability in response to CNS insults, e.g., after spinal cord injury or during MS, potentially enabling therapeutics to reach the CNS parenchyma without specific transport mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the reported therapeutic activity of ATROSAB in EAE models (40) supports this reasoning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether alterations of the BBB permeability in different neurodegenerative diseases are sufficient to reach therapeutic effective concentrations in the CNS is presently unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, strategies are now available to overcome limits of BBB passage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, antibodies engineered to be actively transported via BBB have been developed that were shown to be beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimers disease (48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytokines including TNF can cross the BBB (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analogy, we assume that the engineered TNF mutein EHD2scTNFR2 could be able to penetrate the BBB, too.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, in an acute neurodegenerative disease model, we provide proof of concept that both the TNFR2-selective TNF variant EHD2scTNFR2 and the antagonistic TNFR1-selective antibody ATROSAB protect from neurological deficits due to excitotoxic cell death induced by excessive glutamate exposure in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data provide a rational base for previous failure of clinical studies with anti-TNF drugs in neurodegenerative diseases and highlight the essential protective role of TNFR2 in the central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigations in additional neurodegenerative diseases models on the therapeutic potential of the TNFR2 agonist EHD2scTNFR2 and the TNFR1 antagonist ATROSAB are warranted and will reveal whether and for which indications these or functionally similar proteins can be successfully applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

TNF muteins were diluted in 2% (mass/mass) skim milk powder in PBS and incubated for 1 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bound proteins were detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies to TNF (clone F6C5; 1 µg/mL; incubation for 1 h at RT) and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies (diluted 1:10,000; incubation for 1 h at RT), followed by incubation with 3,3,5,5-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaction was stopped by addition of 1 M H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450 nm was determined with an absorbance reader (Multiskan FC; Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed using the software Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between each step, nonbound proteins were removed by washing four times with 0.005% Tween-20 in PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crystal_Violet_Staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
L929 or Kym-1 cells (1.5 × 104 cells/well) were grown in 96-well flat-bottom cell culture plates overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L929 cells were treated with actinomycin D (1 µg/mL) for 30 min and Kym-1 cells with or without 80M2 (1 g/mL) for 30 min before addition of TNF variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then cells were incubated with different concentrations of TNF muteins for 24 h at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with crystal violet [20% (vol/vol) methanol; 0.5% crystal violet] for 20 min to stain viable cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dye was washed away under rinsing water and cells were air-dried.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal violet was resolved with methanol and the optical density at 550 nm was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was analyzed in triplicates and data were analyzed using the software Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 4 (GraphPad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MTT_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were incubated with MTT (0.5 mg/mL) for 2 h at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then lysis buffer [10% (mass/mass) SDS, 20 nM HCl] was added, cells were lyzed overnight, and optical density at 550 nm was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was analyzed in triplicates, and data were analyzed using the software Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunofluorescence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary fibroblasts from human/mouse tumor necrosis factor receptor one knock in (hu/mTNFR1-k/i) mice were cultivated on poly-d-lysine (10 µg/mL)-coated coverslips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation with TNF derivatives, the cells were fixed with PBS/4% (mass/mass) paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min on ice at point in time 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then cells were permeabilized with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS/4% (mass/mass) BSA for 30 min and cells were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies against NF-B p65 for 60 min followed by the incubation with appropriate fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies for 45 min in PBS/2% (mass/mass) BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After staining the nuclei with DAPI, the cells were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The labeled cells were analyzed by wide-field fluorescence microscopy (CellObserver with Colibri LED modules; Carl Zeiss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotype or secondary antibody control stainings were used to determine background fluorescence and to adjust the intensity of specific stainings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the nuclear translocation of NF-B p65, mean fluorescence intensities of nuclei and cytoplasm within a cell were determined automatically using Cell Profiler (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ratios of nuclear to cytoplasmic fluorescence were calculated from at least 500 cells for every condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ELISA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary embryonic fibroblasts were stimulated as indicated, and supernatants were collected at the indicated time intervals and analyzed by an ELISA specific for IL-6 according to the instructions of the manufacturer (BioLegend).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorbance at 450 nm was determined, and the amount of released IL-6 was determined with the provided standard and calculated using the software GraphPad Prism 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Isolation__cDNA_Synthesis__and_Quantitative_Real-Time_PCR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted using the peqGOLD Total RNA Kit (Peqlab) and then transcribed into cDNA with the Affinity Script Multiple Temperature cDNA Synthesis Kit and oligo(dT) primers (Agilent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained cDNA was used to determine the gene expression by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR; CFX96; BioRad) using specific primers for CXCL2, IL-6, and GAPDH (Table S1) and the KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Mastermix (Peqlab).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the expression of distinct genes, Ct values were determined by correlating the obtained values to the housekeeping gene GAPDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are presented relative to the unstimulated controls as normalized fold expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Humanized_TNFR_Knock-In_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The humanized Tnfrsf1a and Tnfrsf1b knock-in mouse lines (hu/mTNFR1-k/i and hu/mTNFR2-k/i) were generated as contracted by Ozgene Pty Ltd. For targeting TNFR1, the human sequence from chromosome 12 position 63307636332522 was inserted in place of mouse chromosome 6 positions 125306866125310626.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For TNFR2, the human sequence from chromosome 1 position 1218861012193082 was inserted in place of mouse chromosome 4 positions 144814170144819194.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The targeting constructs were electroporated into C57BL/6 ES cell line, Bruce4 (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homologous recombinant ES cell clones were identified by Southern hybridization and injected into BALB/c-albino C57BL/6 blastocysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male chimeric mice were obtained and crossed to albino C57BL/6 females to establish heterozygous germline offspring on C57BL/6 background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The germline mice were crossed to a ubiquitous Cre mouse line to remove the loxP-flanked selectable marker cassette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To initially distinguish between hetero- and homozygous mice, the genotype of hu/mTNFR transgenic mice was tested by using mouse TNFR-specific forward primers (mTNFR1 OZ fwd and mTNFR2 OZ fwd; Table S2) in combination with mouse- or human-specific reverse primers (mTNFR1 OZ rev, huTNFR1 OZ rev, mTNFR2 OZ rev, and huTNFR2 OZ rev; Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mouse/mouse TNFR1-specific primers for wild-type TNFR1 lead to a product of 1,217 bp, whereas the mouse/human TNFR1-specific primers for the chimeric TNFR1 lead to a product of 702 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the mouse/mouse TNFR2-specific primers for wild-type TNFR2 lead to a product of 1,169 bp, whereas the mouse/human TNFR2-specific primers for the chimeric TNFR2 lead to a product of 771 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After homozygous chimeric mice were bred for more than three generations, genotyping was carried out by PCR with primers specific for huTNFR1 (Table S1), leading to a 313bp product for the human TNFR1 allele, and mTNFR1 (Table S1), inducing a 270-bp fragment for the wild-type allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homozygous hu/mTNFR2-k/i animals were genotyped by PCR, using primers specific for huTNFR2 (Table S1) to produce a 300-bp fragment for human TNFR2 allele and using primers for mTNFR2 (Table S1), which results in 380-bp fragments for the wild-type allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Male homozygous hu/mTNFR-k/i C57BL/6J mice (12 wk, 2430 g) were used for experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animals were individually housed with a free access to food and tap water and kept in an air-conditioned room (21 ± 2 °C) with a 12/12 h light/dark circle (lights on 7:00 AM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Southern_Blot_Analysis_ES_Cell_DNA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ES cell DNA was isolated, digested with restriction enzymes, and analyzed on agarose gels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specificity of digestion products was tested by Southern blotting: DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with the 5 or 3 external probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were washed and the pattern of hybridization was visualized on a X-ray film by autoradiography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Southern_Blot_Analysis_Mouse_Tissue  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genomic DNA from lung, heart, liver, brain, thymus, kidney, and skin tissue of both homozygous hu/mTNFR1-k/i and hu/mTNFR2-k/i mice, respectively, was isolated, digested with BamHI, and blotted on nylon membrane and probed with the endogenous probes (enP) for TNFR1:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
and for TNFR2:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA from tail biopsies of C57BL/6 wild-type mice was used as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Primary_Mouse_Embryonic_Fibroblasts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brain and dark red organs were removed from embryonic (E1416) hu/mTNFR1-k/i or hu/mTNFR2-k/i mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remaining tissue was minced and digested using trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) and 1% DNase I (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Digestion was stopped by addition of FCS, and homogenates were centrifuged (5 min, 200 × g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Digested tissue was triturated in culture medium [DMEM, 10% (vol/vol) FCS, l-glutamine, 1% (vol/vol) penicillin/streptomycin (P/S)] and plated in cell culture dishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 12 d, cells were frozen or used for experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isolation_of_Primary_Thymocytes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thymus of hu/mTNFR2-k/i mice was isolated and mashed through a 40-µm cell strainer (Flacon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were centrifuged (300 × g, 5 min) and washed once with culture medium [RPMI 1640, 10% (vol/vol) FCS, 50 µM -mercaptoethanol, P/S].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, 1.5 × 105 cells were plated into anti-CD3 (clone 17A2; BioLegend)-coated (6 h at 4 °C, 1 µg/mL) 96-well (U) plates and cultivated for 4 d in the presence of EHD2scTNFR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amount of cells was then determined by MTT assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isolation_of_Thymocytes_and_Splenocytes_for_Flow_Cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thymus and spleen of hu/mTNFR1-k/i or hu/mTNFR2-k/i mice were isolated and mashed through a 40-µm cell strainer (Flacon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were centrifuged (300 × g, 5 min) and washed once with PBA (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.02% NaN3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, 0.5 × 106 cells were incubated with antibodies against mouse TNFR1 (HP8002; Hycult Biotec), human TNFR1 (HP9002; Hycult Biotec), mouse TNFR2 (HP8003; Hycult Biotec), and human TNFR2 (HP9003; Hycult Biotec) for 45 min on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed twice with PBA and incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies for 30 min on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then cells were washed again twice with PBA, and fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry (MACSQuant Analyzer 10; Miltenyi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized data are presented as unit area vs. fluorescence intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Primary_Cortical_Neuron_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic brains (E1416) of hu/mTNFR1-k/i mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The meninges were removed and the cortical neurons were separated by mechanical dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were plated in a density of 12 × 104 cells/well (96-well plates) and 2 × 106 cells/well (six-well plates) on poly-d-lysine precoated plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurobasal medium (Gibco) with 2% (vol/vol) B27-supplement, 0.5 mM glutamine, P/S was used as culture medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h, neurons were treated with 10 µM cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) for another 66 h to inhibit nonneuronal cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the medium was completely exchanged and after 7 d of in vitro culture, the neuronal cell cultures (less_than1% contaminating glial cells) were used for experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TNF_Tolerance_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transgenic hu/mTNFR1-k/i mice were injected (i.v.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with recombinant mouse TNF (30 µg) or saline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Body weight and temperature were controlled regularly as indicator for TNF-induced toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nucleus_Basalis_Magnocellularis_Lesion_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Injection into the NBM was performed as previously described by Luiten et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, after anesthesia with isoflurane, mouse heads were fixated in a Kopf stereotactic frame (Kopf Instruments model 900).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A volume of 0.6 µL solution was slowly infused in two steps of 0.3 µL into the NBM of the right hemisphere (coordinates: 0.6 mm posterior to bregma; 2.1 mm lateral to the sagittal suture; 4.6/4.4 mm ventral to the dura) (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the injection (0.1 L/min), the needle of a 1-L Hamilton syringe was left in place for 2 min to allow for an effective drug diffusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The right side of the NBM and the contralateral intact hemisphere served as internal control without interference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were killed for analysis 8 d after the NBM injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hu/mTNFR2-k/i mice were divided into four groups: (i) PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.40); (ii) PBS with 580 ng EHD2scTNFR2; (iii) 55 nmol NMDA (Sigma); and (iv) 55 nmol NMDA with 580 ng EHD2scTNFR2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hu/mTNFR1-k/i mice were divided into seven groups: (i) PBS; (ii) PBS with 3 µg ATROSAB; (iii) 55 nmol NMDA; (iv) 55 nmol NMDA together with 3 g ATROSAB; (v) 55 nmol NMDA, 3µg ATROSAB, and 150 ng mouse TNFR2 antagonist (MAB426); (vi) 55 nmol NMDA together with 150 ng MAB426 only; and (vii) 55 nmol NMDA and 2 µg anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor (huEGFR) IgG as an unspecific control antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue_Processing_and_Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under a deep anesthesia via an i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of pentobarbital sodium, mice were transcardially perfused by a short prerinse with 0.5% heparin physiological saline and subsequently perfused and fixated with 4% (mass/mass) PFA in phosphate buffer (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain tissues were removed, postfixed 48 h with 4% (mass/mass) PFA in PBS, subsequently stored in PBS at 4 °C for 24 h, and cryoprotected by immersion in 30% (mass/mass) sucrose at room temperature for 24 h. Afterward, frozen coronal sections (20-µm thickness) were cut using a Leica cryostat microtome and collected in PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.40) containing 0.1% sodium azide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cholinergic_Fiber_Stainings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After rinsing several times in PBS, free-floating tissue sections were processed for ChAT immunohistochemistry by incubation in PBS with 0.3% H2O2 for 45 min, rinsed several times again, and preincubated in PBS containing 5% (vol/vol) normal rabbit serum (NRS; Zymed) and 0.4% Triton X-100 at RT for 1 h. Subsequently, sections were incubated with goat anti-ChAT IgG (diluted 1:333; Millipore) in PBS containing 1% NRS, 0.5% BSA, and 0.4% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 3 d. After incubation with the primary antibody, sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated with rabbit anti-goat IgG (diluted 1:500; Sigma) in PBS containing 1% NRS, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.5% BSA at RT for 4 h and at 4 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated in PBS with Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (A and B solution were both diluted to 1:500) at RT for 2 h. Finally, DAB (Sigma) reaction to peroxidase as chromogen was visualized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visualization of DAB reaction was enhanced by ammonium nickel sulfate (BDH Chemicals Ltd.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Macrophage_Microglial_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tissue sections were incubated in 0.3% H2O2 in PBS for 45 min, rinsed in PBS several times, preincubated in 5% (vol/vol) normal horse serum (NHS) and 0.4% Triton X-100 PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, sections were incubated with rat anti-mouse integrin M monoclonal antibody (CD11b, diluted 1:1,000, Chemicon International) or anti-mouse IBA-1 (WAKO Chemicals, Neuss, Germany) in PBS containing 1% NHS and 0.4% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 3 d. Thereafter, sections were incubated in biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector; Brunschwig Chemie) diluted 1:500 at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation of Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (diluted to 1:500) at RT for 2 h. Finally, peroxidase was visualized by DAB as chromogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visualization of the DAB reaction was enhanced by ammonium nickel sulfate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantitative_Analysis_of_Cholinergic_Fibers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ChAT-positive innervation density was measured in layer V of the somatosensory cortex by using a program of the LAS Image Analysis Software (Leica Quantimet).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface area density of cortical ChAT-positive fibers was measured in eight coronal sections (coordinates: 0.6 mm posterior to bregma), which represent a strong reaction of cholinergic innervations from the lesioned NBM subdivision (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After ground subtraction and gray-scale threshold determination, the surface area of ChAT-positive fibers was calculated as a percentage by (the area coverage of ChAT-active cholinergic fibers)/(the total sampling area) × 100 in each coronal section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlated value of fiber reduction caused by the unilateral NBM lesion was calculated as the percentage difference between the surface area density of cortical fibers in the damaged side and that in the contralateral side (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_Macrophage_Microglial_Activation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantification of the reactive volume of macrophage/microglial activation has been previously described (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the size of the reactive region of CD11b-positive macrophage/microglial activation was measured on the surface area of the lesion site by using a program of the Quantimet 600 system (Leica).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reactive surface area of microglial activation was quantified in a series of CD11b-positive sections of each mouse brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total reactive volume of microglial activation in a brain was calculated as (x1+ x2 +  xn) × 100 m3, where xn is the reactive surface area of each section (µm2) and 100 m was the distance between two consecutive sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
