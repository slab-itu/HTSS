The LeuT-fold neurotransmitter:sodium symporter MhsT has two substrate sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The crystal structure of the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) features a drug bound not only in the primary site, but also simultaneously in a second site, thereby supporting the existence of two binding sites in neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs) as we demonstrated previously for the bacterial NSS homolog LeuT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we provide evidence that MhsT, another NSS homolog, can simultaneously bind substrate molecules both in its primary substrate (S1) site and in its secondary substrate (S2) site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in LeuT, substrate binding to both the S1 and S2 sites of MhsT is critical for transport, providing further support for a mechanistic model in which the allosteric interaction between the two substrate sites is a key element of Na+-coupled symport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crystal structures of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter MhsT revealed occluded inward-facing states with one substrate (Trp) bound in the primary substrate (S1) site and a collapsed extracellular vestibule, which in LeuT contains the second substrate (S2) site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In n-dodecyl--d-maltoside, the detergent used to prepare MhsT for crystallization, the substrate-to-protein binding stoichiometry was determined by using scintillation proximity to be 1 Trp:MhsT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using the same experimental approach, as well as equilibrium dialysis, we report that in n-decyl--d-maltoside, or after reconstitution in lipid, MhsT, like LeuT, can simultaneously bind two Trp substrate molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trp binding to the S2 site sterically blocks access to a substituted Cys at position 33 in the S2 site, as well as access to the deeper S1 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of either the S1 or S2 site disrupts transport, consistent with previous studies in LeuT showing that substrate binding to the S2 site is an essential component of the transport mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dynamics of Trp33 in the extracellular vestibule of MhsT may allow Trp binding in the S2 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Overall scheme of the S1 and S2 sites in MhsT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) The extracellular vestibules in the crystal structures of LeuT (PDB ID code 2Q6H), MhsT (PDB ID code 4US4), dDAT (PDB ID code 4XP4), and hSERT (PDB ID code 5I6X), showing the variable positioning of the residues aligned to Trp33 of MhsT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Trp33 is located at the interface of TM1, TM3, TM10, and EL4, among residues aligned with those that contribute to the previously identified S2 site of LeuT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) The docking of a Trp molecule in the S2 site, using the induced-fit docking protocol (58) implemented in Schrodinger suites (2014-4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotation of the Trp33 side chain in the occluded extracellular vestibule allows the S2 site to accommodate a Trp molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effect_of_the_Detergent_on_Substrate_Binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given our previous findings that substrate binding to the S2 site in LeuT is sensitive to both detergent choice and concentration (28, 29), we compared binding to MhsT after solubilization in DDM versus n-decyl--d-maltopyranoside (DM), a detergent with the same headgroup but a shorter alkyl chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presteady-state time points showed that binding of 0.5 M 3H-Trp, the substrate bound in the MhsT crystal structure (13), to MhsT prepared and assayed in 0.1 (wt/vol)% DDM (MhsTDDM) approaches about 50% of that observed for MhsT prepared and assayed in 0.1 (wt/vol)% DM (MhsTDM) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, in contrast to LeuT where substrate binding to the S2 site was sensitive to increasing DDM concentration (29), lowering the DDM concentration during the purification and elution of MhsT to 0.02% [about 2-fold its critical micellar concentration (CMC)] (31) led to binding levels comparable to those observed in 0.1% DDM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, raising the DM concentration from 0.1% (slightly above its CMC) (32) to 1.0% (about 10-fold its CMC) did not inhibit binding, as expected if higher concentrations of detergent penetrate the S2 site (SI Appendix, Fig S2) as shown for LeuT (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3H-Trp saturation binding experiments using equilibrium dialysis (Fig 2B) or SPA-based binding studies (Fig 2C) showed that MhsTDDM exhibits a molar binding stoichiometry of 1 (SI Appendix, Table S1), consistent with our previous measurements (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, however, MhsTDM binds approximately two molecules of Trp under saturating substrate conditions (Fig 2 B and C and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissociation constant (Kd) for Trp binding is not substantially affected by the detergent (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate altogether the effect of detergent on the interaction of MhsT with its substrate, MhsTDDM and MhsTDM were incorporated into nanodiscs (MhsTND; SI Appendix, Fig S3), artificial 10 nm-sized phospholipid bilayers encircled by two -helical membrane scaffold proteins, which have been successfully used as a more native lipid environment for the functional analysis of membrane proteins (22, 3335).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saturation binding of MhsTND yielded a Bmax of 2 Trp/MhsT, regardless of whether MhsTDDM or MhsTDM was used for the reconstitution (Fig 2D and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Role_of_S2-Site_Residues_in_Substrate_Binding_and_Transport  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As discussed above, docking studies indicate that a Trp substrate molecule can be accommodated in the extracellular vestibule of the MhsT crystal structure in the space freed by rotating the side chain of Trp33 (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting pose places the tryptophan in a potential S2 site with substantial similarity to that in LeuT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the S2 site and characterize its functional importance, we investigated the effects of mutating putative S2 site residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected residues Ile111 and Phe381 in MhsT that align, respectively, with LeuT residues Ile111 and Leu400, both of which are crucial for substrate binding in the S2 site and for substrate transport by LeuT (20, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also selected residues from the S1 siteIle104 and Phe230 in MhsT that align with Val104 and Phe253 in LeuTwhich we have shown to be essential for substrate binding and transport in LeuT (20, 29) and which were seen to interact with the S1 Trp substrate in the MhsT crystal structures (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Saturation binding studies were carried out with MhsT variants in which Ile104, Phe230, Ile111, or Phe381 was replaced with Cys and protein purified and assayed in DM or DDM, as well as with these MhsT variants reconstituted into nanodiscs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In DM, all these mutants bind one molecule of Trp with affinities that are similar to that measured for MhsT-WTDM (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that each mutation by itself, in either the S1 or S2 site, reduces the molar binding stoichiometry from 2 observed for MhsT-WTDM to 1, consistent with disruption of either the S1 or S2 site, and highlights that under equilibrium conditions substrate can bind independently to either site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In DDM, the S2-site mutants (MhsT-I111C or -F381C) also exhibit a stoichiometry of 1 (Fig 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Table S1), which is expected if DDMs role in reducing the WT stoichiometry to 1 is due to its disrupting the S2 site, since in these constructs this site is already disrupted by the mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this hypothesis, and in contrast to findings in DM, the S1-site mutants (MhsT-I104C or -F230C) show virtually no binding activity in DDM at the Trp concentrations tested (Fig 3 C and D and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with loss of binding to the S1 site through mutation, compounded by loss of binding to the S2 site due to DDM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reconstitution of the S1- and S2-site MhsT variants into nanodiscs followed by saturation binding measurements mimics the behavior observed for protein prepared and assayed in DM (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the S2 site being intact in both DM and lipid, but impaired in DDM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the effect of the S1- or S2-site mutations on active transport of Trp, we measured 3H-Trp uptake in intact Escherichia coli cells expressing the individual MhsT variants (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of key positions in either the S1 or S2 sites of MhsT resulted in an activity pattern for MhsT-I104C, -I111C, -F230C, or -F381C that is virtually indistinguishable from that observed for control cells lacking MhsT, highlighting the importance of the integrity of both the S1 and S2 substrate sites for substrate transport in MhsT, just as in LeuT (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Conserved_Trp33_Is_Not_Essential_for_MhsT_Function  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given our findings that a second Trp can bind in the S2 site, we sought to better understand the role of the highly conserved Trp33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we have recently shown in MhsT that the packing of Trp33 and its nearby residues in the extracellular vestibule is affected by the binding and dissociation of Na2, and this effect is propagated through reconfiguration of an aromatic cluster in TM3 and TM6, in a manner that allosterically couples this region to conformational changes on the intracellular side of the transporter (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the functional importance of Trp33 in MhsT, we introduced Cys, Ala, or Leu at this position and tested the effect of the mutations on binding and transport activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4A shows saturation binding of 3H-Trp by MhsT-W33A, -W33C, and -W33L in the presence of DM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to MhsT-WT, where the binding isotherm fits a single-site binding model (Fig 2C), the saturation binding data of the three Trp33 mutants did not fit well to a single-site model but instead to a single-site model with variable Hill slope (F test, P less_than 0.001 for all three mutants), which yielded molar binding ratios of 2, Kds of 7 M, and Hill coefficients between 1.7 and 2.0 (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consistent with only small changes in substrate binding to the S1 and S2 sites, all three mutants showed substantial transport activity (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the uptake kinetics (SI Appendix, Fig S5A and Table S1) showed that the maximal velocity of transport (Vmax) of the mutants relative to MhsT-WT is between 30% (MhsT-W33A or -W33L) and 40% (MhsT-W33C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of Trp yielding half-maximum transport velocity (Km, about 1 µM for MhsT-WT) was only slightly altered by the mutations (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that while the Trp33 side chain likely plays some role in the transport mechanism, it is not essential for transport, in contrast to the S2-site residues Ile111 and Phe381, mutation of which ablates transport (SI Appendix, Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proximity_of_the_Trp33_Locus_to_the_S2_Site_Revealed_with_the_Substituted-Cysteine_Accessibility_Method  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taking advantage of the fact that MhsT has no native Cys, we were able to explore the involvement of the Trp33 locus in binding and transport using the substituted-cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we used the functional MhsT-W33C mutant (which displays only slightly impaired initial rates of transport compared with MhsT-WT; Fig 4B and SI Appendix, Fig S5A and Table S1), and the positively charged methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA), a sulfhydryl-specific reagent that reacts readily with water-accessible Cys (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MTSEA did not affect background uptake activity in control cells lacking MhsT, and, as expected given the absence of Cys in MhsT-WT, preincubation of cells expressing MhsT-WT with MTSEA had no effect on the initial rate of 3H-Trp uptake (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, MTSEA pretreatment of MhsT-W33C reduced uptake to 12% of that observed for the same mutant in the absence of MTSEA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although the Trp33 side chain tolerates mutation to Cys, chemical modification of the sulfhydryl by MTSEA, which results in a Lys-like side chain, greatly disrupts transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, when the preincubation was performed in the presence of both Na+ and Trp, the activity of MTSEA-treated MhsT-W33C was 90 ± 7% of that observed for the nontreated mutant (Fig 4C), revealing a protective effect of Na+ and Trp, the two cotransported substrates of MhsT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, neither Na+ alone nor Trp alone afforded protection of the thiol group located in the S2 site against MTSEA (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that the effect of MTSEA reaction with the engineered Cys at position 33 is due to disruption of the S2 site, we performed SPA-based 3H-Trp binding experiments in the presence or absence of MTSEA with purified, DM-solubilized MhsT-WT, -W33C, as well as -W33C/I104S and -W33C/F381S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that like the Cys mutations of Ile104 (S1 site) or Phe381 (S2 site) (Fig 3), the Ser mutations reduced the binding stoichiometry from 2, as observed in MhsT-WT and -W33C, to 1 (SI Appendix, Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of MhsT-W33C with MTSEA reduced binding by about 50% while it had no effect on the binding activity of MhsT-WT, -I104S, or -F381S (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining the W33C mutation with the I104S or F381S mutation yielded constructs (MhsT-W33C/I104S and -W33C/F381S) with binding properties virtually indistinguishable from that of the individual S1 (I104S) or S2 (F381S) mutant (SI Appendix, Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, MTSEA treatment only marginally reduced the binding activity of MhsT-W33C/F381S, which already has a disrupted S2 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, preincubation of MhsT-W33C/I104S with MTSEA reduced the binding activity of that mutant from 54.1 ± 0.9% to 5.6 ± 0.2% of nontreated MhsT-WT (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Trp binding in the S1 site of MhsT-W33C/I104S is impaired due to the I104S mutation (SI Appendix, Fig S5C), this result indicates that the reaction of MTSEA with Cys at position 33 specifically inhibits substrate binding to the S2 site in MhsT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to the transport studies (Fig 4C), we found that preincubation of purified MhsT-WT or -I104S with MTSEA had little effect on subsequent 3H-Trp binding activity (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MTSEA reaction with Cys at position 33 in the WT, or I104S background (MhsT-W33C or MhsT-W33C/I104S, respectively), reduced 3H-Trp binding from 100 to 50% or from 50% to 5% of their control values, respectively (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with disruption of the S2 site in the context of an intact or a disabled S1 site, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When Na+ and Trp were added together during the MTSEA preincubation, the 3H-Trp binding activity was fully protected in both constructs (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since there is no Trp binding to the S1 site in the I104S mutant, the protection of Cys33 from MTSEA must be mediated through a direct steric effect of substrate Trp bound in the S2 site, and not indirectly by the collapse of the extracellular vestibule in response to S1 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Substrate_Binding_to_the_S2_Site_Occludes_Access_to_the_S1_Site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having established that Trp binds in the S2 site, we next sought to investigate its impact not just on MTSEA reaction within the S2 site itself, but also on accessibility to the deeper S1 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so in a manner that does not rely on indirect inference of reactivity based upon a functional effect, but rather direct assessment of thiol reactivity, we measured with the SPA the reaction of the thiol-specific reagent 14C-N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to MhsT-I104C, which contains an engineered reporter Cys in the S1 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only background 14C-NEM binding was measured in MhsT-WT, consistent with the absence of endogenous Cys (SI Appendix, Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, robust 14C-NEM reaction with MhsT-I104C was observed in the absence of Na+, regardless of whether Trp was present or absent (Fig 4F), consistent with the Na+ dependence of substrate binding in the S2 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 14C-NEM reaction was reduced by 27% in the presence of Na+ alone, consistent with partial closure of the extracellular vestibule in Na+ (38) slowing access to 104C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast, 14C-NEM binding was reduced to background levels when both Na+ and Trp were present throughout the incubation (Fig 4F), consistent with Trp binding at the S2 site sterically occluding access to the deeper S1 site and thereby protecting the S1 reporter Cys from reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the same set of experiments were carried out with MhsT-I104C/I111S, which has an impaired S2 site due to the I111S mutation (SI Appendix, Table S1), the addition of Trp and Na+ failed to inhibit the NEM reaction with the thiol group at position 104, consistent with the inability of Trp to bind the S2 site (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the partial protective effect of Na+ was preserved, since the Na1 and Na2 sites are unaffected by the I111S mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the rotamer position of the Phe230 side chain may play an important role in modulating access to the S1 site, as it does for the aligned Phe253 in LeuT (20), we sought to determine whether S2-mediated protection of 104C results from rearrangement of the Phe230 side chain or whether sterically blocking the pathway from the extracellular vestibule to 104C is sufficient, in which case protection should not depend on the Phe230 side chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The I104C/F230A double mutant showed a virtually identical pattern of Trp protection as observed for MhsT-I104C alone (SI Appendix, Fig S6A), most consistent with steric block of the pathway to the S1 site by substrate bound in the S2 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our initial studies showing a Trp:MhsT stoichiometry of 1 in DDM (13) prompted us to consider a mechanism in which the conserved Trp in the extracellular vestibule (Trp33 in MhsT) might take the place of an exogenous S2 substrate in NSS family members other than LeuT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the collapse of this Trp into the S2 site could provide an intramolecular allosteric trigger for inward opening that is provided in LeuT by an exogenous S2 ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found in subsequent docking studies that the MhsT structure is in fact capable of accommodating a second Trp substrate in a site homologous to the S2 site from LeuT, with the only adjustment being the rotation of the Trp33 side chain (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that MhsT, like LeuT, can simultaneously bind two substrate molecules per transporter molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutagenesis analysis verified that residues aligned with those that disrupt S1 or S2 binding in LeuT do the same in MhsT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, mutation of any one of these four critical residues abolishes all active transport in MhsT, as it did in LeuT, consistent with the mechanism for transport that we proposed previously in which binding of the S2 substrate acts allosterically as a symport effector to enhance inward opening and release of S1 and Na1 to the cytoplasm (20, 21, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this mechanism requires substrate binding to both the S1 and S2 sites, flux studies using radiolabeled Na+ and substrate in the related NSS member GAT [the -aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter] suggest a net transport of two Na+ and one substrate molecule per reaction cycle (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, although this transport stoichiometry has not been measured in any other NSS, most likely only one substrate molecule (S1) is transported per cycle, along with cotransport (or symport) of two Na+ (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is now apparent that all of the LeuT structures with ligand in the S1 site contain density in or near the S2 site that is either OG, the TCAs clomipramine or imipramine, the SSRI paroxetine, the inhibitor tryptophan, or a still unidentified molecule (11, 2528, 3942) (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the recent hSERT crystal structure with S-citalopram, ligand was identified not only in the S1 site but also in a second site in the extracellular vestibule (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no doubt, therefore, that the S2 site can bind small-molecule ligands, and we agree with the statement in Coleman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17) regarding this second binding site (termed there allosteric site): The malleability of the allosteric site opens the possibility that, depending on the shape and size of the allosteric ligand, occupancy of the allosteric site might not necessarily abrogate transport activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it is conceivable that there could be a spectrum of small molecules that range from inhibiting to enhancing transport activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with our data in LeuT and now MhsT and the allosteric role that a substrate bound in the S2 site has in enabling transport activity (20, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nonetheless, the questions of whether substrate binds in the S2 site, and if so, whether this is an atypical property of LeuT that is not shared by other NSS members, have remained contentious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first reservation that has been raised is that substrate has not been crystallized in the S2 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the S2 site in LeuT can be crystallized with detergent, TCAs, SSRIs, and the inhibitor amino acid Trp, one might expect that it could be crystallized with Leu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, extensive efforts by multiple laboratories including our own have failed to yield a structure with substrate in the S2 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This failure is consistent with our biochemical (20), biophysical (21), and computational (20, 21) data suggesting that substrate binding in the S2 site of LeuT allosterically triggers inward opening of the transporter and thus enhances dynamics that would be expected to impair crystallization (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second argument against the S2 site binding substrate in LeuT was a study that measured the stoichiometry as 1 (23) in contrast to our measurements of 2 (20, 28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we were able to replicate these results, reducing the stoichiometry from 2 to 1 by raising the concentration of DDM (29), in accordance with the published studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that elevated DDM concentration irreversibly blocked binding to the S2 site in LeuT, an effect that could only be undone by removal of the detergent during reconstitution into liposomes (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An independent study also has measured the stoichiometry in nanodiscs to be 2 (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study that used NMR to measure stoichiometry was a technical tour de force, but unfortunately failed to use more routine binding measurements to characterize the protein used in the NMR experiments and determine whether the S2 site was in fact intact after detergent treatment, and thus is, unfortunately, not helpful in clarifying the native stoichiometry (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although a preponderance of evidence now suggests that the stoichiometry of LeuT is in fact 2, and that substrate binding to the S2 site allosterically plays a critical role in inward opening and the transport cycle (43), it had remained an important open question as to whether this mechanism is limited to LeuT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we extend this mechanism to MhsT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned above, we focused our studies on Trp33, which is located in the collapsed extracellular vestibule of MhsT (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comprehensive sequence alignments of NSSs compiled for our previous study (44) that includes both eukaryotic and prokaryotic members, this position is a Trp in all of the eukaryotic NSS sequences retrieved from the Swiss-Prot database, and in all prokaryotic NSS sequences retrieved from RefSeq database, with the only exceptions being LeuT (Leu29) and three other transporters from uncharacterized thermophilic Pyrococcus species (all Val).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In hDAT, mutation of the aligned Trp84 enhanced cocaine binding, consistent with a more outward-open configuration, and reduced transport by slowing inward release of dopamine (45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding W68L mutation in GAT1 also markedly reduced transport due to increased Na+ affinity and impaired substrate release (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with a role for this conserved Trp in enhancing the transition to the inward-facing conformation, just as we inferred for S2 binding in LeuT (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since MhsT has a rate of transport quite similar to that of the human biogenic amine transporters (13), it serves as a much better model for these clinically relevant targets in which to answer the question of whether the binding of a substrate triggers the S2 allosteric mechanism or whether the intramolecular collapse of the conserved Trp into the S2 site serves this role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MhsT, we have shown that mutation of Trp33 is readily tolerated, as the binding stoichiometry remains 2 and uptake is only modestly reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, a more radical mutation, created by reacting MTSEA with an engineered Cys at this position disrupts S2 binding and inhibits transport, demonstrating the functional involvement of this locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the reaction of MTSEA with this Cys can be protected against by the substrate Trp (only in the presence of Na+, which is needed for binding).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed here that this protection does not result from a conformational change associated with binding of Trp to the S1 site but in fact results from direct steric block within the S2 site, as protection was preserved in a substrate binding-deficient S1-site mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This establishes that Trp33 is near the critical S2 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also showed that binding of Trp to the S2 site protects an engineered Cys in the S1 site, presumably by blocking access deeper into the transporter (SI Appendix, Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our computational analysis indicates that the presence of substrate Trp in the S2 site maintains the extracellular vestibule in a collapsed state, which is expected to restrict the bulky NEM molecule from accessing the S1 site, consistent with the observed reduction in S1 accessibility in the presence of S2-bound substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in the absence of substrate, the transporter is expected to be in an outward-facing conformation with the S1 site exposed to the water milieu (48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We rule out that Trp binding in the mutated S1 site of the MhsT-I104C mutant can compete with NEM as saturation binding reveals only occupation of the S2 site in this mutant at the Trp concentration (20 M) chosen for the NEM labeling experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to LeuT and MhsT, the two-substrate stoichiometry demonstrated here is also shared with other LeuT-fold transporters without primary sequence homology to LeuT, namely PutP and vSGLT, in which the substrate stoichiometry has also been shown to be 2 and in which mutation of residues in the presumed S2 site abolishes transport (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the structural and functional similarities among NSS members, it seems likely that the two-substrate model will also extend to eukaryotic NSSs, although this must be explored experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, mutation of the conserved Trp in GAT severely disrupted transport, consistent with the possibility of a more important role for this side chain in eukaryotic proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, however, only a moderate impairment of transport was observed in DAT upon mutation of this residue, more similar to the results we presented here for MhsT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These questions must therefore be addressed more directly both computationally and experimentally in eukaryotic NSSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such studies cannot be limited to assessing the stability of a substrate bound in S2 for the length of a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory, but must include a quantitative model of the manner in which the binding of a second substrate is connected to functional mechanisms such as allosteric coupling to inward opening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Allosteric propagation mechanisms that have been elaborated and applied to NSS proteins (e.g., see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20, 36, 43, and 5154) have been based on extensive MD simulations in combination with Markov state model (MSM) analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predictions from such studies, probed with specific binding and flux experiments, will further reveal the nature and role of the S2 site in the function of MhsT and cognate NSS family members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The mhsT WT gene or mutated versions of mhsT (flanked by a sequence that encodes an N-terminal 10×His tag and TEV protease cleavage site) were expressed from a pNZ8048 derivative in Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace Trp33, Ile104, Ile111, Phe230, and Phe381 in individual fashion and double mutants were generated by swapping mutagenized fragments using appropriate restriction sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fidelity of the resulting mhsT variants was confirmed with sequencing (Macrogen, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After solubilization of inverted membrane vesicles of L. lactis producing the appropriate MhsT variant with 1.5% (wt/vol) of the detergent used for the subsequent immobilized metal-chelate chromatography (IMAC), protein was purified in 50 mM 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (Tris)/2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (Mes), pH 7.5/20% glycerol/150 mM NaCl/1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP)/0.1% (wt/vol) DDM or DM as previously described (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When indicated, the concentration of DDM during IMAC was reduced to 0.02%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HPLC-mediated size-exclusion chromatography (on a Shodex Protein-KW803 column) was used for buffer exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately before the size-exclusion chromatography the protein was concentrated using centrifugal filtration with Vivaspin6, molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) 50,000 devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reconstitution_of_MhsT-Containing_Nanodiscs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MSP1E3D1 and lipids were prepared as described (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli polar lipids (Avanti) were dissolved in chloroform, dried under a stream of nitrogen gas, and resuspended at a concentration of 20 mM in 10 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.01% NaN3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanodiscs were formed at a molar ratio of 0.1 MhsT:1 MSP1E3D1:500 lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detergent was removed by serial addition of Biobeads SM2 (Biorad) and the MhsT nanodiscs were resuspended in 100 mM Tris/Mes, pH 7.4/1 mM TCEP after ultracentrifugation of the samples at 365,000 × g for 1 h. The protein concentration of all samples was measured with the Amidoblack protein assay (55) and, in addition, the concentration of MhsT in nanodiscs was quantified from silver-stained SDS/PAGE gels with densitometry using ImageJ (NIH) using known amounts of purified MhsT as reference (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transport_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transport of l-[3H]tryptophan (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc) was measured in intact E. coli MQ614 harboring pQE60 (serving as control) or pQE60 derivatives containing the appropriate mhsT variants (that, in analogy to the pNZ8048 derivatives mentioned above, encode an N-terminal His tag and TEV site) as described (13, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the relative amounts of the MhsT variants in the membrane of the E. coli cells, membrane vesicles were produced from MQ614 cells expressing the given mhsT variants or those transformed with pQE60 (no mhsT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normalized amounts (10 g of total membrane protein) of the membrane vesicles were subjected to SDS/PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using His probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and a horseradish peroxidase-based chemiluminescence detection method (SuperSignal West Pico kit; Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Binding_Studies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
l-[3H]tryptophan binding to purified MhsT variants was performed in 50 mM Tris/Mes, pH 7.5/20% glycerol/150 mM NaCl/1 mM TCEP/0.1% DM or DDM as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the effect of the detergent concentration on the MhsT binding activity (SI Appendix, Fig S2), the DM and DDM concentrations were varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equilibrium dialysis was carried out with the HTD96b dialysis 96-well apparatus and 12,00014,000 MWCO membranes using 500 ng of purified protein as described (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SPA-based binding studies, 50 ng of protein was bound to 250 g of Cu2+-coated yttrium silicate (YSi) SPA beads in an assay volume of 100 L. Binding studies using MhsT reconstituted in nanodiscs were performed with the SPA in 50 mM Tris/Mes, pH 7.5/150 mM NaCl/1 mM TCEP and 50 ng of protein per assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3H-Trp binding with the SPA was performed in the dark for 16 h at 4 °C with vigorous shaking on a vibrating platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reactivity of 20 M 14C-NEM (55 mCi/mmol) with the engineered Cys at position 104 (MhsT-I104C) was measured with the SPA and 100 ng of indicated DM-purified MhsT variants in 50 (or 200) mM Tris/Mes, pH 7.5/150 (or 0) mM NaCl/20% glycerol/0.1 mM TCEP/0.1% DM in the presence or absence of 20 M Trp as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions were performed in the dark for 530 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All SPA samples were counted in the SPA mode of a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta plate PMT counter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 800 mM imidazole (which prevents the interaction of the His-tagged protein with the Cu2+-coated SPA beads) was added to the samples to determine the nonproximity background signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All SPA-based experiments were performed at least in duplicate with replicas of three or more, and data are expressed as mean ± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equilibrium dialysis was measured in duplicate with protein from two independent preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data fits of kinetic analyses were performed using nonlinear regression algorithms in Prism 7 (GraphPad), and errors represent the SEM of the fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chemical_Modification_of_Cys33  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transport of l-[3H]tryptophan in intact E. coli MQ614 expressing MhsT variants that contained a single cysteine in place of Trp33 was measured after the chemical modification of the thiol group of MhsT-W33C with MTSEA (kindly provided by A. Karlin, Columbia University, New York) (57) in the presence or absence of ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, before uptake measurements, cells expressing MhsT-WT, -W33C, or -W33C in combination with the S1-site mutant I104S or the S2-site mutant F381S were incubated with 0.5 mM MTSEA for 20 min at 23 °C in the presence or absence of 50 mM NaCl and/or 50 M Trp in 100 mM Tris/Mes, pH 7.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E. coli MQ614/pQE60 served as control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell suspensions were washed with the reaction buffer lacking MTSEA followed by three washes with 100 mM Tris/Mes, pH 7.5 before being used for uptake studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental data in figure panels (except those in Fig 2B) are from representative experiments shown as mean ± SEM of triplicate determinations and the corresponding kinetic constants are for the same dataset with the mean ± SEM of the fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the kinetic constants from independent experiments, individual data of two or more independent binding or transport experiments (with technical triplicates) were subjected to global fitting in GraphPad Prism 7 and the kinetic constants are summarized in SI Appendix, Table S1 as mean ± SEM of the global fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding data were fit to a one-site-specific binding model or a specific binding with Hill slope model as determined with the extra sum-of-square F test, whereas transport data were fit to the MichaelisMenten model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
