Self-interrupted synthesis of sterically hindered aliphatic polyamide dendrimers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hydrolytically and enzymatically stable nanoscale synthetic constructs, with well-defined structures that exhibit antimicrobial activity, offer exciting possibilities for diverse applications in the emerging field of nanomedicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we demonstrate that it is the core conformation, rather than periodicity, that ultimately controls the synthesis of sterically hindered aliphatic polyamide dendrimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter self-interrupt at a predictable low generation number due to backfolding of their peripheral groups, which in turn leads to well-defined nanoarchitectures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
2,2-Bis(azidomethyl)propionic acid was prepared in four steps and 85% yield from the commercially available 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid and used as the starting building block for the divergent, convergent, and double-stage convergentdivergent iterative methods for the synthesis of dendrimers and dendrons containing ethylenediamine (EDA), piperazine (PPZ), and methyl 2,2-bis(aminomethyl)propionate (COOMe) cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cores have the same multiplicity but different conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A diversity of synthetic methods were used for the synthesis of dendrimers and dendrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the method used, a self-interruption of the synthesis was observed at generation 4 for the dendrimer with an EDA core and at generation 5 for the one with a PPZ core, whereas for the COOMe core, self-interruption was observed at generation 6 dendron, which is equivalent to generation 5 dendrimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular modeling and molecular-dynamics simulations demonstrated that the observed self-interruption is determined by the backfolding of the azide groups at the periphery of the dendrimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter conformation inhibits completely the heterogeneous hydrogenation of the azide groups catalyzed by 10% Pd/carbon as well as homogeneous hydrogenation by the Staudinger method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These self-terminated polyamide dendrimers are enzymatically and hydrolytically stable and also exhibit antimicrobial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these nanoscale constructs open avenues for biomedical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Selecting_the_Aliphatic_Poly(amide)_Dendrimer_and_the_Synthesis_of_Its_Building_Block  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most sterically congested dendrimer reported to date (Fig 1) (12) was selected to evaluate the reactivity of its functional groups as a function of generation number and core structure and compare it with nonsterically hindered aliphatic polyamide dendrimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This sterically hindered aliphatic polyamide dendrimer is expected to provide an amplification effect of the reactivity of similar functional groups available in less sterically hindered dendrimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sterically hindered aliphatic polyamide is also synthetically attractive because it was originally prepared from the inexpensive and commercially available 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid AB2 building block (1 in Fig 2) (12), which was previously used in the divergent iterative synthesis of five generations of aliphatic polyester dendrimers (35, 36) that are commercially available (37), as well as in the synthesis of amphiphilic Janus dendrimers that self-assemble in biomedically interesting dendrimersomes (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The starting material for the iterative synthesis of the current aliphatic polyamide dendrimer is the AB2 2,2-bis(azidomethyl)propionic acid (compound 7 in Fig 2) that was previously obtained in 66% yield via the three reactions steps involving 1, 2, and 3 (Fig 2) (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attempts to improve the low yield of this synthesis failed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modification of this synthesis led to a more efficient four steps procedure involving 1, 4, 5, and 6 to produce 7 in 85% yield while reducing the overall reaction time from 92 to 38 h (Fig 2) and performing all steps under milder reaction conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Divergent_Synthesis_of_Four_Dendrimer_Generations_with_an_Ethylenediamine_Core  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first divergent synthesis investigated used a modified literature procedure that involved the use of an ethylenediamine (EDA) core and the acid chloride-activated form of 7 to produce three generations of polyamide dendrimers (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main modification involved the replacement of the amidation step consisting of the addition of 8 to a water/NaOH mixture containing EDA and a higher-generation dendrimer with the addition of 8 to a CH2Cl2/Et3N solution of EDA at 023 Â°C (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This modification improved the yield of the amidation step at all generations with a remarkable increase at G3 from 27 to 59%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that, due to steric reasons, the rate of amidation of the acid chloride competes with its rate of hydrolysis, and therefore the transition from amidation in basic water to CH2Cl2 improved its yield (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum generation of the previously reported synthesis of this dendrimer was G3 (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the modified conditions used here, the maximum generation that could be synthesized with the EDA core was G4 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All attempts to perform the heterogeneous reduction of the azide groups of G4 to amine with 10% Pd/C and up to stoichiometric amount of catalyst under 120 psi H2 pressure as well as Staudinger homogeneous hydrogenation have failed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An amidation method inspired from the synthesis of peptides (4042) was elaborated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carboxylic group of 7 was activated as an ester of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) either by the direct esterification of 7 with HOBt in the presence of N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and a catalytic amount of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to produce 9 in 92% yield or by the esterification of 8 in the presence of Et3N to generate 9 in only 69% yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amidation of EDA followed by iterative reduction/amidation steps produced consistently four generations of dendrimers in up to 20% higher yields than the acid chloride methods (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the reduction of G4(EDA)N3 generated by the HOBt-activated method could not be accomplished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Divergent_Synthesis_of_Five_Dendrimer_Generations_with_a_Piperazine_Core  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Disubstituted EDA and piperazine (PPZ) exhibit the same multiplicity but different conformations (4345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same core multiplicity with different conformations was not previously investigated in the synthesis of dendrimers (1, 2, 16, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The divergent iterative methods based on the acid chloride 8 and the HOBt ester 9 of 7 were both used in the synthesis of polyamide dendrimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High yields (6392%) were obtained for the first four generations with both methods (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, by contrast with the EDA core that allowed the synthesis of only four generations, the PPZ generated five generations of dendrimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G5(PPZ)N3 was obtained in 4438% yield with both methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attempts to hydrogenate G5(PPZ)N3 to G5(PPZ)NH2 failed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Divergent_Synthesis_of_Six_Dendron_Generations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The focal point of the polyamide dendrons was generated by the reduction of the azide groups of G1(COOMe)N3 (compound 6 from Fig 2) to NH2 to generate G1(COOMe)NH2 in 98% yield (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amidation of G1(COOMe)NH2 with 9 (Fig 2) or with 8 (Fig 2) produced G2(COOMe)N3 in 92% and 84% yield, respectively (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrolysis of the methyl ester of G2(COOMe)N3 produced G2(COOH)N3 in 93% yield (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of the COOH group of G2(COOH)N3 as HOBt ester or as acid chloride followed by amidation with G1(COOMe)N3 produced G3(COOMe)N3 (85% and 55% yields), which was hydrolyzed to G3(COOH)N3 (91% yield) (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reduction of the azide groups of G2(COOMe)N3 to G2(COOMe)NH2 (94% yield) followed by its amidation with 9 produced G3(COOMe)N3 (60% yield), which was reduced to G3(COOMe)NH2 (95% yield) and amidated with 9 to generate G4(COOMe)N3 (49% yield) that was reduced to G4(COOMe)NH2 in 92% yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeating this amidation/reduction iteration on G4(COOMe)NH2 produced G5(COOMe)NH2 in 40% yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amidation of G5 with 9 produced G6(COOMe)N3 in 38% yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All attempts to reduce the azide groups of G6(COOMe)N3 to G6(COOMe)NH2 failed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not surprising because the G6(COOMe)N3 dendron is equivalent to a G5 dendrimer that contains at the focal point the methyl ester of 2,2-bis(aminomethyl)propionic acid (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This focal point has the same multiplicity as EDA (Fig 2) and PPZ (Fig 3) except that it contains an additional tetrahedral carbon isolating the methylenic units from EDA or PPZ (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Accelerated_Double-Stage_ConvergentDivergent_Synthesis_of_Three_EDA_Generations_and_Five_PPZ_Generations_of_Dendrimers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An accelerated double-stage convergent-divergent synthesis was also used for the synthesis of dendrimers containing EDA and PPZ at their core (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G2(COOH)N3 (Fig 4) was activated both as HOBt ester and as acid chloride (both in 99% conversion and used without purification) (Fig 5), whereas G3(COOH)N3 (Fig 4) was activated only as HOBt ester (99% conversion and used without purification).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These activated compounds were reacted with EDA and PPZ to produce G2(EDA)N3 (78% yield), G2(PPZ)N3 (65% yield), G3(EDA)N3 (78% yield), and G3(PPZ)N3 (65% yield) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amidation of G2(PPZ)NH2 (Fig 3) with G2(COBt)N3 and G2(COCl)N3 generated G4(PPZ)N3 in 16% and 42% yields (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, G3(COBt)N3 was reacted with G2(PPZ)NH2 to produce G5(PPZ)N3 in 18% yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated attempts to reduce the azide groups of G5(PPZ)N3 to generate G5(PPZ)NH2 did not succeed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_Analysis_of_Dendrimers_and_Dendrons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structural analysis of all dendrimers and dendrons prepared by divergent and accelerated double-stage convergentdivergent methods by a combination of 500-MHz 1H-NMR (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2), 126-MHz 13C-NMR spectroscopy (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Fig 6A), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) (Fig 6B) demonstrated perfectly monodisperse compounds with molar masses equal to their theoretical values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that, although the reactivity of the azide and amine groups from their periphery may decrease while the generation number increases, there is a generation number at which at least the azide groups become completely inactive toward heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyzed with 10% Pd/C as well as homogeneous hydrogenation by the Staudinger reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of reactivity produces a self-interruption of the dendrimer synthesis process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this generation number is controlled by the structure of the core even when the multiplicity of the core is identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that the conformation of the core is either as important or even more important than its multiplicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_Modeling_and_Molecular-Dynamics_Simulations_of_Azido-Terminated_Dendrimers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Long-timescale fully atomistic molecular-dynamics simulations, based on state-of-the-art force fields, demonstrate that the observed decrease in reactivity of the dendrimers peripheral groups is commensurate with increasing sequestration of these groups and an overall compactness of the dendrimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculated atom number densities and radial distribution functions (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 and 8) indicate that an increasing number of terminal groups are backfolded into the dendrimer interior or are trapped in invaginations created on the dendrimers surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The calculated radius of gyration of the peripheral groups Rg(N3), demarcated by the solid white line in the density contours of Fig 7, is only slightly greater than the radius of gyration of the dendrimer (inner gray line), but always much less than that of its calculated radius of solvent accessible surface area (rSASA, outer gray line), indicating a tightly compact structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This ratio, Rg(N3)/rSASA is always less than 1 and decreases as the dendrimer generation increases, indicating a propensity of the outer groups to compact into the dendrimer structure, rather than expand into the bulk solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This presumably leads to the observed decrease and eventual cessation of their reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, and most importantly, this ratio is also dependent on the chosen core type, with the Rg(N3)/rSASA decrease per generation being most pronounced for the EDA core, followed by that of PPZ and finally COOMe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the computations fully support the observation that the chosen core type influences the reactivity of the peripheral groups, with the most rigid core having the most pronounced effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, the calculated radial distribution functions, (r) show a nonzero probability of finding terminal groups (Fig 8, solid teal line) backfolded into the dendrimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculated 3D atom number densities (Fig 7, yellow hotspots) indicate buried terminal groups as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the observed compactness of the dendrimers structure, we wondered whether reactants could penetrate into the dendritic interior to react with the buried terminal groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a spherical probe with various radii, the surface areas of the model dendrimers were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the square root of the surface area of a sphere is linearly proportional to the probe radius, any computed deviations from linearity between these values indicate penetration by the probe into the dendrimer interior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a smaller probe can penetrate into surface invaginations, leading to an apparent increase in surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deviations are indeed observed with probe radii less than 3 Ã (Fig 9) beginning with the fourth-generation dendrimer and are more pronounced at smaller probe radii and larger dendrimer generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This suggests that, in order for reactants to penetrate the surface of the dendrimer, they must have an apparent radius less than 3 Ã, or about the average distance between two oxygen atoms in bulk water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Couple this with the likelihood for the reactant molecule to at least partially desolvate to penetrate, and the observed decrease in reactivity of the terminal groups becomes quite clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Antimicrobial_Properties_of_Dendrimers_and_Susceptibility_to_Enzymatic_and_Chemical_Hydrolysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Naturally occurring peptides as well as synthetic mimics including peptoids are known to exhibit antimicrobial activities (4753).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for potential antimicrobial activity of the present aliphatic polyamide dendrimers terminated with amine, cell viability assays using resazurin were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resazurin is a redox indicator dye, which provides a readout for bacterial cell growth and viability (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) is measured as described in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G4(PPZ)NH2 was found to be active against all Gram-positive bacteria that were tested (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureussee SI Appendix, Table S2, for MIC estimates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G2(PPZ)NH2 did not display antibacterial activity at concentrations up to 1,024 Âµg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis, polyamide dendrimers G2(PPZ)NH2, G4(PPZ)NH2, and G4(PPZ)N3 were treated with a broad-spectrum protease, proteinase K (EC 3.4.21.64) (55), which is a serine protease with a broad specificity toward peptide substrates, and analyzed by 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three dendrimers were found to be stable against enzymatic degradation (Methods and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrolytic stability of these dendrimers was tested for 24 h at 23 Â°C and 80 Â°C under base-catalyzed conditions for G4(PPZ)N3 and for G3(EDA)NH2 under acid-catalyzed conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, no hydrolysis was observed under any of these conditions (Methods and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzymatic and hydrolytic stability of these aliphatic polyamide dendrimers make them likely candidates for biomedical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sterically hindered aliphatic polyamide dendrimers are expected to amplify the dependence of the reactivity of their peripheral functional groups on their core structure and generation number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding this reactivitycore structuregeneration dependence is important to elucidate the synthesis of such constructs for potential applications in nanomedicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Toward this goal, a study of the divergent, convergent, and double-stage convergentdivergent iterative synthesis of the most sterically hindered polyamide dendrimer known to date (12) was performed in gram quantities (Fig 10) with three different cores (EDA, PPZ, COOMe) having the same multiplicity but different conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A four-step synthesis in high yield, short reaction time, and under mild reaction conditions of the starting compound [2,2-bis(azidomethyl)propionic acid obtained from the commercial 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid] was elaborated to facilitate this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, the conformation rather than the multiplicity of the core provided self-interruption of the iterative synthesis at a predictable generation number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results expand on previous work that predicted and demonstrated a change in the reactivity of the functional groups for less sterically hindered polyamide dendrimers such as PAMAM (1, 2, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular modeling and molecular-dynamics simulations demonstrated that this self-interruption is likely due to the backfolding of the functional groups on the dendrimer periphery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steric hindrance of these aliphatic polyamide dendrimers makes them behave like peptoids (53) rather than as peptides of -amino acids, and consequently they are both enzymatically and hydrolytically stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While demonstrating self-interruption synthesis of sterically hindered aliphatic polyamide dendrimers, these experiments also provided quantitative mechanistic insights into the De Gennes self-limiting growth and dense packing parameters (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combination of function together with their gram quantity synthesis, and their antimicrobial properties, make these dendrimer nanoarchitectures interesting candidates for nanomedicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synthesis_of_Dendrimers_and_Dendrons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dendrimers and dendrons were synthesized by divergent, convergent, and double-stage convergentdivergent iterative methods starting from the commercially available 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of their synthesis and structural analysis methods and data are available in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Silico_Modeling_and_Molecular-Dynamics_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The monomers used in constructing models of the dendrimer macromolecules were taken from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecules were described by the Amber GAFF forcefield (56) except for the terminal azido group for which parameters were used from previous work (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fully atomistic molecular-dynamics simulations were performed using NAMD 2.11 (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NPT ensemble was applied with a temperature of 300 K and a pressure of 1.0 atm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methanol was used as a solvent and was described using the Amber force field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A time step of 1 fs was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trajectories of each of the 18 systems (3 cores, 6 generations each) were collected for a minimum of 100 ns, of which the last 20 ns was used for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendrimer rmsd and autocorrelation functions of the square of the radius of gyration were used to establish equilibrium and relevant decorrelation times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The VMD software package (59) was used to perform the following analyses: the radial distribution function, autocorrelation function, radius of gyration, solvent-accessible surface area, fractal dimension, and aspect ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MD analysis package (60) was used to calculate the 3D atomic densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thorough accounts of the modeling and simulation details are available in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Viability_Assays_Using_Resazurin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell viability assays to determine MICs were performed using resazurin based on established protocols (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saturated cultures of the strains to be tested were grown in Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) (Difco) at 37 Â°C with aeration for 1618 h. The cultures were then diluted 1:100 in fresh MHB and allowed to grow to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 2Ã dilution scheme of the test dendrimer was prepared in MHB in a 96-well clear microtiter plate such that the final concentrations were 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1,024 gmL1 in a 50-L volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five microliters of 0.675% resazurin stock solution was added to each well containing the dendrimer solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures grown to OD600 were diluted 1:100 fold and 50 L of cells were added to each well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plate was placed on a shaker for 15 min, followed by stationary incubation at 37 Â°C for 1618 h. For M. luteus, the incubation was carried out for 48 h as the strain grows slowly at 37 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resazurin turns from blue to pink color as a function of cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A MIC value was determined by the lowest concentration of dendrimer at which there was no color change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All estimates were derived from at least three independent trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proteinase_K_Digestion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proteinase K digestions of the dendrimers terminated with an amine group were performed as follows: 5 mg of the dendrimer G2(PPZ)NH2 or G4(PPZ)NH2 was added to 5 mg of proteinase K in a microcentrifuge tube and resuspended in 200 L of 30 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A control for proteinase K without addition of dendrimer was included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tubes were incubated at 37 Â°C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following 16 h at 37 Â°C, the above reactions were dehydrated at room temperature in a Speedvac to facilitate analysis of samples by NMR and MALDI-TOF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the dendrimers were recovered, and their structures were confirmed by NMR and MALDI-TOF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
