Golgi stress response reprograms cysteine metabolism to confer cytoprotection in Huntingtons disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Golgi stress response is emerging as a major stress response pathway although molecular players in the process have not been identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that Golgi stress response induced by the ionophore monensin is mediated by the PERK-ATF4 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that subtoxic levels of monensin precondition cells to respond to future damaging insults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monensin stimulates the reverse transsulfuration pathway via cystathionine -lyase, the biosynthetic enzyme for cysteine, important for redox homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have harnessed this pathway to mitigate toxicity associated with cysteine deprivation in Huntingtons disease (HD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are relevant to not only HD, but also other diseases involving redox imbalance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting the molecular controls for restoration of cysteine balance may offer more robust therapeutic avenues for disease management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Golgi stress response is emerging as a physiologic process of comparable importance to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial stress responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike ER stress, the identity of the signal transduction pathway involved in the Golgi stress response has been elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the Golgi stressor monensin acts via the PKR-like ER kinase/Activating Transcription Factor 4 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ATF4 is the master regulator of amino acid metabolism, which is induced during amino acid depletion and other forms of stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the genes regulated by ATF4 is the biosynthetic enzyme for cysteine, cystathionine -lyase (CSE), which also plays central roles in maintenance of redox homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Huntingtons disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder, is associated with disrupted cysteine metabolism caused by depletion of CSE leading to abnormal redox balance and stress response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, restoring CSE function and cysteine disposition may be beneficial in HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we harnessed the monensin-ATF4signaling cascade to stimulate CSE expression by preconditioning cells with monensin, which restores cysteine metabolism and an optimal stress response in HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have implications for treatment of HD and other diseases associated with redox imbalance and dysregulated ATF4 signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Monensin_Up-Regulates_CSE_in_Mouse_Embryonic_Fibroblasts_via_the_ATF4_Pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CSE is the biosynthetic enzyme for cysteine and a key enzyme in the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which is responsible for generation of glutathione and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CSE can be induced by a variety of stress stimuli (1012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to analyze the response of CSE to different stress conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cultured MEFs in low-cysteine medium, glutamine-depleted medium (Q), and arginine-depleted medium (R) or treated them with erastin (ERA), an inhibitor of cystine transport that elicits amino acid starvation (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously (10), low-cysteine medium or erastin treatment markedly increases levels of CSE in MEFs (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, omission of other amino acids also influences CSE, as removal of glutamine and arginine from the medium augments CSE levels (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ER stress can also induce CSE in MEFs (10, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the cross-talk between ER and Golgi, we wondered whether Golgi stress might influence CSE in a fashion similar to that elicited by ER stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilized monensin, which impairs Golgi function, to induce Golgi stress (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monensin is an ionophore that binds sodium and protons and, when incorporated into cholesterol-rich membranes, elicits proton leakage from acidic organelles including the Golgi apparatus (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined induction of CSE in response to nigericin (Nig), another Golgi stressor (13), as well as brefeldin A (BFA) (14), which interrupts trafficking between ER and Golgi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three stressors markedly increase CSE levels comparable to the actions of thapsigargin (TG), a classic stimulus to ER stress (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Induction of CSE by TG is mediated by the transcription factor ATF4 (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monensin also stimulates ATF4 levels to an extent similar to thapsigargin (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescent examination reveals enhancement of ATF4 by monensin selectively in the nuclei of MEFs (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both monensin and thapsigargin increase mRNA levels of ATF4, indicating that their inductive influences are at the transcriptional level (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhancement of ATF4 by monensin is concentration-dependent with a modest augmentation evident at 0.1 M monensin and increased stimulation at concentrations from 5 to 10 M. CSE is also induced in response to monensin treatment (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Activation_of_ATF4_by_Monensin_Involves_PERK_in_MEFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PERK is a well-characterized inhibitor of protein translation that acts by phosphorylating eIF2 to inhibit protein translation (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under conditions of global translational arrest, elicited by stress stimuli such as ER stress, selected proteins, such as ATF4, undergo increased expression to enable cell survival (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since ER stress activates ATF4 via PERK (18), we wondered whether monensin similarly influences PERK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we compared actions of monensin and thapsigargin in efforts to contrast regulation of ATF4 and PERK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both monensin and thapsigargin enhance levels of CSE, ATF4, and phospho-PERK (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While thapsigargin robustly increases levels of binding Ig protein (BiP), which accumulates in response to ER stress, monensin does not influence BiP levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that the stress response of monensin differs from that induced by thapsigargin (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrated that Golgi stress differs in its properties from amino acid deprivation (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glutamine deprivation, like monensin, enhances ATF4 levels, but whereas monensin augments phospho-PERK, no such increase occurs with glutamine depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish definitively that monensin acts via PERK, we utilized PERK-deleted MEFs and analyzed the induction of ATF4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both monensin and thapsigargin fail to augment ATF4 in PERK-deleted cell lines indicating that PERK phosphorylation is involved in ATF4 up-regulation (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, monensin acts via the PERK pathway wherein phosphorylation of PERK leads to phosphorylation of eIF2 to promote up-regulation of ATF4 and its downstream targets such as CSE (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Monensin_Induces_ATF4_in_Striatal_Cell_Lines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously we reported that induction of ATF4 is compromised in striatal HD cell lines in response to low-cysteine conditions (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We wondered whether monensin can induce ATF4 in HD cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined induction of ATF4 by monensin in the striatal cell-line models STHdhQ7/Q7 (Q7) and STHdhQ111/Q111 (Q111) harboring 7 and 111 glutamine repeats, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence studies show that monensin can induce ATF4 in both Q7 and Q111 striatal cell lines (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore whether PERKs influence upon ATF4 is altered in HD, we monitored phosphorylation of PERK in Q7 and Q111 striatal cell lines in response to thapsigargin or monensin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phospho-PERK levels are similar in Q7 and Q111 cell lines treated with these stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the MEFs, BiP is not induced by monensin in Q7 or Q111 striatal cell lines, contrasted with robust induction of BiP by thapsigargin in both Q7 and Q111 cell lines (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
General control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) is a kinase which, like PERK, can mediate ATF4 expression via eIF2 phosphorylation (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GCN2 undergoes autophosphorylation under conditions of amino acid starvation so that accumulation of phospho-GCN2 is an indicator of amino acid deprivation (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While arginine depletion promotes phosphorylation of GCN2, thapsigargin or monensin treatment fail to do so (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the induction of ATF4 by monensin in striatal cells does not involve phosphorylation of GCN2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed the response of ATF4 at various time points in the Q111 striatal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhancement of ATF4 by monensin in Q111 cells is first evident at 4 h and increases progressively at 8 and 16 h (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of CSE protein also increase in parallel with ATF4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphorylation of PERK also increases as a function of time (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next we examined concentration-response relationships at different time points for monensins actions on CSE, ATF4, and phospho-PERK to determine the lowest concentration of monensin that can induce ATF4 in Q111 cell lines (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only negligible levels of these targets are elicited by 0.01 M monensin, whereas 0.05 M monensin produces robust enhancements evident at 3 d with levels of CSE, ATF4, and phospho-PERK similar at 5 and 7 d (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe any cytotoxicity and/or adverse effects in these cell lines after prolonged monensin treatment at these concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear staining with DAPI revealed intact nuclear morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the integrity of the Golgi apparatus under conditions of prolonged low-dose monensin treatment was not significantly altered as assessed by immunostaining with known the Golgi markers giantin and acyl-CoAbinding containing domain 3 (ACBD3) (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since CSE is one of the biosynthetic enzymes for H2S, we also measured the production of this gasotransmitter in Q7 and Q111 cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed previously, the production of H2S is almost twofold lower in Q111 cell lines (Fig S1) (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H2S production is increased in Q111 cell lines upon monensin treatment; however, treatment of Q111 cell lines with propargylglycine, an inhibitor of CSE, prevents this increase (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that monensin stimulates H2S production via the reverse transsulfuration pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protective_Effect_of_Monensin_Against_Cysteine_Deprivation_in_HD_Cell_Lines  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously reported that cysteine deprivation is lethal in HD cell lines due to depletion of CSE, while supplementation with cysteine is beneficial (7, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Q7 cells robustly up-regulate ATF4 and CSE when grown in low-cysteine medium, Q111 cells are highly compromised in their ability to respond to low cysteine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of ATF4 or CSE under these conditions is minimal (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when Q111 cells are pretreated with monensin before growth in low-cysteine medium, ATF4 induction is rescued (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rescue occurs at the transcriptional level, as monensin markedly stimulates transcription of ATF4 and its targets, xCT (the transporter for cystine), Cat1 (cationic amino acid transporter 1), Lat1 (large amino acid transporter 1), and Cse (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This response was not observed in Q111 cells pretreated with vehicle (DMSO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike ER stress, the molecular markers of Golgi stress response have not been as well characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There have been reports of proteins that are up-regulated during Golgi stress response including ACBD3 (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we monitored the induction of Acbd3 transcripts after monensin treatment, which was induced under these conditions (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence analysis also revealed an increase of nuclear ATF4 upon monensin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ACBD3 was used as a marker for Golgi (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the rescue of the ATF4 response by monensin would enhance cell viability in low-cysteine medium, we pretreated the Q7 and Q111 cells with either monensin or vehicle (DMSO), followed by cysteine deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under low-cysteine conditions without monensin, Q7 cells display a modest reduction in cell viability (Fig 4 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, for Q111 cells, viability in a low-cysteine medium is reduced by about 75%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, pretreatment with monensin dramatically enhances cell viability of Q111 cells in low-cysteine medium to levels comparable to Q7 cells (Fig 4 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, low concentrations of monensin prevent toxicity associated with cysteine deprivation in HD cells by up-regulating the reverse transsulfuration pathway via ATF4 and its targets including CSE (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protective effect of monensin is dependent on CSE expression, as MEFs lacking CSE fail to grow robustly under cysteine-deprived conditions even after monensin pretreatment, unlike the wild-type cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small increase in viability in the CSE-deleted cells may reflect actions of monensin on the cystine transporter (xCT), which is also regulated by ATF4 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that full functionality of CSE is required for growth under cysteine-deprived conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The identity of the molecular components involved in the Golgi stress response has been elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principal finding of this study is that monensin, a Golgi stress agent, signals via the PERK-ATF4 pathway and intersects with pathways responsible for maintenance of redox homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulation of ATF4 by monensin occurs through PERK, as ATF4 is not induced by monensin in PERK knockout MEFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A consequence of ATF4 induction is the stimulation of the reverse transsulfuration pathway, which plays a central role in the maintenance of redox homeostasis in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low concentrations of monensin up-regulate CSE, a key enzyme of the reverse transsulfuration pathway and the biosynthetic enzyme for cysteine, via ATF4, which regulates CSE during stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway is disrupted in Huntingtons disease, as a result of which the HD cell lines are sensitive to cysteine deprivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell death elicited by cysteine starvation in these cell lines is prevented by monensin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support the notion that enhancement of the reverse transsulfuration pathway as a whole may be therapeutic in HD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Earlier, we reported that treatment with cysteine and N-acetylcysteine rescues abnormalities in HD cell lines and mice (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, supplementation with cysteine does not fully restore the functionality of CSE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of monensin to activate the reverse transsulfuration pathway provides a more complete rescue of ATF4 and its targets including CSE, the biosynthetic enzyme for cysteine and H2S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HD is associated with elevated oxidative stress (21, 22), which is responsible for the aberrant ATF4 response to cysteine deficits (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-cysteine levels due to CSE depletion contribute to oxidative stress, as cysteine is a building block for the major antioxidant glutathione and is itself an antioxidant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cysteine is also the substrate for the generation of hydrogen sulfide, which regulates cytoprotective pathways (Fig 1A) (8, 2325).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased oxidative stress compromises the response of the stress-sensitive transcription factor ATF4, which also includes up-regulation of CSE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This abnormality culminates in a vicious cycle that mediates cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitigating oxidative stress in HD cell lines reverses this abnormality (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study we have shown that low concentrations of monensin correct these deficits by restoring ATF4 function in response to cysteine deprivation via the PERK pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The use of monensin as a stimulant of the reverse transsulfuration pathway has implications for other disorders involving redox imbalance that may also display a suboptimal ATF4 response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Alzheimers disease is associated with generalized oxidative stress as well as specific deficits in levels of H2S (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV patients have depleted levels of CSE as well as elevated oxidative stress (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is employed in treating the cachexia of HIV infection (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidative stress has been linked to an increase in muscle fatigue, which is relieved by NAC treatment (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There has been very little exploration of CSE levels in association with various disease states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, CSE has been reported to be depleted in spinocerebellar-degeneration patients (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, glutathione and cysteine levels decline with normal aging (31, 32) and in cancers (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice in which the neuronal cysteine transporter EAAC1 has been deleted undergo age-dependent neurodegeneration (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, dietary supplementation with cysteine or cysteine-rich foods has proved beneficial in several neurodegenerative diseases involving oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, intake of whey protein, which has high levels of cysteine, has been linked to decreased oxidative stress, increased glutathione content, and improved antioxidant status in patients with Parkinsons disease (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementation with NAC, a more stable cysteine derivative, has also proved beneficial in elderly subjects, eliciting improved motor function (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reverse transsulfuration pathway is a central hub in redox control so that stimulating this pathway may impart therapeutic benefits in diverse disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reveal that low-grade Golgi stress, which does not elicit toxicity, can up-regulate cytoprotective defense mechanisms and may prime or precondition cells to withstand additional insults (Fig 4 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HD cell lines, ATF4 up-regulation in response to cysteine deficits is halted due to high-oxidative-stress levels (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementing diets with NAC compensates for low levels of cysteine and reduces oxidative stress, but does not restore the full functionality of CSE with respect to its enzymatic activity in generating H2S, cysteine, and other thiol products such as cysteamine and CoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ATF4 signaling and regulation of amino acid homeostasis, which would normally be up-regulated under this stress, are impaired in HD cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, novel molecules that can stimulate the reverse transsulfuration pathway may have adaptive benefits in HD as well as under diverse conditions involving altered oxidative stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although low concentrations of monensin afforded protective effects in cell-line models of HD, their effects in mouse models of HD and the minimal effective dose required to mitigate symptoms remain to be evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we utilized a cell-line model of HD to establish that stimulating the reverse transsulfuration pathway protects cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-grade Golgi stress induced by monensin preconditions cells to tolerate cysteine deficiency associated with Huntingtons disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings may be relevant to other neurodegenerative diseases associated with deficits in cysteine metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
