Reversion to an embryonic alternative splicing program enhances leukemia stem cell self-renewal  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we show for the first time, to our knowledge, that Muscleblind-like 3 (MBNL3) down-regulation in therapy-resistant human blast crisis leukemia stem cells (LSCs) is associated with activation of a human embryonic stem cell alternative splicing gene regulatory network involved in reprogramming and expression of a CD44 splice isoform, CD44 transcript variant 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting blast crisis LSCs with a human CD44 monoclonal antibody in combination with a potent breakpoint cluster region - ABL proto-oncogene 1, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL1) antagonist impairs LSC self-renewal in a niche-dependent manner and provides a compelling rationale for devising novel clinical combination LSC eradication strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Formative research suggests that a human embryonic stem cell-specific alternative splicing gene regulatory network, which is repressed by Muscleblind-like (MBNL) RNA binding proteins, is involved in cell reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, RNA sequencing, splice isoform-specific quantitative RT-PCR, lentiviral transduction, and in vivo humanized mouse model studies demonstrated that malignant reprogramming of progenitors into self-renewing blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells (BC LSCs) was partially driven by decreased MBNL3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lentiviral knockdown of MBNL3 resulted in reversion to an embryonic alternative splice isoform program typified by overexpression of CD44 transcript variant 3, containing variant exons 810, and BC LSC proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although isoform-specific lentiviral CD44v3 overexpression enhanced chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progenitor replating capacity, lentiviral shRNA knockdown abrogated these effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined treatment with a humanized pan-CD44 monoclonal antibody and a breakpoint cluster region - ABL proto-oncogene 1, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL1) antagonist inhibited LSC maintenance in a niche-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, MBNL3 down-regulationrelated reversion to an embryonic alternative splicing program, typified by CD44v3 overexpression, represents a previously unidentified mechanism governing malignant progenitor reprogramming in malignant microenvironments and provides a pivotal opportunity for selective BC LSC detection and therapeutic elimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reversion to an embryonic splicing program contributes to malignant reprogramming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Cytoscape network of previously published MBNL and ESC-specific alternative splicing program-related transcripts (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nodes are colored according to log twofold change of fragments of kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) in BC over FPKM in CP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid lines represent gene interactions derived from the Reactome Functional Interaction (FI) annotations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dashed lines represent predicted interactions from the Reactome FI annotations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) RNAseq analysis of MBNL3 expression in BC CML progenitor cells compared with progenitors from CP CML patient samples (P = 0.038; n = 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) RNAseq analysis of CD44 expression in BC CML progenitor cells compared with progenitors from CP CML patient samples (P = 0.013; n = 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) RNAseq analysis of CD44v3 expression in BC CML progenitor cells compared with CP CML progenitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) Model of CD44 exon organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colors of circles represent receptor placement or function as follows: black, the ectodomain; dark blue, intracellular (IC) domain; green, the HA binding domain; light blue, transmembrane (TM) domain; pink, variable exons (10, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (F) qRT-PCR analysis of MBNL3 (P = 0.049, Left) and CD44v3 (P = 0.037, Right) expression after MBNL3 KO in BC CML progenitors compared with pLKO (n = 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (G) Growth quantification of BC CML progenitors transduced with lentiviral shRNA for CD44v3 shows that knock-down of CD44v3 impacts the cell growth compared with untransduced and sh-control (n = 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (H) Lentiviral overexpressing (OE) of CD44v3 in CP CML progenitor increased hematopoietic colony formation (Left) (P = 0.003), specifically of G (P = 0.028), M (P = 0.008), mixed (P = 0.009), and Bfu-E (P = 0.008) colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD44v3 OE CP patient samples showed a trend of increased self-renewal capacity (P = 0.081) as measured by secondary colony formation (Right) (n = 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

hESCs Hues16 (46:XY) and H9 (46:XX) were cultured in a feeder-free manner (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 1 h before passaging, cell culture plates were coated using hESC qualified Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and cells were cultured and kept undifferentiated in prewarmed mTeSR1 medium (Stem Cell Technologies) and passaged enzymatically every 46 d using Dispase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peripheral blood samples from CML patients were obtained before initiation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment, unless otherwise stated in Table S1, from patients at the University of California, San Diego and the University of Toronto Health Network according to Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human CD34+ cord blood cells and NPB cells were purchased from AllCells Inc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mononuclear cells were Ficoll-separated (GE Healthcare BioSciences) from peripheral blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were CD34+-selected using magnetic beads (Miltenyi) and stained with the following anti-human antibodies: Lineage mix (Invitrogen) (CD2-PE-Cy5.5, CD3-PE-Cy5.5, CD4-PE-Cy5.5, CD8-PE-Cy5.5, CD14-PE-Cy5.5, CD19-PE-Cy5.5, CD20-PE-Cy5.5, CD56-PE-Cy5.5), CD34-APC (BD Biosciences), and CD38-PECy7 (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were gated into stem cells (LinCD34+CD38) and progenitor cells (LinCD34+CD38+) and sorted into lysis buffer (RLT, QIAGEN) using a FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was extracted using RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNAseq  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At least 20 ng of RNA per sample with an integrity 7 were prepared for RNAseq analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was processed using SMART cDNA synthesis (Clontech) and NEBNext paired-end DNA Sample Prep Kit (New England BioLabs) to prepare libraries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 instruments with an average of 161 million Chastity-passed paired reads, 50 bp in length, per sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNAseq_Whole_Gene_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As described previously (26), paired-end Chastity-passed reads were aligned to the human reference genome (version hg19/GRch37) plus exon junction sequences constructed from all known transcript models in RefSeq and EnsEMBL and known genes from the UCSC database using BurrowWheeler Aligner software (version 0.5.7) (27) with default parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After alignment, the reads that spanned exonexon junctions and did not map to the human reference genome were repositioned as large-gapped alignments in the genome based on the coordinates of the exons used to construct exon junction sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For gene expression quantification, we developed gene-coverage analysis software algorithms to calculate the per-base coverage across all exons annotated by EnsEMBL (version 59) and to sum up the coverage across all nonredundant exonic bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the coverage, we computed read counts and normalized them by the gene lengths and library depths (i.e., RPKM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fold changes in gene expression levels were calculated by transforming all RPKM values using the equation 1 + X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes with a fold change 2 or 2 and a false discovery rate (FDR) 0.05 using the BenjaminiHochberg FDR calculation were considered differentially expressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CD44_Nomenclature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our RNAseq, each CD44 isoform has been related to its specific RefSeq mRNA (GeneID for CD44v3, NM_001001390).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RefSeq IDs (previously known as EntrezID) for CD44 have been matched with the CD44 genomic locus from the NCBI Gene database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/960).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, next-generation sequencing analysis enabled NCBI reannotation of three complete genome assemblies (GRCh37.p13, CHM1_1.1, and HuRef) and identified additional splice variants for many human genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, human splice variants are now designated based on transcript sequence (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/news/08-27-2013-human-annotation-105/) rather than variant exon expression, which helps to resolve confusion induced by the multitude of names given for CD44 splice isoforms; for example, CD44 v8v10 is also known as CD44E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNAseq_Isoform_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paired reads were aligned to the hg19 reference genome with Alexa-sEq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (37), and isoform expression levels were computed with the Cufflinks software packages (v.1.1.0) (38) using default parameters plus upper-quartile normalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A filtered version of the UCSC KnownGenes (39) was used as the input reference genome annotation; isoforms for which RNAseq reads did not support (i.e., align to) every exon and splice junction were filtered out of the KnownGenes collection before input into Cufflinks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Differential_Gene_Expression__Network__and_Pathway_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed using log2-transformed RPKM values that were subtracted by the median across each row (genes) for centering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2,228 genes expressed differentially in BC and CP CML were used to identify significantly enriched pathways and networks of differentially expressed genes using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com) and the Reactome FI plugin (40) Cytoscape (version 2.8.1) essentially as previously described (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significantly enriched pathways from the Reactome FI plugin were filtered at an FDR less_than0.01, and the overlapping relationship between the significant pathways was visualized using EnrichmentMap (version 1.2) with the Reactome FI plugin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genes were ranked by the significance of differential expression represented in FDR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MBNL and transcripts with ESC-specific alternative splicing listed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6 were put into the Cytoscape Reactome FI plugin to create a network from that set of genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were then colored according to the log twofold change of the ratio of their average expression values (FPKM) from BC to CP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression values (FPKM) for BC and CP samples were input into the GSEA software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An enrichment plot describing the enrichment of Cell Adhesion Molecules was obtained from the analysis results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heat map showing 76 cell adhesion-related genes was based on an Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Molecules PCR Array (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Splice_Isoform_and_qRT-PCR_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Validation of RNAseq was performed using qRT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primer sequences for all genes analyzed can be found in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was extracted with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used 1 g of template RNA for reverse transcription to cDNA with SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qRT-PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad iQ5 multicolor Real-Time PCR using SYBR GreenER qPCR SuperMix for iCycler (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Target mRNA was normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) mRNA transcript levels, and the relative fold difference in expression was calculated via the deltadelta CT method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lentivirus_Transduction_and_Hematopoietic_Progenitor_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We developed a lentiviral human CD44v3 overexpression vector in the pCDH-EF1-MCS-T2A-copGFP lentiviral vector (System Biosciences) (Fig S1E) and the CD44v3 knockdown vector in Mission pLKO.1-puro (Sigma Aldrich) (Fig S1F), and the MBNL3 knockdown was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, also in the Mission pLKO.1-puro vector (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
hESCs and CP CML were incubated in 96-well plates containing StemPro (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with human IL-3, CM-CSF, and stem cell factor (SCF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were transduced for 72 h before collection of cells for qRT-PCR and self-renewal assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For hematopoietic progenitor assays, 100 CD34+ cells per well in a 12-well plate were cultured in Myelocult media (Stemcell Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary colonies (Bfu-E, GM, G, M, and Mix) were counted after 14 d. Individual colonies for each condition were picked and replated separately in fresh methylcellulose (MethoCult H4435, Stemcell Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of secondary colonies was evaluated after 14 d of culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rescue experiments were performed by first knocking down hESCs and BC LSCs using CD44v3 knockdown vector and pLKO backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, cells were retransduced with CD44v3 overexpression vector and pCDH backbone for an additional 24 h. Cells were collected prior, in between, and after transductions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mice_and_in_Vivo_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used RAG2/c/ mice in the human BC CML xenotransplantation experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAG2/c/ mice lack the common cytokine receptor  chain for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, as well as RAG-2, leading to a complete lack of mature T and B cells and NK cell function (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macrophages are still present in these mice (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mouse_Health_Assessment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vivo doseresponse health assessments were performed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every second day each mouse within the study and within all four treatment groups underwent a health assessment where their body weight, grooming, and activity were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were scored with a number between 1 and 5, with 5 being the highest and 1 (body weight was measured in grams before any dosing) being the lowest, to ensure their health during the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CML_Progenitor_Xenotransplantation_and_CD44_mAb_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human CD34+ BC CML patient cells were intrahepatically injected (100,000 cells per mouse) into RAG2/c/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Engraftment levels were monitored in peripheral blood by FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once engrafted, mice were randomized into four treatment groups: (i) control IgG1 (30 mg·kg·wk) + vehicle [50% (vol/vol) propylene glycol in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS)], (ii) control IgG1 (30 mg·kg·wk) + dasatinib (25 mg·kg·d), (iii) CD44 mAb RG7356 (30 mg·kg·wk) + vehicle, and (iv) CD44 mAb RG7356 (30 mg·kg·wk) + dasatinib (25 mg·kg·d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies were administered by i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection and dasatinib by oral gavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After treatment, BM, spleen, peripheral blood, and tumors were collected and analyzed by FACS to assess tumor burden (number of solid tumors and Lin+CD45+ cells) as well as the presence of CML LSCs (LinCD45+CD34+CD38+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were also assessed by qRT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of human cells was analyzed with human-specific antibodies: anti-lineage markers (Invitrogen) (CD2-PE-Cy5.5, CD3-PE-Cy5.5, CD4-PE-Cy5.5, CD8-PE-Cy5.5, CD14-PE-Cy5.5, CD19-PE-Cy5.5, CD20-PE-Cy5.5, CD56-PE-Cy5.5), antiCD34-APC (BD Biosciences), antiCD38-PECy7 (BD Biosciences), antiCD45-RA FITC (Invitrogen), and antiCD44-APC (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were analyzed on a MacsQuant flow cytometer (Miltenyi) and FlowJo software (Tree Star).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For serial transplantation assays, LSCs (CD34+) were isolated from the BM of primary xenografted mice from the treatment groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 25,000 cells were retransplanted intrahepatically into secondary neonatal recipient RAG2/c/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 8 wk, the levels of BM, spleen, and peripheral blood engraftment of human cells were assessed by FACS and qRT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were also assessed for expression of CD44, CD44v3, BCR-ABL, -catenin, ICAM-1, RHAMM, and OPN by qRT-PCR (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-human CD44 monclonal antibody (RG7356; Isotype IgG1) was provided by Roche Diagnostics GmbH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It binds to the constant region of CD44 and blocks the HA binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An IgG1 isotope mAb, Xolair (Novartis), which reacts with free IgE not found in our LSC xenograft system, was used as an isotope control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TKI, dasatinb (BMS Inc.), was purchased for experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry_of_BM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse femurs were dissected, leaving 2 mm of muscle tissue surrounding the bone to maintain the BM morphology when sections are cut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each femur was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 2 h in room temperature and decalcified at 4 °C in 0.23 M EDTA, pH 7.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue was further cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight in 4 °C and then imbedded in OCT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides containing tissue sections were thawed in 37 °C for 5 min, and the OCT was washed off using PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were fixed using 4% PFA for 10 min followed by a wash with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were blocked for 1 h using 10% BSA and 0.2 Triton-X-100 and stained with the following primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight: rabbit anti-human Ki67 (BD Biosciences), biotin anti-human CD34 (BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-human OPN (AbboMax), rabbit anti-human CD44 (Abcam), and rabbit anti-human HA (Abcam).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then stained for 45 min in room temperature with the following secondary antibodies: donkey anti-Rabbit Alexa Flour 488 (Invitrogen), StAv 555 (Invitrogen), and CD38 Alexa Flour 647 (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were washed three times followed by mounting using Prolong DAPI gold (Molecular Probe).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colocalization of markers was analyzed using Olympus Fluoview version 2.1c software and Pearsons coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values ranging from 0.5 to 1 indicate colocalization, and values ranging from 1 to 0.5 indicate absence of colocalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunocytochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
hESCs were collected and mounted on slides using Cytospinn at 50 × g for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were fixed using 4% formaldehyde for 10 min followed by a 3× wash using PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were blocked for 1 h using 10% BSA and 0.2 Triton-X-100 and stained with the following primary antibodies in 4 °C overnight: Flag produced in mice (Sigma) and OCT4 produced in rabbit (Diagenode).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then stained for 45 min at room temperature with the following secondary antibodies: donkey anti-mouse Alexa Flour 594 (Invitrogen) and donkey anti-rabbit 488 (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were washed three times followed by mounting using Prolong DAPI gold (Molecular Probes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ChIP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For ChIP analysis, the commercially available LowCell#ChIP kit from Diagenode was used; a detailed protocol can be found with the kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, cross-linking of cells was performed using 1% formaldehyde.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatin shearing was performed by adding a buffer containing protease inhibitor to cross-linked cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation, the cells were sonicated for 10 min in 0.5-min pulse intervals to obtain small fragments of DNA (between 300 and 500 kb).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies (OCT4, H3K27me3, and H4K16Acall from Active Motif) were bound to protein A-coated magnetic beads and incubated for 2 h in 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoprecipitation was performed by spinning tubes with the antibody-coated beads and placing them in a magnetic rack before aspirating the supernatant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatin was then added to antibody-coated beads and incubated on a rotating wheel overnight at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were then washed and beads were captured using a magnetic rack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Buffer was aspirated and DNA isolation buffer was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were then incubated at 55 °C for 15 min and then at 100 °C for an additional 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were centrifuged and qRT-PCRs were run on supernatant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ChIP data are presented as % input and normalized to pCDH backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Reversion_to_an_Embryonic_Alternative_Splicing_Program_in_BC_CML  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNAseq analysis demonstrated that CML progression from CP to BC was associated with decreased expression of MBNL3 and other key regulators of an embryonic alternative splicing program (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This coincided with increased expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) and fibroblast growth factor-5 (FGF5), which are involved in embryonic development, stem cell differentiation and proliferation, and tumor growth, as well as increased expression of Musashi RNA binding protein-2 (MSI2), which has been linked to LSC maintenance in a mouse model of BC CML (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pluripotency genes such as SOX2 and KLF5 were up-regulated together with CD44 during BC transformation (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of MBNL3 expression coincided with CD44 overexpression in BC compared with CP progenitors (Fig 1 B and C, Fig S1A, and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predominant NCBI-designated splice variant of CD44 detected by RNAseq, in BC compared with CP progenitors, CD44v3 (containing variable exons 810), showed expression levels similar to pluripotent undifferentiated hESCs (Fig 1 D and E and Fig S1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of MBNL3 (Fig 1F and Fig S1 D and H) in CML progenitors resulted in increased CD44v3 transcripts (Fig 1F) and enhanced OCT4 expression (Fig S1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in CD44v1 were not statistically significant (Fig S1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of CD44v3 in CP CML progenitors was associated with self-renewal and reduced MBNL3 levels (Fig 1 G and H and Fig S1I), whereas knockdown of CD44v3 reduced expansion of progenitors (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, when expressed in the context of the breakpoint cluster region - ABL proto-oncogene 1, nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (BCR-ABL1) oncogene, CD44v3 may increase cell expansion and enhance malignant reprogramming of progenitors into self-renewing LSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, CD44v3 overexpression enhanced hematopoietic colony formation, resulting in a trend toward increased replating capacity, an in vitro surrogate measure of self-renewal (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prosurvival MCL1 and BCLX long isoforms increased BC LSCs (Fig S1K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our results linking CD44v3 to activation of the pluripotency network prompted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis to study OCT4 occupancy of the CD44 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we observed a trend toward an increase in the recruitment of OCT4 to the CD44 promoter after CD44v3 overexpression (Fig S1J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rescue experiments confirmed specificity by knocking down CD44v3 and lentivirally reintroducing CD44v3 24 h later (Fig S1L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To elucidate the role of CD44v3 in the maintenance of stem cell self-renewal capacity, we investigated the effect of CD44v3 on pluripotent hESCs compared with LSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Splice isoform-specific quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to compare CD44v3 expression in undifferentiated hESC and embryoid bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, hESCs harbored significantly higher CD44v3 than their differentiated counterparts (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although undifferentiated hESCs had low MBNL3 expression, it increased upon hESC differentiation (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to CML progenitors, lentiviral overexpression of CD44v3 in hESCs resulted in OCT4 enrichment on the CD44 promoter (Fig 2C) and up-regulation of the H4K16Ac active mark (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have suggested that -catenin enhances OCT4 activity and therefore reinforces pluripotency, which corroborates our study (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to hESCs, BC LSCs harbored low levels of MBNL3 compared with their CP progenitor counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of CD44v3 in hESCs was associated with increased OCT4 and SOX2, but not CD44v1 (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, splice isoform switching favoring prosurvival MCL1 and BCLX long isoform expression (Fig 2E) resulted in increased proliferation (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, lentiviral knockdown of MBNL3 decreased hESC proliferation (Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal fluorescence microscopic analysis confirmed OCT4 up-regulation in hESCs following CD44v3 overexpression (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, CD44v3 overexpression was associated with increased -catenin (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enrichment of OCT4 was detected on the -catenin promoter in CD44v3-transduced hESCs, suggesting that CD44v3 is a marker of stem cells (Fig 2H) that have increased proliferation (Fig 2I) and decreased differentiation potential (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although CD44v3 overexpression enhanced hESC maintenance, knockdown of CD44v3 abrogated these effects (Fig 2J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a rescue experiment of CD44v3 confirmed specificity following knockdown of CD44v3 and lentiviral reintroduction of CD44v3 24 h later (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that a shared CD44 splice variant expression pattern promotes both hESC and BC LSC maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

BC_LSCs_Have_a_Unique_Adhesion_Molecule_Gene_Expression_Pattern  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CD44 adhesion ligands OPN, HA (9), intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and the HA-mediated motility receptor (RHAMM) (25) were examined by RNAseq and qRT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In BC LSCs, CD44 was among the most highly expressed adhesion molecules along with OPN and ICAM-1 (Fig S3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 76 cell adhesion-related genes analyzed, eight were up-regulated in BC compared with CP progenitors, including connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), l-selectin (SELL), and integrin alpha L chain (ITGAL) (Fig S3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, additional transcripts encoding proteins known to interact with HA, including versican (VCAN), ICAM-1, OPN (SPP1), and CD44, were more highly expressed by BC compared with CP progenitors (Fig S3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed enrichment of adhesion molecule expression in BC compared with CP progenitors (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, both RNAseq and qRT-PCR showed that BC progenitors expressed significantly higher levels of OPN and ICAM-1 compared with CP progenitors, whereas RHAMM levels were unchanged (Fig 3B and Fig S3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of CD44v3 in CML progenitors was associated with increased OPN (R2 = 0.731) and ICAM-1 (R2 = 0.714) but not with RHAMM (R2 = 0.093) expression (Fig S3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, CD44v3 overexpression in hESCs correlated with OPN (R2 = 0.81) and ICAM-1 (R2 = 0.84) ligand expression but not RHAMM (R2 = 0.21) (Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data thereby support hESC and LSC adhesion to a HA-rich niche (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CD44_and_BCR-ABL1_Inhibition_Reduces_BC_LSC_Survival  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if targeted inhibition of CD44 and BCR-ABL1 could abrogate human BC LSC (LinCD34+CD38+) survival in vivo, recombinase activating gene-2 (RAG2/c/) neonatal mice were xenotransplanted with LSCs from three separate BC patient samples (Fig S4 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human BC LSC-engrafted mice were treated for 14 d with an IgG1 control antibody, a clinical grade CD44 monoclonal antibody (mAb), a potent BCR-ABL1 inhibitor, dasatinib, or the combination of CD44 antibody and dasatinib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, FACS analysis was performed to determine BC LSC frequency in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow (BM) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CD44 mAb or dasatinib treatment alone reduced human BC LSC frequency in peripheral blood and splenic niches (Fig 4A and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 AC and S6 A and B) as well as myeloid sarcoma formation (Fig S5D), only combination treatment significantly reduced BC LSC survival in the BM niche in all three patient models (Fig 4A and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S5 AC and S6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, single agent CD44 mAb treatment of CP and BC CML in vitro did not have a significant effect on cell survival or differentiation (Fig S6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that only combined CD44 and BCR-ABL1 inhibition reduces human BC LSC survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Disruption_of_BC_LSC_Ligand_Interactions_with_CD44_and_BCR-ABL_Inhibition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of combined CD44 and BCR-ABL1targeted therapy on CD34, CD38, CD44, HA, and OPN expression and interaction in engrafted mouse femurs was analyzed by qRT-PCR and confocal fluorescence microscopy using colocalization software (Fig 4B and Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of CD34+ and CD38+ cells showed that these markers colocalized in control IgG- (Rr = 0.64), CD44 mAb alone- (Rr = 0.58), and dasatinib alone-treated mice (Rr = 0.61), indicative of the persistence of BC LSCs (Fig 4 B and C and Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, CD34 and CD38 colocalization was disrupted in BM following combination treatment (Rr = 0.28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colocalization of CD34+ cells with CD44 and OPN was observed in the control IgG-, dasatinib alone-, and CD44 mAb alone-treated mice but was disrupted in femurs from combination-treated mice (Rr = 0.34 and Rr = 0.39, respectively) (Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, colocalization of CD34+ cells with HA was abrogated in the CD44 mAb- or combination-treated group, indicating that CD44 mAb RG7356 blocks CD44HA ligand interaction (Rr = 0.42) (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following both CD44 mAb and combination treatment, qRT-PCR analysis of CD34+ cells isolated from BM and spleen revealed a significant reduction in CD44 and CD44v3 expression in BM (Fig S7A) and spleen (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the spleen showed significantly reduced levels of ICAM-1, RHAMM, and OPN following combination therapy (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that dasatinib and CD44 mAb therapy exert distinct effects on BC LSCligand interactions in different niches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CD44_and_BCR-ABL1_Inhibition_Reduces_BC_LSC_Self-Renewal  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the effect of CD44 inhibition on BC LSC self-renewal in vivo, we performed serial transplantation of human CD34+ cells from the BM of BC LSC engrafted mice after 14 d of treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although dasatinib alone did not eradicate self-renewing BC LSCs, recipients of cells from CD44 mAb-treated mice or in those treated with both CD44 mAb and dasatinib displayed a reduction in BC LSC self-renewal in peripheral blood, spleen, and BM (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, there was no significant reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels following serial transplantation of dasatinib alone-treated BM, thereby highlighting the inability of dasatinib to eradicate BC LSCs (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcript levels of CD44, OPN, BCR-ABL1, -catenin, and CD44v3 expression were significantly reduced in engrafted spleens (Fig S7D) in CD44 mAb alone- or combination-treated mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there was a significant reduction in total CD44 and -catenin expression in the BM of CD44 mAb combination therapy transplant recipients, expression levels of CD44v3, BCR-ABL1, and OPN were not significantly reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that CD44 plays a vital role in BC LSC self-renewal and combined CD44-targeted therapy can reduce their self-renewal capacity in a niche-dependent manner (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Alternative pre-mRNA splicing, which is more common in human than primitive pluripotent stem cells (6), regulates membrane protein structure and function as well as cancer stem cell evolution (16, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown, for the first time to our knowledge, that decreased expression of MBNL3, a repressor of embryonic alternative splicing and stem cell reprogramming, is associated with activation of a pluripotency network and with up-regulation of a CD44 splice isoform, CD44v3 (NCBI designation, compare Fig 1B), in human BC LSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with activation of a stem cell reprogramming network, CD44v3 up-regulation is associated with increased expression of pluripotency transcription factors, including OCT4, SOX2, and -catenin, in addition to the prosurvival long isoforms of MCL1 and BCLX, resulting in increased self-renewal and apoptosis resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, CD44v3 expression correlated with higher levels of ICAM-1 and OPN, suggesting that an embryonic alternative splicing program promotes stem cell adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up-regulation of both CD44 and its ligand, OPN, has been documented in many cancers and correlates with a poor prognosis (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although an increased (13, 18) LSC burden has also been linked to a poor prognosis (29), LSC isoform-specific expression data have been lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the BC LSC context, these molecules promote homing and adhesion of cells in the HA-rich BM niche, where LSCs are retained in a dormant state and thus are impervious to tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target dividing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that dasatinib alone is not enough to effectively target cancer stem cells in the BM (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others have shown that BCR-ABL1expressing cancer stem cells in mice are dependent on CD44 for homing as well as retention in the BM (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that CD44v3 is linked to enhance expression of OPN and ICAM-1 on BC progenitors, which are important for interactions in the local microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is conceivable that BC LSCs, in addition to adhesion molecule up-regulation and interaction with ligands, contribute to their own niche in an autocrine fashion by producing OPN and HA, resulting in enhanced adhesion as well as survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that a pananti-CD44 mAb disrupts the homeotypic adhesion of LSCs and retention in malignant niches, forcing them to enter the blood stream, where dasatinib effectively can target them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CD44 mAb and dasatinib treatment significantly reduces BC LSC self-renewal in the splenic niche and lowers self-renewal in BM, some BCR-ABL1 and CD44v3-expressing cells persist in the BM niche following combination therapy, suggesting that a CD44v3-specific mAb may be more effective at eradicating BC LSCs from the more recalcitrant BM niche (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both BC LSC self-renewal and survival appear to be predicated on reversion to an embryonic alternative splicing program typified by CD44v3 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Down-regulation of MBNL3 in CML activates an embryonic alternative splicing program and malignant reprogramming of progenitors into self-renewing BC LSCs that express CD44v3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observed that the CD44 target gene, -catenin, interacts with the pluripotency regulator OCT4 in LSCs, as has been reported in mouse ESCs (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the precise mechanisms through which -catenin activates OCT4 remain unclear and will be the subject of future investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies highlighted the importance of CD44v isoform expression in colon (30), gastric (31), and hematological malignancies (32) but did not completely elucidate mechanisms governing human variant CD44 expression or their cell type- and context-specific effects on function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, CD44 variable exons 810 (present in CD44 isoforms 1, 2, and 3) have been linked to gastric cancer stem cells (33) and associated with tumor progression in bladder cancer (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a mouse thymoma cell line, CD44v10 was found to bind more readily to OPN than other adhesion molecules, such as HA, and promoted tumor-infiltrating leukocyte recruitment upon local inflammation (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although other aggressive myeloid malignancies, like AML, have been shown to harbor a distinctive CD44 population that promotes expansion of myeloid lineage cells (35), we show that malignant reprogramming of CML progenitors, by repression of MBNL3, enables them to adopt features of an embryonic alternative splicing program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This culminates in the up-regulation of pluripotency factors, such as SOX2 as well as inhibitor of DNA binding 2 and 3 (ID2 and ID3), which inhibit differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, a human CD44-specific mAb, RG7356, impairs tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant BC LSC survival and self-renewal in a niche-dependent manner, particularly when combined with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide the impetus for devising novel combination strategies aimed at eradicating BC LSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we have uncovered a previously unidentified mechanistic link between de-repression of embryonic alternative splicing of CD44v3 and pluripotency programs that provides a unique prognostic and therapeutic opportunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
