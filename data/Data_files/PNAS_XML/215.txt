Artificial eye for scotopic vision with bioinspired all-optical photosensitivity enhancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although biological eyes ingeniously adopt diverse optical approaches to improve their scotopic vision, enhancement of the photosensitivity in artificial imaging systems still clings to electronic methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present an all-optical strategy to significantly improve the low-light imaging capability of manmade sensors, which is inspired by the optical concept of superposition eyes and elephantnose fish eye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides showing an artificial eye whose scotopic vision is largely improved by a bioinspired photosensitivity enhancer, we also demonstrate a complete solution to acquire high-resolution images under low-light conditions with our device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, our purely optical approach can be used on top of other electronic technologies, which can boost the most state-of-the-art imaging sensor whose photosensitivity is gaining on the physical limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability to acquire images under low-light conditions is critical for many applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to date, strategies toward improving low-light imaging primarily focus on developing electronic image sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by natural scotopic visual systems, we adopt an all-optical method to significantly improve the overall photosensitivity of imaging systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such optical approach is independent of, and can effectively circumvent the physical and material limitations of, the electronics imagers used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate an artificial eye inspired by superposition compound eyes and the retinal structure of elephantnose fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bioinspired photosensitivity enhancer (BPE) that we have developed enhances the image intensity without consuming power, which is achieved by three-dimensional, omnidirectionally aligned microphotocollectors with parabolic reflective sidewalls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work opens up a previously unidentified direction toward achieving high photosensitivity in imaging systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fabrication_of_BPE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To fabricate glass microstructures with parabolic sidewalls, a layer-by-layer ablation process was performed by a femtosecond laser (Uranus2000-10301000, PolarOnyx) with a pulse duration of 700 fs, a wavelength of 1,030 nm, and a repetition rate of 120 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scanning path was precisely controlled by a 3D translation stage (XM ultraprecision linear motor stages, Newport) and the diameter of the laser spot was 1 m, which was focused by a microscope objective lens (N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 0.5, Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A thin layer of photoresist (SU-8 MicroSpray, MicroChem) was sprayed onto the microstructures, and the photocured photoresist was reflowed in an oven at 210 °C for 90 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aluminum reflecting layer was coated on the reflowed Su-8 surface by a sputterer (Denton Discovery 24), and the Al covering the output ports was ablated by a tightly focused femtosecond laser (focused by Nikon objective lens with N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 0.8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove the underlying glass substrate by a hydrofluoric acid [5% (vol/vol)], -PCs were protected by a layer of acid-resistance wax (Crystalbond 509, SPI Supplies), and the etching process lasted about 4 h at 23 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The released -PCs were then transferred onto a radially stretched PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning) membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the removal of the protection wax by submerging the device in acetone for 15 min, the stretched membrane was released, forming the curved BPE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Acquisition_and_Processing_of_Images  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a CCD camera (model KAI-02050, TRUESENSE) to acquire images generated by our device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cover glass on the CCD was removed to enable the close contact between the devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain focal spots of light in Fig 3A, a collimated HeNe laser (model 1108, Edmund Optics) with uniform distribution in light intensity was used as the light source and a flat BPE was butt-coupled with the CCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images in Fig 4 C and F were generated by a double-convex lens (BK-7, Thorlabs) with a focal length of 100 mm, and were processed by an algorithm based on a superresolution image reconstruction method and coded in MATLAB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The image shown in Fig 4G was acquired by scanning the CCD with a five-axis stage consisting of three linear stages (PT1, Thorlabs) and two rotation stages (PR01 and RBB18A, Thorlabs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
