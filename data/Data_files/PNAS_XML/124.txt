title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Musclin is an activity-stimulated myokine that enhances physical endurance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Skeletal muscle is increasingly recognized as a secretory organ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Revealing the identity and function of myokines can improve our understanding of skeletal muscle function under sedentary or exercise conditions, as well as its coordination with other organs, tissues, and overall body metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study identifies musclin as an exercise-responsive myokine critical for skeletal muscle adaptation to physical activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We develop a musclin-encoding gene (Ostn) knockout mouse, which allows us to determine a previously unrecognized physiologic function of musclin in regulation of skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and physical endurance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The demonstrated molecular mechanism for musclin-dependent skeletal muscle adaptation to exercise also transforms the perspective on natriuretic peptide signaling, particularly as it relates to physical activity and exercise-induced remodeling in different tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exercise remains the most effective way to promote physical and metabolic wellbeing, but molecular mechanisms underlying exercise tolerance and its plasticity are only partially understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study we identify musclina peptide with high homology to natriuretic peptides (NP)as an exercise-responsive myokine that acts to enhance exercise capacity in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use human primary myoblast culture and in vivo murine models to establish that the activity-related production of musclin is driven by Ca2+-dependent activation of Akt1 and the release of musclin-encoding gene (Ostn) transcription from forkhead box O1 transcription factor inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of Ostn and elimination of musclin secretion in mice results in reduced exercise tolerance that can be rescued by treatment with recombinant musclin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced exercise capacity in mice with disrupted musclin signaling is associated with a trend toward lower levels of plasma atrial NP (ANP) and significantly smaller levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1- in skeletal muscles after exposure to exercise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in agreement with the established musclin ability to interact with NP clearance receptors, but not with NP guanyl cyclase-coupled signaling receptors, we demonstrate that musclin enhances cGMP production in cultured myoblasts only when applied together with ANP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elimination of the activity-related musclin-dependent boost of ANP/cGMP signaling results in significantly lower maximum aerobic capacity, mitochondrial protein content, respiratory complex protein expression, and succinate dehydrogenase activity in skeletal muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that musclin enhances physical endurance by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Musclin_Production_and_Secretion_into_the_Systemic_Circulation_Are_Stimulated_by_Exercise  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Normal skeletal muscle function requires tight coordination with the operation of other organs and systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such coordination has been attributed in part to the action of myokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, exercise factors, a subset of myokines whose production and secretion into systemic circulation are stimulated by physical activity, have been shown to modulate skeletal muscle and systemic metabolism, angiogenesis, growth, and inflammation (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether musclin is an exercise factor, the level of musclin peptide in skeletal muscle was probed in two groups of wild-type (WT) mice: one group that exercised on a moving treadmill for 45 min daily (exercise) and a sedentary control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 5 d of exercise or control treadmill exposure, mice were euthanized, and their tissues were harvested by rapid excision and freeze clamp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins were extracted from gastrocnemius muscles and segregated by Western blot (Fig 1A), showing that exercise was associated with a nearly 100% increase in skeletal muscle musclin over control conditions [1.15 ± 0.2 vs. 0.60 ± 0.1 arbitrary units (AU), n = 5 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 1B].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar increase was demonstrated in skeletal muscle musclin mRNA from tibialis anterior samples (0.75 ± 0.05 vs. 0.49 ± 0.05 AU, n = 5 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 1C), whereas musclin mRNA levels in femur were markedly (9698%) lower and were unresponsive to exercise [0.02 ± 0.002 vs. 0.02 ± 0.003 AU, respectively, n = 4 each, P = not significant (NS) between exercise and sedentary, P less_than 0.05 compared with skeletal muscle mRNA].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased musclin production by skeletal muscle was paralleled by an increase in the plasma musclin level from 27.71 ± 5.54 pg/mL (n = 3) in sedentary control WT mice to 46.24 ± 4.69 pg/mL in WT mice after exercise (n = 6, P less_than 0.05; Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, immunohistochemistry of gastrocnemius cross-sections demonstrated more intense staining for musclin when mice were after exercise vs. sedentary (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, musclin production and secretion into the systemic circulation are up-regulated in response to exercise, establishing musclin as an exercise factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Activity-Induced_Musclin_Production_Is_Linked_to_Ca2+-Dependent_Activation_of_Akt  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regulation of musclin transcription has been linked to Akt activation (4, 6, 15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akt is a serine/threonine kinase that has emerged as a critical signaling component for the regulation of cellular metabolism, growth, and survival in multiple systems (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akt activity is increased in response to numerous stimuli, including a wide variety of growth factors and hormones activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) (1820).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akt can also be activated by mechanisms independent of PI3-kinasefor example, in response to increases in intracellular Ca2+ or cAMP, as occurs with increased muscle contractile activity (2125).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we confirm Akt activation in our model of treadmill-exercised mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the levels of phosphorylated Akt (S473 and T308) and total Akt from gastrocnemius of WT mice were compared by Western blot (Fig 2 AC), showing a significant increase in phosphorylated Akt (0.48 ± 0.09 vs. 0.28 ± 0.01 AU, n = 5 each, P less_than 0.05 for S473; Fig 2E; and 1.14 ± 0.02 vs. 0.68 ± 0.07 AU, n = 5 each, P less_than 0.05 for T308; Fig 2F), but not total Akt (1.02 ± 0.05 vs. 1.21 ± 0.06 AU, n = 5 each, P = NS; Fig 2G), in response to exercise vs. sedentary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akt is a known regulator of FOXO1 nuclear export (15, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we find a significant increase in phosphorylated FOXO1 (1.473 ± 0.047 vs. 1.185 ± 0.056 AU, n = 3 each, P less_than 0.05), but not total FOXO1 (1.380 ± 0.046 vs. 1.337 ± 0.103 AU, n = 3 each, P = NS) normalized to GAPDH in gastrocnemius muscle from exercised vs. sedentary muscle (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, FOXO1 nuclear content quantification by Western blot (Fig 2D) shows a dramatic reduction in response to exercise (0.16 ± 0.07 vs. 0.95 ± 0.29 AU, n = 5 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because FOXO1 is known to inhibit musclin-encoding gene transcription in skeletal muscle (6), this exercise-related reduction in nuclear FOXO1 is consistent with our finding of increased musclin mRNA after exercise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found no significant exercise-induced changes in musclin mRNA/hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) in Akt1-KO mice (0.47 ± 0.10 AU, n = 5 vs. 0.45 ± 0.06 AU, n = 4, P = NS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This molecular cascade was verified in a cell culture model of primary skeletal myoblasts isolated from WT mice in which phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO1 were induced by application of a Ca2+ ionophore (A23187; Sigma Aldrich; Fig 3 AC; p-Akt/GAPDH 0.26 ± 0.008, n = 2 vs. 0.91 ± 0.05, n = 4, pFOXO1/GAPDH 0.12 ± 0.02, n = 2 vs. 0.39 ± 0.04, n = 4, pAkt/total Akt 0.21 ± 0.01, n = 2 vs. 0.66 ± 0.03, n = 4, pFOXO1/total FOXO1 0.07 ± 0.01, n = 2 vs. 0.27 ± 0.03, n = 4, for control and ionophore conditions, respectively, all in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+; P less_than 0.05 for all comparisons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This activation of Akt by Ca2+ ionophore was paralleled by augmented musclin production (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, an increase in musclin mRNA was induced by Ca2+ ionophore in a dose-dependent manner (1.00 ± 0.08 AU no ionophore vs. 2.20 ± 0.06 AU for 0.5 µM ionophore vs. 3.60 ± 0.81 AU for 1 µM ionophore, all in presence of 1.0 mM Ca2+, n = 3 each, P less_than 0.05 for each ionophore concentration vs. no ionophore or control; Fig 3D)a response that was eliminated when myoblasts were pretreated with Akt inhibitor-viii (Sigma-Aldrich; 1.09 ± 0.03 AU, n = 3, P = NS vs. control; Fig 3D), or by removal of extracellular Ca2+ from the medium (0.96 ± 0.012 AU, n = 3 each, P = NS vs. control; Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same musclin response to Ca2+ was observed in a primary culture of myoblasts isolated from healthy human subjects (ZenBio; 1.0 ± 0.03 AU for no ionophore vs. 3.02 ± 0.23 AU for 0.5 µM ionophore vs. 3.95 ± 0.83 AU for 1 µM ionophore, all in presence of 1.0 mM Ca2+, n = 3 each; P less_than 0.05 for each ionophore concentration vs. no ionophore or control, values in Ca2+-free buffer were 1.0 ± 0.05, 0.74 ± 0.18, and 0.79 ± 0.18 AU, respectively; n = 3 each, P = NS; Fig 3E), confirming that this mechanism is not specific to mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings all indicate that exercise-related musclin production is driven by the Ca2+AktFOXO1 signaling cascade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genetic_Disruption_of_Musclin_Production_Causes_Reduced_Physical_Endurance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the physiological significance and function of a physical-activity-induced increase in musclin production, we generated a mouse model with ubiquitous disruption of the musclin-encoding gene, Ostn (genOway) and confirmed the absence of musclin production in skeletal muscle of Ostn-KO mice vs. WT controls by Western blot (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ostn-KO mice, housed normally and fed standard chow, exhibited no skeletal deformities or differences in bone density and no growth abnormalities, blood pressure, or body composition changes (Fig S2 and Table S1) compared with controls at 78 wk of age; however, they do demonstrate lower exercise tolerance than controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, when challenged with a program of treadmill exercise with progressive increase in speed and incline (Fig 4C), Ostn-KO mice demonstrate a significant deficit in exertional tolerance with respect to duration (71 ± 6 vs. 91 ± 6 min., n = 6 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 4D), distance (769 ± 102 vs. 1147 ± 121 m, n = 6 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 4E), and overall workload (34 ± 5 vs. 53 ± 4 J, n = 6 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, when mice were offered the opportunity for voluntary exercise on running wheels (Fig 4G), Ostn-KO mice demonstrated significantly lower mean velocity (35 ± 4 vs. 52 ± 4 rotations per 5 min, n = 6 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 4H), duration (303 ± 38 vs. 383 ± 64 min., n = 6 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 4I), and distance (1,505 ± 231 vs. 2,218 ± 253 m, n = 6 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 4J) during the night when the vast majority of activity was recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that the observed phenotype is related to the absence of musclin in the systemic circulation, mice were implanted with osmotic pumps (Alzet Durect) loaded with saline or 50 µg of musclin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dose resulted in musclin plasma levels of 69.7 ± 8.8 pg/mL (n = 3), comparable with levels observed in mice following exercise as presented in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voluntary exercise on running wheels (Fig 4K) was significantly increased in WT mice treated with musclin (n = 5) compared with WT mice treated with saline (n = 4), with respect to mean velocity (51 ± 7 vs. 16 ± 4 rotations per 5 min, P less_than 0.05; Fig 4L), duration (336 ± 39 vs. 147 ± 10 min, P less_than 0.05; Fig 4M), and distance (2,202 ± 280 vs. 696 ± 179 m, P less_than 0.05; Fig 4N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, treatment with musclin rescued the Ostn-KO mice (n = 4) because their exercise activity was equalized to that of musclin-treated WT mice (n = 5) in terms of night-time mean velocity (53 ± 15 vs. 51 ± 7 rotations per 5 min, P = NS; Fig 4L), duration of running (333 ± 53 vs. 336 ± 39 min, P = NS; Fig 4M), and distance run (2,290 ± 632 vs. 2,202 ± 280 m, P = NS; Fig 4N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, intact musclin production is critical for optimal exercise performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Musclin_Boosts_Activity-Related_cGMP_Production_in_Skeletal_Muscle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address the relationship between exercise, musclin, and ANP, we examined WT and Ostn-KO mice after exercise using the same protocol as in Fig 1, which established a significant exercise-related musclin response in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a trend toward higher-plasma ANP levels in exercised WT (n = 18 mice in six groups) compared with Ostn-KO (n = 15 mice in five groups) mice, although it did not achieve statistical significance (140.4 ± 19.9 pg/mL vs. 98.2 ± 4.5, P = 0.09; Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when gastrocnemius muscles were assayed after exercise, we detected significantly more cGMP in the muscle of WT compared with Ostn-KO mice (23.13 ± 0.88 fmol/mg vs. 20.62 ± 0.60 skeletal muscle tissue, P less_than 0.05; Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ANPmusclin interaction with respect to cGMP signaling was further verified in a cell culture model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we examined a skeletal myoblast culture exposed to various combinations and concentrations of these two peptides (n = 3 each; Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, as expected, cGMP production was very low when no peptides were added (0.113 ± 0.003 fmol per µg of protein) or when musclin was added without ANP (0.104 ± 0.006 fmol/µg protein for 1 µM musclin and 0.117 ± 0.003 fmol/µg protein for 5 µM musclin; Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also as expected, exposure to ANP resulted in a vigorous dose-dependent cGMP response (3.491 ± 0.057 fmol per µg of protein for 1 µM ANP and 6.046 ± 0.074 fmol per µg of protein for 5 µM ANP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this response was augmented by the addition of musclin (6.840 ± 0.184 fmol per µg of protein for 5 µM ANP + 1 µM musclin, P less_than 0.05 vs. ANP 5 µM without musclin; Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These data support a synergistic relationship between musclin and ANP and are consistent with the hypothesis that competition for NPRC between musclin and ANP augments local ANP effects due to reduced clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Normal_Musclin_Signaling_Promotes_Mitochondrial_Biogenesis_in_Skeletal_Muscle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NP/cGMP signaling is increasingly recognized as a key regulator of metabolic homeostasis, including effects on skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation potential (2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) is commonly used to estimate overall aerobic fitness based on cardiopulmonary function and oxidative phosphorylation potential (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether musclin production impacts aerobic capacity as a potential mechanism underlying differences in exercise tolerance, we monitored exercise-trained Ostn-KO and WT mice on a metabolic treadmill equipped for indirect calorimetry (Columbus instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 5 d of training, mice were placed on the stationary treadmill for 30 min and then were exposed to the protocol of escalating exercise workload to determine their VO2max.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting oxygen consumption recorded as a function of time reveals a significantly lower VO2 max for Ostn-KO compared with WT (7,629 ± 161 vs. 8,334 ± 212 mL/kg per h, n = 5 and 4, respectively, P less_than 0.05; Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, after 3 wk of musclin infusion delivered via osmotic pumps (Alzet Durect), Ostn-KO and WT mice demonstrated comparable VO2max (8,193 ± 100 vs. 8,034 ± 77 mL/kg per h, n = 3 and 4, respectively, P = NS; Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest musclin signaling may be tied to oxidative phosphorylation through mitochondrial density, size, or function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess this hypothesis, electron micrographs of longitudinal sections through tibialis anterior of exercised mice were examined and appeared to show smaller mitochondrial size in the Ostn-KO compared with WT mice (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding corresponds to a significantly lower mitochondrial protein content when normalized to the wet skeletal muscle weight (1.09 ± 0.04 vs. 1.33 ± 0.07 µg per mg of tissue, n = 6 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 6C), and respiratory complex expression (0.24 ± 0.02 vs. 0.31 ± 0.04 AU for CIII and 0.65 ± 0.08 vs. 0.91 ± 0.06 AU for CVI, n = 3 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 6 D and E) in gastrocnemius muscle homogenates, as well as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity as assessed by percent of immunohistochemical staining in tibialis anterior cross-sections (43.33 ± 0.65 vs. 49.92 ± 2.09%, n = 3 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 6 F and G) from Ostn-KO vs. WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, disruption of normal musclin signaling appears to impact fiber type composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, histologic examination of skeletal muscles from Ostn-KO vs. WT mice indicates a shift toward more pure glycolytic type IIb fibers in the KO (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between sedentary WT and Ostn-KO mice were less marked (Fig S5), consistent with the finding that exercise augments musclin signaling in the WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, differences in oxygen consumption during treadmill testing (n = 4 each), mitochondrial content (0.83 ± 0.20, n = 5 vs. 0.71 ± 0.03 µg/mg tissue, n = 6, P = NS), and respiratory complex expression normalized to GAPDH in gastrocnemius muscle homogenates (0.64 ± 0.06 vs. 0.60 ± 0.02 for CII, 0.53 ± 0.04 vs. 0.57 ± 0.04 for CIII, 1.35 ± 0.08 vs. 1.36 ± 0.04 for CIV, 0.97 ± 0.07 vs. 0.86 ± 0.03 for CVI, n = 4 each, all P = NS) were not significantly different for sedentary WT vs. Ostn-KO mice, respectively, whereas SDH-positive staining of tibialis anterior cross-sections (45.33 ± 0.40 vs. 41.12 ± 1.24%, n = 3 each, *P less_than 0.05) exhibited a smaller difference than that in exercise-trained WT vs. Ostn-KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pattern of distribution of fiber types from muscles of sedentary WT and Ostn-KO were similar to those of their exercise-trained counterparts, consistent with a slower adaptation of fiber type to exercise, except that there was a slightly more prominent component of type IIA fibers in exercised mice (Fig S6; n = 4 each for tibialis anterior and n = 3 each for biceps femoris, *P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address the hypothesis that observed differences in skeletal muscle mitochondrial content of Ostn-KO vs. WT mice are driven by cGMP/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1- (PGC1-) signaling, we examined their tibialis anterior and found that, despite similar PGC1- levels at baseline, (1.729 ± 0.44 vs. 1.125 ±0.1 AU, respectively, n = 5 and 7, P = NS) an exercise-related increase in PGC1- over this baseline was significantly smaller in Ostn-KO than in WT mice (13.0 ± 0.1% vs. 119.7 ± 29.9% increase respectively, n = 3 each, P less_than 0.05; Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a primary myoblast culture model, induction of cGMP by the combination of musclin and ANP (Fig 5C) was associated with a significant increase in mRNA of PGC1- (Fig 5E) and its downstream targets linked to mitochondrial biogenesis, TFAM, NRF1, and NRF2 (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These data indicate that exercise tolerance is influenced by musclin via an effect on ANP-dependent PGC1- regulation of skeletal muscle activity-related mitochondrial biogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study establishes that production of the peptide musclin is up-regulated in skeletal muscle in response to physical activity and that musclin is secreted into the systemic circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of musclin signaling in Ostn-KO mice is associated with reduced oxidative phosphorylation potential and exercise tolerance that is corrected by musclin-replacement therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate a previously unrecognized pathway for skeletal muscle metabolic adaptation to exercise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we use forced treadmill exercise to demonstrate the responsiveness of musclin production and secretion to exercise, we found a phenotype of decreased endurance and trends toward lower mitochondrial content and higher presence of IIA glycolytic fibers, even in untrained Ostn-KO mice compared with WT controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these observed trends and changes in sedentary Ostn-KO became much more obvious and significant after exposure to the treadmill exercise protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret these findings to indicate that musclin production and secretion, although more easily demonstrated in response to vigorous exercise, is physiologically relevant, even for routine daily activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data support the hypothesis that musclin modulates effects of cardiac NPs due to its ability to interfere with binding to NPRC (8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we demonstrate that musclin itself does not induce cGMP production in primary myoblasts, but, rather, potentiates ANP effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we confirm the significance of this signaling in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we demonstrate that WT mice have significantly higher muscle levels of cGMP after exposure to exercise compared with Ostn-KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher level of muscle cGMP in WT vs. Ostn-KO mice is paralleled by a trend toward higher-plasma ANP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevation of ANP in plasma after physical activity has traditionally been linked to atrial wall stretch; however, our data suggest that increased production of musclin could also contribute to this phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, it is possible that our measurement does not reach statistical significance due to significant variability of circulating ANP levels and the inability to use mice as their own controls, because the volume of plasma needed for testing precludes more than a single terminal blood draw per mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We detected an order-of-magnitude lower production of musclin in the bone of our adult mice compared with that from skeletal muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with original reports that indicate that high musclin expression during early bone development sharply declines in a time- and maturity-dependent manner in both mice (5) and humans (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in contrast to skeletal muscle, no exercise-responsive increase in mRNA levels of musclin was observed in bones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it seems likely that the elevated systemic circulating musclin levels after exercise are largely supported by augmented production and secretion by skeletal muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identification of the exercise-responsive nature of musclin signaling, along with its systemic circulation, has important implications for our understanding of exercise-dependent NP signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cardiac NPs are increasingly recognized as hormones with a wide spectrum of targets: In addition to traditional targets of vasculature and kidney, recently their effects on skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, angiogenesis, lipolysis, and adipose tissue remodeling (browning) have been reported (2729, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the present study focuses on one aspect of this signaling network, intramuscular cGMP signaling and mitochondrial biogenesis, it is possible that other cardiac NP signaling targets are similarly affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, musclin may be at least partially responsible for the beneficial effect of exercise on cardiac remodeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such targets should be the subject of future investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
cGMP signaling has been linked to PGC1-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis in many studies in different tissues and organs (3335).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cGMP production in skeletal muscles is typically linked to nitric oxide signaling (3436), although recently a role for NPs in this process has been established (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support the importance NP signaling and its regulation by musclin in cGMP/PGC1-driven mitochondrial biogenesis: We confirm significantly greater mitochondrial quantity and function by multiple methods and demonstrate the in vivo functional importance by revealing a meaningful increase in the VO2max, a parameter that reflects many factors, including oxidative phosphorylation potential and cardiovascular and pulmonary functions critical for physical endurance, of mice with intact vs. disrupted musclin signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, our demonstration that musclin infusion rescues exercise and oxidative capacity in Ostn-KO mice, as well as enhances exercise and oxidative capacity in untrained WT mice, suggests a potential therapeutic role for musclin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of musclin in chondrocytes has been linked to abnormal skeletal growth (9), but such changes may or may not occur with systemically delivered musclin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to better understand musclins therapeutic potential, further studies will be required to determine the extent and durability of beneficial effects and whether there are accompanying long-term deleterious consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such studies may be aided by conditional models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, this study defines musclin as an exercise-responsive factor promoting skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and exercise endurance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Vector construction and targeted knockout strategy were designed together with genOway, where mice were generated based on deletion of a 2.1-kb sequence flanking Ostn exon 2, resulting in inactivation of the ATG and signal peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homology sequences were cloned from murine genomic DNA as three independent fragments by PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first pair of primers (sense: 5-ATG TTA CAG AAC ATT TGA TCC ATT ACG ACA-3; antisense: 5-TGC ACT TCA CAT TAA AAA TTC TTC ACT GC-3) amplified the 3,341-bp fragment containing the exon 2 upstream sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This subclone was used to generate the distal part of the long homology arm of the targeting vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second pair of primers (sense: 5-TAG TAT GCC ATG GTA TTT GTG CTG TGG G-3; antisense: 5-TGC TGG TTA CTT TCT CTT CAA GGG CAG-3) amplified the 2,131-bp fragment containing the exon 2 and neighboring intronic sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This subclone was used to generate the proximal part of the long homology arm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third set of primers (sense: 5-TTG ATT TGT ACC TAC CTT GGT GCC TGC-3; antisense: 5-ACC CAT CAC ATA CAC ACT GCC TTT ACC TAC-3) amplified the 2,465-bp fragment containing the exon 2 downstream sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This subclone was used to generate the short homology arm of the targeting vector and to generate a positive control vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplifications were performed with 1520 PCR cycles with proofreading thermostable Taq polymerase (Accuprime Taq DNA polymerase high fidelity; Invitrogen) using genomic C57BL/6 embryonic stem (ES) cell DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resulting PCR products were subcloned into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) via TA-cloning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing of the isolated distal long homology arm region resulted in one clone with only a single mutation in the amplified region that was subsequently corrected before vector construction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing of the isolated proximal long homology arm region and the isolated short homology arm region identified clones without mutation that were used for vector construction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target vector and a positive control vector were generated with each individual cloning step validated through restriction analysis and partial sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target vector contained two inserted loxP sites flanking exon 2, the neomycin-positive selection gene flanked by flippase recognition target sites and the presence of diphtheria toxin A as a negative selection marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A robust PCR screening strategy and Southern blot for detection of homologous recombination were designed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The targeting vector was linearized by restriction digest with PmeI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting fragment was isolated, purified, and transfected into ES cells according to standard electroporation procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive selection was started 48 h after electroporation by addition of 200 µg/mL of G418 (Life Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 178 clones were isolated, amplified, and screened by PCR to verify homologous recombination at the 3 end of the Ostn locus (sense: 5-GAA CTT CCT GAC TAG GGG AGG AGT AGA AGG-3; antisense: 5-CTC TTC TCT GGC TGT GGG TGG AGA C-3) with the expected amplified product size of 2,159 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eighteen clones recombined at the 3 end of the Ostn locus were analyzed by a second PCR to test for insertion of the distal loxP site at the 5 end of the locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 18 tested ES cell clones, 3 were positive for the presence of the distal loxP site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 3 recombined clones were further verified by Southern blot analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombined ES cells were injected into albino C57BL/6 blastocysts, giving rise to two highly chimeric males ( greater than 50%) identified by coat color markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These male mice were bred with C57BL/6 Cre recombinase expressing deleter mice to excise the loxP-flanked sequence and generate heterozygous mice carrying the constitutive knock-out allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping by PCR of pups derived from F1 breeding allowed identification of a pup with complete heterozygous Cre-mediated excision of Ostn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second breeding of this male with C57BL/6 WT females allowed the generation of additional heterozygous mice with complete Cre-mediated excision of Ostn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockout and WT alleles were further verified by Southern blot in these animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ostn+/ mice were used to generate Ostn/ (Ostn-KO) and WT controls through further breeding cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genotyping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genotyping was performed on tail tip DNA extracted with the Dneasy Blood and Tissu Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR was performed by using Platinum Blue PCR Supermix (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect the amplification product of the knockout allele of 2,395 bp and the WT allele of 4,420 bp, the following primers were used: forward: 5-GTG AGG TTA TGA ACA TTC CAA CAG CTA TAT CC-3; and reverse: 5-ATG GGG TTA TTT TCC TTG TCC ACC TAC C-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Akt1-KO_Mouse_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Akt1-KO mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Animal_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All animal protocols conform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (37) generated by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, National Research Council of the National Academies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal protocols were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ostn-KO and littermate C57BL/6 WT control mice or Akt1-KO (Jackson Laboratory), 78 wk old, of either gender, were used for all experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all experiments, mice were anesthetized with inhaled isoflurane (5% induction, 11.5% maintenance; Piramal Healthcare) to maintain a respiratory rate of 5060 breaths per minute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Skeletal_reconstruction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microcomputed tomography (CT) images of the mice were acquired with the Siemen's Inveon PET/CT scanner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CT parameters for acquisition were as follows: voltage of 80 kV and tube current of 500 µA, 220 rotation degrees with 360 steps, medium-resolution magnification, and a binning of 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Projections were reconstructed into images by using the manufacturer's software with a downsample factor of 1, beam hardening correction, bilinear interpolation, and SheppLogan reconstruction filter (ultimate image pixel size of 36.15 µm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were analyzed by using ImageJ (Version 1.50b) with the BoneJ (Version 1.3.12) plugin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Femurs and tibia were cropped and rotated to measure length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only cortical bone was measured for thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For femurs, a 0.54-mm section of bone was measured 3.6 mm from femoral distal growth plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For tibias, a 0.54-mm section of bone was measured 3.6 mm from the tibial proximal growth plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were converted to binary images automatically by using the BoneJ plugin and then measured for thickness with the plugins Thickness tool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, 3D images were created by using the Inveon Research Workplace (Version 4.2) multimodal 3D visualization software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Histology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Muscles were dissected from anesthetized mice, embedded in OCT compound, and frozen in 2-methylbutane precooled at 165 °C in liquid nitrogen (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Muscles were stored at 80 °C until used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For histology, 10-µm cross-sections, cut using a Microm cryostat, cooled to 20 °C, were mounted on positively charged slides (Superfrost/Plus; Fisher Scientific) and stored at 80 °C until used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transmission_Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Muscles were fixed in 2.5% (vol/vol) glutaraldehyde and 0.1 M Na+ cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, overnight at 4 °C, followed by three 20-min washes in the same, fixed in 4% (wt/vol) OsO4, washed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, then dH2O, followed by 2.5% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A series of ethanol washes was used to dehydrate the sample, which was then exchanged with an ethanol and Spurrs mixture series of increasing Spurrs concentration, culminating in a final solution of 100% Spurrs resin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Muscles were embedded in Spurrs resin at 60 °C for 2448 h. Ultramicrotomy was carried out at 90 nm, and samples were collected on 200 mesh formvard grids for staining with uranyl and lead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stained sections were examined with a JEOL JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope, and digital images were collected with a Gatan UltraScan 1000 2k × 2k CCD camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons between two groups were made using the two-sided Student's t test and between more than two groups using analysis of variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A P value less_than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sigma Plot 11 was used for all statistical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
