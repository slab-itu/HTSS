Inhibition of 910 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors prevents chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study addresses the need to phase out opioids as the major analgesic drugs for moderate to severe chronic pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We establish that a highly selective and potent inhibitor of the 910 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtype prevents the expression of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, selective antagonists of the 910 nAChR are potential leads for nonopioid analgesic drug development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of inhibitors of the 910 receptor, together with genetic studies, suggest a key role for the 910 nAChR subtype in an intercellular signaling network that can be activated by diverse insults (e.g., chemotherapy, nerve injury, and diabetes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Opioids are first-line drugs for moderate to severe acute pain and cancer pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these medications are associated with severe side effects, and whether they are efficacious in treatment of chronic nonmalignant pain remains controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Medications that act through alternative molecular mechanisms are critically needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antagonists of 910 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been proposed as an important nonopioid mechanism based on studies demonstrating prevention of neuropathology after trauma-induced nerve injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the key 910 ligands characterized to date are at least two orders of magnitude less potent on human vs. rodent nAChRs, limiting their translational application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, an alternative proposal that these ligands achieve their beneficial effects by acting as agonists of GABAB receptors has caused confusion over whether blockade of 910 nAChRs is the fundamental underlying mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these issues definitively, we developed RgIA4, a peptide that exhibits high potency for both human and rodent 910 nAChRs, and was at least 1,000-fold more selective for 910 nAChRs vs. all other molecular targets tested, including opioid and GABAB receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A daily s.c. dose of RgIA4 prevented chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain in rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild-type mice, oxaliplatin treatment produced cold allodynia that could be prevented by RgIA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, in 9 KO mice, chemotherapy-induced development of cold allodynia was attenuated and the milder, temporary cold allodynia was not relieved by RgIA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings establish blockade of 9-containing nAChRs as the basis for the efficacy of RgIA4, and that 9-containing nAChRs are a critical target for prevention of chronic cancer chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Development_of_RgIA4__an_Analog_of_-Conotoxin_RgIA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have carried out a broad program to identify and develop peptides that target 910 nAChRs, and five diverse structural families of conotoxins that inhibit 910 receptors have been characterized (2025).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two -conotoxins from cone snail venoms, Vc1.1 and RgIA, are particularly promising in terms of their analgesic properties and the prevention of neuropathology; however, as detailed in the Introduction, these peptides exhibited a striking decline in affinity for the human receptor compared with the rodent 910 nAChR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weak affinity of Vc1.1 for the human receptor is likely responsible for the failure of phase II human clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore sought to develop analogs that had high affinity and selectivity for the human 910 nAChR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our approach was to assess the structure activity relationships of a small library of mutant -conotoxins that were produced by chemical synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We systematically mutated non-Cys residues of RgIA, the smallest of the 910 nAChR-targeted conotoxins, and we found that residues in both the first and second disulfide loops of RgIA could be changed to shift potency favorably (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining these mutations to create second-generation analogs, 13 amino acid peptides were generated that, unlike the native RgIA, had high affinity for the human 910 nAChR (Fig 2 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parent peptide, RgIA, produced only partial blockade of the human 910 nAChR at concentrations up to 33 M. In contrast, analogs RgIA4 and RgIA5 produced complete blockade of the nAChR with low nanomolar potencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although RgIA4 was not the most potent analog identified, it was the most selective for the human 910 nAChR (Fig S1 and Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we selected peptides that retained high affinity and selectivity for the rat 910 nAChR (Table 1) to facilitate mechanistic studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RgIA4 was the most selective of these analogs, and when further tested against opioid receptor subtypes and a broad panel of other receptors and ion channels, micromolar levels of the peptide showed low or no activity as summarized in Tables 3 and 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the RgIA4 peptide was tested on the GABAB receptor using three different assays, it elicited no activity; these results are shown in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, RgIA4 is 1,000- to 10,000-fold selective for the 910 nAChR compared with all other tested receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RgIA4_Relieves_Chemotherapy-Induced_Neuropathic_Pain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oxaliplatin is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent used to treat colorectal cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, side effects include neurotoxicity, and prominent symptoms of acute neuropathy include sensitivity to touching cold items, discomfort in swallowing cold items, throat discomfort, and muscle cramps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cold-related sensitivity is rated as the most severe symptom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathic pain in rats is a commonly used model of human chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assessed the pain-relieving effects of RgIA4, which potently blocks 910 nAChRs but lacks activity on GABAB receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxaliplatin administration in rats produced cold allodynia (i.e., pain due to a cold stimulus that does not usually provoke pain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated daily s.c. injections (5 d each week) of RgIA4 at doses of 0.12880 g/kg prevented chemotherapy-induced cold allodynia; assessments were performed 24 h after the last RgIA4 dose on days 8, 15, and 22 (P less_than 0.01 for all measures; Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated oxaliplatin administration in rats also induced a low pain threshold in response to mechanical noxious stimuli (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration of RgIA4 (0.12880 g/kg) prevented mechanical hypersensitivity at 30 min and 24 h post-RgIA4 dosing at all concentrations tested (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No behavioral, neurological, or autonomic effects were observed in rats administered RgIA4 (100 g/kg) daily for 21 d or in rats administered a single dose of RgIA4 (5 mg/kg) (Tables S1S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_Wild-Type_and_9_nAChR_KO_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the role of 9-containing nAChRs for chemotherapy-induced cold allodynia and RgIA4-mediated pain relief further, we compared wild-type and 9 nAChR KO mice using the oxaliplatin model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four groups of mice were treated daily (5 d each week) with (i) vehicle (i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  + vehicle (s.c.), (ii) vehicle (i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  + RgIA4 (40 g/kg s.c.), (iii) oxaliplatin (i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  + vehicle (s.c.), or (iv) oxaliplatin (i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  + RgIA4 (s.c.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were assessed for oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia using a cold-plate test on day 1 and again on days 8, 15, and 22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first group of animals, mice were assessed 30 min and 24 h after the last injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 30 min after injection, oxaliplatin-treated wild-type mice differed significantly in paw withdrawal latency from vehicle-injected controls on day 15 (P less_than 0.001) and day 22 (P less_than 0.001) (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 30 min after the last injection, oxaliplatin-treated 9 KO mice did not differ significantly from vehicle-injected 9 KO controls on any given day (P  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 24 h after the last injection, oxaliplatin-treated wild-type and 9 KO mice both differed significantly from vehicle-treated controls on day 22 (P less_than 0.001 for wild-type mice and P less_than 0.01 for 9 KO mice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the second group of animals, mice were assessed 72 h after the last injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 72 h after the last oxaliplatin injection, oxaliplatin-treated wild-type mice significantly differed in paw withdrawal latency from vehicle-treated controls on all test days: day 8 (P less_than 0.05), day 15 (P less_than 0.05), and day 22 (P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, oxaliplatin-treated 9 KO mice did not differ from vehicle-treated control mice on any treatment day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the data suggest that compared with wild-type mice, 9 KO mice do not develop chronic cold allodynia in response to oxaliplatin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also compared the effects of oxaliplatin treatment in wild-type and 9 KO mice that had been treated with RgIA4 (40 g/kg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When measured at 30 min or 24 h after the last injection, RgIA4 reversed oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia in wild-type mice by day 22 (P less_than 0.001 at both time points) (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When measured at 72 h after the last injection, RgIA4 reversed oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia in wild-type mice by day 15 (P less_than 0.05) and on day 22 (P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, RgIA4 did not have a significant effect on the attenuated oxaliplatin-induced cold allodynia in 9 KO mice at any time point on any test day (all days, P  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, daily s.c. injection of RgIA4 prevented chemotherapy-induced cold allodynia in wild-type mice but not the transient and attenuated cold allodynia in 9 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of this study demonstrate that the 910 nAChR is a valid molecular target for drug development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a chemotherapy-induced animal model of pain, we have shown that when 910 nAChR function is inhibited, either by pharmacological manipulation or by genetic manipulation, the expression of neuropathic pain is attenuated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We eliminated 910 nAChR function genetically using 9 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pharmacological blocker developed for this study was RgIA4, an analog of -conotoxin RgIA, a native peptide expressed in cone snail venom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analog has been extensively characterized: It has high affinity for both rodent and human 910 nAChRs (in contrast to the native venom peptide, which has low affinity for the human receptor), and is highly selective (103-fold) for the 910 nAChRs vs. all other tested receptors, including opioid and GABAB receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The well-characterized rodent model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy was used to assess the effects of blockade of 910 nAChRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxaliplatin is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for colorectal cancer and also is used to treat pancreatic, gastric, and testicular cancers (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is an organoplatinum complex that is thought to produce cytotoxicity via the formation of DNA adducts that interfere with DNA replication and transcription, leading to the induction of apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurotoxicity is dose-dependent, and symptoms (typically, increased sensitivity to cold) often continue to worsen for several months after completing chemotherapy, suggesting an ongoing disease process (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are currently no agents approved for prevention of the chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, often leaving clinicians to decrease the dose or duration of the medication treatment, thus diminishing the effectiveness of the intended cancer therapy (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of the present study establish a key role for the 910 nAChR in the progression of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion is illustrated in Fig 5, which summarizes the 72-h time points obtained in the experiment with wild-type and 9-KO mice described in Results (also Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that oxaliplatin produces an increasing severity of cold sensitivity, similar to the syndrome observed in human chemotherapy patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cold allodynia, assessed in rodents by paw withdrawal latency, becomes more intense with successive doses of oxaliplatin; in contrast, the cold allodynia is not observed if RgIA4 is injected concurrently with oxaliplatin administration or if the experiment is carried out on 9 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The extended duration (2472 h) of efficacy of RgIA4 in the rodent model is remarkable, in that RgIA4 is rapidly metabolized in vivo; the plasma half-life in rodents is less than 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  * The analgesia data shown in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 5 are 24-h and 72-h points, respectively; the lack of detectable cold allodynia suggests that application of RgIA4 may have disease-modifying effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the high specificity of RgIA4 for the 910 nAChR, it is reasonable to conclude that the absence of cold allodynia is a direct consequence of 910 nAChR inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results obtained using 9 KO mice are consistent with this mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this nAChR subtype appears to play a key signaling role in preventing a pathological pain state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Blockade of the 910 nAChR did not appear to be analgesic per se (i.e., the baseline thresholds were not elevated).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the utility of the mechanism of action is appropriate for prevention of chronic pain, such as in cancer chemotherapy and, as detailed in a previous study, in prevention of development of trauma-induced neuropathic pain (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, acute pain (e.g., acute surgical pain) may not be affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, single doses of other conotoxins that block 910 nAChRs produce analgesia in models of established neuropathic pain, including CCI and partial sciatic nerve ligation, suggesting that this mechanism may also have utility in these settings (8, 9, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The occurrence of a species affinity gap between homologous human and rodent molecular targets is a potentially important general issue in drug development, particularly if the molecular target has not been identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preclinical pain studies are most often carried out on rodent models, and a large affinity gap could lead to failure to demonstrate efficacy in human clinical trials (such as was observed for Vc1.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the present studies, -conotoxin RgIA, a venom peptide from C. regius, was used as a template for engineering highly selective peptide antagonists of 910 nAChRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final analog, RgIA4, has high affinity (low nanomolar) for both the human and rodent 910 nAChR; RgIA4 retains high selectivity, with no activity detected on the GABAB receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low affinity for the rodent receptor can also be problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lead compounds with high affinity only for human transient receptor potential (TRP) channels were abandoned as analgesic drug leads because the low affinity for rodent TRP channels precluded validation using animal models of pain (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the -conotoxin RgIA analogs developed in the current study have high affinity for both human and rodent 910 nAChRs, they are useful both for mechanistic studies using rodent models of pain as well as for potential drug leads for human therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific peptide chosen for the animal studies, although not the most potent analog on the human receptor, was the most selective, and was therefore suitable for assessing the role of 910 nAChRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach we used to obtain selective analogs of native RgIA that also addressed the affinity gap between rodent and human 910 nAChRs provides a paradigm that should be generally applicable whenever species-specific differences in affinity exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 910 nAChR represents a mechanistically distinctive target for modifying the disease course of chronic pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presently available pain medications act on a limited number of pharmacological targets that treat, but do not prevent, disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Commonly used medications include opioids, COX inhibitors, N-type CaV channel blockers, and catecholamine reuptake inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these medications generally provides only partial pain relief.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For treatment of severe chronic pain, medications from multiple classes are often required, and despite combination therapy, millions of patients worldwide are left to suffer from treatment-resistant symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas morphine and opioid derivatives are the gold standard for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain, long-term use is problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Opioid tolerance rapidly develops, leading to the need for dose increases to obtain the same analgesic effect (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RgIA4 lacks activity at opioid receptors, and multiple doses of RgIA4, rather than causing tolerance, produced gradual and sustained pain relief.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the short course of treatment produces permanent beneficial effects requires further study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conus venoms have been a rich source of peptides that target neuronal receptors and ion channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -conotoxin MVIIA (ziconotide) from the fish-eating Conus magus was approved for treatment-refractory severe chronic pain, such as in patients with cancer or AIDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ziconotide is a positively charged peptide that does not readily cross the bloodbrain barrier and, consequently, must be delivered intrathecally to produce its centrally acting effects (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RgIA4 differs substantially from -conotoxin MVIIA in structure (two vs. three disulfide loops), function (nAChR antagonist vs. CaV channel antagonist), effective route of administration (s.c. vs. intrathecal), and side-effect profile (no neurological effects in Irwin testing for RgIA4 vs. 25% or more of patients receiving ziconotide reporting dizziness, nausea, confusion, somnolence, or nystagmus) (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pathophysiology of oxaliplatin-induced chronic pain remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T cells and macrophages infiltrate damaged neuronal tissue, and neuroimmune-mediated mechanisms may play a role in disease progression (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the tissue target of RgIA4 is unknown, it is noteworthy that the parent compound, RgIA, reduces neural immune cell accumulation (T cells, macrophages, and acetylcholine-synthesizing lymphocytes) after CCI (9, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 9 and 10 subunit transcripts have been identified in immune cells, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also recently been shown that functional 910 nAChRs regulate ATP-dependent cytokine release in monocytes (37) and that 9-containing nAChRs modify the function of proinflammatory monocytes (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 9-containing nAChRs also modulate the influx of monocytes and neutrophils in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a murine model of multiple sclerosis (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that the restorative properties of RgIA4 are related to neuroprotective modulation of immune function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An additional indication that inhibition of 910 nAChRs may be disease-modifying comes from studies of the parent compound, RgIA, in rats that have undergone CCI of the sciatic nerve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphological analysis indicates that RgIA administration prevents CCI-induced decreases of axon diameter, loss of myelin sheath, and decreases in fiber number (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, CCI causes secondary pathological changes along the ascending pain pathway, including edema and infiltration of macrophages in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and activation of microglia and astrocytes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RgIA administration also prevents these ascending pathway pathologies, indicating protective effects against disease progression (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, another conotoxin that preferentially inhibits the 910 receptor, Vc1.1, was previously shown (41) to prevent neuropathic pain in a rodent model of diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, chronic neuropathic pain is a highly prevalent complication of diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Established neuropathy is irreversible, even after subsequent improvements in metabolic parameters (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the analgesic effects of Vc1.1 persisted for 10 d after cessation of Vc1.1 administration, consistent with a disease-modifying effect (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus, compounds that have a pharmacological profile that includes 910 antagonist activity prevent or attenuate the expression of pain in several rodent models, including neuropathic pain induced by chemotherapy, traumatic nerve injury, or diabetes (8, 13, 35, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of the present study establish that it is the blockade of the 910 nAChR that enables the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings strongly suggest that there is a common molecular pathway involved in the expression of pain following a diverse array of triggering insults, a pathway that apparently includes signaling via 910 nAChRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conotoxin_Synthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
-Conotoxins were synthesized using an AAPPTec Apex 396 automated peptide synthesizer as previously described (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peptide masses were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two-Electrode_Voltage-Clamp_Recording  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Xenopus laevis oocytes were used to express cloned rat or human nAChR subtypes heterologously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were made 15 d postinjection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oocytes were voltage-clamped at 70 mV at room temperature and exposed to acetylcholine, RgIA, or analogs as described previously (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Receptor_Pharmacology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synthetic RgIA4 was tested on non-nAChRs by the National Institute of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program using previously described methods (4648).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds were initially tested in quadruplicate at 10 M in primary binding assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds that blocked more than 50% of the radioligand binding were then tested in secondary binding assays to determine a concentrationresponse curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patch-clamp electrophysiology was used for assessing the human ether-a-go-gorelated gene (hERG) function (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gi-coupled cAMP modulation was assessed in CHO-K1 cells expressing GABAB1a/B2 with Gi/o coupling; assays were performed by DiscoverX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds were incubated with cells for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 15 M forskolin, and cellular cAMP was detected using the HitHunter cAMP XS assay detection method according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effects were calculated as a percentage of maximal GABA effect (GABA EC50 = 188 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values were obtained in duplicate, and the experiment was repeated once.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a separate experiment, cellular dialectric spectroscopy (49) was used to assay changes in electrical impedance in CHO cells expressing human GABAB1a/B2 (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values were obtained in duplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assay was performed by Eurofins Cerep according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compounds were incubated with cells for 10 min at 28 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular agonist effect was calculated as a percentage of 100 M 3-aminopropyl(methyl)phosphinic acid agonist control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experimental procedures on animals were performed in accordance with the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and were performed under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees' approved protocols at the University of Utah, University of Florence, A. T. Still University Kirksville College of Osteopathic Medicine, or Kineta, Inc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male or female SpragueDawley rats, weighing 200250 g at the beginning of the experimental procedures, were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild-type mice were CBA/CaJ (The Jackson Laboratory).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Germline 9 KO mice (28), originally on a 129Sv/Ev and CBA/CaJ background, were crossed using an accelerated backcrossing program (The Jackson Laboratory) until 99.5% identity with wild-type CBA/CaJ mice was achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were then further backcrossed with wild-type CBA/CAJ mice for an additional three generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments involving animals have been reported according to Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Irwin_Test  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A modified Irwin screen was used to test the potential adverse behavioral, neurological, and autonomic effects of RgIA4 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Groups of two to three rats (Charles River Laboratories) were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two independent blinded studies were conducted, each with a different route of administration, RgIA4 concentration, adverse effect readouts, and times of assessments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one study, RgIA4 was administered s.c. at a concentration of 5 mg/kg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observations were conducted at 0, 0.25, and 2 h postdosing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a second study, RgIA4 was administered i.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for 14 d at a concentration of 100 g/kg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observations were conducted daily at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 24 h postdosing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sign or effect was noted either for its presence or absence, or was assigned a score ranging from 0 to 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scoring scheme, 0 represents no visible change, whereas 1 represents mild changes and 3 represents marked changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animals were also observed for vehicle- or compound-induced mortality during the observation period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Voltage-Dependent_Calcium_Current_Recording_in_Rat_DRG_Neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
L4 and L5 DRG neurons were isolated from SpragueDawley rats, enzymatically dissociated, plated onto polylysine-coated glass coverslips, and maintained overnight at 37 °C in a 5% (vol/vol) CO2 incubator in minimum essential media with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DRG neurons were recorded in a solution containing 145 mM N-methyl-d-glucosamine (NMG)Cl, 5 mM BaCl2, 10 mM NaHepes, and 5 mM glucose, with pH 7.4 and osmolarity of 320 mOsm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pipet solution contained 104 mM NMGCl, 14 mM creatinePO4, 6 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NMGHepes, 5 mM TrisATP, 10 mM NMG2EGTA, and 0.3 mM Tris2GTP with pH 7.4 and osmolarity of 300 mOsm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Test solutions were applied, and ionic currents were recorded and analyzed as previously described (24, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were carried out at room temperature, and the holding potential was 80 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Group data were calculated as the mean ± SD, and Students t test was used to determine significant differences (P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Oxaliplatin-Induced_Neuropathic_Pain_in_Rats  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neuropathy in rats (Harlan) was induced as described by Cavaletti et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, rats were treated with 2.4 mg/kg i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oxaliplatin (Sequoia Research Products) for 5 consecutive days every week for 3 wk (15 i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injections).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the study period, experimenters were blinded as to the identity of the injected compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA using Dunnetts multiple comparison test (GraphPad Prism).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Rat_Cold_Plate_Test  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As previously described (55), rats were placed in a stainless steel box (12 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm) with a cold plate as the floor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature of the cold plate was kept constant at 4 ± 1 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pain-related behaviors (i.e., lifting and licking of the hind paw) were observed, and the time of the first sign was recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cutoff time of the latency of paw lifting or licking was set at 60 s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The nociceptive threshold in the rat was determined with an analgesimeter (Ugo Basile) as previously described (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, a constantly increasing pressure was applied to a small area of the dorsal surface of the hind paw using a blunt conical probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanical pressure was increased until vocalization or a withdrawal reflex occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vocalization or withdrawal reflex thresholds were expressed in grams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analgesia measures, mechanical pressure application was stopped at 120 g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Oxaliplatin-Induced_Neuropathic_Pain_in_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Oxaliplatin (MedChem Express) was dissolved at 0.6 g/L in 0.9% NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RgIA4 was dissolved at 0.01 g/L in 0.9% NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each experiment, mice were divided into four equally sized groups (n = 79 animals) and injected with saline (i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  + saline (s.c.), saline (i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  + RgIA4 (40 g/kg, s.c.), oxaliplatin (2.4 mg/kg i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  + saline (s.c.), or oxaliplatin (2.4 mg/kg, i.p.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  + RgIA4 (40 g/kg, s.c.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first study, mice were injected once per day on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and again on Monday and Tuesday.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Wednesday, mice were tested before injection (24-h time point) and 30 min after injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern was repeated for an additional 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second set of experiments, mice were injected once per day on Monday through Friday and tested on Monday before injection (72-h time point).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern was repeated for an additional 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For mice, testing was conducted using a cold-plate test chamber (IITC, Inc. Life Science).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were allowed to acclimate in the chamber at room temperature (23 °C) for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature was then lowered at a rate of 10 °C per minute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The testing was stopped when the animal lifted both forepaws and shaking or licking occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternating lifting of forepaws was not scored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Throughout the study period, experimenters were blinded as to the identity of the injected compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA using Dunnetts multiple comparison test (GraphPad Prism).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
