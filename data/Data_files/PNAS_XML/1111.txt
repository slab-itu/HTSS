Brain-to-brain coupling during handholding is associated with pain reduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanisms that underlie social touch analgesia are largely unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we apply a hyperscanning approach with real-life interaction of dyads to examine the association between brain-to-brain coupling and pain relief.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings indicate that hand-holding during pain increases the brain-to-brain coupling network that correlates with the magnitude of the analgesia and the observers empathic accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings make a unique contribution to our understanding of physiological mechanisms of touch-related analgesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mechanisms underlying analgesia related to social touch are not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While recent research highlights the role of the empathy of the observer to pain relief in the target, the contribution of social interaction to analgesia is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current study examines brain-to-brain coupling during pain with interpersonal touch and tests the involvement of interbrain synchrony in pain alleviation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Romantic partners were assigned the roles of target (pain receiver) and observer (pain observer) under painno-pain and touchno-touch conditions concurrent with EEG recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain-to-brain coupling in alphamu band (812 Hz) was estimated by a three-step multilevel analysis procedure based on running window circular correlation coefficient and post hoc power of the findings was calculated using simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings indicate that hand-holding during pain administration increases brain-to-brain coupling in a network that mainly involves the central regions of the pain target and the right hemisphere of the pain observer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, brain-to-brain coupling in this network was found to correlate with analgesia magnitude and observers empathic accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that brain-to-brain coupling may be involved in touch-related analgesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Behavioral_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Empathic accuracy in the partner touchpain [mean (M) = 0.24, SD = 0.27] condition was higher than in the no-touchpain (M = 0.41, SD = 0.50) condition (Mdiff = 0.17 [0.07, 0.27], P = 0.003), indicating that touch increases empathic accuracy between the partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratings of the target of pain in the partner touchpain [M = 25.03, SD = 20.32] condition were significantly lower than in the partner no-touchpain (M = 37.74, SD = 24.82) condition (Mdiff = 12.71 [1.97, 23.45], P = 0.021) and in the pain-alone (M = 52.41, SD = 29.41) condition (Mdiff = 27.38 [16.21, 38.53], P less_than 0.001), confirming that touch had an analgesic effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Alpha_Band__Interbrain_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the first stage of the analysis, we filtered out electrode combinations with null effect, that is, electrode pairs with zero interpersonal coupling in all conditions of interest (partner touchno-pain, partner no-touchno-pain, partner touchpain, and partner no-touchpain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed 63 combinations of interbrain electrodes where the coupling in at least one of the conditions of interest exceeded the baseline no-pain-alone condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed findings are shown in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 AC depict the interbrain coupling networks for the second step of the analysis, demonstrating brain-to-brain coupling networks for the conditions of partner touchno-pain, partner no-touchno-pain, and partner no-touchpain compared with the no-pain-alone condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the figures, the no-touchno-pain condition demonstrated an interbrain coupling pattern, mostly between the right parietal regions of the female partner and the right parieto-occipito-temporal areas of the male partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The partner touchno-pain condition showed an interbrain coupling pattern between central regions of the female partner and fronto-central regions of the male partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, the partner no-touchpain condition demonstrated interbrain coupling between the right frontal regions of the female partner and the left central-frontal regions of the male partner, and between the left central-frontal areas of the female partner and the left central-frontal areas of the male partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed findings of step 2, including calculated post hoc power, are given in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our main analysis, depicted in Fig 2D, shows an interbrain coupling network for the partner touchpain condition compared with all of the other conditions (step 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis revealed the largest interpersonal network comprising 22 links, mostly between the left and right central-frontal female regions and the right frontal-parietal-occipital male regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed findings of step 3, including calculated post hoc power, are given in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Alpha_Band__Clustered_Interbrain_Links  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The interpartner links describing the unique interpartner network during pain and touch were clustered using NMF (Statistical Analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, the same links were clustered in the partner no-touchpain condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three-cluster solution showed the best fit in both cases (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Alpha_Band__Correlations_Between_Brain-to-Brain_Coupling_and_the_Behavioral_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cluster 2 showed significant correlation with female pain reduction during touch (r = 0.56 [0.14, 0.81], P = 0.012, power = 0.82) (Fig 4), that is, an increase in interpartner coupling as represented by cluster 2 that is associated with enhancement in touch-related analgesia in the female partner (see Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cluster 1 (r = 0.18 [0.29, 0.59], P = 0.35) and cluster 3 (r = 0.23 [0.25, 0.61], P = 0.45) were not correlated with pain reduction in the female partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in the partner painno-touch conditions, clusters 13 were not correlated with the female partners pain (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Notably, in the paintouch condition, cluster 1 correlated significantly with the empathic accuracy of the partner (r = 0.66 [0.28, 0.86], P = 0.002, power = 0.95), indicating that an increase in interpartner coupling is associated with enhancement of the corresponding empathic accuracy (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cluster 2 (r = 0.23 [0.25, 0.62], P = 0.35) and cluster 3 (r = 0.31 [0.17, 67], P = 0.20) were unrelated to empathic accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in the partner painno-touch conditions clusters 13 were not correlated with empathic accuracy (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Beta-Band_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first step of the algorithm revealed no findings after false-discovery rate (FDR) correction for the beta band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The aim of the present study was to test (i) whether interpersonal touch during pain enhances brain-to-brain real-time coupling between the target of the pain and the observer, and (ii) whether brain-to-brain coupling is associated with touch-related analgesia and with the partners empathic accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with our previous report (64), the behavioral data demonstrated an analgesic effect of partner touch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, all study conditions (i.e., partner touchno-pain, partner no-touchno-pain, partner no-touchpain, and partner touchpain) showed a nonzero pattern of brain-to-brain coupling in the alphamu band only but not in the beta band, indicating that social interactions are associated with brain-to-brain coupling in the alpha band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results cannot be explained by spurious coupling because the interbrain coupling analyses were adjusted for the baseline condition in which we synchronously recorded EEG for the noninteracting partners (49, 80).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the main findings of the study are based on brain-to-brain circular correlation coefficients (CCorrs) that showed the lowest sensitivity to spurious couplings of EEG hyperscanning data (81).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we carried out post hoc power analysis using simulations and found strong support for the validity of our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the touchpain condition, this study was designed with four control conditions, one to rule out suspicious random brain-to-brain coupling (no-pain-alone) and three others: only interpersonal interaction (no-touchno-pain), only touch (touchno-pain), and only pain (no-touchpain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These multiple control conditions were designed to decrease the risk of alternative explanations for our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we found a coupling network in the partner touchpain condition above and beyond all other conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This network consisted of coupling between the central regions of the female partners brains and mainly the right hemisphere of the male partners brains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the coupling observed in the other three conditions (i.e., partner touchno-pain, partner no-touchno-pain, and partner no-touchpain), this coupling pattern is the strongest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the number of links in the coupling network is not necessarily associated with the power of the coupling, the links may represent a secondary marker for the interbrain coupling, providing good simplification of the coupling patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this condition, the target of the pain processes both the pain and the partners touch, resulting in a more widespread interpersonal coupling pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the parietal lobe integrates sensory information of tactile and visual modalities (82), the increased involvement of the observers parietal areas in the coupling may represent multimodal integration of information, ranging from perception of the situation to the empathic reaction via touch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of these findings, tactile-induced analgesia (28) has been found to correlate with activations in brain areas related to multimodal neural activity (83) and emotional processes (8488).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in the partner touchpain condition, the coupling observed near the temporoparietal junction replicates findings from a joint attention paradigm (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous neuroimaging studies showed that the right temporoparietal region is consistently activated in social cognitive processing involving attention orientation, selfother discrimination, and perspective-taking (89, 90).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the target of the pain may also integrate somatosensory information (touch and vicarious pain) that may explain the involvement of central regions in interpersonal coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the coupling in the partner touchpain condition could be a result of integration of sensory information from tactile, visual, and nociceptive inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike the touchpain condition, the no-touchno-pain condition demonstrated a relatively weaker interbrain coupling pattern, mostly between the right parietal regions of the female partner and the right parieto-occipito-temporal areas of the male partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the interpartner brain-to-brain coupling pattern in this control condition may represent a basic interpersonal interaction and therefore may also constitute part of the coupling during pain and touch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the findings of Dumas et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (49) who reported alphamu interpersonal coupling between the model and the imitator during a spontaneous imitation condition mostly between the right centro-parietal regions, both in the model and the imitator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the alphamu band has been associated with the mirror neuron system (91), such activity in the right centro-parietal area has even been proposed as a neuromarker of social coordination (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the simple coupling pattern in the no-touchno-pain condition replicated previous hyperscanning findings of interpersonal cooperation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since this pattern resembles part of the complex network in the partner touchpain condition, it could be assumed that the pain and touch coupling network partially involves the general interpersonal interaction network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this notion, researchers have demonstrated that, in addition to brain coupling, mere copresence can result in autonomic physiological coupling (92, 93).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, although this condition involves seemingly symmetric roles for both the target and the observer, the pattern of interbrain coupling is not entirely symmetric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It involves mostly right centro-parietal regions in both pain target and pain observer; however, the spatial distribution of the interbrain coupling links is higher for the observer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This asymmetric pattern of coupling could be explained by the differential roles of the partners during the interaction, which was based on the initial division into targets and observers at the beginning of the study: (i) The participants may have had different expectations, based on the assigned roles; (ii) pain targets underwent a pain calibration procedure before the main study began.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The partner touchno-pain condition also demonstrated an interbrain coupling pattern that constitutes parts of a partner touchpain coupling network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This network links central regions of the female partner with fronto-central regions of the male partner that are very close to somatosensory regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research indicates that social touch activates somatosensory areas, as expressed in the alphamu band (9496) and the P45 somatosensory-evoked potentials amplitude (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, touch was found to increase the coupling of electrodermal activity, which was found to be correlated with the somatosensory activation (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this interbrain network during the partner touchno-pain condition reflects how social touch increases interpersonal coupling in somatosensory regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The partner no-touchpain condition exhibited the weakest interbrain coupling between the right frontal regions of the female partner and the left central-frontal regions of the male partner, and between the left central-frontal areas of the female partner and the left central-frontal areas of the male partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these findings, frontal alpha modulation correlates with both vicarious pain (97) and empathy for pain (37, 71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, research has repeatedly demonstrated that both pain and empathy for pain activate frontal brain areas (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generally, the obtained patterns exhibited a consistent relationship at both the topographic and the intensity levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the no-touchno-pain condition, the coupling between occipital areas could be explained by resting visual alpha activations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, interpersonal touch results in a shift from occipital to central regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The no-touchpain condition yielded the weakest interbrain coupling, resulting in a pattern that was not additive to other conditions, thus emphasizing the nonlinearity of brain-to-brain coupling patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the pattern of coupling in the no-touchpain condition is in line with previous findings of disruption in autonomic coupling under similar conditions (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with fMRI studies showing that empathy for pain recruits brain structures that are also involved in the firsthand experience of pain (3436), one might argue that, during pain processing, the target is focused on his/her own pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This focus may interfere with brain-to-brain coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if the observers empathy attempts to mirror this state (as shown in previous fMRI results), the lack of touch makes it difficult to synchronize the two states along the EEG scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the observer may express empathy for the partners pain, but without touch this empathy cannot be communicated to the partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in contrast to the notion of common brain activation for pain targets and pain observers, recent studies applying machine-learning techniques have shown that empathy for pain and the experience of pain result in activation of distinct brain pathways (98).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These initial findings are in line with the pattern of brain-to-brain coupling observed in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nonetheless, the partner no-touchpain coupling was related neither to analgesia in the target of pain nor to the partners empathic accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the mere presence of the partner seems to be insufficient for pain reduction (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these findings, a reduction in heart rate and respiration interpersonal coupling has been demonstrated as resulting from pain manipulation without touch (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One possible assumption when comparing pain conditions with and without partners touch is that the analgesic effect of touch can be explained by the well-known effect of distraction (99).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous research has shown that the condition of a strangers touch did not yield an analgesic effect (12, 64), suggesting that touch by itself is not sufficient to induce analgesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in the touch conditions, partners empathy predicted analgesia in the target, indicating that touch can serve as a tool for communicating empathy, as has been shown for different emotions (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, the patterns of interpersonal coupling during partner copresence, touch-only and pain-only conditions may reflect distinct parts of the brain-to-brain coupling found during the partner touchpain condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these three coupling patterns have no shared parts and are correspondently related to brain areas of general cooperation, somatosensory regions and more cognitive areas, thus representing different components of coupling in the partner touchpain condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Notably, we found that the power of partner touchpain coupling is related to the degree of pain analgesia in the target and to the partners empathic accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously demonstrated the existence of such touch-related analgesia that can be predicted by observer empathy (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies have reported correlations between empathy and activations in affective (35, 100103) and sensory (104, 105) parts of the pain matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, P50 amplitude (event-related potential occurring 50 ms after presentation of a stimulus) correlates with the perspective-taking component of empathy during both touch and pain (106).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a touch-related brain-to-brain coupling network during pain may reflect expressions of empathy in the observer and pain analgesia in the target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note that interbrain links related to pain analgesia in the target mostly involved the central zone of the observers brain (represented by cluster 2) close to the somatosensory cortices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the observers empathic accuracy correlated with links that partially involved the observers central zone and right parietal-occipital-temporal zone (cluster 1), which are related to selfother discrimination and the perspective-taking aspect of empathy (89, 90).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analgesic effect of touch may thus be explained by two possible frameworks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that observer touch enhances coupling, which increases the tendency of the target to feel understood, which in turn activates reward mechanisms (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, recent research demonstrated that the reward circuitry is activated when humans experience synchrony (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, brain-to-brain coupling between an observer and a target experiencing pain may be affected by social understanding that can be rewarding and that may result in analgesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, social touch may communicate empathy between target and observer (9) and social understanding may take part in pain management by increasing reward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research supporting this idea has shown that partner touch enhances analgesia and that trait empathy predicts level of analgesia (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another possibility is that interpersonal touch may blur the borders between self and other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple studies have shown similar brain activation for both pain target and observer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, researchers have demonstrated that the perspectives of self and other show similar patterns of physiological activation for painful and pleasurable virtual reality scenarios (107) and of shared brain activations for pleasant and unpleasant touch (108).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, interpersonal touch may increase empathic sharing, assisting the observer in feeling the targets pain as well as in transmitting emotional support to the pain target, resulting in analgesia and expressed in interpersonal physiological coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to note that the intradyadic relationship can play an important role in brain-to-brain coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research has shown that interpersonal coupling between same-sex unrelated dyads is evident when dyads perform a computer-based cooperation task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is diminished in mixed-sex unrelated dyads (109).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent research indicates that a cooperation task between members of romantic dyads elicited increased coupling compared with dyads comprising friends and strangers, and this increased coupling also correlated with their task performance (110).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the directional coupling from females to males differed from that of male-to-female, suggesting different roles for females and males during cooperation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the current study used a controlled design with several balanced conditions, it has several limitations that need to be acknowledged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, only the female participants underwent pain stimulation while the male participants did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the generalizability of our results is restricted to the male-to-female direction, while the opposite direction should be considered with caution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future research is warranted to test the effect of touch and pain in both men and women as well as in homosexual and heterosexual participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, since EEG recordings provide limited precision regarding brain locations, our interpretations regarding the brain locations should be considered with caution and future neuroimaging studies should help reveal more precise locations of the brain-to-brain coupling reported here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we used Ccorr as a measurement of interbrain coupling because it was least sensitive to spurious couplings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, future studies should investigate reference-free measures of coupling (111) for hyperscanning data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, this study does not explain the exact mechanism of interbrain coupling by pain and touch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, causality between touch-related analgesia, partners empathy, and brain-to-brain coupling should be considered with caution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, one might argue that the sound cue that appeared before each condition produced spurious synchronized activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it should be noted that the sound cue served as a signal to the partners regarding when a condition started and was present during all conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although the sound cue may have triggered coupling, it cannot explain the differences between the coupling patterns observed in the different conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings support the theoretical framework of a biopsychosocial model of pain that suggests a dynamic interaction between biological, psychological, and social factors affecting pain perception (40, 112114).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partner touch (social factor) may help in empathy sharing (psychological factor) with the target of the pain, resulting in analgesia and accompanied by interpersonal central neurophysiological coupling (biological factor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To conclude, this study demonstrates that interpersonal coupling plays a key role in analgesia during social touch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast with the traditional approach that examines one part of the interaction, here we investigated neurophysiological response using a paradigm that also considers social contexts and social dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since physiological resonance has important evolutionary significance, investigation of interpersonal coupling provides an interesting opportunity to understand human behavior in a natural social environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The participants were recruited through fliers posted on campus and were informed that they would be participating in a study investigating brain mechanisms of pain perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were given no information regarding the effects of hand-holding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon arrival, the partners were escorted to different rooms and asked not to communicate verbally with each other until the experiment was over.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants then underwent pain familiarization and pain calibration using the pain-60 approach (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was followed by six counterbalanced conditions: no-pain-alone, pain-alone, partner touchno-pain, partner no-touchno-pain, partner touchpain, and partner no-touchpain, with only female participants receiving pain stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The women were asked to rate their pain intensity 2 s before the end of each condition using the numerical pain scale (NPS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concurrently, the male partners were instructed to rate their partners level of pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both partners wrote the number on a small piece of paper not visible to the other member of the couple.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 10-min break separated successive conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The neural activity of both partners was simultaneously recorded with a dual-EEG recording system using a 64-channel Brainamp MR amplifier manufactured by Brain Products GmbH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system was equipped with two Acticap helmets with 32 active electrodes, arranged according to the international 10/20 system and connected to two synchronized amplifiers to guarantee millisecond-range synchrony between the two EEG recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the pain-alone condition, only the female partner was recorded using 32 channels (see details below in Experimental Conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This condition was used as a baseline and for calculation of the analgesic effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signals were analog filtered between 0.16 and 250 Hz, amplified and digitalized at 500 Hz with a 16-bit vertical resolution in the range of ±3.2 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impedances were maintained below 10 k.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiment consisted of six conditions within one session, each lasting 120 s. The pain-alone condition included pain stimulation applied to the womans left forearm at a temperature individually tailored to induce an NPS score of 60, while the partner sat in an adjacent room.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the partner touchno-pain condition, the participants sat facing each other holding their dominant hands, while during the partner no-touchno pain condition the partner was present without making any physical contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the partner touchpain condition, the pain stimulus was administered to the female participant, while her partner held her dominant hand (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the partner no-touchpain condition, the female participant was administered the same pain stimulus, but her partner was only present without making any physical contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the no-touch conditions, participants were instructed to hold the handles of their armchair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the no-pain-alone condition, the partners sat in the same room, separated by a nontransparent curtain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the pain conditions consisted of one continuous trial that lasted 120 s. With the exception of the no-pain-alone condition, the participants could see each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all conditions, the participants heard a sound cue that signaled the beginning of the trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the conditions without pain stimuli, the thermode was connected to the hand of the pain target, but no stimuli were administrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the validation of the hand-holding procedure, we completed the following.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preparing the paradigm, we conducted a study in which 27 participants were presented with 10 pictures depicting various painful stimuli and were required to select a touch (presented in a 3-s clip) they estimates would diminish their pain out of three types of stimuli: a clip showing slow stroking (3 cm/s) on the arm, a clip showing slow stroking on the palm and static hand-holding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, hand-holding was selected 75% (SD = 31.28) of the time as the preferred type of touch for pain reduction, indicating that although stroking is pleasurable, hand-holding may have a more powerful effect on pain relief.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, static hand-holding was using in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine whether a differential eye-gaze pattern occurred during the painno-pain, touchno-touch condition, we conducted an additional experiment with 18 romantic couples between the ages of 18 and 45 to examine whether the eye-gaze pattern differs between the painno-pain, touchno touch conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each participant was administered 120 s of heat stimuli at the intensity of pain-60 under the same touchno-touch conditions as in the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pain interactions were videotaped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Objective coders evaluated the total duration of the mutual gazing and the number of mutual gazes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data analysis of permutation tests showed no differences between the conditions in either the total duration of the mutual gazing (Diffmedian = 0.05, P = 0.99) or in the number of mutual gazes (Diffmedian = 0.51, P = 0.33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that interpersonal touch is not associated with differential patterns of eye-gaze compared with in the no-touch condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Forty-four heterosexual (as confirmed by a sexual orientation scale) participants (22 couples) were recruited for this study (physiological data of this sample is reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four couples were married.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants ranged in age from 23 to 32 y (mean and SD for men: 26.4 ± 2.27 y; for women: 25.6 ± 1.9 y), had no children, were in long-term relationships (3.46 ± 2.25 y), and had completed an average of 13 y of education (years of education for men: 13.3 ± 1.5; and for women: 13.6 ± 1.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 9% of the couples were married.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two couples were dropped from the analysis because of unsuccessful physiological recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Couples were screened by a phone interview based on the following criteria: (i) right-handed and between the ages of 22 and 40; (ii) no chronic or acute pain; (iii) no medication use (except for oral contraceptives); (iv) no history of neurological disorders, psychiatric problems, or other problems relevant to the study; (v) not pregnant; (vi) in a heterosexual romantic relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants provided informed consent, and the study was approved by the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences Ethics Committee, University of Haifa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Pain_Familiarization_and_Pain-60_Calibration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All contact heat stimuli in this experiment were applied to the left volar forearm using a 3-cm2 computer-controlled Peltier-type thermode (TSA-2001; Medoc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the pain familiarization procedure, participants were exposed to three short contact-heat stimuli (43, 45, and 47 °C), each administered for 7 s in a semirandomized order with a break of 10 s. Participants were asked to report pain intensity using the NPS, ranging from 0, denoting no pain, to 100, denoting the worst pain imaginable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, the stimulus intensity was adjusted to each participant to evoke a peak pain magnitude of 60/100 (pain-60) on the NPS, using the algorithm described by Granot et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (115).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The procedure was previously validated for this paradigm by Goldstein et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pain-60 intensities ranged from 43.7 to 48.5, with an average of 46.11 and SD of 1.43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following measures were evaluated for each of the pain conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EEG_Preprocessing_and_Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The preprocessing was conducted using Matlab R2009b (The MathWorks) with Fieldtrip toolbox (117).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EEG data were rereferenced off-line to an average of the left and right mastoid and filtered with a bandpass ranging from 1 to 45 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal-component analysis (PCA) was used for artifact edification (118, 119) because PCA has been shown to be very effective in reducing artifacts with minimal effect on spectral distortion (119).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCA-dominant components that showed a noncortical source (eyeblinks or movement artifacts) were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The converted EEG signal was then calculated by using the inverse solution of the PCA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, about 3% of the data were removed after visual examination of the obtained data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data were filtered into the 8- to 12-Hz frequency bands using Butterworth filters of order four, divided into consecutive epochs of 1,000 ms, and the instantaneous phase was estimated using the Hilbert transform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from the first 2 s and the last 2 s were excluded from the analysis because of multiple artifacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then CCorr (120) was calculated for each 1,000-ms window over every possible combination of interpartner EEG electrodes (total of 1,024) in each study condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations showed that CCorr has the lowest sensitivity to spurious couplings of EEG hyperscanning data (82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, calculated CCorr was normalized by Fishers Z transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of the transformed coupling data are shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to stress that, in the current statistical analysis, the partners touchpain conditions were emphasized adjusting the related findings by the other study conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the coupling data are nested within conditions and participants, statistical analysis was based on the multilevel modeling (MLM) approach, taking into account the nested data structure and removing linear trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the following algorithm to reduce the number of statistical tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first step, complex contrast was used to test hypothesis H1 that at least a single condition of interest (partner touchno-pain, partner no-touchno-pain, partner touchpain and partner no-touchpain) shows higher interpartner coupling than the baseline no-pain-alone condition for each combination of interpartner electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This step allowed us to filter out a major number of electrode combinations with null effect more effectively than classical ANOVA, which includes comparisons between all possible pairwise conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the first step, only significant electrode combinations were analyzed in the second step, in which each of the four conditions of interest was compared separately to the baseline no-pain-alone condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was done to examine the interpartner connectivity network for interpartner touch with/without pain as well as the network for the partners copresence with/without pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third step was planned to identify a unique interpartner connectivity network for interpartner touch during pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, three contrasts were tested to compare the partner touchpain condition with the other three conditions of interest only for those combinations of electrodes that showed significant coupling for partner touchpain conditions in the second step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the tests conducted within the three steps are organized hierarchically, the hierarchical FDR controlling procedure proposed by Yekutieli (121) and implemented mostly on genomic data (122, 123) was applied to control the findings for the multiple testing problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the next stage, the interpartner networks during painno pain and touch were clustered using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) (124) with 1,000 runs to achieve stable results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factorization rank was estimated by considering the smallest value at which the decrease in the residual sum of squares (RSS) is lower than the decrease in the RSS obtained from random (reshuffled) data (125).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Brunet version of NMF, which is based on KullbackLeibler divergence and uses simple multiplicative updates, was applied (126).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After that, the MLM approach was used to test the difference in the relationship between the pain-related interpartner network and the reduction in the female partners pain/empathic accuracy with and without touch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Correlation analysis of pain-related outcomes with clustered interpartner coupling networks was adjusted by simulation-based multiple-tests correction (127) and includes a report of 95% confidence intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, bootstrapped paired t test was used for behavioral analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all analyses, type 1 error was set to 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power of the significant findings was calculated by simulation study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthetic data were generated 500 times using the obtained parameter estimates and the initial analysis was conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power was computed by comparing P values from the simulated data to the corresponding FDR criterion in initial analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All statistical analyses were performed in R 2.14.2 using the lme4 and NMF packages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
