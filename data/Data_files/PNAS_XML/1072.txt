Genetics of the human face: Identification of large-effect single gene variants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The human face is extraordinarily variable, and the extreme similarity of the faces of identical twins indicates that most of this variability is genetically determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have devised an approach to increase the chance of identifying specific large genetic effects on particular facial features, by choosing features with high heritability and selecting individuals with relatively extreme facial phenotypes for comparison with a control population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has yielded three specific and replicated genetic variants, two for features of facial profiles, and one for the region around the eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further application of these methods should enable the understanding, eventually at the molecular level, of the nature of this extraordinary genetic variability, which is such an important feature of our everyday human interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To discover specific variants with relatively large effects on the human face, we have devised an approach to identifying facial features with high heritability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is based on using twin data to estimate the additive genetic value of each point on a face, as provided by a 3D camera system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have used the ethnic difference between East Asian and European faces as a further source of face genetic variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use principal components (PCs) analysis to provide a fine definition of the surface features of human faces around the eyes and of the profile, and chose upper and lower 10% extremes of the most heritable PCs for looking for genetic associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this strategy for the analysis of 3D images of 1,832 unique volunteers from the well-characterized People of the British Isles study and 1,567 unique twin images from the TwinsUK cohort, together with genetic data for 500,000 SNPs, we have identified three specific genetic variants with notable effects on facial profiles and eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_3dMD_Images__Landmarking__and_Face_Registration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The primary data for our analysis of facial features were 3D images of 1,832 volunteers from the PoBI project, 1,567 imaged individuals from the TwinsUK cohort, and 33 East Asian volunteers, taken by using a 3dMD camera (www.3dmd.com).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The images produced by the 3dMD proprietary software defined the surface of each face in terms of a mesh over 50,000150,000 surface points in 3D space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To perform meaningful calculations on this collection of facial images, it was necessary to align the faces with each other so that any given surface point on a face could be matched with the corresponding point on any other face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was done by a combination of manually annotating each face with 14 well-defined landmarks (for example, the tip of nose or corners of eyes) and then using a series of algorithms that registered each face against a generic model face (see Materials and Methods and SI Appendix for the details of these processes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The raw data from the camera software were transformed via landmarking and registration into a set of 29,658 surface points for each individuals face, where each point had an identity corresponding to a biologically equivalent point on every other face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each point had three coordinate variables describing its 3D position, giving 29,658 × 3 = 88,974 measurements per face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AGV_Prediction_and_Choice_of_Facial_Subregions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As already mentioned, to help identify facial features with high heritability, we devised a method for obtaining the AGVs of every surface point on a face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are known as breeding values in the quantitative genetics literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of each surface point correlated with that of many other points, particularly those immediately surrounding it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of this correlation structure will be genetic, and it is this that represents the biological phenotype of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we exploited the correlation structure to further transform each original registered variable into its corresponding AGV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did this by using the MZ and DZ twin data to estimate the additive genetic variances of each surface point, and the additive genetic covariances between points, which are needed to estimate a set of coefficients jk using a least-squares minimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted AGV for each individual i at variable j is then given by the equationy^ij=k=1mjkxik,where xik are the observed values of the coordinates of the kth original variable (an x, y, or z axis position for a particular registered surface point) for individual i and the summation is over the total, m, of variables per face (three times the number of surface points) (see Materials and Methods and SI Appendix for further details of the procedures for estimating the AGVs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimation of each jk was performed, without any use of genetic SNP data, merely by knowing the relationships between MZ and DZ pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allowed individuals from the twin dataset to be reused for subsequent genetic association analysis, without having unwittingly introduced associations between SNPs and AGV phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ideally, the estimation process should have been carried out by using all of the 88,974 variables that were used to define the surface of each face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computational limitations so far limited us to carrying out this AGV estimation for two subregions of the face (eyes and profile) chosen by visual inspection (see Materials and Methods and Fig 1 for further details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The eyes subregion included 2,736 points, giving 3 × 2,763 = 8,289 variables for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the height (y) and depth (z) dimensions were used for the profile subregion, as the width (x) dimension was much less heritable (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were 1,646 points in the profile subregion, and so 2 × 1,646 = 3,292 variables were used for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mean heritability of the AGVs for eyes was 76.1% and for the profile 81.5%, compared with 69.8% and 76.6%, respectively, for the original variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gain in heritability for the AGVs for the profile is shown more directly in Fig 2, which plots for all of the variables the histograms for both the original data and the AGVs as determined from a subset of the TwinsUK data not used for the estimation of the AGVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clearly shows the significant increase in the AGV heritabilities and also, perhaps more importantly, the substantial reduction in the variance of the AGV heritabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to much-improved AGV heritabilities for variables with previously low heritabilities (see also SI Appendix, Fig S3 for the eyes subregion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also many more AGVs than original variables with heritabilities 0.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Shape_Translation_and_PCA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As described in Materials and Methods, PCAs were carried out on the AGVs after a Procrustes-like transformation that centered both profile and eyes subregions on the origin to avoid any influence of large-scale craniofacial morphology causing differences between individuals in the positions of regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PCAs were then carried out separately for the eyes and profile facial subregions, using all of the PoBI, TwinsUK, and the 33 East Asian individuals images combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting eigenvectors were used as the PC scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selection_of_Facial_PC_Axes_for_Further_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Five PC axes were chosen for genetic association analysis from the largest 50 PC axes, for each of the eyes and profile subregions (PCs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 in the former and PCs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 in the latter; marked by red circles in SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choices were based on PC scores having a heritability of 75% as determined from the TwinsUK data or having a heritability 65% and a relatively large difference between the mean PoBI and East Asian scores (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter criterion was based on the fact that major ethnic groups generally have certain distinct types of facial features, which must be largely genetically determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large difference in the PC phenotype between populations implies that there are facial features common in East Asian populations which are much less common in European populations, or vice versa, and that this difference is due to one or more face-controlling genetic variants that are significantly more or less frequent in East Asian than in European populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These comparisons were made by using the set of 33 East Asian images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this was a relatively small sample, we found several PCs with large between-group differences, suggesting the influences of genetic variants that differ in frequency between the two populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The East Asian images were only used as a contribution to the choice of PCs in the PoBI data for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were not used directly for any genetic analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discovery_Genetic_Association_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the hypothesis that there are genetic variants conferring large effects on facial morphology, and taking into account the discrete nature of facial features, we focused on individuals with facial features that could, in some sense, be considered extreme relative to the general population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore dichotomized the PC scores for the facial phenotypes into subsets of upper and lower extremes, chosen to be the top and bottom 10% of individuals when ranked according to their PC scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This meant that the five PCs chosen for further analysis from each of the eyes and profile subregions gave rise to a total of 20 extreme phenotypes to be tested for genetic associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Only the PoBI data were used for the SNP association discovery analysis, leaving the TwinsUK data for subsequent replication of those SNPs chosen for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, after quality control (QC) procedures, there were 3,161 PoBI individuals (1,532 males and 1,629 females) genotyped for 524,576 SNPs, of which 512,181 were non-sex-linked and were used for the association analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 3,161 genotyped PoBI individuals, only 1,423 (652 males and 771 females) had both good-quality facial images and genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 1,738 individuals with genotype data but no image data were used as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further 409 individuals with image data but no genotype data were also available, giving a total of 1,832 imaged individuals, and all of these were used for the definition of the phenotypes, as previously described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each PC, the individuals in the 10% extreme (upper or lower) were tested against all those not in the extreme together with unphenotyped individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter will include some individuals with the extreme phenotype being tested, which will dilute any suggested association but cannot bias the result toward an association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed that the relatively large number of PoBI controls who were not phenotyped offset any slight loss of power for detecting an association due to the presence of a relatively small number of people with the extreme phenotype in the controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To allow for male vs. female differences, all association analyses were performed for female upper and lower extremes (incorporating all males into the control samples and comparing 77 individuals in the upper extremes against 3,084 = 3,161  77 controls, and 76 individuals in lower extremes against 3,085 = 3,161  76 controls) and combined male and female upper and lower extremes (142 upper-extreme individuals against 3,019 = 3,161  142 controls and 140 lower-extreme individuals against 3,021 = 3,161  140 controls).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male extremes were not studied at this stage because the TwinsUK data to be used for replication hardly included any males.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Males were, however, included in the controls, as no association analyses were done using sex-linked SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, there were therefore four association analyses performed for each of the 10 PCs under considerationnamely, 10 × 2 = 20, as above, taking into account upper and lower extremes for each of the 10 PCs, and 20 × 2 = 40, taking into account that each of these 20 phenotypes was tested separately in females and in combined sexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Association analyses were therefore effectively done on 40 different facial variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is important to emphasize that none of the steps taken to reach this definition of phenotypes involved any relationship to the SNP genotyping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, each of these phenotypes was initially tested independently for genome-wide associations, using only the number of SNPs used for the association analysis to take into account multiple comparisons for assessing significance, just as is done for standard GWAS for diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each of the selected 40 PC extremes, assessment of the statistical significance of SNP associations was based on analysis of the 3 × 2 contingency tables of genotypes (aa/Aa/AA, where a represents the minor frequency allele) vs. extreme/control status, for all 512,181 non-sex-linked SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dominant (A) and recessive (aa) models were both tested for each SNP and the P value for the best fit of the two then used, multiplied by 2 for the extra comparison being made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively small number of extreme individuals motivated a careful selection of the appropriate statistical test for contingency table significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most testsfor example, the Pearsons 2 testrely on assumptions that usually only hold in large samples (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially pertinent when examining models of inheritance involving the effects of minor allele homozygotes, which can be at quite low frequencies among the extremes for MAFs of 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, we therefore only considered SNPs with MAFs 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish the most appropriate test, null hypothesis simulations of 3 × 2 tables were performed, and the type-I error rates were quantified (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The best-performing approximate test, showing only mild deflation of P values within the borderline genome-wide significance range (105 to 106), was an implementation of a Wald test (SI Appendix, Fig S5A), in which standardized log ORs under recessive and dominant models were tested against an N(0, 1) distribution for significant departures from 0 (16) (see SI Appendix for further details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pearsons 2 test showed serious inflation of statistical significance, even when applying Yates continuity correction (SI Appendix, Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Variants were deemed to be sufficiently associated with an extreme facial feature for taking forward for replication, by passing one of three thresholds: (i) having a P value below the standard level of genome-wide significance (5 × 108); (ii) belonging to the candidate SNP set and having a P value less_than500,000 × 5 × 108/66,769 = 3.7 × 107, where 66,769 is the number of tested SNPs in the candidate list (SI Appendix); or (iii) having a P value less_than104 and an OR 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rationale for this threshold was that, at the cost of a greater number of false positives, variants could be discovered with (i) biologically significant consequences and (ii) high power for replication, conditional on them being true positives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An OR lower limit of 9 gave a suitable balance between having either too few or too many SNPs to take forward for replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There were, for the females, 15 associations for the profile and 10 for the eyes that passed the threshold of choice for taking forward for further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were, in addition, for combined males and females, two SNP associations for the profile and two for the eyes that passed this threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 17 SNPs for the profile and 12 SNPs for the eyes were therefore taken forward for replication in the TwinsUK data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the profile, three of the five PC phenotypes (accounting for 9 of 17 associated SNPs to be taken forward for further analysis), and for the eyes ,four of five PC phenotypes (accounting for 10 of 12 associated SNPs to be taken forward for further analysis) showed a substantial difference between East Asian and European individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, all of the discovery associations were statistically more significant under a recessive rather than a dominant inheritance model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Replication_in_TwinsUK_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The TwinsUK dataset provides the basis for valid and unbiased replication since, although it was used for the AGV estimation, this process makes no reference to DNA data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a combination of high OR and low P value was used to determine whether a SNP should be followed up for replication, statistical significance alone was used to determine whether replication had been achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of the 12 eye-associated discovery SNPs, 1 (rs2039473, eyes PC3 associated in females) was not present on the TwinsUK genotyping platform and so could not easily be pursued further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One SNP of the 17 selected for replication for the profile had an r2  0.1 with another discovery hit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, retaining the SNP with the highest OR in the discovery analysis, there remained 16 SNPs with profile-associated phenotypes and 11 eyes-associated SNPs, making a total of 27 SNPs to be taken forward as candidates for replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each of these 27 replication SNPs, association was only tested for the PC extreme with which it was associated in the discovery analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase power, control samples from the appropriate discovery analyses were incorporated into the replication contingency tables before testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Wald test (one-tailed) was then performed under the appropriate inheritance model (recessive in all cases) for each of the 27 replication SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A complication in using the TwinsUK cohort as a replication dataset was the high degree of relatedness between MZ and DZ twins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removing all related individuals satisfied the requirements for independent samples required by standard statistical analyses, but also lost information and resulted in an arbitrarily chosen set of unrelated samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these issues, we carried out a randomization and permutation testing analysis using a limited number of the DZ twins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, noting that statistical power might be gained by utilizing more than half of the DZ twins per analysis, and that a pair of DZ twins contained the genetic information equivalent to 1.5 unrelated samples, we performed 10,000 random selections of one from each pair of DZ twins plus, for a random half of those DZ twins, their twin relative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each random selection thus included 75% of the available 654 DZ individuals (327 pairs) with genetic data plus 246 composite MZ imaged individuals (formed by averaging the data for the two MZ twins and treating them as a single individual) and 129 remaining individuals with no relative available, all after QC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total of 865 (654 × 0.75 + 246 + 129) is approximately equivalent to the full set of independent genetic information available from the TwinsUK data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appropriate genotype distributions for the extremes and nonextremes from this dataset were then produced by using the mean cell counts over the random selections, rounded to the nearest integer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the controls, the PoBI controls (nonextreme phenotyped PoBI individuals and all genotyped but not phenotyped PoBI individuals) were combined with the nonextreme twins data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A random permutation test was then used to assess the significance of the difference between the extremes and the controls, and the OR was calculated from the appropriate recessive 2 × 2 table (see Materials and Methods and SI Appendix for further details of these procedures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of the 27 discovery SNPs taken forward for replication analysis in this way in the TwinsUK dataset, 3 replicated with 5% or lower false discovery rate (FDR; calculated on the basis of having used 27 SNPs) and with ORs 4: rs2045145 (in PCDH15), profile PC2 associated in females; rs11642644 (in MBTPS1), profile PC7 associated in females; and rs7560738 (in TMEM163), eyes PC1 associated in the combined sexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of these SNPs were in any of our candidate gene regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detailed_Analysis_of_the_Three_Replicated_SNP_Associations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each of these SNPs, we show the 3 × 2 tables for the discovery analysis, replication analysis, and combined TwinsUK and PoBI data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined data tables were formed by adding the extremes results for the PoBI discovery and the TwinsUK replication, and testing the combination for significance against the same controls used in the replication analysis (namely, the combined controls from the PoBI and TwinsUK sets as described in Replication in TwinsUK Data) using a Wald test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall OR was estimated from the 2 × 2 table for a recessive model, as was appropriate for each of the three replicated associations, and the P values were for one-sided tests, given the expected direction of a SNP effect in the replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our success in finding specific single SNPs with relatively large effects on facial features depends on our ability to identify facial phenotypes that have the high heritability expected from the extraordinary facial similarity between MZ twins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key to this has been the estimation of the AGVs of points on the surface of the face using data from the 3dMD camera systems 3D facial scans of MZ and DZ twins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tsagkrasoulis et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13) have recently used the same cohort of images to accurately characterize heritabilities of facial geometry measurements, demonstrating the efficacy of the 3D technology for representing heritable aspects of faces, though they have not looked for genetic associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The objective behind estimating additive genetic values is to maximize the heritability captured by each facial surface measurement in order to increase the strength of genetic associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another contribution to the phenotype heritability is the use of ethnic differences, in our case between the UK and East Asian populations, which played a significant role in the discovery of the rs2045145 (PCDH15) association with the more European extreme PC2 profile in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences are necessarily largely genetic and must be due to differences between ethnic groups in the frequencies of genetic variants with defined effects on facial features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final contribution to our success has been the use of dichotomized variables for the genetic association analysis rather than a traditional quantitative variable approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basing our analysis on facial variation within the relatively homogeneous UK population has necessarily, to some extent, limited the range of facial genetic variability available for study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the use of the well-characterized and carefully sampled PoBI population as our control for genetic association studies has minimized the possibility of population stratification effects that are especially troublesome for studies on mixed ethnic populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to emphasize that none of the approaches to the choice of phenotypes to study were in any way dependent on the genetic information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prevented any bias of the chosen phenotype toward having significant associations with SNPs, so that the correction for multiple testing of each chosen phenotype will therefore only depend on the number of SNPs tested for.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The choice of extreme phenotypes for study to maximize the chance of finding variants with relatively large effects inevitably limited the number of individuals available for a genetic association analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This problem turned out to be particularly relevant given that the genetic associations we have found involve homozygotes for relatively low-frequency variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led to a careful consideration of the appropriate statistical test to use for selection of variants for subsequent replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations of expected distributions using random permutations between controls and cases strongly suggested that the conventional 2 tests were too permissive for the balance of cases and controls in our study (SI Appendix, Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led us to adopt a Wald test based on standardized log ORs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also decided to take into account the estimated magnitude of the effect of a potential discovery SNP, choosing a lower threshold of an OR of 9 as a criterion for taking forward a SNP for replication, while allowing for a less stringent P value threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once a criterion has been set for the choice of SNPs to be taken forward for replication, it is then only the number of these chosen SNPs, effectively 27 candidate SNPs, that needs to be taken into account in assessing an acceptable P value for replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another limitation of our study has been the resource-limited availability of a suitable sample of phenotyped and genotyped individuals for replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were fortunate to have the TwinsUK samples for this, but that created the problem of effectively only having females for replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also posed the challenge of how best to use the information from the DZ twins without losing information due to using only one member for each pair in the replication analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The three replicated SNPs were identified as significant by an association with individuals in a 10% extreme of selected PC distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sought for more subtle effects by looking at the frequencies of the associated homozygotes (aa) and heterozygotes (Aa) in successive 5% quantiles across the appropriate PC distributions for combined PoBI and TwinsUK data (Materials and Methods), as shown in Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that in each case the frequency of the aa homozygotes is largely concentrated in the extreme 5% or 10% of the PC distribution with no obvious variation in the (Aa) heterozygote frequencies over the different levels of the PC7 profile and PC1 eyes phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the lack of heterozygote association with these phenotypes in the data given in Tables 2 and 3, and so a clearly recessive control of the extreme phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each variant has no obvious quantitative effect on the trait value outside of the extreme group, which is consistent with our choice of a 10% threshold for dichotomization of the phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is questionable whether these associations could be detected by using a quantitative analysis comparing the average phenotype values within each genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the PC2 profile phenotype (Fig 7A), there is a remarkable association between the presence of aa homozygotes and the absence of Aa heterozygotes in the lower SNP associated extreme (OR 13.2, Yates corrected 2 44.5, using data from Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the presence of a single A allele in this case positively inhibits the expression of the lower extreme phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the observed negative correlation between heterozygotes Aa and the lower extreme phenotype shown in Table 1 (OR 0.51, P = 0.01, Fishers exact test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the strong recessive effects of the three replicated SNPs on their associated extreme phenotypes, there are in each case many extreme phenotypes that are not recessive homozygotes for these SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some of these may be due to measurement error in the phenotype, it seems more probable, given the high heritabilities involved, that most are likely to be associated with other sources of genetic variation that our analysis was too weakly powered to detect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These could include lesser effects of either homozygotes or heterozygotes for other SNPs or epistatic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preponderance of recessive phenotypes may be due to the fact that we are looking for unusual phenotypic differences, with overall dominant effects controlling the corresponding commoner facial features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may seem curious that recessive effects are imposed on phenotypes that were initially produced via maximization of the additive genetic variance via prediction of additive genetic values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent of additive genetic variation, calculated under the assumption of no dominance variation, can be affected by the extent of dominant variation that is actually present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it is possible that additive genetic variation could be the most important factor across the continuous range of values for a given PC phenotype, while recessive genotypes become accumulated in the extremes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The familial pattern of apparent parent to offspring passing on of particular facial features will be expected to be seen largely in the matings between the strongly associated homozygotes (aa) and the heterozygotes (Aa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the probability of the Aa heterozygotes expressing the associated feature is 5- to 10-fold less than for the aa homozygotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the proportion of aa homozygotes in these meetings will be 0.5, this gives the appearance of an apparent dominantly determined phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our small sample of three replicated SNPs, there was no evidence of any particular pattern of gene functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in marked contrast, for example, to the genetic control of tissue type incompatibility by the HLA system in humans or of taste and smell differences by the extraordinary complex of olfactory receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selection for genetic variation in facial features connected, for example, with recognition of group membership, and mate choice preferences is likely to be frequency-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can explain high levels of polymorphism, as was suggested many years ago for the HLA system (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the case of the face, the genetic variation selected for may be adventitious with respect to gene function in the sense that there may be very many different ways in which variation in particular genes can influence the inheritance of facial features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ultimate test for the validity of any particular SNP found to be strongly associated with a particular human facial feature will be to verify the functional effect associated with that SNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be done, for example, by evolutionary comparisons relating SNP variability to facial features, such as for the differences between primate species (as we have done for our replicating SNPs) or in the variety of dog breeds, and by exploring the effects of specific gene mouse knockouts or knockins on snout morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our studies as described here have been limited by:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We suggest that many more specific and relatively large genetic variant effects on human facial features will be found in the future using approaches such as we have described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The PoBI individuals were sampled from throughout the United Kingdom, primarily from rural areas and from individuals all of whose grandparents came from approximately the same area, as described by Winney et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the samples (2,039) have been subject to a detailed population genetic structure analysis (11), which, while revealing extraordinary genetic structure related to geography, showed that the average FST between regional groups was only 0.0007.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for the purpose of genetic association studies, this is an ideal population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MZ and DZ twins were from the TwinsUK cohort (www.twinsuk.ac.uk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

All facial images were taken by using a portable version of the static 3dMDface System3dMD camera and its accompanying dedicated software (www.3dMD.com and SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where possible, three images were taken of each participant, to allow averaging of measurements over multiple images, with the aim of reducing technical noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volunteers were asked to assume a neutral, relaxed facial expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 2,556 images of PoBI individuals and 2,025 images of TwinsUK volunteers were collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 2,556 images of PoBI volunteers, 1,832 were of unique individuals (819 male and 1,005 female and 8 for whom sex was not correctly recorded), while for the twins, 1,567 were of unique individuals (1,551 females and 16 males), not all of whom were satisfactorily genotyped (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, single images were taken of 33 East Asian Chinese origin volunteers (14 females and 19 males).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images from all datasets were registered at 29,658 locations on the facial surface, each referred to as a vertex or surface point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every vertex has three coordinate positions describing its x, y, and z dimensional positions, yielding 88,974 phenotypic variables per individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and the whole project conformed to the UK standard research ethical consent procedures with approval granted by the National Research Ethics Service Committee, Yorkshire and the HumberLeeds West, United Kingdom (Reference 05/Q1205/35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Facial_Registration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3D face images generated by the 3dMD camera system are provided in the form of a triangulated mesh (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each vertex has associated with it a 3D location and an RGB (red green blue) appearance value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the identity of each mesh vertex or point at this stage is unknown, and the number of points varies from image to image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was dealt with by mesh registration, which involved fitting the mesh of a generic face model to the unknown mesh to produce a standardized triangulated mesh in which the identity of each node in the mesh is known (SI Appendix, Fig S1B; refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31 and 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is this registration process that enables meaningful calculations on the collection of facial surfaces to be made (for further details of the process, see SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

AGV_Prediction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The original facial surface measurements xij are continuous random variables describing a position in one-dimensional space (three measurements for each vertex), where i and j are indices, respectively, for individuals (total n) and variables (total m = 88,974).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We aim to estimate the unobserved values Yj = Ee[Xj|g], where the expectation is taken over the stochastic environmental effects (Ee), for a given individual, for each measurement, j, where Xj is the random variable of which xij is a realization, and g represents a random vector of genotypes belonging to the individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In quantitative genetics, the departure of Yj from its population mean would be termed the genetic value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under purely additive genetic effects (no dominance or epistasis), the assumption we rely on below, this is the AGV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The objective is to predict yij, the realized AGV for individual i, at measurement j, using the complete set of measurements taken on the same individual: {xik:k1,2,3m}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is performed for each j in turn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each Xk is modeled asXk=Yk+k,[1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
for all k = 1,2,3...m, where k represents the effects of the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that Ee[k|g] = 0, equivalent to there being no geneenvironment interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the coefficients jk, which effectively measure the predictive influence of variable Xk on Yj, we minimize the expected least-squares error,EgEe[(Yjk=1mjkXk)2|g][2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
with respect to each coefficient jk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This double expectation is taken with respect to the stochastic environmental and genetic effects (Ee and Eg, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After applying constraints to avoid bias and so introducing a Lagrangian parameter, and estimating genetic variances and covariances from the twins data assuming only additive genetic effects, we obtain a matrix equation whose solution gives the estimates of the coefficients jk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted AGVs, for each individual i at measurement j, are theny^ij=k=1mjkxik.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For further details of the estimation procedure, see SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fitting_Process_Using_Facial_Subsets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ideally the linear predictor uses all facial variables {xik:k1,2,3m} as described in AGV Prediction, where m (=88,974) is the total number processed and registered from the camera system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, computational limitations have so far prevented this, and so we used a workaround whereby analysis was restricted to two rectangular subregions of the face, which we call profile and eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were selected based on visual inspection of an image of the average face (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vertices that fell within the subregion on the average face were taken forward for AGV prediction analysis in all individuals (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All subsequent statistical analyses were performed on the predicted AGVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Shape_Translation_and_PCA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a Procrustes transformation approach, we translated each individuals subregion by subtracting the mean x coordinate for their own subregion (taken across all vertices in that region for the particular individual) from the x coordinates of all variables in the subregion, and similarly for the y and z coordinates for both eyes and profile subregions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has the effect of centering all individuals subregions on the origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downstream statistical analyses using these centered values are not then unduly influenced by large-scale craniofacial morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid losing information that could be of genetic interest, no other Procrustes transformationsfor example, matching subregions by rotation or scaling by sizewere applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PCA was carried out in the standard way, performing eigenvalue decomposition on the nxn covariance matrix of scaled (by population SD) and centered (on population mean) facial variables for both subregions separately, using all TwinsUK, East Asian, and PoBI images combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting eigenvectors were used as the PC scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Projecting TwinsUK individuals onto PoBI-fitted PC axes showed that PC scores for the largest five axes had r  0.9 with the scores produced using the combined data, for both subregions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relatively high correlation between the two sets of PC scores justified the use of the combined PCA analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PC scores were averaged over all TwinsUK and PoBI individuals for whom multiple images were available, to reduce sources of environmental variation such as differences in facial expression and small measurement errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PC_Subset_Selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The largest 50 PC axes were inspected for promising phenotypes using two criteria: (i) heritability (33) of each PC axis as determined by using the PC scores of the 1,567 TwinsUK individuals; and (ii) the squared difference between the mean PoBI (European) PC score and the mean East Asian score, taken as a ratio against the within-population variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plots of these statistics are shown in SI Appendix, Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCs with heritability 0.75 or heritability 0.65 and a between/within population variance ratio 1 were taken forward for genetic association analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genotype_QC_and_Genotyping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genotyping of the PoBI discovery samples was performed on two separate Illumina platforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As part of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 study (34), 2,912 samples were typed on the Illumina Human 1.2M-Duo genotyping chip, 2,039 of which were previously used to analyze the population structure of the British population (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since 2011, a total of 823 newly recruited samples were genotyped on the Illumina Infinium OmniExpress-24 BeadChip (750K) platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intersection between the two platforms was 547,863 SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before QC, there were 3,735 genotyped DNA samples, constituting 3,616 unique individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Standard genotype QC procedures were performed by using PLINK [Versions 1.07 (35) and 1.90 (36)] in combination with R scripts, after which there remained 3,161 individuals (1,532 male and 1,629 female) genotyped at 524,576 SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TwinsUK genotype data were available on two platforms; 1,278 samples represented by 2,287,998 array-typed SNPs and 612 whole-genome sequenced samples (19,725,734 autosomal variants).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separate QC procedures were performed for the two platforms before merging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After merging the array and sequencing data and retaining variants common to both sets, there were 1,887,250 variants typed on 1,794 samples, 1,275 of whom were unique individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For more details of QC procedures, see SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Procedure_for_Dealing_with_the_Relatedness_Between_MZ_and_DZ_Twins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MZ twins were dealt with by averaging phenotypes (PC scores) over each member of the MZ pair and taking the average as a single individual, which reduced the influence of environmental variation in the associated facial phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We dealt with the presence of DZ twins by performing 10,000 random selections of a list of unrelated DZ twins plus, for a random half of those individuals, their twin relative, as already described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most significant FDR-adjusted P value (37) over the 10,000 selections was then taken as the overall observed P value, and this was compared against null hypothesis permutations to obtain an empirical P value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there may be more efficient ways of dealing with this problem of the use of the twin data, our approach is certainly more efficient than just using one member of each twin pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Frequency_Trend_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combined TwinsUK and PoBI data were used to inspect for evidence for trends in genotype frequency across the quantitative PC phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was done for each of the three replicating SNPs in the PC phenotype with which they were associated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals were sorted into 5% quantiles based on their ranked PC values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was performed within the TwinsUK data by using a randomization scheme similar to that described in Procedure for Dealing with the Relatedness Between MZ and DZ Twins and in SI Appendix, in which a random set of unrelated DZ pair members was retained and each time combined with the full set of phenotyped individuals from the PoBI discovery set, giving 1,467 individuals when analyzing females only and 2,118 individuals when analyzing combined sexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean frequency of genotypes in each bin for the combination of PoBI and TwinsUK data, the latter taken over the set of randomizations for DZ twins, was taken as the observed data for plotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Function_Analysis_of_Replicating_SNPs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By using the TwinsUK sequence data (600 individuals), replicated variants were assessed for high r2 (as a measure of LD) with novel variants in the sequence data that were not present among the 524,576 SNPs used for the association analysis and which were within 2 Mb upstream or downstream of the physical location of the replicated variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants satisfying this requirement and with r2  0.2 were screened for functional information by using SnpEff (38) and ensembls online tools (www.ensembl.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants were determined to be putatively functional if they were (i) exonic; (ii) located within 5 Kb upstream or downstream of a gene; (iii) within a UTR; (iv) within a splice site; (v) in a highly conserved region, notably that could be coding for a functional RNA sequence; or (vi) in a regulatory region, possibly a known enhancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interspecies conservation, another possible clue to function, was assessed by using ensembls online tools by comparing the 10 base pair flanking regions of variants among eight primate species (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, green monkey, macaque, olive baboon, and marmoset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
