How social information can improve estimation accuracy in human groups  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Digital technologies deeply impact the way that people interact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is crucial to understand how social influence affects individual and collective decision-making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed experiments where subjects had to answer questions and then revise their opinion after knowing the average opinion of some previous participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, unbeknownst to the subjects, we added a controlled number of virtual participants always giving the true answer, thus precisely controlling social information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments and data-driven model show how social influence can help a group of individuals collectively improve its performance and accuracy in estimation tasks depending on the quality and quantity of information provided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model also shows how giving slightly incorrect information could drive the group to a better performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our digital and connected societies, the development of social networks, online shopping, and reputation systems raises the questions of how individuals use social information and how it affects their decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report experiments performed in France and Japan, in which subjects could update their estimates after having received information from other subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure and model the impact of this social information at individual and collective scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe and justify that, when individuals have little prior knowledge about a quantity, the distribution of the logarithm of their estimates is close to a Cauchy distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that social influence helps the group improve its properly defined collective accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantify the improvement of the group estimation when additional controlled and reliable information is provided, unbeknownst to the subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that subjects sensitivity to social influence permits us to define five robust behavioral traits and increases with the difference between personal and group estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then use our data to build and calibrate a model of collective estimation to analyze the impact on the group performance of the quantity and quality of information received by individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model quantitatively reproduces the distributions of estimates and the improvement of collective performance and accuracy observed in our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our model predicts that providing a moderate amount of incorrect information to individuals can counterbalance the human cognitive bias to systematically underestimate quantities and thereby improve collective performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Subjects were asked to answer questions for which they had to estimate various social, geographical, or astronomical quantities or the number or length of objects in a picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each question, the experiment proceeded in two steps: subjects had to first provide their personal estimate Ep.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, after receiving the social information I, they were asked to give a new estimate E. I is defined as the geometric mean of the  previous estimates E (=1 or 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects answered each question sequentially (SI Appendix, Fig S1) and were not told the value of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since humans think in terms of orders of magnitude (20), we used the geometric mean for I which averages orders of magnituderather than the arithmetic one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Virtual experts providing the true value E=T for each question were inserted at random into the sequence of participants (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sequence involving 20 human participants, we controlled the number n=0, 5, 15, or 80, and hence, the percentage =n/(n+20)=0, 20, 43, or 80% of virtual experts, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The social information delivered to human participants, being the geometric mean of previous estimates, is hence strongly affected by these virtual experts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When providing their estimates Ep and E, subjects had to report their confidence level in their answer on a Likert scale ranging from one (very low) to five (very high) and were asked to choose the reason that best explained their second estimate among a list of eight possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used initial conditions for the social information I chosen reasonably far from the true answer T and imposed loose limits to the estimates that subjects could give to prevent them from answering too absurdly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All graphs presented here are based on the 29 questions (5,394×2 prior and final estimates) from the experiment performed in France.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar experiment was conducted in Japan; all results can be found in SI Appendix, where the full experimental protocol is described in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The aims and procedures of the experiments conformed to the ethical rules imposed by the Toulouse School of Economics and the Center for Experimental Research in Social Sciences at Hokkaido University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All subjects in France and Japan provided written consent for their participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Distribution_of_Individual_Estimates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous works have shown that distributions of independent individual estimates are generally highly right-skewed, while distributions of their common logarithm are much more symmetric (12, 13, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because humans think in terms of orders of magnitude, especially when large quantities are involved, which makes the logarithmic scale more natural to represent human estimates (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these works, participants were mostly asked easy questions for which they had good prior knowledge (high demonstrability), such that the answers ranged over one to two orders of magnitude at most (1214, 1719, 2123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that little information was present before the inclusion of our virtual experts and to more clearly identify the impact of social influence, we selected hard questions (low demonstrability).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These questions involve very large quantities, and answers span several orders of magnitude, making the log transform of estimates even more relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare quantities that can differ by orders of magnitude, we normalize each estimate E by the true answer T to the question at hand and define the log-transformed estimate X=log(E/T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the log transform of the actual answer T is X=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1A shows the distribution of X before and after social information has been provided to the subjects (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although such distributions have often been presented as close to Gaussian distributions (13, 18), we find that they are much better described by Cauchy distributions because of their fat tails, which account for the nonnegligible probability of estimates extremely far from the truth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cauchy probability distribution function readsf(X,m,)=1(Xm)2+2,[1]where m is the center/median and  is the width of the distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S2A shows the distribution of estimates in the Japan experiment, and SI Appendix, Fig S2B shows that, when the same questions were asked, distributions of personal estimates in France and Japan are almost identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the Cauchy distribution, the mean and standard deviation (SD) are not defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, good estimators of m and  are the median and one-half the interquartile range (the difference between the third and the first quartiles) of the experimental distribution, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, mp (m) and p () will refer to the median and one-half the interquartile range of the experimental distribution before social influence (after social influence), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cauchy and Gaussian distributions belong to the so-called stable distributions family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, {Xi} being a set of estimates drawn from a symmetric probability distribution f characterized by its center m and width , we define the weighted average X=ipiXi, with ipi=1; f is a stable distribution if X has the same probability distribution f as the original Xi, up to the new width .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the center m remains the same because of the condition ipi=1, but the width may decrease after averaging (law of large numbers), depending on the stable distribution f considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cauchy and Gaussian represent two extremes of the stable distribution family, with Lévy distributions being intermediate cases: for the Cauchy distribution, the width  remains unchanged, whereas the narrowing of  is maximum for the Gaussian distribution (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of actual human estimates, the relevance of a certain distribution f can be related to the degree of prior knowledge of the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When individuals have no idea about the answer to a question, the weighted average of arbitrary answers cannot be statistically better (less_than) or worse () than the arbitrary answers themselves, leading to a Cauchy distribution for these estimates (the only distribution for which =).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when there is a good prior knowledge, one expects that combining answers gives a better statistical estimate (less_than; Gaussian).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the quantity to estimate is closely related to general intuition (ages, dates, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), estimates should hence follow a Gaussian-like distribution, while when individuals have very little knowledge about the answer, as in our experiment, estimates should be Cauchy-like distributed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rationale for naturally observing stable distributions is explained in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use the term Cauchy-like, because Fig 1A shows that the distributions of prior (Xp) and final (X) estimates are slightly skewed toward low estimates (Xless_than0), reminiscent of the human cognitive bias to underestimate numbers, because of the nonlinear internal representation of quantities (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we will show, this phenomenon has strong implications on the influence of information provided to the group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe a clear sharpening of the distribution of estimates after social influence mainly caused by the presence of the virtual experts, hence affecting the value of the social information M=log(I/T) and ultimately, the final estimate X of the actual subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sharpening becomes stronger as the percentage of experts increases (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Moreover, consistent with our introductory discussion of the measurement methods of group performance, we propose the two following indicators: (i) collective performance |median(Xi)|, which represents how close the center of the distribution is to zero (the log transform of the true value T), and (ii) collective accuracy median(|Xi|), which is a measure of the proximity of individual estimates to the true value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Distribution_of_Individual_Sensitivities_to_Social_Influence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After having received social information, an individual i may reconsider her personal estimate Epi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The natural way for humans to aggregate estimates is to use the median (22) or the geometric mean (18), which both tend to reduce the effect of outliers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the social information that we provided to the subject was the geometric mean of the  previous answers (including that of the virtual experts providing the true answer Ei=T): Ii=(j=ii1Ej)1/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, one can always represent the new estimate Ei as the weighted geometric average of the personal estimate Epi and the social information Ii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we can uniquely define the sensitivity to social influence Si by Ei=Epi1SiIiSi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value Si=0 corresponds to subjects keeping their initial estimates, while Si=1 corresponds to subjects adopting the estimate of their peers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of log-transformed variables Xi=log(Ei/T), we obtainXi=(1Si)Xpi+SiMi,[2]where the log-transformed social information is simply the arithmetic mean Mi=(1/)j=ii1Xj, and thus, Si=(XiXpi)/(MiXpi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, in this language, Si is simply the barycenter coordinate of the final estimate in terms of the initial personal estimate and the social information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1B shows that the experimental distribution of S has a bell-shaped part that we roughly assimilate to a Gaussian, with two additional Dirac peaks exactly at S=0 and S=1 (SI Appendix, Table S2 shows the numerical values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five types of behavioral responses can be identified: keeping ones opinion (peak at S=0), adopting the groups opinion (peak at S=1), making a compromise between ones opinion and the groups opinion (0less_thanSless_than1), overreacting to social information (S1), and contradicting it (Sless_than0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quite surprisingly, responses that consist of overreacting and contradicting were generally overlooked in previous works (2123, 25), either considered as noise and simply not taken into account or sometimes included into the peaks at S=0 and S=1, despite these behaviors being not negligible (especially overreacting).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the median of S is 0.34, in agreement with previous results (15, 18, 25), meaning that individuals tend to give more weight to their own opinion than to information coming from others (14, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the distributions of S for the experiment performed in Japan and for men and women (in France) are very similar to that of Fig 1B (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find that the subjects behavioral reactions are highly consistent, reflecting robust differences in personality or general knowledge: in each session, according to the way that subjects modified their estimates on average in the first 24 questions, we split the subjects into three subgroups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first define confident subjects as the one-quarter of the group minimizing |Sq|q, where q is the index of the questions (i.e., the subjects who were on average closest to S=0), and the followers as the one-quarter of the group minimizing |1Sq|q (i.e., closest to S=1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other one-half of the group is defined as the average subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S5 shows the distributions of S for the three subgroups computed from questions 2529.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences are striking (SI Appendix, Fig S6): for the group of confident subjects, the peak at S=0 is about seven times higher than the peak at S=1, while for the group of followers, it is less than twice larger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the distribution for average subjects is found to be very close to the global distribution shown in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Impact_of_the_Difference_Between_Personal_and_Group_s_Opinions_on_Individual_Sensitivity_to_Social_Influence  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2A shows that, on average, S depends on the distance D=log(Ep/I)=XpM between personal and group estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up to a threshold of t2.5 orders of magnitude, there is a linear cusp relation between S and D. The farther away the social information M is from a subjects personal estimate Xp, the more likely the latter is to trust the group as S increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2B shows the origin of this correlation: as social information gets farther from personal opinion, the probability to keep ones opinion (S=0) decreases, while the probability to compromise increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the adopting behavior does not change with D. The same phenomena have been observed in the Japan experiment (SI Appendix, Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We now introduce an individual-based model to understand the respective effects of individual sensitivity to social influence and information quality and quantity on collective performance and accuracy observed at the group level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the model, we simulate a sequence of 20 successive estimates performed by the agents (not including the virtual experts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical run of the model consists of the following steps for a given condition (,).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_Between_Theoretical_and_Experimental_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For all graphs, we ran 100,000 simulations, so that the model predictions error bars are negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1B shows that the distribution of sensitivities to social influence S obtained in the model (red curve in Fig 1B) is similar by construction to the experimental one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, by construction of the model (step v above), the cusp dependence of the sensitivity to social influence with respect to D=XpM is well-reproduced by the model (Fig 2A, red curve with open symbols).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We now address several nontrivial predictions of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantifying how social information affects individual estimations and opinions is a crucial step to understand and model the dynamics of collective choices or opinion formation (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have measured and modeled the impact of social information at individual and collective scales in estimation tasks with low demonstrability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By controlling the quantity and quality of information delivered to the subjects, unbeknownst to them, we have been able to precisely quantify the impact of social influence on group performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested and confirmed the cross-cultural generality of our results by conducting experiments in France and Japan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We showed and justified that, when individuals have poor prior knowledge about the questions, the distribution of their log-transformed estimates is close to a Cauchy distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of the sensitivity to social influence S is bell-shaped (contradict, compromise, overreact), with two additional peaks exactly at S=0 (keep) and S=1 (adopt), which lead to the definition of robust social traits as checked by further observing the subjects inclined to follow these behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When subjects have little prior knowledge, we found that their sensitivity to social influence increases (linear cusp) with the difference between their estimate and that of the group, at variance with what was found in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19, for questions where subjects had a high prior knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used these experimental observations to build and calibrate a model that quantitatively predicts the sharpening of the distribution of individual estimates and the improvement in collective performance and accuracy as the amount of good information provided to the group increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model could be directly applied or straightforwardly adapted to similar situations where humans have to integrate information from other people or external sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We studied the impact of virtual experts on the group performance, a methodology allowing us to rigorously control the quantity () and quality (V) of the information provided to a group with little prior knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These virtual experts can be seen either as an external source of information accessible to individuals (e.g., the Internet, social networks, media, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  or as a very cohesive (all having the same opinion V) and overconfident (all having S=0) subgroup of the population, such as can happen with groupthink (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these experts provide reliable information to the group, a systematic improvement in collective performance and accuracy is obtained experimentally and is quantitatively reproduced by our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, if the experts are not too numerous and the information that they give is slightly above the true value, the model predicts that social influence can help the group perform even better than when the truth is provided, as this incorrect information compensates for the human cognitive bias to underestimate quantities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also showed that the sensitivity to social influence is strongly related to confidence and accuracy: the most confident subjects are generally the best performers and tend to weight the opinion of others less.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the group has access to more reliable information, this behavior becomes detrimental to individual and collective accuracy, as too confident individuals lose the opportunity to benefit from this information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, we showed that individuals, even when they have very little prior knowledge about a quantity to estimate, are able to use information from their peers or from the environment to collectively improve the group performance as long as this information is not highly misleading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, getting a better understanding of these influential processes opens perspectives to develop information systems aimed at enhancing cooperation and collaboration in human groups, thus helping crowds become smarter (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Future research will have to focus on the experimental validation of our theoretical predictions when providing incorrect information to the group, with the intriguing possibility of actually improving its performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would also be interesting to study the impact on the group performance of the number of estimates given as social information (instead of only their mean) and of revealing the confidence and/or reputation of those who share these estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
