Role of vascular density and normalization in response to neoadjuvant bevacizumab and chemotherapy in breast cancer patients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Emerging evidence indicates patients who benefit from antiangiogenic therapies have improved vessel function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine how bevacizumab modulates vessel morphology to improve vessel function we conducted a phase II trial of preoperative bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in HER2-negative breast cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the clinical response to bevacizumab may occur through an increase in the extent of vascular normalization primarily in patients with a high baseline tumor microvessel density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If validated, these observations suggest approaches to improve antiangiogenic therapy and to identify patients likely to benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preoperative bevacizumab and chemotherapy may benefit a subset of breast cancer (BC) patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore potential mechanisms of this benefit, we conducted a phase II study of neoadjuvant bevacizumab (single dose) followed by combined bevacizumab and adriamycin/cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel chemotherapy in HER2-negative BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regimen was well-tolerated and showed a higher rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in triple-negative (TN)BC (11/21 patients or 52%, [95% confidence interval (CI): 30,74]) than in hormone receptor-positive (HR)BC [5/78 patients or 6% (95%CI: 2,14)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the HRBCs, basal-like subtype was significantly associated with pCR (P = 0.007; Fisher exact test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and tissue biopsies before and after bevacizumab monotherapy and circulating plasma biomarkers at baseline and before and after combination therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bevacizumab alone lowered IFP, but to a smaller extent than previously observed in other tumor types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathologic response to therapy correlated with sVEGFR1 postbevacizumab alone in TNBC (Spearman correlation 0.610, P = 0.0033) and pretreatment microvascular density (MVD) in all patients (Spearman correlation 0.465, P = 0.0005).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, increased pericyte-covered MVD, a marker of extent of vascular normalization, after bevacizumab monotherapy was associated with improved pathologic response to treatment, especially in patients with a high pretreatment MVD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that bevacizumab prunes vessels while normalizing those remaining, and thus is beneficial only when sufficient numbers of vessels are initially present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study implicates pretreatment MVD as a potential predictive biomarker of response to bevacizumab in BC and suggests that new therapies are needed to normalize vessels without pruning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bevacizumab_Combined_with_ACP_Showed_Superior_Antitumor_Activity_in_TNBC_Compared_with_Hormone_Receptor-Positive_BC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A total of 104 patients were registered on study between November 2007 and June 2011 (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One patient did not initiate study treatment and was removed from the analysis; another patient withdrew consent; one was ineligible after rediagnosis with HER2+ BC; and two other patients were not evaluable for response because they did not complete therapy as per protocol due to toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, 99 patients represent the efficacy population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 91 patients (88%) completed all protocol therapy (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 103 patients who initiated study treatment, 52 patients (50.5%) experienced grade 3 adverse events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The toxicities observed in this study were consistent with that observed in prior studies of similar bevacizumab/chemotherapy regimens (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pCR was observed in 16 of 99 patients, with greater responses seen within the TNBC cohort [52%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3074%] than within the hormone receptor-positive BC (HRBC) cohort (6%, 95% CI: 214%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents a 15-fold increase in the odds of pCR in TNBC over HRBC (P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar differences were seen in residual cancer burden (RCB) (P less_than 0.0001) and MillerPayne (MP) scores (P = 0.0005).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gene_Expression_Profile_Analysis_Showed_Differential_Response_in_BC_Subtypes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PAM50 gene signature, which measures expression profiles for 50 genes and classifies tumors into four intrinsic subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like), was available for 70 patients in the efficacy population (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this group, there were 13 pCRs (19%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of responses did not differ between subjects with and without PAM50 data available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 13 pCRs, 11 were seen within the basal-like subset, 1 within the luminal A subset, and 1 within the luminal B subset (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, responses varied by subtype in terms of pCR (P less_than 0.0001), MP (P = 0.0001), and RCB (P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the HR-positive subset with PAM50 data (n = 54), there was insufficient power to contrast pCR among luminal tumors (one pCR each, luminal A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even within these HRBCs, basal-like subtype was significantly associated with pCR (P = 0.007; Fisher exact test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bevacizumab_Treatment_Exerts_Effects_Consistent_with_Vascular_Normalization_in_BC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In patients with available biopsy and/or plasma samples, we examined the effects of bevacizumab treatment on biomarker levels related to vascular normalization (Tables S4S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified all vessels in two biopsy sections per patient with custom software that automatically segmented CD31+ endothelial cells, SMA+ perivascular cells (pericytes), and vessel lumen, combined them into vascular structures, and allowed manual confirmation of every selection (Fig S2 and SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bevacizumab reduced the intratumoral MVD (number of vessels per square millimeter; Fig 1A), but not the density of mature vessels [pericyte-covered MVD (PC-MVD) and number of SMA+ vessels per square millimeter; Fig 1B and Table S4], indicating pruning of immature vessels, which lack pericytes, but not of mature vessels (Fig S2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pruning of immature vessels likely increases the fraction of vessels that are pericyte-covered (number of SMA+ vessels per number of vessels), but VEGF blockade may also promote maturation of nascent vessels through active pericyte recruitment, thereby increasing PC-MVD (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through both mechanisms, bevacizumab increased the average proportion of vessel perimeter associated with pericytes (SMA+ vessel surface length per total vessel length; Fig 1C), leading to a reduction in IFP (Fig 1D), presumably due to a decrease in vascular permeability (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, biomarkers of functional normalization such as fraction of proliferative cells (Ki67-positive) and fraction of tissue area positive for endogenous hypoxia marker HIF-1 did not significantly change (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only biomarker that differed between subtypes significantly in opposite directions was Ki67, because the fraction of proliferative cells increased in TNBC and decreased in HRBC (Fig S3E and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, bevacizumab also tended to increase cellular proliferation in lesions of colorectal cancer patients (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among circulating biomarkers, bevacizumab therapy alone decreased plasma angiopoietin 2 (Ang-2), soluble Tie2 receptor (sTie2), and IL-1 and increased plasma VEGF, placental growth factor (PlGF), and carbon anhydrase (CA)IX (Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During combination therapy, plasma Ang-2, TNF-, IL-1, IL-8, and stromal-derived factor (SDF)1 decreased, and plasma VEGF, PlGF, soluble (s) sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and IGF1 increased (Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes after bevacizumab alone or combination therapy were consistent between BC subtypes, with the exception of sVEGFR2 (which did not increase in TNBC patients) and TNF- (which did not decrease in HRBC patients) following combination therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, plasma Ang-2, IGF1, sVEGFR2, and IL-8 decreased whereas plasma VEGF, PlGF, sVEGFR1, bFGF, sTie2, IL-6, TNF-, and CAIX increased (Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once again, the changes were largely consistent between BC subtypes, with the exception of sTie2 (not decreased in HRBC patients) and IGF1 (not increased in TNBC patients).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Baseline_MVD__but_Not_Markers_of_Normalization__Associates_with_Pathologic_Response_in_All_Patients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the sample size precluded rigorous inferential statistical analysis, we explored the association between biomarkers and tumor regression in this patient population to generate hypotheses about potential mechanisms of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of all biomarkers, only baseline tumor MVD of both total and patent (i.e., with open lumen) vessels associated with both the RCB and MP tumor regression scores in all patients with evaluable samples (n = 52, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postbevacizumab monotherapy, the increase in the fraction of cells positive for the proliferation marker Ki67 correlated with RCB (more relevant to prognosis after neoadjuvant therapy) but not MP (more relevant to neoadjuvant therapys effectiveness in killing cancer cells in primary tumors) regression scores (n = 45, Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In TNBC, the baseline HIF-1 area fraction (n = 11) and the postbevacizumab increase in PC-MVD (n = 7) were associated with both tumor regression scores (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among circulating biomarkers in TNBC, tumor regression scores were associated with high plasma VEGF (at baseline) and low sVEGFR1 and PlGF levels (postbevacizumab monotherapy) (n = 21, Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In TNBC at baseline, sVEGFR1 levels were associated with the fraction of the average proportion of vascular perimeter associated with pericytes (Spearmans rho = 0.857, P = 0.024, n = 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other proangiogenic or inflammatory factor demonstrated any association with pathologic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Response_to_Bevacizumab_in_BC_May_Depend_on_Extent_of_Vascular_Normalization_Only_in_Patients_with_High_Baseline_MVD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The only biomarker of vascular normalization that correlated with response was change in PC-MVD after bevacizumab monotherapy, but the association held only in the 7 TNBC patients (Table 1) and not the 32 HRBC patients with data available at both baseline and postbevacizumab alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that baseline MVD could be an important distinguishing factor between TNBC and HRBC, because baseline MVD was 62.5% greater in TNBC (Fig S3A) and correlated with RCB and MP scores in all patients (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesize that low baseline MVD might be related to the lack of association of PC-MVD and tumor regression scores in HRBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate this hypothesis, we classified high MVD HRBC patients as those with a baseline MVD greater than or equal to the lowest baseline MVD of a TNBC patient with pCR (MP = 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used a standard cutoff point (MP  greater than 3) to differentiate patients with the greatest tumor response (reduction in tumor cellularity) postcombination therapy (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using MP score rather than the RCB score focused the analysis on the effect of combination therapy on the primary tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated whether PC-MVD increased in 19 patients (all 7 TNBC and the 12 high MVD HRBC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventeen of 19 patients followed the pattern of stable or increased PC-MVD postbevacizumab alone in tumors with MP  greater than 3 and decreased PC-MVD in tumors with MP 3 (Fig S4 A and B and Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable or increased PC-MVD implies pericyte recruitment to vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, fewer than half (8 of 20) of HRBC patients with low MVD followed this pattern (Table S8), which suggests that increased PC-MVD might not be related to tumor regression scores in patients with low baseline MVD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of pericyte-covered vessel perimeter in TNBC and high MVD HRBC patients also followed this pattern (Fig S4 C and D), whereas functional normalization biomarkers did not, nor was there an apparent connection between structural and functional biomarkers (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Averages of these vascular biomarkers in all patients, regardless of baseline MVD, within the same groups of good (MP  greater than 3) or poor (MP 3) response postcombination therapy were consistent with these results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At baseline, the tumor MVD was significantly higher in patients with MP  greater than 3 (Fig 2A and Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these patients tumors, bevacizumab significantly reduced the MVD and increased the fraction of pericyte-covered vessel perimeter (Fig 2 A and B and Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the vascular pruning, PC-MVD trended toward an increase in patients with MP  greater than 3, suggesting pericyte recruitment contributed to the increased pericyte coverage (Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, PC-MVD postbevacizumab monotherapy was significantly higher in patients with MP  greater than 3 than in those with MP 3 (Fig 2C and Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the association between fold change of PC-MVD and tumor regression, which only occurred in TNBC (Table 1), in HRBC patients the pericyte-covered vessel perimeter significantly increased postbevacizumab in MP  greater than 3 tumors and PC-MVD was also significantly higher in MP  greater than 3 than in MP 3 tumors (Table S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results in HRBC are consistent with our hypothesis that low baseline MVD contributes to the lack of association between change in PC-MVD and tumor regression scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, in TNBC and high MVD HRBC patients with improved pathologic response postcombination therapy, bevacizumab induced vascular remodeling, which led to a higher density of normalized vessels (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enrollment required a pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two cohorts of patients were eligible: patients with HRBCs and patients with TNBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For eligibility, an HRBC diagnosis was required [i.e., expression of estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone receptors (PR) by standard immunohistochemical methods].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eligible TNBCs had to be negative for ER, PR and HER2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low positive (less_than10%) hormone receptor status was considered HRBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with HRBC were eligible if they had high-risk disease, defined as either having clinically positive axillary lymph nodes by pathological analysis, with a primary tumor 1.5 cm or no evidence of axillary lymph node involvement with a high grade tumor 1.5 cm, or a low/intermediate grade tumor with a primary tumor 2.5 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients could not have evidence of metastatic disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with bilateral cancers were eligible provided that at least one cancer met the eligibility requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with TNBC were required to have a tumor 1.5 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with a clinically negative axilla were required to have a sentinel lymph node biopsy performed either before starting preoperative therapy or at the time of definitive surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For patients with a clinically positive axilla, a needle aspiration or core biopsy was required before initiation of therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with a positive sentinel node or needle biopsy at baseline were required to undergo a level I and II axillary lymph node dissection at the time of definitive surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other requirements included adequate hematopoietic, hepatic, and renal function and a left ventricular ejection fraction 50%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients were ineligible if they had HER2-positive disease defined as HER2-amplified by FISH or immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+, a history of prior myocardial infarction, uncontrolled hypertension, neuropathy greater than or equal to grade 2, significant bleeding within 6 mo of study entry, or urine protein:creatinine ratio 1.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Treatment_Regimen  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Treatment consisted of a single dose of bevacizumab 10 mg/kg, followed 2 wk later by doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 wk × 4, followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 wk × 3, followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 × 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary breast surgery was performed no less than 4 wk and no more than 8 wk after the last dose of bevacizumab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients could undergo either lumpectomy or modified radical mastectomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All surgical specimens and diagnostic specimens were reviewed by a central pathologist and response was determined by both the MP scale and the RCB scale (50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pCR was defined as no residual invasive cancer in the breast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Patients and physicians were cautioned about proceeding with immediate reconstruction given potential wound healing complications with bevacizumab exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiation therapy was determined by the patients treating physician.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tumor_Genomic_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All enrolled patients consented to undergo a research core biopsy at baseline and after one cycle of bevacizumab (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five to eight cores were obtained; one core was fixed in formalin and all other cores were frozen in optimum cutting temperature compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression profiles were generated by mRNA sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq Kit to create libraries for paired-end sequencing on an Illumina HiSEq 2000 and data were aligned and genes quantified as previously described (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predictor of Parker et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (53) was used for subtype categorizations using a nearest-centroid procedure and the centroid with the largest correlation value and returned as a five-level classifier (basal-like, luminal a, luminal b, HER2-enriched, and normal-like).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interstitial_Fluid_Pressure_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In brief, to measure the IFP, a 23-gauge needle with a 2-mm side hole at 5 mm from the tip was used (54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The needle and tubing filled with sterile heparinized saline were connected to a disposable pressure transducer and an electronic data acquisition and recording system (AdInstruments Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The needle and tubing were gas-sterilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calibration of the pressure transducer was verified before IFP measurements in each patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The needle was then inserted under ultrasound guidance into the tumor center and the IFP was recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable IFP measurements with a good fluid communication between the tumor interstitial space and needle were considered valid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IFP was measured in two or three different locations within the tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tissue_Biomarkers_Evaluation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following the completion of the IFP measurements, research core tumor biopsies were obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five-micrometer-thick sections were cut from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A double immunostaining procedure was performed with CD31 (N1596; Dako) and SMA (M0850; Dako) antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, the CD31 antibody was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Slides were then washed and incubated in secondary antibody (K4007, EnVision anti-mouse; Dako) for 30 min and developed with 3,3-diaminobenzidine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were then blocked with EnVision doublestain block for 5 min and incubated overnight with the SMA antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washes, slides were incubated in secondary antibody (Doublestain AP Polymer; Dako) for 30 min, washed, and developed with Fast Red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and coverslipped with Faramount (Dako).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the percentage of proliferating cancer cells and hypoxia induced factor (HIF)-1 fraction, immunostaining was performed with a Ki67 antibody (N1633; Dako) and a HIF-1 antibody (610958; BD Biosciences), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histological_Image_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bright-field or fluorescent digital images of stained slides were acquired with a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer slide scanner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were reviewed before analysis and slides with clear nonspecific staining or tissue folding were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microvessel metrics and proliferation analyses were performed semiautomatically using custom software from Visiopharm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The software automatically detected the tissue area, areas positive for Ki67 or CD31, areas stained positive for SMA/pericytes, and areas of vessel lumen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The automatic selection was checked and modified by an investigator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MVD was counted for vessels that displayed at least two of the following three characteristics: positive CD31 stain, visible lumen, and elongated endothelial cell nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two entire biopsy sections, separated by 100 m and excluding areas of fatty tissue and nonspecific staining, were quantified and averaged for each measurement to account for spatial heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the MVD results from the computer-assisted analysis, manual counting was also performed by two trained investigators and correlated with the computer analysis (spearmans rho = 0.63, P = 0.0016).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation between the two manual counts was also tested (spearmans rho = 0.74, P = 8.5 × 109).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vessel perimeter fraction was calculated as the mean ratio of vessel wall length associated with SMA-positive perivascular cells to the total length of the vessel wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values were obtained for every vessel and vessel values were averaged for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proliferation was assessed as the fraction of nuclei positive for Ki67 staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the immunofluorescent stain of HIF-1, analysis was performed with custom algorithms in MATLAB (MathWorks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue selection was performed semiautomatically based on DAPI counterstaining, and selection of positively stained areas was performed automatically based on intensity and size thresholds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity threshold was selected based on the maximum nonspecific staining intensity measured in three to five negative control slides that were incubated with only secondary antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area fraction is the fraction of tissue area positive for the stain, and the intensity is the mean signal intensity of positively stained area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The investigators who performed the analyses were blinded from patient, treatment, and time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plasma_Biomarkers_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peripheral blood was obtained from all patients enrolled and evaluated as previously described (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, blood samples were collected in EDTA-containing tubes before any treatment (baseline), after bevacizumab treatment alone (day 14), during dose-dense chemotherapy with bevacizumab (day 70), and before surgery (posttreatment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma samples were separated by centrifugation then aliquoted and stored at 80 °C until they were used for multiplex array and single analyte ELISA measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were carried out for circulating VEGF, sVEGFR-1 (sFLT1), PlGF, and bFGF using the Human Angiogenesis Kit (K15190D), for IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- using the Human ProInflammatory Panel kit (K15049G) from Meso-Scale Discovery, and for SDF1, CAIX, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 using ELISA kits from R&D Systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples were run in duplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The primary objectives were to determine pCR rates in the HRBC and TNBC cohorts and to test the hypothesis that the luminal B subtype is more responsive to preoperative therapy than luminal A subtype among HR+ patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study was designed to have 85% power to detect a difference of 10% pCR in luminal A and 40% pCR in luminal B under the assumption the two subgroups are equally represented in the HR+ cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rates of pCR in IHC and molecular subtypes are reported with binomial 95% CIs, and odds ratios significance was assessed using Fishers exact tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Response by MP was evaluated on an ordinal scale using CochranMantelHaenszel 2 tests, and by RCB on a continuous scale using KruskalWallis ranked tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes of biomarkers within groups and comparisons between groups were tested with paired and unpaired, two-sided Students t tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To separate patients with more and less tumor regression we used a cutoff value of the MP grading scale of residual cellularity in resected primary lesions following neoadjuvant therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to other studies (57, 58), we selected MP  greater than 3 as a cutoff for a better response, which includes grade 4 (90% reduction in tumor cells from baseline) and grade 5 (no invasive cancer cells remaining).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each biomarker, patients were only included if there was data available both pre- and postbevacizumab therapy alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BC is a complex disease composed of several biologically distinct subtypes (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For patients with HRBC, only 510% of patients will achieve a pCR to preoperative chemotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent neoadjuvant phase III trials showed that bevacizumab increases rates of pCR in HER2-negative BC, yet the results were inconsistent regarding which subtype benefits (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study found that even with the addition of bevacizumab to dose-dense ACP chemotherapy, only 6.4% of HRBC patients achieved a pCR, in contrast to 52% of TNBC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study was not powered to compare pCR rates between luminal A vs. luminal B BCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, among patients with either HRBC or TNBC, PAM50 data suggested an increase in response in those with the basal-like subtype, relative to other subtypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Serial biopsies enabled exploratory investigation of bevacizumabs effects and mechanism of action in BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with other tumor types, in BC bevacizumab pruned immature vasculature, induced maturation of vessels (as evidenced by increased pericyte coverage), reduced IFP, and changed levels of circulating biomarkers PlGF, VEGF, and Ang-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the magnitude of the decrease in IFP was less than that seen in rectal cancer (20, 22), which may indicate that either BC vessels are less sensitive to VEGF blockade or bevacizumab distribution in BC tissue is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effects of bevacizumab, though consistent with vascular normalization, did not correlate with pathologic response in all patients, because baseline MVD was the only biomarker to correlate with both RCB and MP scores in the 52 patients with data available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this patient cohort is too small for rigorous statistical analysis, these results suggest that a sufficiently high baseline MVD might be necessary for bevacizumab to aid primary tumor regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A phase II trial in 20 BC patients also noted an association between expression of the endothelial cell marker CD31 and tumor regression (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In patients with other tumor types treated with bevacizumab and cytotoxic therapy, correlations between baseline MVD and response have also been documented (24, 25), whereas other studies have found no relationship between MVD or MVD surrogates and response (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exploratory nature of our current analysis notwithstanding, the association between MVD and tumor regression scores is consistent with the notion that vascular remodeling postbevacizumab can convert some nonfunctional vessels into functional ones, but it cannot create new vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the function of the vascular network in tumors with high MVD and redundant vasculature (Fig 3, top left) might benefit from the pruning of certain vessels and increased function of the remaining, normalized vessels (Fig 3, top right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, tumors with low MVD (Fig 3, bottom left) might have their already limited number of vessels pruned, which would outweigh the benefit of increased function of normalized vessels (Fig 3, bottom right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, our results also offer a potential explanation for the failure of antiangiogenesis therapy postoperatively (2), because micrometastatic lesions might have very low MVD and lack angiogenesis (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, a significant fraction of BCs are desmoplastic (29, 30), which might cause vessel compression and reduce the patency of vessels (3133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our current study, patent MVD had a stronger association with tumor regression than total MVD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, because a fraction of BCs are likely hypoperfused, the response to normalizing therapy might be more sensitive to baseline MVD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of our correlative analyses suggested that the fold increase in PC-MVD might be associated with tumor regression in TNBCs (which are highly vascularized) (Table 1), but not in HRBCs (which tend to be poorly vascularized).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we reasoned that HRBC patients with baseline MVD greater than or equal to that of TNBC patients with pCR might follow a pattern similar to that of TNBC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, this high MVD threshold in HRBC is lower than the lowest MVD of all patients assessed in a recent colorectal study (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this descriptive analysis of high baseline tumor MVD in the HRBC cohort, the majority of patients with a good response in the primary tumor after combination therapy (MP  greater than 3) had maintained or increased PC-MVD (Table S8 and Fig 3, top left to top right), whereas patients with a poor response to therapy (MP 3) had decreased PC-MVD (Table S8 and Fig 3, top left to bottom right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern only held in about half of low MVD HRBC patients (Table S8 and Fig 3, bottom left to bottom right), which suggests no association between changes in PC-MVD and tumor regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The averaging of the biomarkers of all patients followed the trend of higher baseline MVD, increased pericyte-covered vessel perimeter after bevacizumab, and higher postbevacizumab monotherapy PC-MVD in patients with MP  greater than 3 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our exploratory findings support the concept that bevacizumab-induced increase in PC-MVD is necessary but not sufficient for chemotherapy-induced tumor regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The evidence of PC-MVD increases in patients with better responses to combination therapy indicates that, rather than vascular pruning, VEGF blockade is inducing pericyte recruitment to immature vessels to increase the fraction of pericyte-covered vessel perimeter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge this is the first clinical evidence of antiangiogenic therapy-induced pericyte recruitment, which has previously only been demonstrated preclinically (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One limitation of the present study is the lack of functional imaging to confirm the significance of the structural vascular changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because HIF-1 at best weakly correlates with oxygen electrode measurements, our HIF-1 measurements may not reflect functional changes accurately (3436).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are no clinical studies investigating the relationship between PC-MVD and tumor oxygenation, preclinical studies demonstrated that increased PC-MVD is associated with increased vascular function and oxygenation (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our result of increased PC-MVD correlating with tumor regression is consistent with a cediranib study in glioblastoma, which identified a vascular normalization index as a measure of the extent of vascular normalization (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This index is proportional to a reduction in vessel permeability, which is related to high levels of pericyte coverage in preclinical models (39), and an increase in cerebral blood volume, which is indicative of increased MVD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, this functional imaging index mirrors our histological assessment of increased PC-MVD in BC patients with good response to combination therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar imaging studies of cediranib in glioblastoma also linked improved survival with treatment-induced increases in perfusion and oxygenation (11, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our studys design with paired biopsies separated by 2 wk did not allow examination of a normalization window over an extended time period, our findings are consistent with these other studies functional associations with tumor regression, as early changesnot absolute valuesof normalization markers associated with regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results indicate that tumor regression from VEGF blockade might be restricted to tumors with a sufficiently high MVD and might occur through pericyte recruitment rather than vascular pruning, leading to an increased extent of vascular normalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found several biomarkers that associated with tumor regression in TNBC, including high VEGF levels at baseline and low sVEGFR1 and PlGF levels before combination treatment (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes of sVEGFR1 levelsa factor linked with vascular normalization (37) that we proposed as a resistance biomarker to neoadjuvant bevacizumab in rectal cancer (40)was directly associated with pericyte coverage and inversely associated with response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two phase III randomized trials of bevacizumab have shown that specific VEGFR1 SNPs correlated with high VEGFR1 expression and poor outcome (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have reported inverse associations between plasma sVEGFR1 and treatment outcomes after anti-VEGF therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal (vandetanib plus cetuximab/irinotecan), hepatocellular carcinoma (cediranib monotherapy), sarcoma (sorafenib), and lung cancer (bevacizumab plus chemotherapy) (12, 4244).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, although plasma PlGF (a growth factor not blocked by bevacizumab) consistently increased in these BC patients, the extent of this increase was associated with lower tumor regression scores in TNBC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This association with less regression warrants further exploration of this potential mechanism of resistance to anti-VEGF therapy in TNBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, bevacizumab induced changes in vascular structure and levels of circulating biomarkers indicative of vascular normalization in BC, although these changes were small compared with other tumor types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline MVD was associated with tumor regression, indicating that many BCs may be insufficiently vascularized to yield improvement in perfusion or oxygenation because anti-VEGF therapy-induced pruning of immature vessels may outweigh the number of normalized vessels, leaving an insufficient number of functional vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In patients with relatively high baseline MVD, response may result from adequate number of normalized vessels, as evidenced by increased PC-MVD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the potential mechanistic link between sufficient MVD and changes in PC-MVD with tumor regression needs to be confirmed through simultaneous biopsies and functional imaging studies in larger clinical studies (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed association of circulating biomarkers with regression in TNBC is consistent with previous studies in BC and other tumor types and reveals a potential connection between sVEGFR1 and vascular maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest that in poorly perfused BCs and other hypoperfused tumors (e.g., pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma), strategies that increase perfusion without pruningtargeting alternative angiogenic pathways (46), directly inducing differentiation of intratumoral sources of pericyte progenitors (47), and increasing vessel patency by reducing solid stress (3133) or enhancing lumen formation (48)should be explored (1, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
