Stability of ferrous-iron-rich bridgmanite under reducing midmantle conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This paper reports an unexpected change in the oxidation state of Fe in bridgmanite, the most dominant mineral in the lower mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxidation state change resolves the discrepancy between laboratory and seismic studies on the chemical composition of the lower mantle, showing that the lower mantle has major element chemistry similar to the upper mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxidation state change will also lead to a lower Fe content in bridgmanite in the midmantle, whereas the total Fe content remains the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a change can lead to an increase in viscosity at 1,100- to 1,700-km depths, providing a viable mineralogical explanation on possible viscosity elevation suggested by geophysical studies at the same depth range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our current understanding of the electronic state of iron in lower-mantle minerals leads to a considerable disagreement in bulk sound speed with seismic measurements if the lower mantle has the same composition as the upper mantle (pyrolite).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the modeling studies, the content and oxidation state of Fe in the minerals have been assumed to be constant throughout the lower mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report high-pressure experimental results in which Fe becomes dominantly Fe2+ in bridgmanite synthesized at 4070 GPa and 2,000 K, while it is in mixed oxidation state (Fe3+/Fe=60%) in the samples synthesized below and above the pressure range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little Fe3+ in bridgmanite combined with the strong partitioning of Fe2+ into ferropericlase will alter the Fe content for these minerals at 1,100- to 1,700-km depths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our calculations show that the change in iron content harmonizes the bulk sound speed of pyrolite with the seismic values in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments support no significant changes in bulk composition for most of the mantle, but possible changes in physical properties and processes (such as viscosity and mantle flow patterns) in the midmantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Synchrotron Mössbauer spectra of bridgmanite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Bridgmanite recovered to 03 GPa after synthesis at different pressures and 2,0002,300 K (bottom four spectra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also included synthetic spectra of bridgmanite at 1 bar with different amount of Fe3+ using IS and QS values from McCammon (4) (top two spectra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Bridgmanite at in situ high pressure after laser heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synthesis pressures for the samples are shown on the right side (circles, measured intensities; curves, fitted spectra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ferric iron content of aluminous bridgmanite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters were measured for the samples quenched to 03 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gray scale for the symbols of the previous data points (1, 2, 48) represents Al# for 3O basis bridgmanite formula (black for Al#  0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We plot only Al#  0.05, except for Piet et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light red and gray curves are guides for the eye for the datasets from this study and other studies (79), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
EELS of Fe in bridgmanite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was recovered from 47 GPa and 2,000 K and compared with olivine (Fe3+/Fe=0%), andradite (Fe3+/Fe=100%), and cronstedtite (Fe3+/Fe=50%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the spectra were measured under the same instrumental conditions (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure at 708 keV in andradite is a prepeak of Fe3+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Seismic and mineralogical structures in the lower mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Comparison of bulk sound speeds of seismic measurement [PREM (17); circles] and pyrolite models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three different pyrolitic models are presented: depth-dependent changes in Fe3+/Fe of bridgmanite (red curve), constant Fe in bridgmanite (0.04Fe2+#) and ferropericlase (0.27Fe#) (solid blue curve), and constant Fe in bridgmanite (0.045Fe2+# and 0.045Fe3+#) and ferropericlase (0.15Fe#) (dashed blue curve).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Materials and Methods for details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light red area represents estimated uncertainties, including those from thermoelastic parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Changes in the crystal chemistry of bridgmanite and ferropericlase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bridgmanite, the tilted squares and the diamond-shaped areas between them represent the B and A sites, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ferropericlase, the 45° rotated squares represent the MgO6 octahedra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Changes in viscosity (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black curve is for a density scaling of 0.2 and harmonic degrees of 27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light gray area represents a range of different values found in all of the models in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Changes in radial correlations of the P and S wave tomography models (PMEAN and SMEAN) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Starting_Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used two different starting materials with the same composition: 28.8 wt% MgO, 53.6 wt% SiO2, 12.8 wt% FeO, and 4.8 wt% Al2O3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We synthesized 15 bridgmanite samples (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 3-oxygen formula unit of bridgmanite, the synthesized bridgmanite contained 0.19Fe and 0.10Al, which are both elevated from the samples studied previously, including pyrolitic compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elevated amounts of Fe are important to obtaining sufficient quality of Mössbauer spectra for accurate determination of the oxidation state of Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Al/Fe ratio overlaps with the range of the values reported for bridgmanite synthesized from pyrolitic starting materials (2, 7, 8, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fe3+/FeFe of bridgmanite synthesized at the lowest pressure of our study (35 GPa) followed the trends found in bridgmanite reported in previous redox-controlled experiments (1, 5) (see SI Appendix, Fig S7 and sections S4.1S4.4 for detailed discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both starting materials are enriched with Fe57: 67 and 95% for pyroxene and glass-starting materials, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SMS data of these materials indicate that the pyroxene contains no detectable amount of Fe3+ and the glass-starting material contains Fe3+/Fe  10% (SI Appendix, Fig S3 and section S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ensure reducing conditions, we mixed our starting materials with predried Fe metal powder (25 wt%) following the method used in multianvil syntheses by Frost et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (1) (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A potential disadvantage of mixing metallic Fe with the starting materials is the complexity of measured SMS due to Mössbauer signal from Fe in both metal and bridgmanite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce the problem, we used metallic Fe with a natural level Fe57 (2%) and starting materials with Fe57 enrichment (6795%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also limited the amount of metallic iron to 5 wt%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The powder mixture was compressed between diamond anvils to make a rigid foil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The foil was loaded into the hole in a preindented Re gasket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The foil was propped by three to four grains of the starting materials to allow Ar or Ne to flow in to separate the foil from the diamond anvils during cryogenic or gas loading (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The separation of the sample foil from the diamond anvils is particularly important to prevent direct contact between the diamond anvils and the sample foil and therefore to ensure lower thermal gradient during laser heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One sample was loaded with a KCl medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KCl was dried at 1,073 K for 24 h before loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some ruby chips were loaded on the gasket or the edge of the sample chamber as pressure sensors, to avoid direct contact between the ruby chips and our sample foils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pressures were measured by using both ruby (34) and diamond pressure scales (35) after temperature quench.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

High-Pressure_Synthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At a target pressure, double-sided laser heating was conducted to 2,0002,300 K at sectors 13 and 16, Advanced Photon Source (APS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By scanning the infrared laser beams (1,065 nm), we transformed the entire foil of the starting material + Fe metal powder mixture into bridgmanite + Fe metal powder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of hot spot was 2025 m, and the sample was translated by 25 m during scanning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first scan, each spot was heated for 510 min until the starting material transformed to bridgmanite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the second scan, each spot was heated for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scan was repeated for multiples of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each spot was heated for a total of 1030 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal radiation spectra from both sides of the sample were measured by using an imaging spectrometer and fitted to the Planck black-body radiation function to obtain temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid memory effects from preexisting electronic configuration of Fe and the crystal structure, once bridgmanite was formed at a target pressure, the samples were never heated again at different pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pressure before and after heating was measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found pressure changes less_than5 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, pressure in the DAC during laser heating should be higher due to thermal pressure (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown a 5 GPa increase for heating to 2,0002,300 K (38), which is included in the estimated error bars presented in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Synchrotron_XRD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diffraction patterns were measured during laser heating and after temperature quench for nine different samples at different pressures, ranging between 31 and 105 GPa, to ensure the synthesis of bridgmanite (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were conducted at beamlines 13IDD (39) and 16IDB (40) of the APS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At GSECARS, monochromatic X-ray beams with a wavelength of 0.3344 Å were focused to an area of 3×4 m2 on the sample in LHDAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the High-Pressure Collaborative Access Team (HPCAT), monochromatic X-ray beams with a wavelength of 0.3515 Å were focused to an area of 5×6 m2 on the sample in LHDAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Powder diffraction images were collected by using MarCCD detectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser beams were aligned coaxially with the X-ray beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SMS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nuclear forward scattering was conducted at sector 3 of APS (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 14.4-keV X-ray beam was focused on an area of 6×6 m2 in the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The storage ring was operated in top-up mode with 24 bunches separated by 153 ns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear resonant scattering was measured in a time window of 15130 ns with a typical data collection time of 812 h. We conducted SMS on both the temperature-quenched samples at high pressure (in situ SMS) and decompressed samples at 03 GPa in DAC (quench SMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 14 samples were successfully measured at in situ high pressure in DAC after laser heating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten samples were successfully quenched to 03 GPa, where SMS was conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectral fitting was performed by using the CONUSS package (41) (see SI Appendix, section S3 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EELS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We expanded the beam size at the sample to 100200 nm in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) mode with sufficiently low accelerating voltage at 120 kV to reduce the electron dosage of the sample, while allowing enough total intensity to provide good signal-to-noise ratios for the spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were performed in a JEOL ARM200 ACEM with a Gatan Enfinium spectrometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy resolution was 0.70.9 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We avoided the area with metallic iron grains to obtain the EELS spectra from pure bridgmanite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured the EELS spectra of minerals with known oxidation states of Fe (olivine, pyroxene, andradite, and cronstedtite) using the same instrumental conditions and used them for spectral fitting to extract Fe3+/Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of ferric iron (Fe3+/Fe) was determined by the EELS analysis methods in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EDS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The measurements were conducted in a JEOL ARM200 ACEM for spot measurements and a JEOL JEM-2800 TEM for X-ray mapping (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ARM, EDS was performed with a JEOL 50 mm2 windowless light-element-sensitive X-ray detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray compositional mapping was conducted in a JEOL JEM-2800 system combined with a JED-2300T detector at 200 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam size was 0.5 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EDS spectra were analyzed by using the method in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lower-Mantle_1D_Profile_Calculations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The bulk sound speed and density profiles were calculated for pyrolite by using the Burnman toolkit (44) combined with the parameters listed in SI Appendix, Table S2 (14, 45, 4547) along the mantle geotherm (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We corrected volume and elasticity for compositional differences using a linear assumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed that thermal parameters were not sensitive to compositional differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted calculations for a CaOMgOAl2O3SiO2FeO system with oxide ratios from the pyrolite composition in Ringwood (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bulk composition was fixed throughout the lower mantle for all of the pyrolite profiles we calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iron partition coefficients were 0.58 (2) and 0.12 (23) for Fe3+-rich (HIBZs) and Fe2+-rich (LIBZ) bridgmanite systems, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the partition coefficients and the pyrolite composition, we obtained: 0.045Fe3+# and 0.045Fe2+# in bridgmanite and 0.15Fe# in ferropericlase for HIBZs, and 0.04Fe2+# in bridgmanite and 0.27Fe# in ferropericlase for LIBZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All Al2O3 entered bridgmanite, and all CaO was incorporated into CaSiO3 perovskite in our models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our Fe# values for bridgmanite and ferropericlase in HIBZ were consistent with the Fe# reported for pyrolite with Fe3+-rich bridgmanite in Irifune et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2), 0.090.10 and 0.120.14, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ferropericlase in the study had slightly lower Fe# than ours because it contained other cations, such as Si, Al, Ni, Cr, and Na, the total content of which was 0.020.06 cation#.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our calculation, we assumed that Si and Al did not enter ferropericlase and did not consider minor oxide components with weight percent less than 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The bulk sound speed and density of ferropericlase were calculated for their corresponding iron contents (0.15 and 0.27 Fe# in Fig 4A and SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the softening of bulk modulus (reduction of bulk sound speed) in ferropericlase in mixed spin using the methods and parameters presented in previous studies (18, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both theory and experiments have shown that spin transition pressure increases with Fe content in ferropericlase (5053).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature also increases the spin transition pressure and the interval of the spin transition zone (54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we consider data obtained at high pressuretemperature (18, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there are no direct measurements for our two compositions, we adapted the spin transition pressures reported for 0.1875 and 0.25 Fe# ferropericlase at mantle-related high temperatures (18, 20) for 0.15 (HIBZ) and 0.27 (LIBZ) Fe#, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Density profiles of all three presented pyrolite models are in agreement, consistent with previous results (18, 20), in that ferropericlase spin transition does not have significant impact on density (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
