title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two Ck1 transcripts regulated by m6A methylation code for two antagonistic kinases in the control of the circadian clock  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most abundant modification in mRNA is the N6-methylation of internal adenosines (m6A), but m6As physiological function is unknown for most mRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that Casein Kinase 1 Delta mRNA (Ck1), coding for a critical kinase in the control of circadian rhythms, is regulated by m6A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When m6A is inhibited, the expression of two CK1 isoforms, uncharacterized until now, increases due to enhanced translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in CK1s leads to a slower clock because of increased phosphorylation of the clock protein PER2 at a key residue, leading to the stabilization of PER2 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The N6-methylation of internal adenosines (m6A) in mRNA has been quantified and localized throughout the transcriptome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the physiological significance of m6A in most highly methylated mRNAs is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was demonstrated previously that the circadian clock, based on transcription-translation negative feedback loops, is sensitive to the general inhibition of m6A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the Casein Kinase 1 Delta mRNA (Ck1), coding for a critical kinase in the control of circadian rhythms, cellular growth, and survival, is negatively regulated by m6A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of Ck1 mRNA methylation leads to increased translation of two alternatively spliced CK1 isoforms, CK11 and CK12, uncharacterized until now.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression ratio between these isoforms is tissue-specific, CK11 and CK12 have different kinase activities, and they cooperate in the phosphorylation of the circadian clock protein PER2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CK11 accelerates the circadian clock by promoting the decay of PER2 proteins, CK12 slows it down by stabilizing PER2 via increased phosphorylation at a key residue on PER2 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations challenge the previously established model of PER2 phosphorylation and, given the multiple functions and targets of CK1, the existence of two isoforms calls for a re-evaluation of past research when CK11 and CK12 were simply CK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_3-UTR_of_Ck1_Is_Methylated  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify clock-related transcripts regulated by m6A, we quantified m6A levels in mouse liver mRNA at two time points, CT4 and CT16 (CT is circadian time, and CT0 and CT12 correspond to the beginning of the rest and the active phase, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant m6A peaks were found at CT4 (8,414) and at CT16 (8,821).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most peaks (72%) were detected at both time points (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several transcripts involved in circadian regulation showed significant peaks at CT4 and CT16 (SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Clock (20), Dbp (21), Ck1 (17), and Fbxl3 (22, 23) are potent regulators of the circadian period, m6A methylation of these transcripts is likely to be of importance for clock function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these four transcripts, the most significant peak, according to the q value of the peak-calling analysis (SI Appendix, Fig S1A), was the single peak in the 3-UTR of Ck1 (SI Appendix, Fig S1B), but no significant peaks were detected in the mRNA of its close homolog, Ck1 (SI Appendix, Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given these observations, together with the relevance of Ck1 for human FASPS and its role as a hub kinase (24), we selected Ck1 for further investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

m6A_Regulates_the_Expression_of_Two_CK1_Isoforms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the role of m6A in the control of Ck1 expression, we treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with Deazaneplanocin A (DZnep), an inhibitor of methylation known to inhibit m6A and elongate the circadian period length in these cells (14, 25), and observed an increase in CK1 proteins (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was opposite to our expectations, since available evidence published so far in mammals has associated higher CK1 expression with a faster clock (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While replicating these results, we noticed that, under certain conditions during migration of proteins in the acrylamide gel, two bands, not one, were seen on the membrane, both bands increasing under DZnep treatment (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing these two bands with the bands obtained from cells transfected with CK1 expression vectors, we later identified the two bands as two isoforms of CK1 (Fig 3), CK11 (415 aa) and CK12 (409 aa), reported in databases but of functions unknown, sharing 99.75% identity with human CK1s, and conserved in virtually all vertebrates (SI Appendix, Fig S1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only difference between these isoforms is a small 63-bp exon in mouse, retained in Ck12 immediately upstream of the 3-UTR and containing a STOP codon (SI Appendix, Fig S1B), thus coding for the smaller kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that the results above were dependent upon mRNA m6A inhibition, we silenced in MEFs the catalytic subunit of the mRNA m6A methyltransferase, Mettl3 (27, 28), and measured CK1 protein levels by immunoblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, two specific bands were detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of Mettl3 increased the intensity of the two bands, demonstrating m6A negatively regulates CK1 expression (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the mRNA level, Mettl3 silencing mildly increased Ck11 and had little effect on Ck12 (Fig 1C) and significantly delayed the initial steps in Ck11 and Ck12 degradation (SI Appendix, Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the half-life of Ck12 was significantly longer than that of Ck11, which we confirmed in a longer time course (SI Appendix, Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the increase in CK1s under m6A inhibition cannot be readily explained by changes in steady-state transcript levels or mRNA stability, we measured the impact of Mettl3 silencing on translation of Ck1 transcripts by polysome fractionation (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a recent report showing that m6A attenuates translation efficiency (29), Mettl3 silencing significantly increased the amount of Ck1 transcripts only in fractions containing the heavier polysomes, while Ck1 was not significantly affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 3-UTR of Ck1 transcripts is over 2,000 nucleotides long, but its function in the regulation of CK1 expression is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed reporter mRNAs in which the luciferase coding sequence was flanked by the 5- and 3-UTRs of Ck1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To closely mimic Ck11 and Ck12, the end of the coding sequence of each Ck1 was also included downstream of the luciferase STOP codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also designed Ck1luc transcripts lacking most of the 3-UTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reporter mRNAs were transcribed in vitro and then added to reticulocyte lysates to assess the efficiency of their translation by luminometry (SI Appendix, Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deletion of the 3-UTR caused a significant increase in Ck11luc (approximately sixfold) and Ck12luc (approximately threefold) luminescence, demonstrating the role of the 3-UTR as a negative regulator of CK1 translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ablation_of_Ck1_m6A_Methylation_by_CRISPR-Cas9_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, to investigate the physiological role of the methylated locus in the 3-UTR of Ck1, we generated a mutant mouse strain with a 43-bp deletion in the genomic region corresponding to the methylated peak (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This deletion does not affect the coding sequence but removes the N6-methylated adenosine at GGm6ACA, located previously by screening of m6A sites in brain and liver transcriptomes (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consequences of this mutation on Ck1 m6A levels, mRNA, and protein expression were investigated in the liver, since it is known to have high mRNA m6A levels (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, Ck1 transcripts had lower m6A levels in 43/43 animals compared with wild type (Fig 2B), but the level of Ck1 mRNAs was not significantly affected (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CK1 protein levels increased significantly: homozygous 43 mutant mice had higher CK1 levels in the liver and the brain (Fig 2C), despite an inversed CK11/CK12 ratio (Fig 3), and had a longer period (23.97 h ± 0.02) of locomotor activity behavior rhythms compared with wild-type mice (23.64 h ± 0.08, Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although noncoding, this mutation, weakening m6A-dependent posttranscriptional processes limiting CK1 expression, was sufficient to cause an observable increase in CK1 proteins, accompanied by a change in circadian locomotor activity behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How an increase in the expression of endogenous CK1s is able to elongate period length is investigated in the next part of this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CK11_and_CK12_Are_Two_Different_Kinases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data presented above go against expectations based on period elongation observed in liver explants from Ck1 knock-out mice (31) and on CK1 overexpression causing a shorter period (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overexpression studies, however, did not specify which isoform was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of two isoforms has been suggested before in a circadian context (32), but has been ignored until now.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, since CK11 is considered canonical and has been the de facto focus of past works, CK12 is the major isoform in the liver, where both transcripts show relatively constant levels across 24 h (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN), this relationship is reversed (Fig 3B; see also Fig 2C), and the molar ratio of Ck12/Ck11 is tissue-specific (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both CK1s can interact with PER2 (Fig 3D), but no evidence of CK11/CK12/PER2 complexes was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the role of CK1s in the circadian clock, immortalized MEFs prepared from PER2::LUCIFERASE knock-in reporter mice (33) were stably transfected with CK11 or CK12 expression vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of CK11 led to a shorter period (Fig 3E) compared with colonies stably transfected with the empty vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CK12 led to an 1-h period elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While both isoforms could phosphorylate PER2 (Fig 3F), the intensity of the phosphorylated bands was higher with CK12 and CK11 + CK12, suggesting higher kinase activity for CK12 and/or faster PER2 degradation with CK11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A picture emerges in which CK1 isoforms may not simply be two redundant kinases but may phosphorylate PER2 differently and in cooperation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Work on CK1 and - have shown that PER2 phosphorylation can either accelerate or decelerate the clock depending on which residue is targeted (15, 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pS478 in mice leads to faster degradation of PER2 by the ubiquitin ligase -Trcp (3638), while pS659, named FASPS because its mutation in humans (S662G) causes FASPS, stabilizes PER2 and elongates period (16, 18, 34, 3840).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S659 and three to four nearby downstream residues are phosphorylated in vivo, but work in vitro using CK1 or CK1 has shown that CK1 needs a priming phosphorylation at S659 by an unknown priming kinase before phosphorylating downstream residues in the cluster, which is necessary for PER2 stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro experiments concluding that CK1 could not phosphorylate S659, however, used a truncated CK1 containing only the N-terminal kinase domain and thus gave no insights into the respective functions of CK1 isoforms (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CK11_and_CK12_Lead_to_Different_PER2_Phosphorylation_Patterns  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain insights into the respective functions of CK1s, we refined a previously published mathematical model of the regulation of PER2 by branched phosphorylation fates (38) to allow the rate of each phosphorylation step to be independently tuned (SI Appendix, Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As explained in SI Appendix, Supplemental Results, our model predicted that CK12 could be the priming kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we transfected PER2::LUC MEFs with the vector mixes used in Fig 3E, immunoprecipitated MYC-PER2, and quantified PER2 phosphopeptides after trypsin digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetra-, tri, di-, and unphosphorylated FASPS peptides were detected (Fig 4A, SI Appendix, Fig S4, and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of unphosphorylated FASPS peptide was highest without CK1s, and lowest with CK1s together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diphosphorylated peptide, always detected without pS659, had similar levels with or without CK1s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of triphosphorylated peptides showed some variations between replicates but was always highest when both CK11 and CK12 were present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the tetraphosphorylated FASPS peptide, with confirmed pS659 (SI Appendix, Fig S4B), showed the most pronounced isoform-dependent differences in abundance among all PER2 phosphopeptides detected (SI Appendix, Fig S4A and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was undetected without CK1 and highest when CK1s were transfected together, indicating that both isoforms are required for full FASPS phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we confirmed the results above with immunoblotting using an anti-triphospho FASPS antibody (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since this antibody was raised against the human FASPS sequence, we used an untagged human PER2 (hPER2) expression vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphorylated FASPS cluster was not detected when hPER2 was transfected alone (Fig 4B), indicating that endogenous kinases are not sufficient to noticeably phosphorylate exogenous PER2 (same with Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3F and 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When transfected with CK11, a new band appeared corresponding to FASPS phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This band increased in intensity with CK12 and with CK11 + CK12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Validating these results, CK1s mutated to K38R, which has been reported to blunt kinase activity (42), were unable to normally phosphorylate the FASPS cluster (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, wild-type CK1s could not phosphorylate a S662G-mutated hPER2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data demonstrate that CK11 and CK12 cooperate in the phosphorylation of PER2, with CK12 promoting FASPS phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, the activity of CK1s on the phosphorylation of S659 in mouse PER2 was investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate our results independently, we transfected HEK293 cells with different vectors encoding myc-tagged CK11 or CK12, together with myc-tagged mPER2, and probed cell lysates with a novel antibody specifically raised against pS659 (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite lower exogenous expression of CK12, these data revealed clearly that the activity of CK12 on S659 is remarkably higher than that of CK11 (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data demonstrate that the activity of CK12 as a priming kinase is higher than that of CK11, but that both isoforms are required for the full phosphorylation of the FASPS cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lack_of_CK12_Shortens_the_Period  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next sought to silence endogenous Ck12 by siRNA in PER2::LUC MEFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Ck1s knock-down elongated the circadian period in a manner consistent with previous observations (31), silencing only Ck12 significantly shortened the period (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of Ck12 knock-down on endogenous FASPS phosphorylation and PER2 levels was also measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knocking down Ck12 in human U-2 OS cells caused an observable decrease in FASPS, despite CK11 being still present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ascertain that the band that we detected is truly FASPS-phosphorylated endogenous PER2, as positive controls Ck1s and Per2 were also silenced, leading, as expected, to a decrease in the FASPS band intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, diluted lysate of cells transfected with wild-type or S662G mutant hPER2 expression vector, with or without CK1 expression vectors, confirmed the identity of the endogenous FASPS band (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to our results so far, the consequences of PER2 phosphorylation by CK11 or CK12 on PER2 stability should be different: more stable when phosphorylated by CK12 than by CK11 due to increased FASPS phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this by transfecting hPER2 together with CK11 or CK12 and then treating the cells with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PER2 stability was highest without cotransfected CK1 (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When comparing CK11 vs. CK12, not only the intensity of phosphorylated PER2 was higher with CK12, as observed in Fig 3F, but the stability of total PER2 was higher in the presence of CK12 (Fig 5C), which explains the former observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, CK12 did not stabilize transfected hPER2 as expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the large amounts of transfected vectors may affect normal regulation or PER2 proteins, we sought to investigate the stability of PER2::LUC proteins in stably transfected cells described in Fig 3E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These control, CK11-, and CK12-overexpressing PER2::LUC cell lines were synchronized by a dexamethasone shock, and after 30 h (time of the first PER2 peak), were treated with CHX to assess PER2::LUC stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with our hypothesis, while CK11 destabilized PER2::LUC, CK12 had a remarkable effect on its stabilization (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we sought to confirm that the long-period phenotype of the 43/43 mice originates from a more stable PER2 protein due to an increase in CK1 (2) expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary skin fibroblasts were prepared from adult 43/43 and wild-type mice, synchronized, and then treated after 30 h with CHX and sampled every hour to measure PER2 stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous observations, 43/43 cells had increased CK1 expression compared with wild type, both wild-type and 43 cells mostly expressing CK12 (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with our hypothesis, PER2 was more stable in 43/43 cells (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have shown that two alternative Ck1 transcripts are regulated by m6A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the methylation of Ck1 3-UTR is inhibited or prevented by mutation, the expression of CK1 isoforms increases, affecting the circadian clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely, given that Dbp, Fbxl3, and Clock transcripts are also methylated, that global inhibition of mRNA m6A methylation would still affect the clock in 43/43 animals, as the general disruption of mRNA processing caused by the lack of m6A would still occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the lack of CK1 is embryonic lethal (31), higher expression or increased activity has been linked to cancer progression, migraine, and circadian disruption (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we demonstrated here, the expression of CK1 isoforms is kept to a low level by its methylated 3-UTR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of these observations goes beyond the circadian field, given the manifold functions of CK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further investigations should reveal what the respective physiological functions of CK1 isoforms are, and additional discussion on the role and regulation of CK1Ds can be found in SI Appendix, Supplemental Discussion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Animals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experiments were approved by the animal experimentation committee of Kyoto University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twelve-week-old C57BL/6 males were maintained at 23 °C ± 1 °C with 50% ± 10% relative humidity, on a 12-h light/12 h dark cycle (lights on 8:00, lights off 20:00), food and water ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Fig 3 A and B, lights were permanently switched off from 8 PM on day 0, and animals were sampled from 8 AM (corresponding to circadian time 0) on day 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice with a 43-bp deletion in the 3-UTR of Csnk1d by CRISPR-Cas9 were generated with the same method used for similar genetic editing (44) as briefly explained in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locomotor activity recording and analysis were obtained from animals housed individually in light-tight, ventilated cages with ad libitum access to food and water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animals were entrained on a 12-h light (200 lx fluorescent light)/12-h dark cycle for at least 1 wk to synchronize the circadian clock to the ambient lightdark cycle, before turning lights off for the remainder of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locomotor activity was recorded in 5-min bins with passive infrared sensor (FA-05 F5B; Omron) and analyzed with Clocklab software (Actimetrics) on MatLab (Mathworks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Free-running period was quantified by 2 periodogram over the entire recording in constant darkness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
