A parasitic nematode releases cytokinin that controls cell division and orchestrates feeding site formation in host plants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sedentary plant-parasitic cyst nematodes are microscopic roundworms that cause significant yield losses in agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful parasitism is based on the formation of a hypermetabolic feeding site in host roots from which the nematodes withdraw their nutrients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The host cell cycle is activated at the site of infection and contributes to the formation of the syncytium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we provide genetic evidence that nematode-derived cytokinin is involved in activating the host cell cycle during infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings show the ability of an animal to synthesize and secrete a functional plant hormone to establish long-term parasitism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sedentary plant-parasitic cyst nematodes are biotrophs that cause significant losses in agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parasitism is based on modifications of host root cells that lead to the formation of a hypermetabolic feeding site (a syncytium) from which nematodes withdraw nutrients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The host cell cycle is activated in an initial cell selected by the nematode for feeding, followed by activation of neighboring cells and subsequent expansion of feeding site through fusion of hundreds of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is generally assumed that nematodes manipulate production and signaling of the plant hormone cytokinin to activate cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, nematodes have been shown to produce cytokinin in vitro; however, whether the hormone is secreted into host plants and plays a role in parasitism remained unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal activation of cytokinin signaling during interaction between the cyst nematode, Heterodera schachtii, and Arabidopsis using cytokinin-responsive promoter:reporter lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results showed that cytokinin signaling is activated not only in the syncytium but also in neighboring cells to be incorporated into syncytium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analysis of nematode infection on mutants that are deficient in cytokinin or cytokinin signaling revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility of these plants to nematodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we identified a cytokinin-synthesizing isopentenyltransferase gene in H. schachtii and show that silencing of this gene in nematodes leads to a significant decrease in virulence due to a reduced expansion of feeding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings demonstrate the ability of a plant-parasitic nematode to synthesize a functional plant hormone to manipulate the host system and establish a long-term parasitic interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cytokinin_Signaling_Is_Activated_at_Nematode_Feeding_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess whether cytokinin signaling is activated in Arabidopsis in response to sugar beet cyst nematode infection, we used the recently described Two Component signaling Sensor new:Green Fluorescent Protein (TCSn:GFP), which reflects the activity of type B response regulators (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCSn:GFP plants were grown in 35-mm glass bottom microwell dishes and infected with J2 nematodes of H. schachtii, and the fluorescence of GFP was analyzed in a time-course analysis at 4, 6, and 10 d after inoculation (dai) representing J2, J3, and J4 stages of nematode development, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a strong GFP signal in the developing feeding sites at all time points, which extended into immediately surrounding cells (Fig 1A), indicating that cytokinin signaling is specifically and early activated during the plant-nematode interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate which of the three receptors (AHK2, AHK3, AHK4) mediates cytokinin signaling during nematode infection, we analyzed the activity of the cytokinin-sensitive marker construct ARR5:GUS in Col-0 and in three different double receptor mutant backgrounds (ahk2/3, ahk2/4, and ahk3/4) (10, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a majority of root infection zones (70%) exhibited GUS staining at 1 dai in Col-0 (SI Appendix 1, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar strong GUS expression was detected in almost all syncytia and neighboring areas at 3, 5, and 10 dai (Fig 1B and SI Appendix 1, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison with Col-0, there was a reduction in the number of positively stained infection sites in ahk2/4 lines at all time points examined (SI Appendix 1, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the strongest reduction was observed in ahk3/4 lines, where GUS expression was absent (Fig 1B and SI Appendix 1, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of ARR5:GUS in uninfected control roots was the same as described before (SI Appendix 1, Fig S3) (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that cytokinin signaling is activated during the early stages of feeding site development and that this activation is mainly mediated by AHK3 and AHK4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether cytokinin AHK receptors are expressed in syncytia, previously described transgenic Arabidopsis AHK2:GUS, AHK3:GUS, and AHK4:GUS reporter lines were analyzed in response to H. schachtii infection at 3, 5, and 14 dai (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infected AHK2:GUS seedlings showed weak GUS activity at the feeding site as early as 3 dai, which gradually declined as the parasitic nematodes reached third (J3) and fourth (J4) developmental stages at 5 and 14 dai, respectively (SI Appendix 1, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AHK3:GUS and AHK4:GUS seedlings showed GUS expression in syncytia at 3 and 5 dai (SI Appendix 1, Fig S4), with reduced levels by 14 dai, as the nematodes reached the fourth juvenile stage (J4) (SI Appendix 1, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cytokinin_Signaling_Is_Required_for_Nematode_Development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the role of cytokinin in cyst nematode parasitism, we screened loss-of-function cytokinin receptor double mutants (ahk2/3, ahk2/4, and ahk3/4) in nematode infection assays (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plants were grown and infected with J2 nematodes, and the number of males and females was counted at 14 dai.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, cysts were counted at 30 dai.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no significant difference in the number of females per plant at 14 dai between Col-0, ahk2/3 and ahk2/4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it was significantly decreased in ahk3/4 at 14 dai compared with Col-0 plants (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the average number of cysts was significantly decreased in all three mutants compared with Col-0 (SI Appendix 1, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also a significant decrease in the average size of female nematodes in ahk3/4 plants, whereas this decrease did not occur in ahk2/3 or ahk2/4 plants (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the average size of the female-associated syncytia was significantly decreased in all three mutants compared with Col-0 plants (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, AHK-mediated cytokinin signaling is activated during parasitism and is required for cyst nematode development and syncytium formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cytokinin_Degradation_Leads_to_a_Decrease_in_Nematode_Susceptibility  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the infection assays using the double-receptor mutants showed a decrease in female numbers, size, and associated syncytium size, one active receptor was still present in these plants, which might compensate for the loss of gene function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with the AHK:GUS analysis showing expression of all three receptors at nematode feeding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triple receptor KO mutants are extremely dwarf, precluding any meaningful analysis (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we examined transgenic lines overexpressing four different cytokinin oxidase genes (CKXs) driven by a constitutively expressed CaMV 35S promoter (35S:CKX1, 35S:CKX2, 35S:CKX3, and 35S:CKX4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A transgenic line overexpressing the CKX3 gene driven by a root-specific promoter (PYK10:CKX3) was also used (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lines were subjected to the nematode infection assay, and we found a significant decrease in the susceptibility of various CKX lines compared with Col-0 (Fig 2 DF and SI Appendix 1, Fig S6), supporting the idea that a threshold level of cytokinin is critical for nematode infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Cycle_Activation_and_Progression_at_Nematode_Feeding_Sites_Is_Mediated_by_Cytokinin  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cytokinin is a key regulator of cell cycle activation and progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been previously shown that the cell cycle is activated during nematode infections, which contributes to the development of syncytia and galls (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that impairment in cytokinin signaling might influence the division of cells in and around the nematode feeding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the expression of the cyclin B1;1 gene (CycB1;1), which is activated during G2 phase of the cell cycle and reaches its maximum at the G2-to-M phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, CycB1;1 expression occurs only in dividing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously described CycB1;1:GUS lines as a marker of cell division were used to monitor cell cycle activation in response to H. schachtii infection via a time course analysis at 1, 3, 5, and 10 dai (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No staining was detected at the infection region in CycB1;1:GUS transformed Col-0 roots at 1 dai.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the majority of the infection sites showed positive GUS staining (60%) at 3 dai.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of GUS-positive infection sites increased to 75% at 5 dai (SI Appendix 1, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 and S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that staining was not only present at the edges of developing syncytia; but the entire feeding site was also stained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirm previous observations that cells around the syncytium actively divide to become incorporated into the expanding syncytium (4, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether this cell division was mediated by cytokinin, we introgressed the CycB1;1:GUS reporter line (24) into the cytokinin double receptor mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no change in the frequency or intensity of GUS staining in the CycB1;1:GUS transformed ahk2/3 lines; however, both the intensity and occurrence were decreased in CycB1;1:GUS transformed ahk2/4 and ahk3/4 lines (SI Appendix 1, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 and S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cytokinin_Deficiency_Leads_to_Smaller_Syncytia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the structural changes during syncytium development, we carried out a time course experiment by performing light microscopic analyses of resin-embedded sections of syncytia induced in roots of Col-0 and cytokinin-deficient plants (PYK10:CKX3 and ahk3/4) at 3, 5, and 10 dai.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Col-0 plants, in the region next to the nematode head, parenchyma vascular cylinder cells not incorporated into syncytia frequently divided and formed groups of dividing cells (SI Appendix 1, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remote from the nematode head, the syncytium was located centrally in the vascular cylinder and was enclosed by a continuous layer of pericycle-derived dividing cells forming a periderm-like secondary cover tissue (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In syncytia induced in PYK10:CKX3 and ahk3/4 lines, this cover layer appeared to be thinner and was composed of fewer cells than in Col-0 plants (SI Appendix 1, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, syncytia induced in PYK10:CKX3 and ahk3/4 lines were composed of less hypertrophied cells than syncytia induced in Col-0 plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Host_Plant_Is_a_Source_of_Cytokinin_for_Feeding_Site_Expansion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results to this point indicated that cytokinin signaling activates the host cell cycle during nematode infection and that this activation is vital for the expansion of the syncytium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it was not clear whether the host plants produced the cytokinin or if they were secreted by the nematodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clarify the source of the cytokinin during nematode infection, we infected Arabidopsis multiple-KO mutants of members of the ATP/ADP-IPT (ipt3/5/7) and tRNA-IPT (ipt2/9) gene families with H. schachtii (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our infection assay results showed that the average number of nematodes and the average size of females did not significantly differ between ipt3/5/7, ipt2/9, and Col-0 plants (Fig 3 A, B, and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the average size of syncytia was significantly reduced in ipt3/5/7 compared with Col-0 plants (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the cytokinin involved in the expansion of the nematode feeding site is partially produced by the host plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Cytokinin_Content_of_Plant_Tissues_Increases_on_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify and classify the cytokinin involved in nematode and syncytium development, root segments containing syncytia at 5 and 10 dai were dissected from Col-0, ipt3/5/7, and PYK10:CKX3 plants, and their cytokinin content was compared (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obtained data showed that in Col-0 the total cytokinin, content increased significantly at 5 dai compared with control roots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a further sevenfold increase in the total cytokinin in root segments containing syncytia at 10 dai compared with 5 dai (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed look showed that the total cytokinin consisted of 50% tZ-type, 25% iP-type, and 25% cZ+DHZ-type in all analyzed tissues (SI Appendix 1, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same trend was observed for the levels of free bases tZ, iP, and cZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the levels of DHZ were below the detection limit (SI Appendix 1, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that, although the ipt3/5/7 lines exhibited the lowest amount of total cytokinin in uninfected roots, the amount of cytokinin on infection was the lowest in the syncytia developing in the roots of PYK10:CKX3 line compared with those in Col-0 and ipt3/5/7 plants (Fig 3E and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirmed the results of our infection assays, which suggested that the decrease in susceptibility to nematodes was much more pronounced in PYK10:CKX3 compared with ipt3/5/7 plants (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 DF and 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noteworthy, the concentrations of free bases (tZ and iP) were strongly decreased in ipt3/5/7 plants compared with Col-0 in uninfected roots and at 10 dai.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decrease was not observed at 5 dai when the levels of one of the free bases (iP) were even significantly increased in ipt3/5/7 (SI Appendix 1, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations support the findings of previous studies suggesting that cytokinin may be produced and released by nematodes into the host plants especially during the early stages of infection (13, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm these observations, we measured the cytokinin content of nematodes and found that cytokinin was present in the preinfective J2 of H. schachtii (SI Appendix 1, Fig S11 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total cytokinin in H. schachtii consists of 90% of iP-type cytokinin, which is consistent with a functional role in parasitism (SI Appendix 1, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Silencing_HsIPT_Disrupts_the_Infection_Process  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether nematodes contribute to the levels of cytokinin detected at the infection site, we used the tRNA-IPT sequence from Caenorhabditis elegans to identify an ortholog in the recently annotated H. schachtii transcriptome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a single gene in H. schachtii (HsIPT) encoding a tRNA-IPT (SI Appendix 1, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to access the Heterodera glycines draft genome for further analysis and identified one putative full-length and two partial IPT protein sequences suggesting that HgIPT belongs to a small gene family (SI Appendix, Experimental Procedures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alignment between HgIPT on scaffold 40 and the HsIPT sequence identified a high percentage similarity between the sequences (SI Appendix 1, Fig S13A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A blast against the Affymetrix Soybean GeneChip Consensus Probe database (www.affymetrix.com) identified two probesets for HgIPT: HgAffx.20363.1.S1_at and HgAffx.23529.1.S1_at.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then searched the microarray dataset generated previously to determine the expression profile of HgIPT throughout H. glycines development (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two probesets fell into developmental expression clusters 1 and 4 (SI Appendix 1, Fig S13B), indicating that expression of this gene is highest during the early stages of infection and declines as the nematode proceeds through its life cycle, which is consistent with a role for nematode-secreted cytokinin during the initial establishment of feeding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further, we experimentally tested the potential of HsIPT as a source of cytokinin during the plant-nematode interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we performed in vitro RNAi targeting of HsIPT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results showed that RNAi caused a significant decrease in transcript abundance of the HsIPT gene in J2 of H. schachtii (SI Appendix 1, Fig S14A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then asked whether targeting of HsIPT by RNAi influenced the survival and infectivity of J2 nematodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test viability, we treated J2 nematodes with dsRNA targeted against GFP or IPT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These nematodes were incubated in water and monitored for survival over the course of 30 d. The survival of the nematodes measured by the percentage of live nematodes did not vary significantly between dsRNA-IPT and dsRNA-GFPtreated nematodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test infectivity, we assessed whether there were defects in syncytium establishment by monitoring the cessation of stylet movements for nematodes that invaded the roots 4 h after inoculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not see any difference in the syncytial cells establishment between dsRNA-GFP and dsRNA-IPTtreated J2 nematodes (SI Appendix 1, Fig S14 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We infected the ARR5:GUS and CycB1;1:GUS transgenic Arabidopsis plants with J2s soaked in dsRNA targeting GFP or IPT and performed GUS staining at 1, 3, 5, and 10 dai to analyze whether silencing of the IPT gene interferes with the expression of ARR5:GUS and CycB1;1:GUS on nematode infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that the intensity, as well as the number of GUS-positive infection sites, decreased at various time points in plants infected with J2 nematodes soaked in dsRNA targeting HsIPT compared with GFP-treated nematodes (SI Appendix 1, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S15 and S16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results strongly suggest that HsIPT is involved in producing cytokinin that is secreted into host plants to activate cytokinin signaling and, as a consequence, the cell cycle required for successful parasitism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we used in situ hybridization to localize HsIPT transcripts in J2 of H. schachtii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antisense riboprobe of HsIPT labeled with digoxigenin hybridized in the entire nematode body; however, the signal was particularly strong in the dorsal esophageal gland cells of H. schachtii (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infected Arabidopsis Col-0 with nematodes soaked in dsRNA directed against GFP or HsIPT and counted the number of developed nematodes at 14 dai.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a significant decrease in the number of female nematodes found on plants infected with J2 nematodes soaked in dsRNA targeting IPT compared with GFP (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the average size of the females and the size of the syncytia were significantly reduced (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated whether the silencing of HsIPT also had an effect on sugar beet infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection assays showed that silencing of HsIPT caused no change in the size of female nematodes but the number of females and the size of the syncytium were reduced in a pattern resembling that of Arabidopsis (SI Appendix 1, Fig S16 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze whether silencing of HsIPT reduces the cytokinin levels in nematodes, we treated J2 of H. schachtii with dsRNA against GFP or IPT and measured the level of cytokinin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A very strong and significant decrease (60%) in the concentration of free base iP (one of the major active forms of cytokinin in the infection zone) occurred in nematodes treated with dsRNA against IPT compared with GFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was no significant decrease in the total cytokinin content of J2 nematodes irrespective of the treatment (Fig 4F and Dataset S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support our idea that the HsIPT gene is involved in the production of cytokinin in nematodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The role of cytokinin in the formation of galls induced by RKN on plant roots has been demonstrated previously (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was found that Lotus japonicus plants expressing Arabidopsis ARR5:GUS showed little or no activation of cytokinin signaling during penetration and migration of J2s of RKN inside roots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a high level of GUS expression was observed once the nematode reached the vascular cylinder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, overexpression of CKX genes rendered hairy roots resistant to nematode infection (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, mechanistic details for a role of cytokinin in the plant-nematode interaction remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study we establish a molecular framework for cytokinin function during the cyst nematode-plant interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that activation of cytokinin signaling on cyst nematode infection is mediated mainly by the AHK3 and CRE1/AHK4 cytokinin receptors and that this positively regulates the establishment and development of nematode feeding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detection of a strong signal of cytokinin reporter genes (ARR5:GUS and TCSn:GFP) in and around the expanding syncytium is in line with previous observations and strongly suggests the involvement of cytokinin in cell cycle reactivation after nematode infection (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, analysis with a CycB1;1:GUS reporter showed a strong reduction in cell cycle reactivation in cytokinin receptor double mutants (ahk3/4) after nematode infection, which supported our observations of decreased susceptibility of ahk3/4 double mutants to nematodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also propose that nematodes produce cytokinin that is released into host cells at the site of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cytokinin is subsequently involved in the activation of the cell cycle in cells adjacent to the feeding site, thereby playing an important role in the expansion of the syncytium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of this hypothesis, we found that silencing of the HsIPT gene in nematodes strongly reduced the levels of the free base iP and diminished cytokinin signaling, which in turn reduced activation of the cell cycle and caused a reduction in the infectivity of nematodes to plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also found that the size of syncytia in ipt3/5/7 plants was reduced significantly compared with Col-0, suggesting that the cytokinin secreted by nematodes is not sufficient for optimal development and expansion of the syncytium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results, we postulate that nematode-derived cytokinin is particularly important during the early stages of feeding site initiation and that host-derived cytokinin plays a more dominant role during later stages of syncytium expansion and maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is supported by cytokinin measurements of host roots segments, which showed that ipt3/5/7-derived cytokinin contributes more to the total cytokinin in control roots (72%), as well as in infected tissues at 10 dai (65%) compared with 5 dai (44%) (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the same trend was observed in levels of iP-type cytokinin, especially in levels of the free base iP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cytokinin receptor CRE1/AHK4 has been shown to have high affinity to iP (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the observation that ahk4 mutants are particularly impaired in their response to nematode infection supports a role for nematode-derived cytokinin, in particular for iP, in nematode parasitism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results also raise the question of whether the amount of cytokinin secreted by the nematode is physiologically relevant to play a significant role in feeding site development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous analysis showed that H. schachtii produces cytokinin in the amount of 1.8 × 1018 mol/J21h1, whereas the average concentration of cytokinin in roots is 1018 mol/nL (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an average volume of a root cell ranging between 0.0005 and 0.5 nL, additional cytokinin produced by the nematode may therefore be sufficient to activate the cell cycle at the feeding site during the initial stages of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is supported by the observation that expression of the HgIPT gene is highest during the early stages of infection and that it declines after the nematodes become sedentary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is also plausible that once the nematode becomes sedentary and starts feeding, the profile and secretion of cytokinin may change through changes in expression of the nematode IPT gene in specific tissues, such as gland cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because H. glycines microarray analysis was performed using RNA from entire nematodes, changes in gene expression in local tissues might not be reflected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The discovery that nematodes produce and release cytokinin raises the question of how a nematode tRNA-IPT produces iP-type cytokinin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Arabidopsis, two different pathways that are responsible for the formation of distinct types of cytokinin have been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the tRNA-IPT pathway was shown to be mainly responsible for the bulk of cZ-type cytokinin, the ATP/ADP-IPT pathway is responsible for the bulk of cytokinin including the tZ and iP types (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to Arabidopsis, the bryophyte Physcomitrella patens possesses only tRNA-IPTs and therefore predominantly produces cZ-type cytokinin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the iP-type and tZ-type cytokinins are still present and are also the most active forms in this moss (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent study, it was also suggested that a tRNA-independent pathway exists in case of P. patens (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it may be that the nematode tRNA-IPT enzyme catalyzes the production of a broader range of cytokinins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Thus far, the best-characterized microbial system for the production of cytokinin is the crown gall-forming bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It contains a cytokinin synthetic IPT gene in its Ti-plasmid, which is integrated into plant genomes during infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar IPT genes have been found in other bacteria of the same genus (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to bacteria, phytopathogenic and mutualistic fungi have also been shown to produce and secrete cytokinin into their host plants (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, evidence that an animal can produce cytokinin and use it to manipulate the plant hormone system to establish a parasitic interaction is not yet known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings are reminiscent of those in plant-bacterial and plant-fungal interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show the ability of a nematode to produce and secrete its own cytokinin and not just to manipulate the hosts cytokinin production system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sum, this work provides, to our knowledge, first genetic evidence of cytokinin synthesis by an animal to induce and maintain long-term parasitic interactions with their host plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clarifying further details of the nematode cytokinin synthesis pathway, including details of the activity of HsIPT, and studying its action on host cell development will provide exciting information on cyst nematode parasitism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant_Material_and_Growth_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A. thaliana plants were grown in Petri dishes containing agar medium supplemented with modified Knops nutrient medium under conditions described previously (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CKX lines and ARR5:GUS, AHK:GUS, TCSn:GFP, CycB1;1:GUS, ahk, and ipt mutant lines have been described before (811, 1924).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CycB1;1:GUS reporter line (24) was introgressed into the cytokinin double receptor mutants ahk2-5 ahk3-7, ahk2-5 cre1-2, and ahk3-7 cre1-2 (10), and lines homozygous for the reporter gene and the receptor mutations were selected in subsequent generations using selection marker genes and genotyping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Nematode_Infection_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nematode infection assays on Arabidopsis plants were performed as previously described (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sugar beet seeds were surface sterilized in 6% (vol/vol) sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) for 30 min and were grown in 0.2 Knop medium and infected with nematodes under the same conditions as described for Arabidopsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We used the amino acid sequences of tRNA-IPT from C. elegans (GenBank accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T27538) and Arabidopsis (IPT2) to identify their ortholog in H. schachtii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis resulted in a single gene coding for 449 amino acids (HsIPT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further sequence analysis showed that HsIPT retains the consensus pattern of tRNA-IPTs as suggested previously (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The silencing of HsIPT in H. schachtii was performed as described previously (33), including some modifications (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcript abundance of HsIPT after silencing was analyzed using StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were analyzed in three technical replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An Actin gene was used as an internal control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative expression was calculated by the Pfaffls method (35), where the expression of the HsIPT gene was normalized to the actin gene to calculate fold change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reliability of Actin as a reference gene in response to dsRNA-GFP and dsRNA-IPT treatment was confirmed by using a 60S acidic ribosomal protein-encoding gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same primers for 60S gene were used as described previously for cyst nematode Globodera rostochiensis (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All primer sequences are listed in SI Appendix 1, Fig S18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cytokinin_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Arabidopsis plants were grown and infected with H. schachtii, as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The root segments containing infection sites were cut at 5 or 10 dai.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventeen-day-old uninfected root segments were used as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the cytokinin measurement of H. schachtii, preinfective J2s were collected from cysts under sterile conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extraction, purification, and quantification of endogenous cytokinin was performed as described previously (37) with modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentrations of the various cytokinins were calculated using a standard isotope dilution method (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
