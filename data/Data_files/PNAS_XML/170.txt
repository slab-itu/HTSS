Cell-typerestricted anti-cytokine therapy: TNF inhibition from one pathogenic source  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anti-cytokine therapy has revolutionized the treatment of autoimmune diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent data suggest that cytokines, in particular TNF, produced by various cell types may play distinct and sometimes opposite roles in the inflammatory responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In certain autoimmune diseases TNF produced by monocytes and macrophages plays a pathogenic role, whereas TNF produced by T cells may be protective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, T-cellderived TNF is indispensable for resistance to infections, such as tuberculosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate that cell-typerestricted anti-cytokine therapy may be advantageous, we generated bispecific antibodies that neutralize TNF produced by myeloid cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-targeted inhibition of TNF is more effective than systemic TNF ablation in protecting mice from TNF-mediated hepatotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides a rationale for the development of novel anti-TNF agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overexpression of TNF contributes to pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases, accounting for a remarkable success of anti-TNF therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNF is produced by a variety of cell types, and it can play either a beneficial or a deleterious role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, in autoimmunity pathogenic TNF may be derived from restricted cellular sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study we evaluated the feasibility of cell-typerestricted TNF inhibition in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we engineered MYSTI (Myeloid-Specific TNF Inhibitor)a recombinant bispecific antibody that binds to the F4/80 surface molecule on myeloid cells and to human TNF (hTNF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In macrophage cultures derived from TNF humanized mice MYSTI could capture the secreted hTNF, limiting its bioavailability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, as evaluated in TNF humanized mice, MYSTI was superior to an otherwise analogous systemic TNF inhibitor in protecting mice from lethal LPS/D-Galactosamineinduced hepatotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest a novel and more specific approach to inhibiting TNF in pathologies primarily driven by macrophage-derived TNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MYSTI and STI had similar kinetics of interaction with hTNF and similar anti-hTNF activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) One specificity of MYSTI attaches to the macrophage surface, whereas another captures and retains secreted TNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) MYSTI-1 from N to C terminus comprises anti-TNF VHH, GSGGGGSG linker, anti-F4/80 scFv, and His-tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CDRs in anti-F4/80 variable heavy and light chain domains are highlighted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutated form of MYSTI-1, designated as STI-1, has the same amino acid sequence except for the six CDRs in anti-F4/80 scFv, all of which were substituted with (G4S)n sequences of the same length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations are marked with crosses in orange boxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYSTI-2 comprises anti-F4/80 VHH, flexible linker from the hinge region of camel antibody, anti-TNF VHH, and His-tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the corresponding systemic TNF inhibitor, STI-2 anti-F4/80 VHH was replaced by an irrelevant VHH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Anti-TNF activities of MYSTI, STI, MYSTI-2, and STI-2 were determined by cytotoxic assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L929 cells were incubated in the presence of constant concentration of hTNF and Actinomycin D and serial dilutions of recombinant antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Percentage of living cells ±SD is plotted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Kinetics of interaction of antibodies with recombinant hTNF as measured by SPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kforward (on-rate) and Kreverse (off-rate) values of MYSTI-1, STI-1, and MYSTI-2 ±SD are plotted on isoaffinity graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diagonal lines represent dissociation constants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E) Sensograms plus fitted lines of interaction of MYSTI-1, STI-1, and MYSTI-2 with serial dilutions of hTNF are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data in CE are representative of more than three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sTNF: soluble TNF; tmTNF: transmembrane TNF; TACE: TNF converting enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cloning__Expression__and_Purification_of_MYSTI_and_STI_Recombinant_Antibodies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have designed two bispecific antibodies comprising anti-F4/80 and anti-hTNF domains that bind and neutralize human TNF secreted by monocytes and macrophages derived from TNF humanized mice (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both antibodies we have created appropriate controls serving as systemic TNF inhibitors (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MYSTI-1 antibody comprised anti-F4/80 single-chain antibody (scFv) and a previously reported high-affinity single-domain antibody (VHH) targeting human TNF (2729) joined by a flexible glycineserine linker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A C-terminal histidine tag was genetically added to facilitate its purification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To create appropriate control antibody STI-1, we used the intact anti-TNF moiety of MYSTI-1, but substituted the cDNA coding for anti-F4/80 scFv with a de-novosynthesized scFv gene in which all six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) were replaced with (Gly4Ser)n sequences of the same length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MYSTI-2 antibody comprised a novel anti-F4/80 VHH (Fig S1; Fig S2, Table S1; SI Materials and Methods) and the same anti-TNF VHH module as in MYSTI-1/STI-1, whereas its controlSTI-2contained an irrelevant VHH (30) in place of anti-F4/80 moiety, thus acting as a systemic TNF inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All recombinant antibodies were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography (for SDS/PAGE, see Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Binding_of_MYSTI_and_STI_to_Recombinant_Human_TNF_and_Inhibition_of_Its_Activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Kinetics of interactions of bispecific antibodies with recombinant hTNF was determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All recombinant antibodies demonstrated high-affinity interaction with hTNF and had similar on- and off-rates (Fig 1 D and E and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low dissociation rate of the MYSTI antibodies suggested that they may be capable of remaining bound to the hTNF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare TNF-inhibitory properties of MYSTI and STI, we performed a TNF-induced cytotoxicity assay using the L929 murine fibrosarcoma line and found that MYSTI and STI had very similar hTNF inhibitory activity in vitro (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MYSTI_but_Not_STI_Binds_to_the_Surface_of_Macrophages_via_Anti-F4_80_Moiety  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that bispecific antibody MYSTI via interaction with the F4/80 protein could attach to both peritoneal cavity macrophages (Fig 2 A and B and Fig S4 A and B) and bone-marrowderived macrophages (Fig 2G), whereas mutations or substitutions introduced into STI prevented binding to F4/80 (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of MYSTI interaction with F4/80 negative cells (mostly B and T cells) (Fig 2C and Fig S4C) and observed decrease in F4/80 counterstaining in samples preincubated with MYSTI (Fig 2D and Fig S4D) confirmed a specific interaction with F4/80.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we also demonstrated that MYSTI could bind macrophage-associated F4/80 and hTNF simultaneously (Fig 2 E and F and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these bispecific reagents can selectively capture hTNF produced by macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Retention_of_Endogenously_Produced_hTNF_on_the_Surface_of_Macrophages_by_MYSTI  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As the anti-TNF moiety of both MYSTI and STI could bind and neutralize human but not murine TNF (27), in all subsequent experiments we used primary cells derived from TNF humanized mice in which the murine TNF gene was substituted by its human counterpart (26, 31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peritoneal cavity macrophages from such mice were used to test whether MYSTI could prevent the release of soluble hTNF into the culture medium upon LPS stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that hTNF levels in the supernatants of macrophage cultures were significantly reduced when macrophages were preincubated with MYSTI and then washed, suggesting that soluble hTNF released by macrophages was captured and retained by bispecific antibody on the surface of the peritoneal cavity macrophages at least for the duration of the experiment (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings were confirmed with bone-marrowderived macrophage cultures from TNF humanized mice: preincubation with MYSTI significantly decreased hTNF activity in supernatants upon LPS stimulation, whereas preincubation with neutralizing but monospecific anti-TNF VHH or with STI did not (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, MYSTI can be internalized from the macrophage membrane (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Advantage_of_Macrophage-Targeted_Versus_Systemic_TNF_Inhibition_in_LPS_D-GalactosamineInduced_Hepatotoxicity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We established previously that macrophages are the source of deleterious TNF in LPS/D-Galinduced hepatotoxicity (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that this toxicity can be inhibited by administration of anti-hTNF antibodies or soluble TNF receptors in TNF humanized mice (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the effects of macrophage/monocyte targeted TNF retention (represented by MYSTI) as opposed to systemic TNF inhibition (represented by STI), we compared these two pairs of recombinant antibodies in the experimental model of acute hepatotoxicity in TNF humanized mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYSTI-1 and STI-1 at doses of 750 U/g or the vehicle buffer were injected 30 min before LPS/D-Gal administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the mice that received MYSTI-1 survived (Fig 4A) whereas a similar dose of STI-1 antibody, which had otherwise the same anti-TNF activity and similar molecular weight (MW) and pI, was insufficient to protect mice from lethality, although at higher doses STI also prevented the hepatotoxicity (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The superior efficiency of macrophage-targeted anti-TNF therapy was reproduced in a comparison of independently developed macrophage-specific TNF inhibitor MYSTI-2 with its respective control antibody STI-2 (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with significantly lower levels of hTNF in sera of TNF humanized mice stimulated with LPS after MYSTI-2 administration compared with STI, despite the fact that both reagents carried an identical hTNF-binding VHH module (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYSTI but not STI was able to bind to F4/80-positive peritoneal macrophages in vivo (Fig 4D), thereby preventing LPS-mediated TNF production (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall these results suggested that macrophage-targeted inhibition of TNF is advantageous in terms of required drug dose for protection/survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anti-TNF therapy is currently widely used for multiple autoimmune disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to intrinsic nonredundant beneficial functions of TNF, its inhibition is associated with several side effects, such as increased susceptibility to infections (33), secondary autoimmune manifestations (34, 35), and potentially increased risk of lymphoma development (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, there is an interest in the development of anti-TNF agents, which would be able to discriminate between mainly pathogenic TNF and physiological TNF required for immune homeostasis as more selective reagents may result in fewer side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The apparent nonredundancy of TNF produced by various cellular subsets could be attributed to kinetics, level of the expression, and/or compartmentalization of TNF-producing cells during a particular disease state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetics and the level of expression by various cell types is induced by a variety of stimuli and controlled by distinct intracellular cascades that may differ in specific cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, macrophages can rapidly produce large TNF quantities upon triggering of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), whereas T cells require other stimuli, such as T-cell receptor engagement, and may produce TNF with different kinetics (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Additionally, TNF is initially synthesized by all cells as a type II transmembrane protein that is subsequently cleaved by metalloprotease ADAM17 (TACE) to generate the soluble form of the cytokine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, one of the explanations for the potential difference in the functions of TNF produced by myeloid cells versus T cells could be related to the molecular form of TNF (membrane bound vs. soluble) as their relative levels may differ in these cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obviously, membrane-bound TNF cannot enter the circulation and produce the massive systemic effects observed in several experimental models, including LPS/D-Gal challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, mice producing only membrane-bound TNF are protected from this type of lethal toxicity (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously provided evidence for the significance of both the cellular source and the molecular form of TNF in the maintenance of the microstructure of lymphoid tissues (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, cell-typerestricted TNF blockade may selectively disrupt certain signaling circuits deleterious for the host, but not necessarily neutralize the entire homeostatic or protective TNF signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Myeloid cells are critical players in many autoimmune diseases, found in large quantities at the effector sites, and one of the major producers of TNF in the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking this into account, a possible improvement of existing anti-TNF therapeutic options by selective inhibition of TNF produced by macrophages appears reasonable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study demonstrated that for the resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in mice T-cellderived TNF appears critical and nonredundant for immune protection (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the mode of protection through the formation of bactericidal granulomas whose structural integrity depends on TNF produced by T cells, presumably in membrane-bound form (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both humans and mice, systemic anti-TNF treatment is known to affect granuloma integrity and may cause reactivation of latent disease (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The strategy developed in our study employs targeting TNF-neutralizing antibody to the macrophage surface via interaction with membrane protein F4/80.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding to the surface molecule could induce internalization of antibody and/or induce intracellular signaling events via F4/80.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potentially, such antibody may also bind transmembrane TNF on the surface of macrophages and thus mediate an anti-inflammatory effect by the mechanism of reverse TNF signaling (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the mechanism, our in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that binding of antibody per se does not activate macrophages as determined by TNF production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in primary macrophages prepared from TNF humanized mice, MYSTI (but not STI) can bind and retain TNF on the surface of macrophages, preventing its bioavailability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo administration of MYSTI before LPS challenge resulted in a dramatic reduction in LPS-induced hTNF serum levels in humanized mice with STI having appreciably smaller effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, MYSTI administration blocked very early TNF production by peritoneal macrophages (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, MYSTI can block in vivo TNF activity during acute septic shock more efficiently than the control antibody representing a systemic TNF inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, we propose a novel anti-cytokine therapeutic strategy based on selective inhibition of a cytokine from restricted cellular subsets known to be the main source of pathogenic activity in disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future it will be interesting to assess the efficacy of such reagents (perhaps targeting other proinflammatory cytokines) in relevant chronic disease models, such as experimental arthritis, colitis, and EAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As recombinant hTNF inhibitors with the sole exception of Etanercept do not bind murine TNF with sufficient affinity to block its biological effects, we have generated human TNF knock-in mice here designated as TNF humanized mice (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these mice, lacking murine TNF, human TNF mediates protective and pathogenic functions and could be neutralized with the entire panel of available anti-TNF drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hTNF KI mice were bred at the Animal Breeding Facility of Shemyakin & Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Puschino, Moscow Region, Russia, and housed under specific pathogen free conditions on 12 h light/dark cycle at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animal procedures were approved by the Scientific Council of the Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
