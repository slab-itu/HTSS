Identification of Cav2PKC and Cav2NOS1 complexes as entities for ultrafast electrochemical coupling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) and protein kinase C (PKC), through their enzymatic activities, initiate a variety of intracellular signaling processes in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For activation, both enzymes require intracellular calcium ions (Ca2+), which, for NOS1, may be provided via NMDA-type glutamate receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation by voltage-gated Ca2+ (Cav) channels has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that both PKC and NOS1 form bimolecular complexes with Cav2.2 channels, thus placing themselves within less than 10 nm of a Ca2+ source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the framework of the channelenzyme complexes, PKC and NOS1 are reliably activated even by periods of Ca2+ influx as short as 0.8 ms occurring during action potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results establish Cav2enzyme complexes as molecular entities for fast and precisely timed electrochemical coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Voltage-activated calcium (Cav) channels couple intracellular signaling pathways to membrane potential by providing Ca2+ ions as second messengers at sufficiently high concentrations to modulate effector proteins located in the intimate vicinity of those channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that protein kinase C (PKC) and brain nitric oxide synthase (NOS1), both identified by proteomic analysis as constituents of the protein nano-environment of Cav2 channels in the brain, directly coassemble with Cav2.2 channels upon heterologous coexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within Cav2.2PKC and Cav2.2NOS1 complexes voltage-triggered Ca2+ influx through the Cav channels reliably initiates enzymatic activity within milliseconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using BKCa channels as target sensors for nitric oxide and protein phosphorylation together with high concentrations of Ca2+ buffers showed that the complex-mediated Ca2+ signaling occurs in local signaling domains at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results establish Cav2enzyme complexes as molecular entities for fast electrochemical coupling that reliably convert brief membrane depolarization into precisely timed intracellular signaling events in the mammalian brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Complex_Formation_of_PKC_and_NOS1_with_Cav22_Channels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ca2+-dependent enzymes PKC and NOS1 have been identified as constituents of the extended protein networks making up the nano-environments of Cav2 channels [Cav2.1 (P/Q-type), Cav2.2 (N-type), Cav2.3, R-type] (Fig 1B) in the rodent brain (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within these networks, the individual constituents are interlinked via proteinprotein interactions and thus may be associated with the Cav channels either directly or indirectly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both PKC and NOS1 (Fig S1A), the structural link to Cav2 channels has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore this molecular association, we first used affinity-purifications (APs) combined with nano-flow high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC MS/MS; Materials and Methods) on cultured CHO cells that heterologously coexpressed either of the two enzymes (transient expression) with Cav2.2 channels (stable expression, Fig 1C; for comparison of expression levels between brain and cultured cells, see Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane fractions prepared from the respective cells were equilibrated with antibodies (ABs) against the three target proteins (anti-Cav2.2, anti-PKC, and anti-NOS1) (Materials and Methods), and the eluates of these APs were subjected to nano-LC MS/MS, which provided information on both the identity and the amount of any protein therein (6, 14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative evalution of these APs showed that the anti-Cav2.2 AB purified the subunits of its target channel in all experiments and, in addition, effectively retained the coexpressed PKC (Fig 1C, Left) and NOS1 (Fig 1C, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the ABs specifically targeting either of the two enzymes copurified all Cav channel subunits (Fig 1C, bars in black and gray).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, these results indicate that both PKC and NOS1 are able to coassemble with Cav2.2 channels without the addition of further linker protein(s), most likely by formation of bimolecular channelenzyme complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Operation_of_Cav22NOS1_Complexes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next we investigated the functional properties of the Cav2.2NOS1 assemblies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we applied a genetically encoded reporter system for nitric oxide (NO) that is based on NO-mediated synthesis of cGMP and subsequent cGMP-triggered FRET between cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in an indicator protein (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When coexpressed with NOS1 and Cav2.2 in the aforementioned CHO cell line (Fig 2A, Upper), this indicator enabled monitoring of NO generated by Cav2.2NOS1 complexes in response to voltage pulses by means of combined patch-clamp and fluorescence measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2A, Lower, and B illustrate the results of such measurements obtained during a single-voltage-step experiment in a CHO cell that was dialyzed with high concentrations of the Ca2+ buffer EGTA (10 mM; applied through the patch pipette): The Ca2+ ions conducted inward through activated Cav2.2 channels during a hyperpolarization step to 80 mV (Cav2.2 currents, Fig 2A, Lower) triggered a transient increase in YFP/CFP emission, reflecting NO production (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in FRET signal, which was independent of the Cav2 channel density in the plasma membrane (Fig S2), was observed only with NOS1 in wild-type form, but not with a NOS1 mutant deprived of enzymatic activity (Fig 2B); similarly, no FRET signal was detected when the indicator constructs were expressed alone (Fig 2B) or upon replacement of Ca2+ in the extracellular milieu by Ba2+ (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Ca2+ influx in these experiments was restricted to a few milliseconds, as the hyperpolarizing voltage step not only provided the driving force for the inward Ca2+ currents, but also promoted rapid closure of Cav2.2 channels due to channel deactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, it should be emphasized that, due to the high concentration of EGTA, the observed FRET signal must have been initiated by NO molecules synthesized through NOS1 subunit(s) of Cav2NOS1 complexes or by NOS1 protein located at a nanometer distance from the Cav2.2 channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the FRET signal was no longer seen when EGTA was replaced by the fast Ca2+-buffer BAPTA (10 mM, Fig S2) similar to observations with CavBKCa complexes (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time course of the FRET signal is determined by an initial increase in NO followed by a subsequent degradation/volatilization of NO and hydrolysis of cGMP by endogenous phosphodiesterases (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, the experiments in Fig 2 demonstrate that Cav2.2NOS1 complexes generate NO in response to voltage-gated Ca2+ influx in the millisecond range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the signal-to-noise ratio and time resolution of the NO indicator were somewhat limited, and the measured FRET signal relied on two factors (NO as a trigger and generation of cGMP for signal amplification), rather than reflecting direct binding of NO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore aimed for a direct reporter system of NO effects and tested BKCa channels for which modulation by NO has been reported (1719).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a first step, we measured voltage-dependent activation of homomeric BKCa() channels (also termed BK) at distinct values for [Ca2+]i with and without NOS1 coexpressed in CHO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of the enzyme, steady-state activation curves determined in whole-cell configuration with physiologically relevant [Ca2+]i between 0.1 µM and 10 µM displayed the well-known left-shift along the voltage axis (Fig 3A; voltage for half-maximal activation (V0.5) of 23.9 mV, 98.8 mV, and 133.5 mV for 10, 1, and 0.1 µM, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coexpressed NOS1 markedly shifted channel activation further to the left in a [Ca2+]i-dependent manner: shifts of 30 mV and 15 mV at 1 µM and 10 µM, respectively; importantly, no significant effect was observed at 0.1 µM free Ca2+ (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This NOS1-induced shift in steady-state activation resulted from an increase in the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of the channels (Fig 3A, Inset), likely reflecting structural alterations influencing the dual gating of BKCa channels (11, 20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, NOS1 failed to induce left-shifts of the activation curves when BK coassembled with the auxiliary subunits BK1 and/or BK4 [BKCa(+), Fig 3B] that are both known to affect apparent Ca2+ sensitivity and/or alter the Ca2+-gating processes (11, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To probe how NOS1 activity is linked to BKCa() channels, we next applied a donor of NO and used mutants of BK described in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 3C, the NOS1 effect on steady-state activation was mimicked by the NO donor sodium-nitroprusside (SNP, 1 mM) added to the extracellular solution (Fig S3), but the respective shift in steady-state activation was largely occluded by coapplication of potassium-cyanide (KCN, 150 µM) via the patch pipette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sole application of KCN did not affect BKCa() channel activation (Fig 3C, green symbol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because cyanide binds with high affinity to heme group(s), these results pointed toward NO binding to heme as the mechanism involved in NOS1 action on BK, rather than nitrosylation of sulfhydryl groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis was further supported by recapitulating the NOS1 experiments from Fig 3A with a mutant of BK where a highly conserved residue in the consensus motif for heme binding in the RCK ring had been exchanged [BKCa(C615S)] (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to wild type, steady-state activation curves of BKCa(C615S) mutant channels remained unaffected by the coexpressed NOS1 at [Ca2+]i of 1 µM (Fig 3D) and 10 µM (not shown), suggesting that NOS1 acts on BKCa() channels via NO binding to heme attached to the BK protein as a prosthetic group (2426).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, the experiments shown in Fig 3 established homomeric BKCa() channels as a sensor system that enables direct and highly sensitive monitoring of NO at the plasma membrane through an increase in BKCa()-mediated K+ currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we applied this system to investigate the operation of Cav2.2NOS1 complexes in the context of whole cells with intracellular Ca2+ buffering set by 10 mM EGTA as before (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these experiments, the channelenzyme assemblies were coexpressed with BKCa() channels in CHO cells and used for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with a voltage protocol designed to measure BKCa currents and NO production in response to defined submillisecond periods of Ca2+ influx (Fig 4A, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voltage protocol was a cycle consisting of three steps: (i) a 10-ms depolarization to 50 mV (C-pulse) to activate Cav2.2 channels without eliciting Ca2+ currents (due to a largely reduced driving force for Ca2+ ions); (ii) a 0.8-ms voltage step to 40 mV to drive Ca2+ influx (90-mV increase in inward driving force for Ca2+ ions) that produces an increase in local [Ca2+]i; and (iii) a second depolarization step to 50 mV (T-pulse) to monitor BKCa() channels that were activated by the Ca2+ influx (but were not activated during the C-pulse due to low resting [Ca2+]i, Fig 3A) (7, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, under these experimental conditions, BKCa channels can only be activated by Ca2+ if they are coassembled with Cav2.2 (and are thus provided with [Ca2+]i 10 µM at any Cav channel activation) or if they are localized less than a few 10 nm away from Cav2.2 (where [Ca2+]i is between 1 µM and 10 µM; refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4, 7) and rendered more sensitive to Ca2+ as accomplished by NO binding (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When the voltage protocol described above was repetitively applied every 5 s, it elicited Ca2+-activated BKCa currents that, after an initial lag (of one to three pulse cycles), increased in amplitude by more than twofold over a period of 23 min (2540 cycles; Fig 4A, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated by the current traces (Fig 4A, recorded at 5 s and 125 s) and the current maximum plots (Fig 4A, Inset) of this representative experiment, the increase in amplitude was observed only for the Ca2+-activated channels (T-pulse), whereas the small outward K+ currents triggered by the C-pulse remained unaffected as expected for [Ca2+]i returning to resting levels after each cycle, thus largely preventing BKCa activation at 50 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, the increased Ca2+-activated BKCa currents could be largely attributed to Cav-free BKCa channels that experience a NO-mediated increase in apparent Ca2+ sensitivity because performing the experiment in the absence of coexpressed NOS1 failed to provide an increase in BKCa current amplitude (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, subsequent control experiments with a mutant of NOS1 lacking enzymatic activity (NOS1 Mut) further corroborated this view: In contrast to wild type, NOS1 Mut failed to induce any increase in BKCa currents over an experimental period of 3 min (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, replacing Cav2.2 channels with Cav2.3 that lack interaction with NOS1 did not result in a NO-mediated increase in BKCa currents (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results showed that pulses of Ca2+ influx as short as 0.8 ms were able to trigger activity of NOS1, although repetitive application of the voltage cycle was required to generate steady-state effects (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain further insight into this behavior, we changed the frequency of the influx window for Ca2+ by either decreasing or increasing the intercycle (IC) interval to 2.5 s or 10 s. The respective responses obtained for the Ca2+-activated BKCa currents in independent CHO cells showed an accelerated time course [time constants (mean ± SEM) of 53.5 ± 9.3 s (n = 7) and 88.9 ± 18.4 s (n = 7) for IC durations of 2.5 s and 5 s, respectively] and a slightly increased steady-state current amplitude for the 2.5-s over the 5-s IC interval (2.3-fold vs. 2.1-fold), whereas the increased interval largely abolished the NO effects (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, these results showed that short depolarizations in the submillisecond range are sufficient to trigger reliable activity in Cav2.2NOS1 complexes under whole-cell conditions and in the presence of high Ca2+ buffering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Operation_of_Cav22PKC_Complexes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate Cav2.2PKC complexes, we also used BKCa channels as a reporter system because BK() is effectively targeted by protein kinases (27) and phosphorylation by PKC robustly increases the amplitude of heterologously expressed BKCa() currents (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under cellular conditions, PKC is activated by an increase in [Ca2+]i most effectively when in contact with membrane phospholipids (29) such as in Cav2PKC complexes at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accordingly, we repeated the experiments performed with the Cav2.2NOS1 assemblies for Cav2.2PKC complexes formed upon coexpression of both complex partners in CHO cells (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Cav2.2NOS1, repetitive submillisecond Ca2+ influx elicited by the three-step voltage protocol was sufficient to induce a robust increase in the amplitude of Ca2+-activated BKCa currents (Fig 5 A and B, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As before, these increased BKCa currents were likely generated for most parts by Cav-free (but closely colocalized) BKCa channels, the apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of which was altered by PKC-mediated phosphorylation, as no comparable effects were observed either in the absence of PKC or with an activity-deficient mutant of the enzyme (PKC mut, Fig 5B, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a subsequent control experiment with protein kinase A (PKA) emphasized the specificity of the enzymatic activity triggered by Ca2+ in the Cav2.2PKC assemblies (Fig 5B, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, these results showed that Cav2.2PKC complexes reliably translate membrane depolarization into enzymatic activity via Ca2+ influx through the Cav2.2 channels even in the presence of high concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ buffers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, we identify direct coassembly of NOS1 and PKC with Cav2.2 channels as the molecular basis for their integration into the Cav2 nano-environments identified by proteomic analyses in the mammalian brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cav2NOS1 and Cav2PKC complexes reconstitute Ca2+ nano-domains where either enzyme is put under stringent control of the membrane potential via Ca2+ influx through the Cav channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under cellular conditions, these channelenzyme assemblies realize electrochemical coupling that reliably translates submillisecond membrane depolarization into second-messenger processes driving intracellular signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Functional_Characterization_of_the_Cav2Enzyme_Complexes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Direct coassembly of NOS1 and PKC with Cav2.2 channels was first identified by biochemistry combining APs and MS analysis on solubilized membrane fractions (Fig 1) and subsequently verified by functional experiments on protein complexes in situ (transfected cells; Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, 4, and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these experiments, we set up nano-domain conditions (high Ca2+ buffering by 10 mM EGTA together with brief periods of Ca2+ influx) where activation of Ca2+-dependent effectors can occur only within nanometer distances of the Ca2+ source (4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the first experiments used an established reporter system for NO equipped with a strong amplification mechanism (Fig 2) (16), subsequent characterization of the Cav2NOS1 and Cav2PKC complexes was performed with BKCa() channels as a highly sensitive tool for monitoring both enzymatic activities (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BKCa() channels offered several key advantages: (i) BKCa channels represent a physiological target for both NO and PKC-mediated phosphorylation; (ii) binding of NO molecules and protein phosphorylation occur directly at the reporter channels (Fig 3); (iii) either action is intrinsically amplified due to the large conductance of the BKCa channels (resulting in a favorable signal-to-noise ratio); (iv) time resolution can be set and adjusted by the voltage protocol; and (v) monitoring is done right at the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The detailed functional analyses of the Cavenzyme assemblies revealed some important properties: First, PKC, upon integration into complexes with Cav2.2 channels, retained sufficient structural flexibility to interact with and phosphorylate free BKCa channels (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, both PKC and NOS1 were activated by Cav2-mediated Ca2+ puffs of as short as 0.8 ms (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the time course of the enzymatic output of Cav2NOS1 complexes critically depended on the period between repetitively applied voltage cycles activating Cav2 channels; an IC period of 2.5 s was effective, while an IC period of 10 s was almost ineffective (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, this should result from the balance between generation of NO (and subsequent activation of BKCa channels by NO binding) and NO removal by diffusion and/or degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although a single submillisecond Ca2+ puff did not produce sufficiently high NO concentrations in the setting used, a series of Ca2+ puffs occurring at an appropriate frequency was able to promote robust activation of the BKCa channels (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Implication_of_Cav2Enzyme_Assemblies_for_Cell_Physiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results indicate that upon coassembly with Cav2.2 channels both NOS1 and PKC can be reliably activated by short action-potentiallike membrane depolarization, an alternative to activation of PKC by exogenously administered DAG derivatives or the use of NO donors for delivery of NO (30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these results showed that operation and properties of the two Cav2enzyme assemblies closely resembled those of Cav2BKCa complexes (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the latter, Cav2NOS1 and Cav2PKC reconstituted Ca2+ nano-domains, translating a local Ca2+ signal into an output that may initiate processes that extend well beyond these local domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, although obtained with heterologously expressed Cav2enzyme complexes together with BKCa() channels as ideal reporters, our results should be generally relevant for neurons and other cell types as Cav2NOS1/PKC complexes form readily (reflected by their initial discovery in CNS neurons) (6), and BKCa may certainly be considered a surrogate for other cellular targets of NO and phosphorylation by PKC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this respect, the time course and frequency dependence observed with either of the Cav-controlled enzymatic activities is interesting (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effective NOS1 and/or PKC signaling requires a series of stimuli at an appropriate frequency (Fig 4D), and there is a delay between the electrical signal and the enzymatic output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both efficiency and delay of the signal transduction driven by the enzymatic activities may be tuned (i) by the electrical activity in neurons/cells that gate the Cav channels and (ii) by the particular properties and localization of the respective targets of NO and PKC phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, unlike the stereotypic response of Cav2BKCa complexes, the signaling domains of Cav2NOS1 and Cav2PKC assemblies should not be static, but rather shaped dynamically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cav2.2 channelenzyme complexes were heterologously expressed in CHO cells (SI Materials and Methods, Cell Culture and Transfection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complex formation was investigated by AP and MS analyses as previously described (7, 14, 15) (SI Materials and Methods, Biochemistry); for functional characterization of the Cav2enzyme complexes, either patch-clamp recordings in whole-cell mode (10, 11) were used or a combination of patch-clamp and FRET measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full experimental details are presented in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cell_Culture_and_Transfection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CHO cells and CHO cells stably expressing Cav2.2 channels (Cav2.21; Cav1, 2 subunits) were transiently transfected with cDNAs coding for the following proteins: BK -subunit (UniProtKB/SwissProt accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Q08460), NOS1 (P29476), PKC (P05771), BK1 (Q16558), and BK4 (Q9JIN6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutants NOS1 (RK418/423AE) and PKC (KTT371/635/642AAA) as well as the fusion proteins of NOS1 with red fluorescence protein were prepared and verified by sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmids for the two-component NO indicator system, sGC-CGY-pcDNA3.1 and sGC-CGY-pcDNA3.1 (16), were kindly provided by M. Sato and Y. Umezawa, Department of Chemistry, University of Tokyo, Tokyo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and measured 24 d after transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Biochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NO_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For detection of NO, a genetically encoded indicator system originally introduced by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16 was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, this system consists of the - and -subunits of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC and sGC) that were both fused with an engineered indicator translating cGMP-binding into a FRET signal based on CFP and YFP (Fig 2, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
FRET photometry on individual CHO cells was performed with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope and a Plan Apo VC 60×/1.40 Oil /0.17 DIC N2 WD 0.13 oil-immersion objective (Nikon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wide-field illumination was realized with an Oligochrome (Till Photonics) controlled through the D/A converter of an EPC-10 USB patch-clamp amplifier in combination with PatchMaster software (HEKA Electronics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence intensities were acquired with fluorescence detection unit (FDU) photodiodes and Oligochrome Imagining Control Unit (ICU FDU-2) (Till Photonics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CFP was excited at 435 nm (excitation filter 430/24 ET band-pass), and fluorescence emission intensities were collected using an ET triple-band beam splitter CFP/YFP/mCherry with a 480/40-m ET band-pass for CFP (F480) and a 535/30-m ET band-pass filter for YFP (F535) (all from AHF Analysetechnik AG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YFP/CFP emission ratios were calculated as F535/F480 from background-corrected traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For statistical analysis, CHO cells with a transient YFP/CFP emission ratio were selected (Fig 3B), and those that failed to provide an increased FRET ratio in response to Ca2+ currents were omitted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electrophysiology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed at room temperature using a HEKA EPC 10 amplifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currents were low-pass-filtered at 310 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leak currents were subtracted with a P/4 protocol at a holding potential of 90 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serial resistance was 3070% compensated using the internal compensation circuitry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standard extracellular solution contained (in mM): KCl 5.8; NaCl 144; MgCl2 0.9; CaCl2 1.3; NaH2PO4 0.7; D-Glc 5.6, and Hepes 10 (pH 7.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recording pipettes pulled from quartz glass had resistances of 23.5 M when filled with internal solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For recordings of BKCa currents in unmodified CHO cells, the intracellular solution containing (in mM) KCl 139.5, MgCl2 3.5, DiBrBAPTA 2, Hepes 5, Na2ATP 2.5, and Na3GTP 0.1 (pH 7.3) was supplemented with CaCl2 to give the following free Ca2+ concentrations: 10 nM, 100 nM, 500 nM, 1 M, 5 M, and 10 M. WEBMAXC 2.22 was used for calculating appropriate amounts of CaCl2 to be added to the internal solution for the given [Ca2+]i, and the final free Ca2+ concentrations were checked with a Ca2+-sensitive electrode (World Precision Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For recording BKCa currents and for the FRET experiments in CHO cells stably expressing Cav2.2, the internal solution contained (in mM) KCl 127.5, MgCl2 3.5, Hepes 5, Na2ATP 2.5, Na3GTP 0.1, and K2EGTA 10 (pH 7.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Steady-state activation of BKCa channels at distinct [Ca2+]i was determined using test pulses ranging from 80 to +200 mV (in 10 mV increment), followed by a repolarization step to 0 or 50 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conductancevoltage relations were determined from tail current amplitudes measured 0.5 ms after repolarization to a fixed membrane potential (usually 0 mV) and normalized to maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fitting, a Boltzmann function was used: g/gmax = gmax/[1 + exp({Vh  Vm}/k)], where Vh is the voltage required for half-maximal activation and k the slope factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conductancevoltage plots at different [Ca2+]i (Fig 3A, Inset) were converted into calcium-conductance plots for different voltages and fitted to a Hill equation: g/gmax = amp/(1+(Kd/[Ca2+])n), where n is the Hill coefficient and Kd the apparent dissociation constant for Ca2+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma; DiBrBAPTA was obtained from Alfa Aesar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
