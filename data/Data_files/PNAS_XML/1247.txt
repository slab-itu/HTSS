Fully gapped d-wave superconductivity in CeCu2Si2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Identifying the gap structure of superconductors is vital for understanding the underlying pairing mechanism of the Cooper pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first heavy fermion superconductor to be discovered, CeCu2Si2, was thought to be a d-wave superconductor with gap nodes, until recent specific heat measurements provided evidence that the gap is fully open across the Fermi surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a resolution to this puzzle from measurements of the London penetration depth, which give further evidence for fully gapped superconductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyze the data using a d-wave band-mixing pairing model, which leads to a fully open superconducting gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model accounts well for the penetration depth and specific heat data, while reconciling the nodeless and sign-changing nature of the gap function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nature of the pairing symmetry of the first heavy fermion superconductor CeCu2Si2 has recently become the subject of controversy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CeCu2Si2 was generally believed to be a d-wave superconductor, recent low-temperature specific heat measurements showed evidence for fully gapped superconductivity, contrary to the nodal behavior inferred from earlier results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report London penetration depth measurements, which also reveal fully gapped behavior at very low temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explain these seemingly conflicting results, we propose a fully gapped d+d band-mixing pairing state for CeCu2Si2, which yields very good fits to both the superfluid density and specific heat, as well as accounting for a sign change of the superconducting order parameter, as previously concluded from inelastic neutron scattering results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Resistivity_and_Specific_Heat  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The samples were characterized using resistivity and specific heat measurements, as shown for the S-type sample in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual resistivity of the S-type sample in the normal state just above Tc is 040cm, and a superconducting transition is observed, onsetting around 0.65 K and reaching zero resistivity at about 0.6 K. The transition width of 0.05 K is in line with recent reports (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific heat also shows a superconducting transition with Tc 0.64 K, similar to previous results (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A/S-type sample (Fig 1B) displays a superconducting transition, onsetting around 0.62 K, with a lower residual resistivity of 012cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific heat shows both an AFM transition at TN 0.7 K and a superconducting transition at Tc 0.53 K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Temperature_Dependence_of_the_Penetration_Depth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measurements of the change of the London penetration depth (T)=(T)(0) for the S-type sample are displayed in Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the Inset, a sharp superconducting transition is clearly observed, with an onset at around 0.62 K. To probe the superconducting gap structure, we analyzed the behavior of (T) at low temperatures, and the results are shown in the main panel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were fitted with the exponential temperature dependence for a fully open gap, (T)=AT12e(0)/kBT+B, where (0) is the gap magnitude at zero temperature and the constant B allows for some variation in the extrapolated zero temperature value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fitting was performed up to 0.12 K (Tc/5), and as shown by the solid line in Fig 2A, the model can account for the data with a gap of (0)=0.48kBTc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar gap value of (0)=0.58kBTc is obtained from a corresponding fit for the A/S-type sample, as displayed in the main panel of Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small gap values in both cases means that (T) only saturates at very low temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicate similar superconducting properties of the S- and A/S-type samples and are consistent with the fully gapped superconductivity reported for an S-type single crystal in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The penetration depth of the S- and A/S-type samples could also be described by a power law dependence Tn (SI Appendix), with n=2.24 and 2.43, respectively, when fitting from the base temperature to 0.12 K. For line nodes in the superconducting gap in the presence of impurity scattering, (T) may show quadratic behavior at low temperatures, which crosses over to linear behavior at an elevated temperature (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check how the exponent n evolves with temperature, we also fitted with the power law expression from the base temperature up to a range of temperatures Tup, and the dependence of n on Tup is shown in Fig 2 B, Inset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can clearly be seen that for both samples, n increases with decreasing Tup, with n greater than 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the true low-temperature behavior is not a T2 dependence, as expected for a dirty nodal superconductor, but n increases as expected for superconductivity exhibiting a full gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, both the specific heat and (T) data are consistent with fully gapped superconductivity at very low temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_the_Superfluid_Density  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The superfluid density was calculated using s(T)=[(0)/(T)]2 and is displayed for both S- and A/S-type samples in Fig 3, where (0)=2000 Å (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The superfluid density was fitted following the method of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26, for a gap k(T) integrated over a cylindrical Fermi surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The superfluid density data were fitted with an isotropic s-wave model with a gap (T)=(0)tanh1.821.018TcT10.51 (27) as well as a d-wave model with line nodes (k(T,)=(T)cos2,  = azimuthal angle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3A, a single-band isotropic s-wave gap cannot account for the data of the S-type sample, in contrast to the low-temperature (T) data discussed above (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single-band d-wave model shows reasonable agreement above 0.5Tc, but the agreement is poor at low temperatures, since for this model s(T) is linear but the data are not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement with the d-wave model at higher temperatures is consistent with the previously reported evidence for d-wave superconductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data were also fitted using a two-gap s-wave model (27), and this gives reasonable agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fitted gap values are 1(0)=1.96kBTc and 2(0)=0.75kBTc, with a fraction for the larger gap of x1=0.74.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both gap values are slightly larger than the ones obtained for the two-gap model in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, neither the s- nor d-wave single-band models could describe the superfluid density of the A/S-type sample at low temperatures (Fig 3C), but the data could be fitted using a two-gap model with 1(0)=2.0kBTc, 2(0)=0.75kBTc, and x1=0.74.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the other hand, it is difficult to reconcile an s-wave model with the evidence for a sign-changing gap function, as concluded from the INS response, where a sharp spin resonance forms at the edge of a spin gap well inside the superconducting gap (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the incommensurate ordering wave vector of the nearby SDW (QAF) is identical to the nesting wave vector spanning the flat parallel parts of the warped cylinders (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that there is a sign change of the pair wave function inside the dominating heavy-fermion band, which is incompatible with a nodeless s± pairing state (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, if there is no sign change of the gap function across the Fermi surface, kk+q=|k||k+q|, the coherence factor in the spin susceptibility (q,) is vanishingly small (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, in this case, the spin spectrum will not have a sharp peak, although there may be a broad enhancement of the spectral weight above 2 (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when there is a change of sign of the gap function between regions of the Fermi surface connected by q=QAF, there is an enhanced coherence factor since kk+q=|k||k+q|.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives rise to a sharp peak in (q,) below 2, leading to the conclusion that there must be a sign-changing order parameter in CeCu2Si2 (16, 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By a similar argument, the lack of a coherence peak in NQR measurements also strongly disfavors superconductivity without a sign reversal (15, 18, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, given the strong Coulomb repulsion in Ce-based heavy fermion superconductors, the order parameter must be anisotropic with a sign change, without running into the issue of a large * (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the f-electrons have a Coulomb repulsion that is much larger than their effective Fermi energy, and they must avoid each other, thereby excluding any sign-preserving pairing function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such strongly correlated superconductors, even anisotropic and sign-changing pairing states can be robust against disorder (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, potential scattering [due to a site exchange between Cu and Si of less than 1% within the homogeneity range (34)], which enhances the residual resistivity by a factor of 4, apparently has an almost negligible influence on Tc (cf., the resistivity results on the S and A/S samples in Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, recent experiments on electron-irradiated samples revealed only a minor change of Tc (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, just like in the cuprates, the effect of substitutional disorder on Tc is known to be site- and size-dependent (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CeCu2Si2, the superconducting Tc was found to be extremely sensitive to nonmagnetic substitutions on the Cu site: For example, Rh, Pd, and Mn substitution for Cu at a level of 1% fully suppresses superconductivity (35), which is impossible to account for in the scenario of an s-wave state without a sign change of the order parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are needed to develop a detailed understanding of all these observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present work, we consider a pairing function that, by analogy with an s3 pairing state (36), has an effective gap as a result of intraband pairing with dx2y2 symmetry and interband pairing with dxy symmetry; our pairing function preserves both the fully gapped nature and order parameter sign change along QAF on a single nested Fermi surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The s3 pairing state was introduced in the context of the iron-based superconductors (SI Appendix) (36), as part of the studies about orbital-selective superconducting pairing (3740).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There, the pairing function has the form sx2y2(k)×3 (s3), as a product of an s-wave form factor and a Pauli matrix in the dxz,dyz orbital subspace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For that case, the interorbital mixing in the dispersion part of the Hamiltonian ensures that in the band basis the pairing is equivalent to a superposition of intra- and interband components with dx2y2(k) and dxy(k) form factors, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting quasiparticle spectrum acquires a nonvanishing (k)2 contribution, as the two components are added in quadrature, ensuring a full gap on the whole Fermi surface with a sign change of the intraband component of the gap function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also shown how this pairing channel can be stabilized within a self-consistent five-orbital model, with a full gap and a resonance in the spin-excitation spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the case considered in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36, QAF of CeCu2Si2 will connect two parts of the Fermi surface with a sign change in the intraband component of the gap function (see Fig 4), thereby generating an enhanced spin spectral weight just above a threshold energy E0=3.9kBTc (14), inside the superconducting gap 215kBTc (see below and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the following, we apply a simplified model for the gap structure to CeCu2Si2, given by summing contributions from the two d-wave states in quadrature, with (T,)=[(1(0)cos(2))2+(2(0)sin(2))2]12(T), where (T) is the gap temperature dependence from BardeenCooperSchrieffer theory (1), which we used previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, a d+d band-mixing pairing can introduce corrections to the gap given above, due to the nondegeneracy of the bands throughout the Brillouin zone, which would then lead to an extra parameter, the band splitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, we will show that the data can be well fit by the simple function without this extra parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the dxy and dx2y2 states each have two line nodes, the nodes of the two states are offset by /4 in the kxky plane, and as a result, the gap function is nodeless everywhere on a cylindrical Fermi surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should also be noted that for this model the same s(T) is calculated upon exchanging 1(0) and 2(0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The superfluid density of the S-type sample was fitted using this model, and the results are shown in Fig 3B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that such a model can also fit the data well, with gap parameters of 1(0)=2.5kBTc and 2(0)=0.58kBTc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3D, s(T) for the A/S-type sample is equally well fitted, with similar parameters of 1(0)=2.54kBTc and 2(0)=0.6kBTc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of the larger gap agree almost perfectly with the gap value obtained from Cu-NQR measurements at higher temperatures (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this model only uses two fitting parameters, while the two-band s-wave model of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8 needs three.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_the_Temperature_Dependence_of_the_Specific_Heat  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also reanalyzed the specific heat data digitized from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8 using the d+d band-mixing pairing model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5, the data can also be well described using this model, with fitted parameters 1(0)=2.08kBTc and 2(0)=0.55kBTc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of the small gap is similar to that obtained from the superfluid density fit, while the large gap is smaller in comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the calculated superfluid density requires an estimation of G/(0), where G is a calibration constant for the tunnel diode oscillator (TDO) method, and the small differences in the gap values from the fits may arise due to uncertainties in this value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion_and_Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both the superfluid density and specific heat results are highly consistent with a model of the d+d band-mixing pairing state, which most importantly also explains the sign change of the superconducting order parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the fully gapped nature of the pairing state means that the density of states N(E) is zero at low energies, N(E) is nearly linear above the small gap, much like for pairing states with line nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also consistent with the literature results showing d-wave superconductivity (15, 18), which were not obtained at low enough temperatures to observe clear evidence for fully gapped behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of a coherence peak below Tc in the Cu-NQR 1/T1(T) measurements (15, 18, 32) can also not be accounted for by a two-gap s-wave model but is readily taken into account by the anisotropic d+d state, which changes sign along QAF across the Fermi surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the effective gap corresponding to a d+d band-mixing pairing is formally identical to one obtained from a d+id pairing and the good fits to s(T) and the specific heat are also consistent with this pairing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the d+id state, time-reversal symmetry would be broken and although no clear experimental indication of a time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting state was found from SR measurements of A/S-type samples (41), this requires further study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, a d+d band-mixing pairing is invariant under time reversal, while generating the expected sign change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From a theoretical perspective, unconventional superconductors in the presence of strong correlations are generally expected to be robust against disorder (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been demonstrated in models for strongly correlated superconductivity driven by short-range spin-exchange interactions (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The s3 pairing state (36) arises in a similar fashion and is also expected to be robust against disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the 4f electrons in heavy fermion systems undoubtedly have strong correlations, the d+d band-mixing pairing state proposed for CeCu2Si2 should be similarly robust to disorder, except for atomic substitutions (35, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we have studied the change of penetration depth (T) and normalized superfluid density s(T) of the heavy fermion superconductor CeCu2Si2 (both A/S- and S-type samples).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavior of (T) at very low temperatures agrees with fully gapped superconductivity, as concluded from specific heat measurements (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that a nodeless d+d band-mixing pairing state can account for the temperature dependence of both the superfluid density and specific heat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This state has the necessary sign change of the superconducting order parameter along QAF on the heavy Fermi surface deduced from INS (14) and is consistent with the lack of a coherence peak in 1/T1(T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model also explains the consistency of d-wave superconductivity at higher temperatures, previously reported from 1/T1(T) measurements (15, 18, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore propose this d+d band-mixing pairing state to be the superconducting order parameter of CeCu2Si2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that this is also a strong candidate pairing state for FeSe-based superconductors (36), such a pairing model may well be applicable to a wider range of fully gapped unconventional superconductors, including the case of a single CuO2 layer (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CeCu2Si2 single crystals were synthesized by a modified Bridgman technique using a self-flux method (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature dependence of the London penetration depth shift (T)=Gf(T) was measured down to about 40 mK using a TDO-based technique (47), where f(T)=f(T)f(0), f(T) is the resonant frequency of the TDO coil, and G is a calibration constant (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
