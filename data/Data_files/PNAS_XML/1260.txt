-Catenindependent mechanotransduction dates back to the common ancestor of Cnidaria and Bilateria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Besides genetic regulation, mechanical forces have been identified as important cues in numerous developmental processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanical forces can activate biochemical cascades in a process called mechanotransduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies in vertebrates and flies elucidated the role of mechanical forces for mesodermal gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains unclear whether mechanotransduction is a universal regulatory mechanism throughout Metazoa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis that mechanical pressure can ectopically activate or restore brachyury expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanotransduction is dependent on -catenin, similar to vertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that a regulatory feedback loop between genetic and mechanical gene activation exists during gastrulation and the -catenindependent mechanotransduction is an ancient regulatory mechanism, which was present in the common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the genetic regulation of cellular differentiation processes is well established, recent studies have revealed the role of mechanotransduction on a variety of biological processes, including regulation of gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains unclear how universal and widespread mechanotransduction is in embryonic development of animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we investigate mechanosensitive gene expression during gastrulation of the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, a cnidarian model organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the blastoporal marker gene brachyury is down-regulated by blocking myosin II-dependent gastrulation movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brachyury expression can be restored by applying external mechanical force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using CRISPR/Cas9 and morpholino antisense technology, we also show that mechanotransduction leading to brachyury expression is -catenin dependent, similar to recent findings in fish and Drosophila [Brunet T, et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2013) Nat Commun 4:115].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrate that prolonged application of mechanical stress on the embryo leads to ectopic brachyury expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data indicate that -catenindependent mechanotransduction is an ancient gene regulatory mechanism, which was present in the common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians, at least 600 million years ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The_Role_of_Myosin_II_During_Gastrulation_of_N_vectensis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gastrulation in N. vectensis occurs by invagination and is initiated by the apical constriction of cells at the animal pole, which leads to the formation of the preendodermal plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the preendodermal plate invaginates into the blastocoel (Movie S1) (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As actomyosin constriction is involved in apical constriction and cell-shape changes, we examined the necessity of this force-generating mechanism during gastrulation using ML-7, a potent and selective reversible myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that 10 M ML-7, applied at blastula stage, was sufficient to completely inhibit invagination during gastrulation, although this treatment did not entirely inhibit apical constriction of preendodermal cells (Fig 1I) (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that additional, actomyosin-independent mechanisms such as membrane shuttling participate in preendoderm apical constriction (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To show that the effect of ML-7 is nontoxic and reversible, we washed out the inhibitor after 12 h of treatment, at the time when the control embryos have completed gastrulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the ML-7 washout embryos (78/100) then gastrulated (Fig S1) and ultimately develop into polyps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ML-7 specifically impairs myosin II function required for invagination of the endoderm during N. vectensis gastrulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Blocking_Gastrulation_Movements_Inhibits_Brachyury_Expression__Which_Can_Be_Rescued_by_Applying_External_Mechanical_Stress  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gastrulation in Nematostella is accompanied by the expression of several marker genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the T-box gene brachyury starts shortly before gastrulation as a broad ring at blastula stage marking the boundary of the preendodermal plate (Fig 1 CE) (4548).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the beginning of gastrulation movements, brachyury expression intensifies and narrows to a few rows of marginal cells surrounding the blastopore (Fig 1 FH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If brachyury expression depends on mechanical stress generated by gastrulation movements, we expected brachyury expression to be reduced in ML-7treated embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in more than 95% of ML-7treated embryos brachyury expression either vanishes completely or is not expressed as a contiguous ring (Fig 1 B, J, and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether loss of brachyury expression in ML-7inhibited embryos is due to the absence of mechanical strains, pregastrulation blastulae were subjected to external pressure for 12 h during ML-7 treatment (Fig 1A and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As controls, spherical blastulae were treated with ML-7 or DMSO without exogenous force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental treatments began in stage-matched blastulae [16 hours postfertilization (hpf)] and were terminated when all of the DMSO-treated control embryos had completed gastrulation (28 hpf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed normal brachyury expression in a contiguous ring in 50% (n = 119) of the ML-7treated embryos subjected to compression compared with 5% (n = 104) in similarly treated embryos with no compression (three independent experiments; P  0.02 paired, two-tailed Students t test) (Fig 1 B, M, and N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that applied mechanical stimulation is sufficient to restore brachyury expression in embryos lacking gastrulation strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interestingly, mechanical force applied to the ML-7treated embryos during gastrulation activated brachyury expression only around the blastopore (Fig 1N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, blastoporal cells appear more competent than the rest of the embryo to respond to mechanical forces by altering gene expression, likely because the blastopore cells are a zone of active Wnt/-catenin signaling and brachyury is a direct target of -catenin (47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Up-Regulation_of_Brachyury_Expression_upon_External_Mechanical_Strain_Is_-Catenin_Dependent  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether -catenin has a role in stress-induced expression of brachyury, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to mutate the apc homolog in Nematostella (4851).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apc is a necessary component of the -catenin destruction complex and its loss of function is expected to lead to constitutive activation of Wnt/-catenin signaling (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homozygous mutants of apc show a discernible phenotype at 3 dpf, as expected for a negative regulator of Wnt signaling (47, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homozygous apc mutants also express brachyury ectopically compared with wild-type and heterozygous siblings (Fig 2 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this expression was maintained even during ML-7 treatment, which blocks invagination of the preendodermal plate (Fig 2 E and F), suggesting that the stabilization of -catenin is downstream of the mechanotransduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a complementary test, we repeated the ML-7 treatment and application of mechanical strain on embryos where -catenin expression is knocked down by morpholino (MO) injection (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brachyury expression was lost in the -catenin morpholino-injected embryos and could not be rescued by application of external mechanical stress (Fig 2 GK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results show that up-regulation of brachyury expression upon mechanical stress is -catenin dependent and that the mechanical stress acts upstream of -catenin activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prolonged_Mechanical_Stress_Activates_Ectopic_Brachyury_Expression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether other areas of the embryo are competent to express brachyury in response to mechanical force, we subjected stage-matched spherical blastulae to prolonged compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compressed embryos at 15 Â°C for 26 h until control embryos had completed gastrulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation at colder temperatures slows down the development and enables the force impact during gastrulation for a longer time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 40% (74/187) of the compressed embryos had broad, ectopic brachyury expression relative to 10% (7/68) uncompressed controls (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, compression of late gastrulae did not lead to ectopic brachyury expression (Fig 3 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, there appears to be a narrow time window in which cells are competent to respond to mechanical forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that mechanical forces cooperate with the genetic factors to regulate brachyury expression during the blastula-to-gastrula transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Role_of_Mechanical_Strains_and_Cell-Shape_Change_During_Gastrulation_of_N_vectensis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To monitor the morphogenetic movements and the dynamics of cell-shape changes during gastrulation, we generated a transgenic line expressing the actin-binding protein lifeact-mOrange2 under the control of a recently reported EF1a promoter (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During gastrulation, presumptive endodermal cells constrict apically, forming a preendodermal plate, which then invaginates into the blastocoel (Movie S1) (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, ectodermal cells surrounding the blastopore also undergo extensive morphogenetic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of the time-lapse movies of gastrulating embryos of Nematostella revealed that the formation and invagination of the preendodermal plate correlates with extensive elongation of the ectodermal blastopore lip cells, whereas the shape of more aboral cells remains unchanged (Fig 4A, Fig S4 AI, and Movies S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shortly after, the blastoporal cells constrict on the basal side, thus bending the blastopore lip toward the preendodermal plate and therefore pushing it inside (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, ML-7 treatment only slightly inhibits apical constriction of the preendodermal cells, and blastoporal cells abutting the preendodermal plate get stretched apically as in the control embryo (Fig 4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, sagittal sections of the ML-7treated gastrulae revealed that the blastoporal marginal cells do not constrict on the basal side (Fig 4C), and hence the blastopore lip does not bend inwards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the blastopore lip is unable to push in the preendodermal plate during gastrulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that cellular contractility at the basal side of the blastopore lip cells is very important for the morphogenetic movements during gastrulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the pushing force of the blastopore lip rather than a pulling force of the apical constriction of the preendodermal cells is a driving force of invagination movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regardless, the fact that blocking actomyosin contraction during gastrulation abolishes expression of several -catenin target genes (47, 53), such as brachyury, foxA, axin, and apc, expressed in the blastopore lip (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ML-7 treatment did not affect snailA expressin in the preendodermal plate (Fig S3 K and L).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the blastopore lip is a sensitive region for -catenindependent mechanotransduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To get insights into the mechanical properties of the cells during gastrulation, we used a Brillouin scattering microscope, which allows for spatial mapping of the viscoelastic properties of biological materials (5558).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Brillouin microscope probes the sample pixel per pixel with a single-frequency laser and measures the gigahertz scale (less_than0.0001-nm wavelength) spectral modification of the scattered light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectrally shifted light is the result of inherent collective thermal density fluctuations within the sample, which can be used to calculate the viscoelasticity of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our measurements show that the blastopore lip cells appear significantly stiffer than the plate cells or cells on the aboral side of the embryo (the elastic modulus in the former is larger than in the latter by on average more than 10%) (Fig S4 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, cells of the ML-7treated embryos were significantly softer than cells of the wild-type embryos and blastopore lip cells displayed a similar stiffness as the other parts of the embryo (Fig 4 EI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that contractility and increased longitudinal compressibility (stiffness) of the blastopore lip cells is crucial for the force generation, which drives invagination movements and facilitates mechanosensitive gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results show that in Nematostella, brachyury expression can be induced by -catenindependent mechanotransduction of physical forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that during normal development, the gastrulation movements generate the physical forces acting on blastopore lip cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that mechanical and genetic regulation of gene expression form a feedback loop that robustly enforces brachyury expression: early maternal activation of intracellular components of Wnt/-catenin at the oral pole activate the expression of Wnt ligands in the preendodermal plate at the blastula stage (Fig 4I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through negative feedback loops, these Wnt genes become expressed as a ring surrounding the preendodermal plate, where they initiate brachyury expression at the margin of the blastopore and endoderm in the plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contractility of the blastopore lip cells lead to a local higher stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanical stress is then transduced in a -catenindependent manner to enforce brachyury expression and other targets of -catenin in the blastopore lip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the high concentrations of -catenin at the oral pole, this region is particularly competent to respond to mechanical stress, preventing that undirected physical forces could ectopically activate brachyury expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, upon prolonged physical stress, brachyury can be induced ectopically as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contraction of the blastopore lip cells at the basal side then bends the lip inward and pushes the plate into the blastocoel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because -catenindependent mechanotransduction and activation of brachyury is also found in other Bilateria (16), these findings imply that this mechanism of gene regulation and the feedback between genetic and mechanical gene activation might be an ancient feature of animal development, at least predating the cnidarianbilaterian split over 600 Mya (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals_and_Embryo_Culturing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals were kept in the dark at 18 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spawning and embryo collection were performed as described (59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Work with genetically modified organisms (GMO) of safety level 1 at the Department of Molecular Evolution and Development, University of Vienna, was approved by the Ministery of Economy and Sciences (BMWfW) of Austria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Live_Imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transgenic animals expressing lifeact-mOrange2 under control of the ubiquitous EF1 promoter were generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fully transgenic F1 animals were spawned as described (59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgenic embryos were embedded in 1% low-melting point agarose (V3841, Promega) and imaged in Nematostella medium (NM) with a HCX ApoL40X/0.8W objective using a Leica TCS SP5X confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time stamps were added to the movies using ImageJ software Time Stamper plugin (NIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Morpholino_Injection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
-Catenin knockdown was performed by zygote injection of previously characterized translation blocking -catMO: 5 TTCTTCGACTTTAAATCCAACTTCA (53) at a concentration of 500 M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Inhibitor_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prior treatment embryos were kept at 17 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the inhibition of cellular contractility and cellular mechanical tensions within the embryo, ML-7, a selective MLCK inhibitor, was used (Calbiochem, Merk Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All treatments were carried out at 22 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 16 hpf, precisely staged spherical blastulae were selected and treated with 10 M ML-7/1% DMSO in NM until 28 hpf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control embryos were treated with 1% DMSO in NM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least 100 embryos were selected for each treatment, including the experiments with embryo compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 28 hpf, embryos were processed for the fixation as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm reversibility of ML-7 treatment, at 28 hpf, ML-7treated embryos were washed 5 Ã 5 min in NM and left to develop in NM until 42 hpf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Uniaxial_Global_Embryo_Compression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To restore mechanical strains in ML-7inhibited embryos, we applied uniaxial global embryo compression to the embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we placed exactly 100 embryos on a Petri plate lined with 1.1% low-melting point agarose/10 M ML-7/NM) in the 10 M ML-7/1% DMSO/NM solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscopic coverslip size 24 Ã 50 mm, m = 0.43 g (Roth, catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1871) was slowly dragged on top of the embryos without further pressing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, the force compressing the embryos was approximately equivalent to the weight of the coverslip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the number of embryos in each experiment was 100, the compressing force was roughly the same in each experiment, which was calculated as: F = mcoverslipÂ·g  Fa; Fa = waterÂ·gÂ·Vcoverslip; F = 2.61 mN on 100 embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, 26 N was applied to each embryo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryos were compressed for 12 h at 22 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three independent experiments were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To stimulate ectopic brachyury expression, we compressed stage-matched spherical blastulae at 16 hpf and late gastrulae at 28 hpf for 26 h at 16 Â°C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phalloidin_Staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Embryos were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS at 4 Â°C for 1 h. After 7 min acetone shock on ice, embryos were washed five times in PBSTx (PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100) and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:30 in PBSTx at 4 Â°C, overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the staining, embryos were washed 10 Ã 10 min in PBSTx, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and imaged with a Leica TCS SP5X confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_Hybridization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In situ hybridizations (ISHs) were conducted as previously described (48, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryos were imaged and quantified with the Nikon Eclipse 80i compound microscope equipped with DIC optics and Zeiss AxioCam camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the in situ patterns of different treatments within one experiment was done blindly on encoded microscope slides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Brillouin_Scattering_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Image_Processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Images were adjusted for levels, brightness, and contrast using FIJI software (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focus stacking of ISH images was done using Helicon Focus software (Helicon Soft Ltd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All images were cropped and assembled into the panels using Adobe Illustrator CS6 software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell-Shape_Index_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell-shape indexes of the blastoporal and aboral cells for the beginning of gastrulation (t0) and for the midgastrulation time point (t1) were calculated as follows: cell index(t) = cell width(t)/cell length(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fold change cell index was calculated as cell index(t0)/cell index(t1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n = 30, P  0.01, paired two-tailed Students t test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nondividing cells visible in the middle of the field of view were taken at random for measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
