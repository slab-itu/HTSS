Role of surface and subsurface processes in scaling N2O emissions along riverine networks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We show that N2O emissions from riverine systems depend on river and stream size and that the primary source of N2O production shifts from the hyporheic and benthic zones in streams to the benthic and water column in rivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis also reveals the primary scaling factors governing riverine N2O emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, it provides a predictive tool to quantify N2O emissions from any riverine environment worldwide, among biomes, land-use types, and climatic conditions, using readily available reach-scale biogeochemical measurements and hydromorphological data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Riverine environments, such as streams and rivers, have been reported as sources of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere mainly via microbially mediated denitrification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our limited understanding of the relative roles of the near-surface streambed sediment (hyporheic zone), benthic, and water column zones in controlling N2O production precludes predictions of N2O emissions along riverine networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we analyze N2O emissions from streams and rivers worldwide of different sizes, morphology, land cover, biomes, and climatic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the primary source of N2O emissions varies with stream and river size and shifts from the hyporheicbenthic zone in headwater streams to the benthicwater column zone in rivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis reveals that N2O production is bounded between two N2O emission potentials: the upper N2O emission potential results from production within the benthichyporheic zone, and the lower N2O emission potential reflects the production within the benthicwater column zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By understanding the scaling nature of N2O production along riverine networks, our framework facilitates predictions of riverine N2O emissions globally using widely accessible chemical and hydromorphological datasets and thus, quantifies the effect of human activity and natural processes on N2O production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of average flux of N2O emissions per unit area, FN2O (micrograms N per square meter per hour), from the study reaches of all of 417 analyzed streams and rivers to the atmosphere shows that FN2O systematically decreases with system size (as width) along a gradient from headwater streams to rivers (Fig 1) of contrasting river networks (e.g., US streams and African rivers) and within the same networks (e.g., Manistee and Tippecanoe, with channel widths that span less_than1 to  greater than 50 m) (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this analysis, streams and rivers can be classified in three zones according to the gradient of reduction in emissions shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zone 1, which includes small streams with widths (W) that are less than 10 m (4), shows a very steep reduction of emissions with stream size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zone 2, which includes streams with 10 less_thanWless_than 30 m, has a gradual reduction of emissions with stream size, and zone 3 groups rivers with W30 m and N2O emissions that do not depend on W. These proposed breaks are similar to those reported in the stream geomorphological literature (26, 27), suggesting the importance of stream hydromorphological characteristics for determining the biogeochemistry of streams/rivers (details are in SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that this reduction is caused by a shift from N2O production that occurs primarily in the benthic and hyporheic zones (benthichyporheic zone) of headwater streams to N2O production occurring in the benthic zone and the water column (benthicwater column zone) of rivers, and this shift is caused by a reduction in hyporheic exchange rate with increasing stream/river discharge flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The work of Ocampo et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (15) suggested interpreting NO3 transport and transformation within a riparian zone using a Damköhler number, which is the ratio of a characteristic residence time, with importance (28) that has been documented by several empirical (5, 16, 17) and numerical (29, 30) investigations, to the characteristic time of the pertinent biogeochemical reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent investigations also proposed this approach to interpret hyporheic processes (31, 32), and they adapted it to quantify the hyporheic biogeochemical response at both bed-form (33) and reach (34) scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we capitalized on these advances to depict the observed scaling effect on N2O emissions across riverine networks (Fig 1), and we parameterized the transformation efficiency of dissolved NO3 to gaseous N2O in terms of two Damköhler numbers (Materials and Methods and SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In headwater streams that are typically small and shallow, microbially mediated denitrification occurs mainly within the benthichyporheic zone (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Headwater stream hydrodynamics at and within the streambed (hyporheic flows) is the main factor controlling the flux of dissolved nutrients to the microbial assemblages that control biogeochemical transformations (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the Damköhler number for the benthichyporheic zone is defined as the ratio between the median hyporheic residence time (50), which is an index of the time that stream water spends within the hyporheic sediment, and the characteristic time of denitrification (D), D=1/kD, where kD is the denitrification reaction rate (evaluated as the ratio between the denitrification uptake rate, vfden, and the mean flow depth, Y0: kD=vfden/Y0): DaDHZ=50/D (zone 1 in Fig 2) (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as stream size increases, the ratio of hyporheic to surface flow declines, which reduces the relative contribution of hyporheic zone to biogeochemical transformations (zone 2 in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rivers, therefore, water column transformations combined with benthic processes at the sedimentwater interface dominate denitrification, overwhelming the benthichyporheic contribution (zone 3 in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior requires a different metric to describe the relevant timescale of N2O production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify this metric with the time of turbulent vertical mixing, tm, which is the average time for any neutrally buoyant particle to sweep through the entire water column because of turbulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we introduce a unique Damköhler number for rivers, DaDS=tm/D, with tm replacing 50 and stating a shift from hyporheic- to water column-dominated N2O production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to our previous work (34), we define the dimensionless flux of N2O, F*N2O, as the ratio between FN2O and the total flux per unit streambed area of dissolved inorganic nitrogen species [NO3 and ammonium (NH4)] in the stream (FDIN0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both reactive species are potential sources of N2O via denitrification and nitrification, respectively (37), and may vary with time and stream (11) (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, dimensionless emissions depend on the inorganic nitrogen load through kD, which is often parameterized as a function of the stream concentration of NO3 (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of isotopic N15 tracer along the LINXII Study sites (6, 10, 11) allows for separating N2O production from the benthic and hyporheic zones, with the former associated with direct denitrification and the latter associated with the indirect one (6, 34) (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, groundwater and water column contributions from these headwater systems were deemed negligible at the LINXII Study sites (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measured emissions from only the benthic zone (Fig 3, red symbols) are one order of magnitude lower than the total emissions from both benthic and hyporheic zones (Fig 3, orange symbols), stating the relative importance of the hyporheic zone contribution in headwater streams (zone 1 in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power law relationships reported in Fig 3 shown by red and orange lines are obtained by regression with the experimental LINXII Study data and suggest that hydromorphological processes governing hyporheic exchange also influence processes within the benthic zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have similar scaling patterns, with experimental data ranging more than five log scales regardless of biome, LULC type, stream morphology, stream size, and climatic conditions (Fig 3) and effects that are accounted in the proposed dimensionless framework via FDIN0, kD, and 50, with kD linked to biochemistry and 50 linked to stream hydraulic and morphology (34, 36) (Materials and Methods and SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This linkage confers predictability to the above relationships provided that FDIN0 is known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same analysis applied to N2O flux from the benthichyporheic zone in the Kalamazoo River watershed (19, 20) shows a similar scaling with DaDHZ for F*N2O (Fig 3, green dashed line), which is not statistically different from the orange line in Fig 3 [analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analysis Fvalue=0.068less_thanFcrit=4.259 and P=0.796 greater than 0.05].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we combine the LINXII Study and Kalamazoo River data and define the following power law (black solid line in Fig 3): F*N2O=1.55×107(DaDHZ)0.43 and r2=0.48, which we identify as the upper N2O emission potential (upper bound) from headwater streams caused by processes occurring in both the hyporheic and benthic zones, whereas the production from only the benthic zone provides the lower N2O emission potential (lower bound) (red solid line in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that these two dimensionless power laws are globally applicable at the watershed and larger scale, because the use of DaDHZ captures both the advective and biogeochemical scaling of N2O production at the reach scale, whereas the effect of water temperature can be accounted for with an Arrhenius-like relationship when quantifying the N2O flux from F*N2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We test their generality with all study reaches (more than 400 worldwide), excluding those used in their derivation (LINXII Study, 16 streams, and Kalamazoo River, 12 streams).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, N2O emissions from headwater streams in zone 1 within a riverine network (compare Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4A) can be computed as the product of the total mass flux of inorganic nitrogen load (FDIN0) and F*N2O provided by the upper-bound power law model as a function of DaDHZ (black line in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found this power law valid for all of the headwater streams of the watersheds analyzed in this study regardless of biomes, LULC, or climatic conditions (in Fig 4A, notice the higher r2 of 0.59 when applied for all studied headwater streams without including those used to derive the upper-bound power law relationship in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regression of a power law to all of the available data (blue line in Fig 4A) is also not statistically different (ANCOVA analysis Fvalue=0.0less_thanFcrit=3.89 and P=1 greater than 0.05) from the upper-bound power law (black lines in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4A) and maintains the same r2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we suggest that the upper-bound power law could be widely applicable to streams across the globe because of the breath of our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some unexplained variance is likely caused by N2O originating from groundwater and terrestrial sources or nitrification/denitrification of groundwater NH4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model assumed that the main source of N2O resulted from transformations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (NO3 plus NH4) present in the stream without distinguishing the source of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (e.g., groundwater, runoff, or atmospheric deposition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we may partially account for NH4 of groundwater origin if nitrification occurs within the stream via transformation in the water column, benthic, or hyporheic zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another potential source of error is that we do not account explicitly for hyporheic downwelling fluxes that control the amount of reactants delivered to the sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fluxes depend on the same hydromorphological parameters that characterize 50, and thus, we implicitly, although partially, account for downwelling fluxes via 50, because there is an inverse relationship between 50 and mean hyporheic downwelling flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As stream/river size increases, the relative contribution of the hyporheic zone to N2O emissions in relation to the benthos and water column declines; consequently, our conceptual model predicts a decline in dimensionless emissions, F*N2O (compare Fig 4 A, C, and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notice that colors of the symbols in Fig 4 vary from green to yellow as the width of the system increases from streams to rivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coefficient of determination of the upper-bound power law model, which includes both benthic and hyporheic zones (in Fig 4, the black lines are the same as in Fig 3), declines moving from headwater streams (Fig 4A, r2=0.59) to intermediate systems (Fig 4C, r2=0.28) and rivers (Fig 4E, r2=0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decrease suggests a shift in processes controlling N2O production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the data are fitted, r2 rises again, but the resulting regression curves, shown in blue in Fig 4 C and E, increasingly deviate from the power law model of zone 1 (upper bound) (black line in Fig 3) as stream and river size increases (moving from Fig 4 A, C, and E) and approaches the lower-bound power law model (Fig 3, red line with r2 of 0.40 when applied for all studied rivers, of which none were used for its derivation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fitted blue line in Fig 4E and the lower-bound power law (red line in Fig 4E), which was derived without the contribution of the hyporheic zone (Fig 3), are not statistically different (ANCOVA analysis Fvalue=0less_thanFcrit=3.86 and P=1 greater than 0.05), which suggests that hyporheic processes have a negligible contribution to N2O emissions in rivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, a power law, F*N2O=c1(DaDS)b, where DaDS, encapsulating hydrodynamic and biochemical processes occurring in the benthicwater column environment, replaces DaDHZ fitted to the experimental data separately (Fig 4 B, D, and F), shows very low-determination coefficients in headwater and intermediate systems (Fig 4 B, r2=0.26 and D, r2=0.08) but a value comparable with that in Fig 4A for rivers (r2=0.54 in Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, N2O emissions from rivers scale with DaDS (which is defined by replacing the hyporheic residence time with the residence time in the water column) better than with DaDHZ (compare Fig 4 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We suggest that the contribution of the water column to N2O emissions increases from streams to rivers as an effect of an increase in suspended particle loads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Denitrification has been shown to occur within anoxic microsites associated with suspended sediments located throughout the well-mixed water column (38) typical of river systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to existing modeling and empirical approaches (12, 34, 36), which suggest that the hyporheic zone or benthos is the primary source of N2O regardless of stream and river size, our data show a systematic shift from predominantly hyporheicbenthic N2O production in streams to predominantly benthicwater column production in rivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a metaanalysis of all available data collected by us and previously published, we show that this shift is controlled by key hydrodynamic and biogeochemical parameters that effectively explain the observed decline of N2O emissions per unit area as the stream/river size increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used hydrodynamic parameters typically collected in the field for morphologic classification: the reach-scale mean flow velocity (V), the hydraulic depth (Y0), the mean channel width (W), the channel slope (s0), the median grain size (d50), and the type of bed forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When not measured or observed in the field, we estimated these quantities by means of morphological relationships as a function of drainage area and water discharge (3941) (Table S5) or using information extracted from remote sensing and Digital Terrain Map analysis (chiefly for W and s0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we used morphological relationships on bed-form stability to characterize bed-form morphology and d50 (42, 43) when not observed in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successively, we used these parameters to quantify tm (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1) or 50 (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 shows dune morphology, and Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 shows pool-riffle morphology).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biogeochemical parameters are kD, which we evaluated in the field or derived from NO3 concentrations measurements (Table S3), and NO3 and NH4 concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these quantities vary among reaches belonging to the same river system as noted in Tables S2 and S3, which report the minimum and maximum values for each river system as well as the variability of DaDHZ and DaDS, which depends on variation in morphological and biogeochemical parameters (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variability results from natural variation in both hydraulics and biogeochemical parameters among reaches and may explain, at least partially, the scatter observed in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4, but it does not represent the effect of parameter uncertainty or within-reach variability, which we do not consider here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N2O emissions per unit area are predictable and greater, for a given nutrient load, in headwater streams compared with rivers, in part because of the contribution of the hyporheic zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Headwater streams are important sources of N2O emissions along riverine networks resulting from a combination of significant contact time with the bioreactive benthichyporheic zone and significant surfacesubsurface exchange of water and solutes (4, 18) as well as their relative predominance in river networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, as streams transition to rivers, the contribution of the hyporheic zone declines, and benthicwater column contribution dominates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, headwater streams may have a disproportionate impact on annual N2O emissions, especially if they drain agricultural or urban LULC type, because they also represent the greatest proportion of riverine network drainage length (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We unveiled the primary scaling factors governing riverine N2O emissions and provide a predictive tool that can be applied worldwide to quantify N2O emissions from riverine environments across scales from headwater streams (Qless_than0.2 m3/s) to rivers (Q19,000 m3/s) draining a variety of biomes, LULC types, and climatic conditions through accessible reach-scale geochemical measurements (i.e., stream temperature and NO3 concentration) and hydromorphological parameters (i.e., stream morphology, mean flow depth, velocity, slope, and channel width) (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our scaling laws allow one to quantify N2O emissions at the watershed scale using geographic information system analyses of stream morphology (44) and readily available measurements of nitrate and ammonium, which can be distributed throughout the river network, both in space and through time (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach requires robust hyporheic models linked to hydromorphological information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These models are not currently available for cascade, step-pool, and plane-bed morphologies (34), which are common in small headwater streams (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, there is a need for research to define these relationships, include them in network-scale hyporheic models, and quantify Da numbers, such as in the project Networks with Exchange and Subsurface Storage (12) to predict reach-scale N2O emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the above evidences of the role of river morphology in controlling N2O emissions may contribute to improvement of conceptual models by considering stream morphology and constraining and linking the role of the different parts of the stream/river reach (e.g., hyporheic zone, benthic zone, the water column, and also the riparian zone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scaling framework actively quantifies the impact of human activity and natural forcing through 50, a function of river morphology and hydrology (46), which may change because of climate change, water extraction, sediment transport regime, and land use, and D, which accounts for land use land cover, and therefore, water quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water temperature effects on N2O emissions can be also accounted by scaling the dimensionless value with an Arrhenius-type equation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the framework can be used to quantify N2O emissions under different scenarios and treatments, such as watershed-scale changes in land use and water management or how changing climate influences biogeochemical outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, it provides the needed feedback among climate, LULC, and water management to help quantify human impact on climate change at the global scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dimensionless flux of N2O from riverine networks is parameterized with a Damköhler number that represents the ratio between the characteristic residence time within the denitrifying zones (benthic, hyporheic, and water column) and the characteristic time of the biogeochemical reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the purpose of this model, the characteristic time of the biogeochemical reaction is the time of denitrification, D, and it is defined as the inverse of the denitrification reaction rate kD (D=1/kD=Y0/vfden) (details on the calculation of D are in SI Text), whereas the characteristic residence time within the denitrifying zones changes along the riverine network according to the riverine environments that mainly control this biogeochemical process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In headwater streams, a robust estimator of the time that a solute molecule is exposed to the denitrifying environment is the median hyporheic residence time (50), which is the time at which 50% of stream water that entered the streambed sediment is still within the hyporheic zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its value is a function of streambed morphology, surface hydraulics, and groundwater table (details on the calculation of 50 are in SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, it accounts for the impact of external forcing on stream physical conditions, such as human water management, or climate change on discharge and sediment transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in both discharge and sediment input caused by climate change affect bed-form type and shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This forcing also includes LULC, biome, and climatic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the Damköhler number for the benthichyporheic zone is defined as the ratio between the characteristic time controlling hyporheic residence time and the characteristic time controlling the denitrification process:DaDHZ=50D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]Values of DaDHZless_than1 suggest that the system is limited by the denitrification rate (i.e., low kD) or short residence time (small 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, DaDHZ greater than 1 suggests high denitrification efficiency (high kD) or long residence time (large 50) (zone 1 in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As stream size increases, the ratio of hyporheic to surface flow declines in favor of a gradual contribution of the benthicwater column in controlling denitrification (zone 2 in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rivers are turbulent systems in which dissolved solutes and particles are vertically mixed throughout the water column (47), thus requiring a different metric to describe the relevant timescale of N2O production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify this metric with the time of turbulent vertical mixing, tm, which is the average time for any neutrally buoyant particle to sweep through the entire water column because of turbulence (details on the calculation of tm are in SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we introduce a unique Damköhler number for rivers as follows:DaDS=tmD,[2]where the median residence time in the hyporheic zone, 50, is replaced by tm, stating a shift from hyporheic- to water column-dominated N2O production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When DaDSless_than1 (tmless_thanD), the timescale for the vertical mixing is less than that of denitrification; therefore, the production of N2O is chiefly controlled by microbial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when DaDS greater than 1 (tm greater than D), the production of N2O is controlled by hydrodynamics, which determines solute mixing throughout the water column, thereby influencing the contact time with microbial denitrifiers carried by suspended particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Characteristics_of_Analyzed_Streams_and_Rivers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Manistee River, included in the federal registry of National Wild and Scenic Rivers, is forested over 83% of its 3,616-km2 watershed, whereas the Tippecanoe River, also considered one of the top-10 rivers that must be preserved by The Nature Conservancy, has 82% of its 4,496-km2 watershed in intensive row crop agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrasting LULC types between these two watersheds are reflected in seasonal and annual patterns of discharge, temperature regimes, and inorganic N loading, with average NO3 concentration at 120 gN/L in the Manistee River and 1,860 gN/L in the Tippecanoe River during summer base flow conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During summer, stream discharges range between 22 and 14,000 L/s in the Manistee River and between 2.5 and 22,500 L/s in the Tippecanoe River from the headwaters to the main stem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Kalamazoo River (Michigan) watershed, data are available from 12 small headwater streams (Qless_than60 L/s) draining three different LULC types [i.e., agriculture, urban, and reference (unmodified LULC)] (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sites are composed of low-gradient streams dominated by fine sediments and sand (20) with dune-like and pool-riffle morphologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LINXII Study dataset includes 16 headwater streams from six different US biomes across three different LULC types (agriculture, urban, and reference) characterized by two different types of morphology: pool riffle and dune (6, 10, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these headwater systems, experimental results confirm that N2O production within the water column is negligible (6, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to use 16 of 72 LINXII Study streams that included geomorphic site characterization, which allowed us to characterize the flux of N2O and/or the median hyporheic residence time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the remaining sites, 29 had missing N2O emission or production rates [table S1 in the work by Beaulieu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6)], whereas the remaining 30 sites had step-pool, cascade, or undefined morphology for which there are no hyporheic flow models to provide a robust estimate of the median hyporheic residence time (50) [discussion of figure 2 in the work by Marzadri et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (34)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also used previously published data collected at five locations along the Swale-Ouse River (United Kingdom) from headwater (steep reach characterized by boulders, cobble, and sand) to tidal sites (low gradient and mainly sand-bedded reach) and at one site of a highly eutrophic tributary, the Wiskle River (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean annual discharge of the Swale-Ouse is 5,600 L/s, and the LULC is mainly agriculture (42% arable and 23% pasture).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The six large river networks in sub-Saharan Africa are characterized mainly by three different LULC: grassland [AthiGalanaSabaki (AGS), Betsiboka, and Tana], forest (Rianila and Congo), and woodland and shrubland (Zambezi) (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their mean annual discharges range from Q72,000 L/s in the AGS to Q41,000, 127 L/s in the Congo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower part of the Hudson River is a tidal system flowing in the urban area between Albany and Manhattan, with a mean annual discharge of 400,000 L/s (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We categorize all of the streams and rivers into three zones according to estimated width W, and we categorized channel sizes as small with W 10 m, intermediate systems with W=1030m, and large rivers with W 30 m. Our analysis (Fig 1) shows that N2O emissions decrease rapidly with W in zone 1, decrease slowly in zone 2, and remain constant in zone 3, which are in agreement with previous characterizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Forest Practice Code (26), streams are classified as small and intermediate with Wless_than2030m and rivers are classified with W greater than 2030m, whereas in the work by Buffington and Montgomery (27), small streams have width Wless_than20m, intermediate streams have W=2030m, and large rivers have W greater than 30m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with these classifications, we reduce the width limit for small streams to W10m according to the work by Peterson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_the_Timescale_of_Vertical_Mixing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The timescale of vertical mixing is given by the following expression: tmY02/Dz, where Y0 represents the length scale of vertical mixing, and Dz is the vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient (47), which can be evaluated through the following expression (48): Dz0.067Y0u*; u*=(gY0s0)0.5 is the shear velocity, where g is the gravitational acceleration and s0 is the friction slope (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the characteristic time becomestm=Y00.067u*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]The friction slope is evaluated using the Mannings formulation under the assumption of uniform flow condition in a wide channel:s0=(0.035VY02/3)2,[S2]where V is the mean flow velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If not measured, the reach-scale mean width W, depth Y0, and velocity V are evaluated by using the following power law relationships (39):{W=aQb,Y0=cQd,V=eQf,[S3]where the scale factors a, c, and e and the exponents b, d, and f depend on watershed drainage area WDA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For watersheds with WDA35,000km2, we used the parameters reported by Raymond et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (41), and we used those by Rhoads (40) for watersheds with WDA greater than 35,000km2 (Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both measured and computed (through Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3) reach-scale hydraulics are reported in Tables S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_the_Median_Hyporheic_Residence_Time  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The median hyporheic residence, 50, was evaluated for dune and pool-riffle morphology according to formulations presented in a previous work (34) by assuming steady-state flow conditions in both the stream and hyporheic zone and neutral groundwaterstream interaction (no losing or gaining conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium, which was used to compute 50, is assumed homogeneous within the following range: Kh=3.18×104m/s6.5×103m/s depending on d50 (49), if available, or streambed sediment texture (Table S2 reports the range of variation of all of the hydromorphologic parameters used to evaluate 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Streams and rivers included in the LINXII Study experiment and the following stream/rivers (Kalamazoo, Manistee, Tippecanoe, and Swale-Ouse) are characterized with dune or pool-riffle morphology according to the available information on stream slope (s0) and median grain size (d50) and where possible (the LINXII Study, Manistee River, and Tippecanoe River), by visual inspection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  African rivers and the Hudson River are assumed to be characterized by dune morphology according to the values of stream slope evaluated from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For streams characterized by dune morphology, the value of 50 is evaluated according to the formulation proposed and validated by Elliott and Brooks (50):50=2cos1(0.5)2hmKh,[S4]where =2/Ld is the bed-form wavelength [with Ld=6Y0 being the bed-form length evaluated according to Yalin (42)], Kh is the alluvium hydraulic conductivity, and hm is the amplitude of head variation, which depends on stream hydrodynamic parameters through the following equation reported by Shen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (51):hm=0.28V22g{(Hd0.34Y0)3/8ifHdY0less_than0.34,(Hd0.34Y0)3/2ifHdY0 greater than 0.34,[S5]where g is the gravitational acceleration and Hd is the bed-form height, which is assumed equal to Hd=0.167Y0 according to Yalin (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, according to Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S4 and S5 and given that D=Y0/vfden, under the hypothesis that Ld=6Y0 and Hd=0.167Y0 (42), DaDHZ assumes the following expression:DaDHZ=2cos1(0.5)(26Y0)2Kh0.28V22g(0.1670.34)3/8vfdenY0=17.810gY0vfdenKhV2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S6]For streams characterized by pool-riffle morphology, 50 is evaluated according to the formulation proposed and validated by Marzadri et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (33):50=0.21exp(1.22YD*)LprCzs0Kh,[S7]where Lpr=6.5W is the bar length, Cz is the dimensionless Chezy coefficient quantifying streambed resistance (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9), and YD*=Y0/Hpr is the dimensionless streamflow depth that depends on the pool-riffle height Hpr according to the following expression proposed by Ikeda (43):Hpr=Y0(0.18ds0.451.45)for2less_thanless_than35,[S8]where =W/(2Y0) is the alternate bar aspect ratio and ds=d50/Y0 is the relative submergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, streambed resistance is estimated through the following relationship:Cz=6+2.5ln12.5dS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S9]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7S9, and D=Y0/vfden and under the hypothesis that Lpr=6.5W, DaDHZ assumes the following expression:DaDHZ=1.365Wexp[1.220.18(d50Y0)0.45(W2Y0)1.45][1+2.5ln(Y02.5d50)]Khs0vfdenY0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S10]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and with D=Y0/vfden, DaDS assumes the following expression:DaDS=Y00.067gY0s0vfdenY0=14.925vfdengY0s0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S11]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_the_Residence_Time_of_Denitrification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated D=1/kD=Y0/vfden for each stream and river based on data availability, which ranged from direct kD measurements to reported values of vfden and Uden to directly measured NO3 concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We scaled vfden with Y0, because the mean hydraulic depth is a critical parameter for both stream and hyporheic hydraulics; both dune and pool-riffle bed-form hyporheic exchanges depend on Y0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table S3 reports the different formulations adopted to evaluate the uptake rate of denitrification vfden when kD is not measured directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the African rivers and the Hudson River, where no information was available on vfden, we used the empirical formulations proposed by Mulholland et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (10) (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S19), from which vfden is quantified from stream NO3 concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Manistee River and the Tippecanoe River, we used a modified version of the relationship proposed by Mulholland et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (10), where we considered only eight LINXII Study streams in Michigan located midway between our studied watersheds (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Kalamazoo River (Michigan) and the Swale-Ouse River (United Kingdom), we estimated vfden using their measured values of the areal uptake rate of denitrification (Uden) and the stream nitrate concentration (vfden=Uden/[NO3]; Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S21 for the Swale-Ouse River and Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S23 for the Kalamazoo River).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, for the LINXII Study streams, D=1/kD is evaluated as the inverse of the measured values of the reaction rate of denitrification reported in the work by Beaulieu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_Nitrous_Oxide_Production_from_Benthic_and_BenthicHyporheic_Zones_in_the_LINXII_Study_Streams  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the LINXII Study sites, isotopic N15 tracer experiments have been used to measure N2O direct denitrification occurring in the benthos (term B in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we used this information to separate it from the total emissions (emission rate) (term A in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S12) (6) to estimate the N2O produced by denitrification within the hyporheic zone (N2OhyporheicDen) (term C in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S12):N2Oemissionrate=N2OdirectDen+N2OhyporheicDen,A=B+C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S12]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The missing production of N2O that resolves the mass balance is a combination of indirect denitrification (NH4 to NO3 to N2/N2O) and denitrification that occurs in groundwater before reaching the stream and the hyporheic zone [called from unmeasured sources in the work by Beaulieu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Available data do not allow us to separate the different contributions responsible for indirect denitrification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Marzadri et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (34) proposed that, because of the short duration of the experiments, the LINXII Study measurements did not characterize coupled nitrificationdenitrification, and therefore, the first contribution was deemed equal to zero; therefore, they are, in principle, conservative estimates of N2O production via denitrification, and the contribution of groundwater was shown to also be negligible in the LINXII Study streams (6), such that the unmeasured sources portion equals the N2O production within the hyporheic zone (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3, the lower N2O emission potential is quantified by using only the dimensionless flux of N2O resulting from the production within the benthos (direct denitrification), whereas the upper N2O emission potential is quantified by using the measured total N2O emissions (direct and hyporheic denitrification).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the upper N2O emission potential, we also used the data reported by Beaulieu et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19, 20) measured along the Kalamazoo River.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Evaluation_of_Nitrous_Oxide_Emissions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The N2O emitted to the atmosphere via diffusive evasion FN2O (micrograms N per square meter per hour) is evaluated as follows:FN2O=k2Y0([N2O]obs[N2O]eq),[S13]where k2 is the airwater gas exchange rate (d1), [N2O]obs is the measured concentration of dissolved nitrous oxide in the stream water (micrograms N per liter), and [N2O]eq is the N2O concentration expected if the stream was in equilibrium with the atmosphere (micrograms N per liter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all of the streams and rivers analyzed, [N2O]obs was measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for the Swale-Ouse River (22), the LINXII Study (6) streams, and the Kalamazoo River (19, 20), where FN2O was directly measured, FN2O was calculated using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these rivers, [N2O]eq is computed by using the Henrys law:[N2O]eq=pN2OKHenryMWN2O=pN2Oexp[A1+A2100TK+A3ln(TK100)]MWN2O,[S14]where Ai (i=1,2,3) are constants (9), TK is the water temperature (Kelvin), pN2O is the partial pressure of N2O in the air (atm), and MWN2O is the molecular weight of N2O as N. For the Hudson River, the values of pN2O were measured (24), whereas for the other streams and rivers, we assumed a partial pressure of pN2O=315ppbv=315×109atm (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The airwater gas exchange rate k2 (d1) is quantified as follows (52):k2=k600Y0(ScN2O600)nw,[S15]where nw is a coefficient that should be 1/2 or 2/3 depending on surface state of water; we fixed it equal to 2/3 considering low wind speed (52) along the Manistee River, the Tippecanoe River, and the Swale-Ouse River (United Kingdom) and 1/2 along all of the African rivers and the Hudson River considering the presence of waves at the airwater interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variable k600 (meters per day) is the gas transfer velocity evaluated according to model 5 proposed by Raymond et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (41):k600=2,841(Vs0)+2.02[S16]for all of the rivers except for the Hudson River, along which we used a mean value of k600=4.8×0.24=1.152(m/d) (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This choice is justified by the fact that measurements have been taken in the part of the river influenced by tide effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S15, ScN2O is the Schmidt number of N2O evaluated as a function of water temperature (degrees Celsius) as follows (53):ScN2O=2,056137.11T+4.317T20.054T3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S17]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following Marzadri et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (34), we define the dimensionless flux of N2O, F*N2O, as the ratio between the stream N2O emissions to the atmosphere, FN2O, and the total stream mass flux of NO3 and NH4, which are the potential sources of N2O and may vary with time and stream (11):F*N2O=FN2OV([NH4+]+[NO3]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S18]  #@NEW_LINE#@#
