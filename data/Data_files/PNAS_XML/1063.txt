TRPM4 and TRPM5 are both required for normal signaling in taste receptor cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is currently thought that the transduction of bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli in taste cells depends on G protein-coupled receptor signaling with transient receptor potential melastatin 5 (TRPM5) acting as a common downstream component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the absence of TRPM5, mice have a reduced, but not abolished, ability to detect these stimuli, suggesting that a TRPM5-independent pathway also contributes to taste transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify a critical role for the TRPM4 channel in the detection of these taste qualities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of either TRPM4 or TRPM5 impairs sensitivity to bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli, and loss of both TRPM4 and TRPM5 abolishes taste responses to these stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required and sufficient for the transduction of bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peripheral taste receptor cells use multiple signaling pathways to transduce taste stimuli into output signals that are sent to the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transient receptor potential melastatin 5 (TRPM5), a sodium-selective TRP channel, functions as a common downstream component in sweet, bitter, and umami signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of TRPM5, mice have a reduced, but not abolished, ability to detect stimuli, suggesting that a TRPM5-independent pathway also contributes to these signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify a critical role for the sodium-selective TRP channel TRPM4 in taste transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using live cell imaging and behavioral studies in KO mice, we show that TRPM4 and TRPM5 are both involved in taste-evoked signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of either channel significantly impairs taste, and loss of both channels completely abolishes the ability to detect bitter, sweet, or umami stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required for transduction of taste stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TRPM4_Is_Expressed_in_Type_II_and_Type_III_Taste_Cells_but_Not_in_Type_I_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of TRPM4 and found it was widely expressed in taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colocalization studies with cell type-specific markers in C57BL/6 mice determined some specificity in its expression within the different taste cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no colocalization between TRPM4 and the type I taste cell marker nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 2 (NTPDase2) (Fig 1A; n = 189 TRPM4+ cells and n = 125 NTPDase2+ cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the TRPM5-GFP mice to identify type II taste cells, immunohistochemical analysis showed a high level of colocalization between TRPM4 and TRPM5 (Fig 1B; n = 270 TRPM4+ cells and n = 209 TRPM5-GFP cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 90% of the TRPM5-GFP cells expressed TRPM4, while 70% of the TRPM4 expression was present in TRPM5-GFP taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since TRPM4 was not completely colocalized with the type II cell marker TRPM5, we evaluated its potential expression in type III taste cells, using SNAP-25 as a marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found some colocalization between TRPM4 and SNAP-25 (n = 165 TRPM4+ cells and n = 130 SNAP-25+ cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 165 TRPM4+ cells, 53 cells (32%) also expressed SNAP-25 (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data were confirmed using PGP9.5, a protein that is expressed in neuronal cells, including type III cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifty-four of the TRPM4+ taste cells (n = 169 total) also expressed PGP9.5 (Fig S1A; n = 97, 32%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, TRPM4 is present in a subset of type III cells, in addition to the majority of type II cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that the GFP expression in the TRPM5-GFP mice was not misexpressed in type III taste cells, we did colocalization studies with the type III taste cell markers SNAP-25 and PGP9.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPM5-GFP did not colocalize with either SNAP-25 (Fig S1B; n = 153 TRPM5-GFP cells and n = 120 SNAP-25+ cells) or PGP9.5 (Fig S1C; n = 140 TRPM5-GFP cells and n = 69 PGP9.5+ cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further control experiments were performed to confirm the specificity of our transgenic mouse lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S2 A and C shows representative images from each of the KO lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the KO mice expressed the targeted protein for either single KOs (Fig S2 A and C) or double KOs (DKOs) (Fig S2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed that the TRPM5-GFP was specific to TRPM5-expressing cells (Fig S2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that the loss of both TRPM4 and TRPM5 did not impact the papillae structure or the signaling pathway upstream of TRPM5, we evaluated the expression of three upstream components of the pathway [PLC2, gustducin, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (IP3R3)] in the taste cells from TRPM4/5-DKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find any structural deformities in the circumvallate (CV) papillae of the TRPM4/5-DKO mice, and the taste cells still expressed PLC2, gustducin, and IP3R3 (Fig S2 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the upstream components of the PLC signaling pathway remain intact in the TRPM4/5-DKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if there was a change in expression of the TRPM channels in the KO mice, we evaluated TRPM4 expression in the TRPM5-KO mice and TRPM5 expression in the TRPM4-KO mice (Fig S2 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantitated the fluorescence intensity of our immunohistochemical images using ImageJ (NIH) to identify any changes in expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned this approach would reveal any differences that were due to either an increased expression of the channel within the cell where it is normally expressed or any increase in expression because a greater than normal number of cells were now expressing the target protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no change in TRPM4 expression in the CV of TRPM5-KO mice compared with wild-type mice (P = 1.0) (Fig S2B) and no change in TRPM5 expression in the CV of TRPM4-KO mice compared with wild-type mice (P = 0.22024) (Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data are not confounded by a nonspecific up-regulation of either TRPM4 or TRPM5 in the KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using these transgenic mouse lines, our data found that TRPM5 was not solely responsible for transducing bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is in contrast to a study by Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) that concluded TRPM5 was solely responsible for the transduction of all these stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To resolve this discrepancy, we analyzed the expression levels of TRPM4 in the Trpm5/ mouse line, along with several of the upstream signaling components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to the mice from the study by Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) as Trpm5/ and the mice used in our study as TRPM5-KO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice were originally described by Damak et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis of the Trpm5/ mice identified some changes in this KO mouse line that indicate it was not a neutral mutation (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Trpm5/ mouse, immunohistochemical analyses of the CV papillae identified a complete loss of TRPM5 (Fig S3A) and normal PLC2 and gustducin expression (Fig S3 B and C); however, the expression of IP3R3 and TRPM4 was severely reduced in the CV papillae of these mice (Fig S3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 89% of IP3R3 expression was lost, while TRPM4 expression was reduced by 87% in the Trpm5/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our data, this reduction in TRPM4 expression will have a significant impact on the ability to respond to bitter, sweet, or umami stimuli, and the loss of both TRPM4 and TRPM5 is expected to produce mice ageusic to these stimuli, as shown by Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of IP3R3 will also severely reduce taste responsiveness as previously shown (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unlikely that the Trpm5/ mouse used by Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) would be able to respond to bitter, sweet, or umami stimuli since the expression of all three of these proteins was compromised.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the conclusions from this earlier study that TRPM5 is solely responsible for the transduction of all bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli did not account for the loss of these additional signaling proteins that occur in this strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Different_Taste_Stimuli_Evoke_Sodium_Responses_in_Isolated_Taste_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluated the contributions of TRPM4 and TRPM5 to taste-evoked signaling using live cell imaging on isolated taste cells taken from mice lacking TRPM4, TRPM5, or both TRPM4/5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live cell imaging is a better approach for characterizing the relative contribution of a channel to taste transduction as we can measure responses from a large group of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of dataset provides a quantitative analysis of the role of a particular channel within the entire taste cell population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we chose not to use patch-clamp analysis, which is limited by the number of cells that can feasibly be tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since TRPM4 and TRPM5 are sodium (Na+)-selective, we optimized our preparation to measure changes in taste-evoked Na+ responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, Na+ imaging has not previously been used to measure evoked signals in taste receptor cells, so we used live cell imaging with both Ca2+- and Na+-selective dyes to validate that these Na+ signals were indeed taste-evoked responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Isolated taste receptor cells from C57BL/6 mice were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2 and the Na+ dye Asante NaTrium-2, and both the Ca2+ and Na+ responses to different taste stimuli were measured, including bitter [10 mM denatonium benzoate (Den)], sweet (20 mM sucralose), and umami [20 mM monopotassium glutamate (MPG)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose these stimuli as representatives of bitter, sweet, or umami taste qualities, and we used maximal concentrations for each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also included saccharin in some of our analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies in our laboratory determined that these concentrations of stimuli produce a maximal Ca2+ response and that higher concentrations do not increase the size of the taste-evoked response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose to use maximal concentrations to increase the likelihood that we would capture the responses from all taste cells that are sensitive to these stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also allows us to analyze the different responses to make comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we used less than maximal concentrations, it is possible that we would consider a cell as nonresponsive even though it could respond at higher stimulus concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses of the responses could also be confounded if we were analyzing the responses at lower concentrations when the responses are expected to be more variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a concurrent increase in intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ and Na+ in response to different taste stimuli (Fig 2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in cytosolic Na+ corresponds with the well-established increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that is routinely used to measure evoked responses in taste receptor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Taste_Cells_Lacking_TRPM4_or_TRPM5_Are_Less_Responsive_to_Different_Taste_Stimuli  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then determined how the loss of either TRPM4 or TRPM5 affected the taste-evoked Na+ responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some taste cells that lacked TRPM5 could still generate a taste-evoked Na+ response as well as a normal Ca2+ response to the bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli tested (Fig 2D and Fig S4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained from the TRPM4-KO mouse (Fig 2E and Fig S4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When both TRPM4 and TRPM5 were lost, taste cells were able to produce a normal increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in response to taste stimuli, but the ability to produce a taste-evoked Na+ signal was lost (Fig 2F and Fig S4 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that TRPM4 and TRPM5 both contribute to taste-evoked Na+ signals in taste cells and that these two channels are sufficient to generate these taste-evoked Na+ signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control experiments demonstrate that TTX-sensitive, voltage-gated Na+ channels are not contributing to these taste-evoked Na+ responses (Fig S5 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data also found that these taste-evoked Na+ signals are specific to Ca2+ release from stores because Ca2+ influx through VGCCs did not affect cytosolic Na+ levels (Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further control experiments demonstrated that the isolated taste cells from the TRPM5-KO, TRPM4-KO, and TRPM4/5-DKO animals could still generate Ca2+ responses to sour and salty stimuli, while no Na+ signals were produced (Fig S5 EL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sour and salty responses were recorded in taste cells that also responded to high K, which indicates the presence of VGCCs and identifies them as type III taste cells (15, 32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the loss of either TRPM4 or TRPM5 did not prevent taste cells from responding to sour or salty stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we did not identify any other channels contributing to these taste-evoked Na+ responses, and in an effort to avoid confusion, we will refer to Na+ signals from TRPM4-KO mice as TRPM5-only, while the Na+ signals from TRPM5-KO mice will be called TRPM4-only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next analyzed the taste-evoked Na+ responses in wild-type, TRPM5-only (TRPM4-KO), TRPM4-only (TRPM5-KO), and TRPM4/5-DKO mice to determine the overall responsiveness of the cells to the different stimuli and to evaluate the characteristics of the remaining taste-evoked Na+ responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments on isolated taste cells from both CV and fungiform (Fun) papillae found that the number of bitter responsive taste cells was significantly reduced in either the TRPM5-only or TRPM4-only cells from both papillae compared with wild-type cells (Fig 2 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall responsiveness to Den and sucralose was significantly reduced in both CV and Fun taste cells from each of the KO mice, while saccharin responses were significantly reduced in both KO mouse lines for CV taste cells and TRPM4-only Fun cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saccharin responses were reduced in the Fun TRPM5-only taste cells, but were not significantly different (P = 0.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there were fewer MPG-sensitive taste cells in both TRPM5-only and TRPM4-only mice compared with controls, these values were not significantly different (Fig 2 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taste cells from the TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO mice did not respond to any taste stimulus tested (Fig 2 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We characterized the remaining taste-evoked Na+ signals from the TRPM5-only and TRPM4-only mice and found that these responses had significantly reduced amplitudes (percent rise over baseline) for all of the taste stimuli tested compared with wild-type mice, in both the CV (Fig 3 AD) and the Fun taste cells (Fig 3 EH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also evaluated the integrated area of the response to get a proportional measure of the taste-evoked Na+ signal when either TRPM4 or TRPM5 was absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the responses from the wild-type mice, the overall size of the response was significantly reduced when either TRPM4 or TRPM5 was missing for both CV (Fig 4 AD) and Fun (Fig 4 EH) taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the loss of either TRPM4 or TRPM5 significantly reduces the ability of taste cells to respond to taste stimuli in comparable ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Taste-Evoked_Na+_Signals_Are_Downstream_of_PLC_Signal_and_Require_Ca2+_Release_from_Endoplasmic_Reticulum_Ca2+_Stores  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the TRPM5-only, TRPM4-only, and TRPM4/5-DKO cells retained an intact Ca2+ response, we hypothesized that the taste-evoked Na+ signals are downstream of the PLC signaling pathway that transduces bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we applied the irreversible PLC inhibitor U73122 and measured the effect of blocking PLC activity on the taste-evoked Na+ signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the bitter-, sweet-, and umami-evoked Na+ signals were all abolished by U73122 (Fig 5 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inactive analog of U73122, U73433, did not affect the taste-evoked Na+ responses (Fig 5 EH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, thapsigargin, which inhibits the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump and prevents the refilling of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores, also eliminated the bitter, sweet, and umami taste-evoked Na+ signals (Fig 5 IL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these data, we conclude that the taste-evoked Na+ signals are downstream of the PLC signaling pathway and depend on Ca2+ release from internal stores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Taste-Evoked_Na+_Signals_Are_Solely_Mediated_by_TRPM4_and_TRPM5  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our imaging experiments using the TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO mice indicate that these two channels are solely responsible for generating the taste-evoked Na+ signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure this was the case, we used specific TRPM4 and TRPM5 inhibitors and the TRPM5-only (TRPM4-KO) and TRPM4-only (TRPM5-KO) mice to evaluate the taste-evoked Na+ signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TRPM4 inhibitor 9-phenanthrol is a reversible, selective blocker of the TRPM4 channel (3436).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we applied 9-phenanthrol (50 M) to taste cells from the TRPM4-only mice, the bitter, sweet, and umami taste-evoked Na+ responses were abolished, indicating that the remaining taste-evoked Na+ signal are due to TRPM4 (Fig 6 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washout of 9-phenanthrol, the taste-evoked Na+ signals were restored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) is a reversible, selective blocker for the TRPM5 channel (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of TPPO (50 M) eliminated the remaining taste-evoked Na+ responses in TRPM5-only mice, indicating that these taste-evoked Na+ signals are solely mediated by TRPM5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Responses were restored after washout of TPPO (Fig 6 GL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the specificity of our pharmacological blockers, we applied the TRPM5 blocker TPPO in the TRPM4-only mice (Fig S6 AC) and the TRPM4 blocker 9-phenanthrol in the TRPM5-only mice (Fig S6 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These antagonists had no effect on the taste-evoked signals in these experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these data and our data from the TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO mice (Fig 2), we conclude that both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are responsible for the taste-evoked Na+ signals and that no other channel contributes to these responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TRPM4_and_TRPM5_Have_Different_Sensitivities_in_Taste_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of the peak rise time in wild-type, TRPM5-only, and TRPM4-only taste cells revealed significant differences in the activation of the TRPM4 and TRPM5 channels during taste-evoked signaling (Fig 7 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used maximal stimulus concentrations for these analyses to reduce any variability in the responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data were initially analyzed separately for the CV and Fun taste cells, but no differences were found between these groups and the data were combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When TRPM5 was the only functional channel present, the rise time was significantly faster for all of the stimuli tested compared with either the wild-type or TRPM4-only responses (Fig 7 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rise time for TRPM4 channels was comparable to the rise time from wild-type cells for both Den and MPG (Fig 7 A and C), while it was significantly slower than the rise time from wild-type cells for sucralose (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also evaluated the responsiveness of each TRPM channel to a range of stimulus concentrations (Fig 7 DF and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At lower stimulus concentrations, the taste cells had smaller responses that increased in size with increasing stimulus concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taste cells from the wild-type mice were the most sensitive and responded to the lowest concentrations of stimuli presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taste cells from the TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO mice did not respond to any stimulus concentration presented (Fig 7 DF and Fig S7 JL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TRPM5 channel was also activated at lower stimulus concentrations compared with TRPM4, although not always comparably to wild type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild-type taste cells had a measurable response to 1 mM Den, while the taste cells that only expressed TRPM5 or TRPM4 did not respond until the concentration was 2.5 mM (Fig 7D, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPM4-dependent signals were not robust until the Den concentration was 5 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a similar response profile for sucralose responses (Fig 7E, Inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For MPG, the wild-type cells had a small response to 1 mM, while the TRPM5-only cells did not respond until 5 mM MPG was applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this response was comparable to the wild-type response (Fig 7F, Inset); however, the responses in the TRPM5-only taste cells were significantly smaller than wild-type responses at higher concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPM4-only taste cells required 10 mM MPG to generate a measurable response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, TRPM4 and TRPM5 have different sensitivities to concentrations of different stimuli, but neither can solely mediate the wild-type response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Loss_of_TRPM4_and_TRPM5_Impairs_Behavioral_Preference_for_Bitter__Sweet__and_Umami_Tastants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed behavioral experiments to determine if the loss of taste-evoked Na+ signals correlated with loss of taste sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used two-bottle preference tests to analyze the preference ratios for TRPM5-only, TRPM4-only, and TRPM4/5-DKO mice compared with wild-type mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested two bitter, two sweet, and two umami stimuli (Fig 8 AC and Fig S8) and found that loss of either TRPM4 or TRPM5 significantly changed the preference ratios for all of the tested taste stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO mice did not show any concentration-dependent changes in preference; in effect, they did not treat any of the taste stimuli presented as different from water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPM4/TRPM5-DKO mice did prefer the highest concentrations of sucrose (Fig S8B; 300 and 500 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these were long-term exposures to the stimuli (48 h) and sucrose has well-established postingestive effects (38), we concluded that their increased intake at these concentrations is most likely due to the positive postingestive effects associated with sucrose and not due to their ability to taste this stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The behavioral responses of mice in the two-bottle preference test depend on peripheral nerve input, postingestive factors, hedonics, and central integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that these behavioral effects were not a result of some nonspecific effect due to using long-term behavioral assays, brief-access lick assays were also performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wild-type mice showed decreased licking of quinine at a concentration of 0.01 mM and higher, while TRPM4/5-DKO mice maintained a lick ratio close to 1.0 for all quinine concentrations (i.e., they did not treat any concentration of quinine tested as different from water).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPM4-only (TRPM5-KO) and TRPM5-only (TRPM4-KO) mice showed intermediate licking behavior (Fig 8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because SC45647 is hedonically positive under wild-type conditions, the lick score is calculated as licks to the stimulus minus licks to water; therefore, a score close to zero resembles water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the TRPM5-only, TRPM4-only, and TRPM4/5-DKO mice showed no concentration-dependent effect on licking to SC45647 across the entire range of concentrations tested, but remained close to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the wild-type mice showed strong concentration-dependent increases in licking to SC45647 concentrations (Fig 8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the umami brief-access test, the wild-type mice showed increases in unconditioned licking for MSG up to 400 mM and then decreased licking at the highest concentration (800 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TRPM4-only and TRPM5-only mice had fewer licks compared with the wild-type mice, and the TRPM4/5-DKO mice showed no dose-dependent change in licking behavior but, instead, maintained a lick ratio close to 1.0, suggesting the DKO mice treat the stimulus as similar to water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data clearly show that both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required for normal taste perception of bitter, sweet, and umami taste qualities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bitter, sweet, and umami taste qualities are detected by taste receptor cells that share a common signaling pathway in which the TRPM5 channel is a critical component (6, 7, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one of these studies (6) reported that mice with a partial deletion of TRPM5 lost all behavioral and nerve responses to bitter, sweet, and umami compounds, while other studies reported reduced, but not abolished, responses to bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli when TRPM5 is lost (2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis of the Trpm5/ mouse used in the study by Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) suggests that the TRPM5 mutation in this line is not a neutral mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this mouse line, the construct retained the genes upstream promoter along with exons 114 (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our immunohistochemical analysis of this mouse line (Fig S3) shows loss of TRPM5 with normal PLC2 and gustducin expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we also found reduced IP3R3 and TRPM4 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of these proteins, in addition to the loss of TRPM5, would explain why the mice in the study by Zhang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) were not able to detect any bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies using a different TRPM5-KO mouse line, which was constructed by removing the promoter and exons 14 of the TRPM5 gene, including the translation start site, reported that loss of TRPM5 caused a significant impairment in the transduction of bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli but that these TRPM5-KO mice retained some sensitivity to these taste qualities (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mouse line was the one we used in our studies, and our control experiments reveal no change in the upstream components (gustducin, PLC2, or IP3R3) when TRPM4 and TRPM5 are lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found no change in the expression of TRPM4 when TRPM5 is lost or in TRPM5 expression when TRPM4 is lost (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These earlier studies indicate the presence of a TRPM5-independent pathway that is also required for normal transduction of bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Until now, the identity of this TRPM5-independent component in taste-evoked signaling has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier reports identified a Ca2+-activated cation current in taste receptor cells that the authors speculated, but did not conclude, may be carried through the TRPM4 channel (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A separate study reported that TRPM4 mRNA is present in taste cells (29), while RNA sequencing analysis revealed high levels of mRNA for both TRPM4 and TRPM5 in isolated taste cells (30) (Fig S2J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data have clearly identified that TRPM4 has an important role in the transduction of bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli and that both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required for normal signaling in taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The primary difference between TRPM4 and TRPM5 in other cell types is their sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses in HEK-293 cells found that the Ca2+ concentration for half-maximal current activation (EC50) for TRPM4 (20.2 ± 4.0 M) is much larger than the EC50 of TRPM5 (0.70 ± 0.1 M) (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If these EC50 values are comparable in taste cells, then we predict that during cell stimulation, TRPM5 would be activated first when cytosolic Ca2+ levels are lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Ca2+ concentrations increase, TRPM4 would also contribute to the taste-evoked signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we do not know the EC50 values for TRPM4 or TRPM5 in taste cells, our data suggest that these channels do have different Ca2+ sensitivities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the taste-evoked responses when either TRPM4 or TRPM5 was absent and found that TRPM5 channels responded to lower stimulus concentrations compared with TRPM4 channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that TRPM5 requires a smaller increase in cytosolic Ca2+ for activation compared with TRPM4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our rise time analyses also demonstrate that TRPM5 channels open significantly faster than TRPM4 channels for all of the taste-evoked responses tested, further supporting the idea that these channels have different Ca2+ sensitivities for activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If TRPM4 requires more cytosolic Ca2+ for activation, then the rise time for this channel will be slower since the channel will not be opening very efficiently until Ca2+ levels are sufficiently higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rise times of the responses when both channels were contributing to the signal (wild-type cells) were between the rise times for the TRPM4-only and TRPM5-only responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When both of these channels contribute to the taste-evoked Na+ influx, the cell depolarization will be larger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps a larger depolarization is needed to sufficiently activate the voltage-dependent ATP release from the Calhm1 channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been postulated that TRPM5 activity alone is unlikely sufficient to activate ATP release consistently enough to mediate rapid taste responses (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution of TRPM4 will increase this initial depolarization, and it appears that both channels are needed to depolarize the taste cells sufficiently to reliably activate ATP release in response to taste stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 90% of TRPM5+ cells also express TRPM4, so it is feasible that these channels are working together in taste signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher stimulus concentrations, both TRPM4-only and TRPM5-only responses are required to generate the wild-type response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the lower stimulus concentrations, both TRPM4-only and TRPM5-only cells were not responsive, even though the wild-type cells responded (Fig 7 DF, Insets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of the overall size of the taste-evoked responses revealed that the size of the Na+ response when only one channel was present was significantly reduced for all taste stimuli tested (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While significantly smaller, the taste-evoked signals in either TRPM5-only or TRPM4-only taste cells were not half the size of the wild-type response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the channels were independently contributing to the wild-type response, we would predict that adding the responses together would approximate the size of the wild-type response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if we added the actual individual responses together, they would be larger than the wild-type response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest there is a functional coupling of TRPM4 and TRPM5 that is needed to generate the appropriate cellular response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if this functional coupling exists, it is not required for the channels to function, as they were able to independently respond to higher stimulus concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps there is some coupling of TRPM4 and TRPM5 that conveys a greater sensitivity to Ca2+ changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRP channels have been shown to functionally couple in other systems (4345), so it is possible that this is also occurring in taste cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data demonstrate that the taste-evoked Na+ responses are solely mediated by TRPM4 and TRPM5 channels and require Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through activation of the PLC signaling cascade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation of TRPM4 by PLC signaling and Ca2+ release from stores is well established in other systems (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a recent study reported that the PLC inhibitor U73122 directly activates TRPM4 (48), U73122 application abolished taste-evoked TRPM4-dependent Na+ responses in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This earlier work was done with heterologous cell lines and a high concentration of U73122, which likely caused nonspecific effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the Na+ responses in taste cells were not activated by a high K+-dependent Ca2+ influx (Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data are consistent with the previous findings that TRPM4 is activated by oscillatory changes in intracellular Ca2+, but not by a large influx of Ca2+ (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, our behavior experiments clearly show that both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required for normal responses to bitter, sweet, and umami stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both two-bottle preference tests and brief-access lick tests, TRPM4-only and TRPM5-only mice had impaired behavioral responses compared with wild-type mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPM4/5-DKO mice did not demonstrate behavioral responses to any taste stimuli tested, suggesting that the loss of both TRPM4 and TRPM5 abolished their ability to detect the bitter, sweet, or umami stimuli that we tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken with the live cell imaging data, we conclude that both TRPM4 and TRPM5 are required, and sufficient, for the normal transduction of bitter, sweet, and umami taste stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animals were cared for in compliance with the University at Buffalo Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the following transgenic mice for the experiments: TRPM5-GFP (49), TRPM4-KO (50), TRPM5-KO (22), and TRPM4/5-DKO mice, which are all in the C57BL/6 background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All transgenic mice were generously provided by Robert Margolskee, Monell Chemical Senses Center, Philadelphia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice used in the experiments were between 2 and 6 mo of age, and both sexes were used for imaging experiments and immunohistochemical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were kept on a 12-h dark/12-h light cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No more than three mice were kept per cage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were only used for a single experiment and were not subjected to any prior analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were transcardially perfused, and tongues were collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-micrometer sections of the CV papillae were cut and then subjected to immunohistochemical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta NLO Confocal Microscope and were only adjusted for brightness and contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The following primary antibodies were used with their research resource identifier (RRID) provided: antiSNAP-25 (1:250, catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20-783-70323; GenWay Biotech, Inc.; RRID: AB-1024914), anti-TRPM4 (1:50, catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OST00027W; Invitrogen; RRID: AB-1091055), anti-TRPM4 (1:50, catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ab63080; Abcam; RRID: AB-956418), anti-PGP9.5 (1:100, catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ab108986; Abcam; RRID: AB-10891773), anti-NTPDase2 [1:100 (51); RRID: AB-2314986], anti-PLC2 (1:250, catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SC-206; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; RRID: AB-632197), anti-gustducin (1:100, catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SC-395; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; RRID: AB-10177605), anti-IP3R3 (1:50, catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  610313; BD Biosciences; RRID: AB-397705), and anti-TRPM5 [1:200 (40)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch and used at a dilution of 1:250.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ImageJ (NIH) was used to measure the corrected immunofluorescence intensity of TRPM4 and TRPM5 in Fig S2 and the corrected fluorescence intensity of TRPM5, gustducin, PLC2, IP3R3, and TRPM4 in Fig S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area, mean gray value, and immunofluorescence intensity were measured in the area of interest and in five small areas selected as the background signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corrected integrated density was calculated as follows:Immunofluorescenceintensity=IntegratedImmunofluorescenceintensity(Areaselected×Meanvalueofbackground).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The two-tailed Students t test was done to determine the statistical difference between the immunofluorescence intensity of different mouse lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
