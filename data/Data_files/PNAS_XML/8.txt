Impact of human mobility on the emergence of dengue epidemics in Pakistan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dengue virus has rapidly spread into new human populations due to human travel and changing suitability for the mosquito vector, causing severe febrile illness and significant mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accurate predictive models identifying changing vulnerability to dengue outbreaks are necessary for epidemic preparedness and containment of the virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that an epidemiological model of dengue transmission in travelers, based on mobility data from 40 million mobile phone subscribers and climatic information, predicts the geographic spread and timing of epidemics throughout the country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generate fine-scale dynamic risk maps with direct application to dengue containment and epidemic preparedness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recent emergence of dengue viruses into new susceptible human populations throughout Asia and the Middle East, driven in part by human travel on both local and global scales, represents a significant global health risk, particularly in areas with changing climatic suitability for the mosquito vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Pakistan, dengue has been endemic for decades in the southern port city of Karachi, but large epidemics in the northeast have emerged only since 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pakistan is therefore representative of many countries on the verge of countrywide endemic dengue transmission, where prevention, surveillance, and preparedness are key priorities in previously dengue-free regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyze spatially explicit dengue case data from a large outbreak in Pakistan in 2013 and compare the dynamics of the epidemic to an epidemiological model of dengue virus transmission based on climate and mobility data from 40 million mobile phone subscribers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that mobile phone-based mobility estimates predict the geographic spread and timing of epidemics in both recently epidemic and emerging locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combine transmission suitability maps with estimates of seasonal dengue virus importation to generate fine-scale dynamic risk maps with direct application to dengue containment and epidemic preparedness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Human_Mobility_in_Pakistan_Does_Not_Conform_to_Standard_Model_Predictions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure human travel patterns underlying the spread of dengue virus across Pakistan in 2013, we estimated the mobility of 39,785,786 mobile phone subscribers between geolocated mobile phone towers in Pakistan between June 1 and December 31 of 2013 (representing 22% of the population; Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daily locations and movements were aggregated to measure travel between 356 small, politically defined areas called tehsils (Fig 1A and Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared our data to gravity models of mobility, developed from transportation theory and commonly used to parameterize infectious disease frameworks, to assess whether observed mobility measured using mobile phone data significantly improves upon this standard approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have focused on intracountry mobility patterns (Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sampled population was extremely mobile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated that between 2.4 million and 4.8 million subscribers traveled between tehsils each day (95% quantile interval: 3.14.6 million; details in Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most travel followed a NWSE corridor along the major highways (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large volumes of travel occurred to and from Karachi, a major population and economic hub of Pakistan, with 710,000 subscribers traveling to or from the city each day on average (95% quantile interval: 570,000813,000; Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to expectations of standard mobility models, there was almost no decay in travel with increasing distance (correlation coefficient: 0.064, P less_than 0.001), although the most frequent destinations for travel were often in a nearby tehsil (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern reflects the topography, road infrastructure, and population distribution in Pakistan, with the largest cities outside Karachi being located in the northern part of Punjab province that includes the Rawalpindi/Islamabad metropolitan area, Lahore, and Faisalabad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there was a decrease in overall movement during Ramadan, we did not observe a systematic difference in the amount or direction of travel patterns in the weeks before and after the holiday (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Epidemiological_Modeling_of_Dengue_Epidemics_in_2013  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There were 15,535 reported dengue cases in 82 tehsils over 7 mo in Pakistan in 2013 (Fig 2A and Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak timing of the epidemic varied by location, and the majority of cases occurred in and around Karachi, in the northern district of Swat, and in the cities of Lahore and Rawalpindi (Fig 2A and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About half of the dengue cases reported occurred in the Mingora area of Swat (KP province), marking the first major outbreak in the region [n = 7,950, compared with a previous maximum of 300 cases reported in KP in 2011 (16)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first fitted an ento-epidemiological model to the reported dengue cases in Southern Pakistan, where transmission occurs year round, and to case data in Lahore and Swat in northern Pakistan, where transmission is seasonal due to climatic variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Southern Pakistan has year-round climatic suitability for dengue vectors and is therefore the most likely source of exported cases to other parts of the country, where greater seasonal temperature extremes limit suitability (16) (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although importation from international regions is technically a possibility, given the fairly restrictive political borders we assume here that importation will be negligible compared with the within-country importation rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fitted an ento-epidemiological model of dengue dynamics in Karachi (Fig 2B), with vector dynamics being determined by temperature (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fitted the mosquito-biting rate (a=0.66) and reporting rate (SI Text), yielding parameter values that are consistent with endemic dengue virus transmission (Materials and Methods and SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In northern Pakistan, we used our epidemiological framework to estimate the timing of the introduction of the first case that sparked the epidemics in each area, to compare these estimates with our mechanistic model of imported infections using mobile phone data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate an expected range of dates for the introduction of dengue to Lahore and Mingora, where most cases were concentrated (Materials and Methods and Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Lahore had suffered its first major outbreak 2 y before this epidemic, and we expect that immunity may have played a significant role in determining transmission dynamics (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mingora, on the other hand, represents an effectively naive population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of serotype information, we took the simplest approach and assumed each population was immunologically naive; however, we hypothesize that the delay between the first cases and the peak of the epidemic in Lahore may have been caused by immunity from the 2011 outbreak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated that the first case was introduced to Lahore during the second week of May (between days 124 and 130; SI Text and Fig 3A) a few days earlier than the first reported case (day 133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Mingora, on the other hand, we estimated that the first introductions likely occurred in August (between days 202 and 231) (Fig 3B), a few weeks before the first reported case in the city.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Models_of_Dengue_Virus_Importation_Based_on_Mobile_Phone_Data_Accurately_Predict_the_Spatial_Extent_and_Timing_of_Epidemics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next modeled the number of infected individuals traveling from the endemic areas in southern Pakistan to all other tehsils, using different approaches to characterize mobility: direct observations from the mobile phone data and various modified gravity models of travel (Materials and Methods) (10, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the performance of the mobile phone data against the next best alternative, we used a parameter-free gravity model (referred to as the diffusion model) that is equivalent to a population-weighted spatial diffusion model (Materials and Methods) based on the travel time distance between the origin and the destination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these models, we fitted a gravity model to the mobile phone data, to determine whether simple adjustments would significantly improve our predictions (SI Text and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compared the timing of predicted importation events from endemic areas in southern Pakistan, based on our mobility model, to the estimated first dengue case inferred from case report data from Lahore and Mingora (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing of the first dengue case estimated from the epidemiological data overlapped well with the predicted introductions from southern Pakistan to Lahore from the importation model (Fig 3A), with the first introductions occurring approximately 1 mo earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Mingora, the predicted timing of imported infections using our model occurred 2 wk before the first reported case, consistent with the serial interval for dengue and the estimates of the first case from epidemiological data (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crucially, the diffusion model does not predict any introductions from endemic areas in southern Pakistan to Mingora.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, travel patterns measured using mobile phone data predict introduction events consistent with outbreaks in both emerging (Lahore) and previously dengue-free (Mingora) regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ability to measure these importations in more remote places like Mingora was somewhat sensitive to the Karachi model fit, in particular the reporting rate, although the mobile phone data are always able to predict earlier, more frequent, and more accurate introductions than the diffusion model (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modeled interaction between seasonal variations in vectorial capacity and the dynamics of importation events provide accurate predictions about the location and timing of epidemics in different epidemiological settings and regions of the country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We combined our estimates of imported cases with an index of climatic suitability for dengue vectors (19) across Pakistan to predict the potential for spread of the virus in areas with introduced cases and assessed how well the spatiotemporal dynamics of the epidemic were captured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the spatial extent and epidemic timing of cases were predicted more accurately using mobile phone data (Fig 4) compared with the diffusion models, which both predicted early spread along the major highway connecting Karachi to other highly populated areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_New_Approach_to_Dynamic_Risk_Mapping_for_Epidemic_Preparedness  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next constructed risk maps to identify areas of the country that were vulnerable to epidemics due to a combination of seasonally varying climatic suitability based on temperature and relative humidity (vectorial capacity index) for dengue transmission and seasonal patterns of importation of dengue virus from southern Pakistan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining the daily suitability index (Fig 5A) with estimated introductions of infected travelers from endemic areas we created a composite epidemic risk measure that varied in space and time and showed a distinctively different pattern of risk than a climate-based suitability map alone (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In southern Pakistan outside of Karachi, for example, a low risk of epidemic dengue results from low numbers of infected travelers visiting the area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along the Afghanistan border, on the other hand, low risk of epidemics is due to temperature extremes that prevent continuous dengue transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest-risk regions are in Punjab and KP provinces in the northeast of the country, where a combination of frequent introductions from Karachi and long periods of sustained climatic suitability for transmission create the necessary conditions for outbreaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The timing of epidemic risk varied considerably in different tehsils (Fig 5C), with the risk of outbreaks varying by up to 4 mo in different regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the mobile phone data, epidemic risk occurred much earlier in tehsils in northern regions relatively far from Karachi, in contrast to the diffusion model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because preparation of local health facilities and surveillance for dengue cases are key components of national response to outbreaks, this variation in timing has important implications for decision making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, given the 2-wk serial interval of dengue (20), mobile phone and disease surveillance data could be used to produce dynamic risk maps and provide location-specific predictions about future risk of epidemics in near real time, giving policy makers time to prepare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For emerging epidemic diseases like dengue, changing environments and dynamic population movements create conditions for geographic expansion of pathogens into naive populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predicting the changing patterns of risk due to these emerging public health threats will be critical to containing their spread and preparing for outbreaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mobile phone data provide dynamic population mobility estimates that can be combined with infectious disease surveillance data and seasonally varying environmental data to map these changing patterns of vulnerability in a country where dengue outbreaks are emerging and irregular in many regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these data are continuously being collected by mobile phone operators, these methods could be integrated into national control programs in near real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A major limitation of mobile phone data generated by national operators is the difficulty in capturing cross-border travel patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  International travel may be less relevant for dengue dynamics in Pakistan than in other dengue-endemic countries, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Less than 2% of the entire Pakistan population are migrants (where their country of origin is not Pakistan) (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than half of these migrants are from Afghanistan (2.3 million) (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Pakistan borders four countries (India, Afghanistan, China, and Iran), all aside from India are not endemic for dengue near the Pakistan borders, making importations of dengue cases to Pakistan unlikely (3, 2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates of travel between India and Pakistan are difficult to obtain, but travel restrictions between the countries and a limited number of international flights may make travel difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another potential issue with this type of data is the sampling frame, because mobile phone ownership may not represent a representative sample of the population, although we have previously found in an African context that mobility estimates from this kind of data were not significantly affected by ownership bias (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that the substantial market share and widespread coverage of the mobile phone operator make the possibility of systematic skew in our estimates unlikely, but this cannot be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Uncertainties are inherent to any epidemiological model of dengue transmission, in particular regarding the large asymptomatic reservoir and the multiple circulating serotypes of the virus, which impact the ability to estimate both the fraction of the population that is susceptible and the reporting rate accurately (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of serotype information, for example, we chose not to include immunological covariates in our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Pakistan moves toward an endemic transmission setting in the northeast of the country, however, serotype data will be increasingly important to determine how strain dynamics are likely to affect the likelihood of outbreaks (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we believe that the substantial lag time in Lahore we observed was probably due to the recent large outbreak in 2011, which may have generated substantial immunity and delayed the 2013 epidemic (16, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These uncertainties will continue to make forecasting challenging, although serotype data could improve model accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given these difficulties, forecasting dengue epidemics will always need to encompass substantial stochastic variation, despite its importance for targeting limited public health resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, vector control programs in Pakistan begin during the monsoon season uniformly across the country.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that the large estimated lead times this approach offers could aid control managers, providing an early warning system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach provides policy-relevant, real-time information about where and when to expect dengue epidemics and therefore how to effectively target interventions, surveillance, and clinical response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Population_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pakistans large population (182 million) is broadly divided into one capital territory, Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA), Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and four provinces, which are further subdivided into 388 tehsils (equivalent to administrative unit 3 from 2008; Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Karachi is the most populated city in the country and located along the southern coast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the population in southern Pakistan lives along the Indus river, whereas in the northern half the population lives in an arc between Faisalabad and Peshawar that includes the major population centers of Lahore, Islamabad, and Rawalpindi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used population data obtained from worldpop.org.uk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dengue_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data for Punjab province were collected by the Provincial Health Department, whereas the District Health Office collected case data for Swat District (Table S1) daily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All public and private hospitals, health clinics, and laboratories reported any case of a patient presenting with dengue symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data listed each patient who presented to a hospital or clinic, regardless of whether the patient was admitted in the province or district, seeking treatment for high fever, body aches, petechiae, and low platelet counts (with a cutoff value for thrombocytopenia of less_than50,000/mm3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cases were then confirmed by using IgM or NS 1-Ag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data reported from Karachi were based on official public releases from the Sindh Health department.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All case data were deidentified and aggregated to the tehsil level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mobile_Phone_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed all voice-based, originated, call data records (CDRs) from 39,785,786 subscriber SIMs (security information management) over a 7-mo period, from June 1 to December 31, 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mobile operator has the largest coverage of tehsil headquarters (352 in the dataset of 388 total tehsils) across Pakistan, particularly in rural areas (two-thirds of the network).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To comply with national laws and regulations of Pakistan and the privacy policy of the Telenor group, the following measures were implemented to preserve the privacy rights of Telenor Pakistans customers: (i) The CDR/mobility data were processed on a backup and recovery server made available by Telenor Pakistan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only Telenor employees have access to the detailed CDR/mobility data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Given the server arrangements, no detailed CDR/mobility data were taken out of Pakistan or left the premises of Telenor Pakistan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) The processing of the detailed CDR/mobility data resulted in aggregations of the data on a tower-level granularity that was accessed only by Telenor employees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further spatial aggregations to the level of the tehsil were made available to the remaining coauthors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On average, 28 million subscriber SIMs were recorded as active on a given day, and of these 15.2 million subscribers generated outgoing, voice-event CDRs that encoded location information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of data acquisition, the mobile phone operator had approximately a 25% market share (22% of the population) and was the second largest provider of mobile telecommunication services in Pakistan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multi-SIM activity is common in Pakistan, but we believe that this should not create a systematic bias in mobility estimates because the geographic coverage of the operator is so extensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Quantifying_Travel_Using_the_Mobile_Phone_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Every caller was assigned to his or her most frequently used base station/mobile phone tower on a given day, as in previous studies (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a given location, defined through the location of a base station, the flux of that location is defined through the number of active callers assigned to the base station and was then aggregated to the tehsil level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On an average day, 12% of the total population of Pakistan made a call.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured daily travel between mobile phone towers relative to subscriber location on the previous day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trips were aggregated to each tehsil based on the location of the origin and destination tower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We normalized trip counts by the origin tehsils number of active subscribers on each day (SI Text and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aggregated forms of these mobility patterns can be made available upon request.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On a country-wide scale there were two significant decreases in the recorded CDR activity, one occurring during Ramadan (July 9 to August 7, 2013), reflecting less subscriber activity (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in the use of mobile communication services during Ramadan has been confirmed by the mobile operator as an expected effect, and this effect is seen every year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other decrease in activity was after October 25, due to a major system upgrade to the core mobile system infrastructure, which impacted all of the customers of the mobile operator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the collected dataset, this led to a drop in the number of location-generating subscribers recorded per day of 3.38 million.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We adjusted the time series under the assumption that the system upgrade was a 1-d event only, based on expert opinion from the operator, and that the population in the customer base did not change its overall behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flux values were adjusted after this date, assuming that the average would remain the same as in the beginning of the dataset (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze the relationship between mobility and dengue dynamics, we approximated travel patterns between January 1 and June 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulated travel, assuming that the mean number of normalized trips (normalized by flux) remained the same, and added noise [Norm(0,), where  is the variance in the number of trips between all pairs of tehsils] (SI Text and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Climate_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A. aegypti entomological and dengue viral factors are highly influenced by temperature (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daily mean temperature and total precipitation were recorded at 39 weather stations across Pakistan, obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Climate Data Center (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperatures peak in the middle of the year, June, July, and August; are lowest in January and December; and are variable across the country (daily averages between 9 °C and 27 °C) (for example, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We converted temperature to dew-point temperature based on the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group proposed model at the University of Montana (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dew-point values and temperature were then converted to relative humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ento-Epidemiological_Framework  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To model dengue dynamics, we used an ordinary differential equation model based on a model by Lourenco and Recker to describe a dengue outbreak in Madeira, Portugal (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model captures the dynamics of dengue between human and mosquito hosts where the mosquito dynamics are dependent on temperature and relative humidity (SI Text and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we assume that individuals can be infected only once and we do not consider multiple serotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assigned temperature-dependent epidemiological variables as in Lourenco and Recker (SI Text and Fig S3) (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relationship between relative humidity and dengue suitability has been explored in a number of environments (3, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have added an additional variable to the temperature-dependent epidemiological variable, the mortality factor that is based on relative humidity (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10, we analyzed the reporting rate  along with the biting rate a (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We varied the reporting rate between 2% and 10% (a 2% reporting rate is shown) because low rates of dengue reporting have previously been found in South Asia (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not fit the carrying capacity (K) explicitly and performed a sensitivity analysis, changing values of K. Although various values of K changed both a and , it did not change the overall shape of the epidemic (Fig S4 and SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the temperature data for Karachi and the population (13.4 million), we estimated that a=0.66,=0.02 (assuming K=5e6; see SI Text for the sensitivity analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Importation_of_Infected_Travelers_from_Endemic_Areas_in_Southern_Pakistan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To estimate the number and role of importation of cases from endemic areas in southern Pakistan (Karachi) to all other tehsils, we first modeled the dengue dynamics in Karachi, using the ento-epidemiological framework described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are focused only on the role of travel within Pakistan as opposed to cross-border migration (Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dengue is endemic in Karachi (16), due to year-round climatic suitability and availability of vectors, and thus we assumed the date of the first introduced was day 1 (t0=1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then estimated the flow of infected travelers from Karachi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first estimated the number of infected travelers per day who have left Karachi (Tt=mtt).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the mobile phone data, 30% (in the figures 30% is shown: min, 25.6%; median, 30%; max, 34%) of subscribers have traveled outside of Karachi per day (t) (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We varied this percentage between 10% and 30% to account for uncertainty in this estimate and a possible overestimate of travel because this value was based only on mobile phone subscribers (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The daily number of infected individuals in Karachi is based on the modeled epidemic (mt).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the destinations of infected travelers based on the daily percentage of travelers from Karachi to all other tehsils (xt,j, mobile phone data; gt,j, gravity model to location j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated these flows using either the mobile phone data or a gravity (diffusion) model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, the amount of travel between two locations, i,j estimated via a basic diffusion, naive gravity, model is Ndiffusion,i,j=(popi×popj)/dist(i,j) and we estimated the population (popi,popj) of each tehsil, using Worldpop.org (www.worldpop.org), and calculated the distance (dist(i,j)) as the travel time distance between centroids of each tehsil (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also fitted a standard gravity model to the mobile phone data (SI Text and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The raw estimates of infected travelers from Karachi to all other tehsils per day represent an upper limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for variation in epidemiological and individual factors, such as the within-host viral dynamics, we assumed that a smaller subset of this upper bound of infected visitors could contribute to transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sampled the actual number of effective infected travelers from a binomial distribution with a fixed probability [Pr(Ti×xt,j|) and Pr(Ti×gt,j|)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We varied this probability between 0.001 and 0.9 (0.01 is shown); see SI Text for further details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for each day, we had an estimated number of introduced cases from Karachi to each tehsil [Pr(Ti×xt,j|)×mt=Yx,t, Pr(Ti×gt,j|)×mt=Yg,t].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The date of the first introduced case from Karachi was sensitive to both the reporting rate for Karachi and the percentage of travelers from Karachi (SI Text) (see Fig S6 for plots of each tehsil that reported cases), although it was less sensitive to the fixed probability (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also investigated the possibility of importations from Mingora into Lahore (Fig S8) during 2013 and find that importations from Karachi to Lahore are more likely the cause of the resulting epidemic in Lahore, although these two possible causes cannot be disentangled in the case data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Environmental_Suitability_and_Epidemic_Risk  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We defined dengue suitability as a function of temperature Zx(T) that is proportional to vectoral capacity (V) for a given location x (19) (SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measure depends on the adult vector mortality rate (determined by temperature and relative humidity) and the infectious period for adult vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values of Zx(T) approximately equal to zero indicate that the environment does not permit onward transmission and can be used to determine the timing of the geographic and temporal limits of dengue transmission in Pakistan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We created a composite measure of environmental suitability and introduction of infected travelers from Karachi, riskepidemic(x)=t=1NZx(Tt)Yx,t for a location x, where Zx(Tt) is the environmental suitability for dengue on day t. This measure sums the environmental suitability (Zx(T)) times the importation of infected travelers from Karachi per day (Yx,t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mobility_Dynamics_Derived_from_Mobile_Phone_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As described in Materials and Methods, for all pairs of consecutive days over the timeframe of the data, we calculated the number of trips between all pairs of tehsils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This created a time series of travel between tehsils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We normalized this time series by the number of daily active subscribers in each origin tehsil (flux value) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dengue_in_Pakistan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first confirmed case of dengue in Pakistan occurred in 1994 (16) in Karachi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before 2008, the majority of confirmed cases were confined to Karachi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since then, there have been cases reported in a number of provinces with the most severe outbreak occurring in 2011 with over 20,000 confirmed cases, the majority of these in the city of Lahore in Punjab province.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dengue season and peak have varied by year, although the peak season often occurs in the fall (OctoberNovember).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comprehensive countrywide seroprevalence survey has not been conducted in Pakistan, although smaller studies have been conducted in Karachi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a study from 1994, DEN-1 and DEN-2 were found in Karachi (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a later study, authors found that DEN-2 (56.2%) was slightly more prevalent than DEN-3 (43.8%) (16) based on serum samples collected at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi from the 2006 outbreak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on samples collected during the 2011 outbreak in Punjab, researchers found 100% prevalence of DEN-2 in dengue-positive samples (495 total samples) (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the same study, 26 of these samples had concurrent infection with DEN-2 and DEN-3 with no evidence of DEN-1 or DEN-4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We also fitted a gravity model (three parameters) to the average number of trips from Karachi and all other tehsils per day (Fig S2):Ngm,i,j=k(popj)dist(i,j).Here, k=7.065,=1.03,=0.156, with a reduction in deviance of 70%, using Euclidean distance (kilometers) between centroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using road distance (kilometers), k=7.8577,=1.03,=0.149, with a reduction in deviance of 70%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using travel time (minutes) distance, k=8.16,=1.03,=0.217, with a reduction in deviance of 70%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Converting_Temperature_to_Relative_Humidity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Relative humidity data are not regularly collected at the 39 weather stations in our dataset (see Fig S3 for the location of weather stations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We converted temperature to relative humidity by first converting temperature to dew point (Td).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the method first developed by the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group at the University of Montana (www.ntsg.umt.edu) in their MTCLIM model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, Td=Tnk(TdayTn), where k is a calibration coefficient (here k=1), and Tday is the estimated diurnal temperature Tday=0.45(TmaxTmean)+Tmean, where Tmax is the daily maximum temperature and Tmean is the daily mean temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dew point (Td) and temperature (T) are converted to relative humidity, using RH=100exp((17.625Td)/(243.04+Td))/exp((1.7625T)/(243.04+T)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ento-Epidemiological_Framework  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To model dengue dynamics, we used an ordinary differential equation model based on a model by Lourenco and Recker to describe a dengue outbreak in Madeira, Portugal (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model captures the dynamics of dengue between human and mosquito hosts, where the mosquito dynamics are dependent on temperature and relative humidity (SI Text and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we assume that individuals can be infected only once and we do not consider multiple serotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For a fully susceptible, fixed human population size N, when bitten by an infectious mosquito (vh), individuals enter an incubation phase (Eh) for a mean duration of 1/h d. Then these individuals become infectious (Ih) for 1/h d before entering the final recovery (Rh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dynamics of the human population are defined by the following equations:dShdt=vhdEhdt=vhhEhdIhdt=hEhhIhdRhdt=hIhN=Sh+Eh+Ih+Rh.The vector population dynamics are originally based on a model developed by Yang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vectors are divided into aquatic (A, which includes eggs, larvae, and pupae) and adult females (V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult females are further subdivided into susceptible (SV), incubating (IV) for 1/V d, when they become infectious (IV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamics of the vector population are defined bydAdt=A(1AK)V(A+AV)AdSVdt=AAhVVVSVdEVdt=hVVVEVVVEVdIvdt=VEVVVEvV=Sv+EV+IV.Here, A denotes the rate of progression from aquatic phase to adults, AV and VV are the mortality rates for the aquatic phase and adults, and A is the intrinsic oviposition rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional logistic term (1A/K) is a term to measure the available capacity to receive eggs that is scaled by the carrying capacity (K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The vector to human (vh) and human to vector (hv) incidence rates are assumed to be density dependent and frequency dependent, respectively,Vh=aVhIVShNhhV=ahVIhSVNh,where a is the biting rate and Vh,hV are the vector-to-human and human-to-vector transmission probabilities per bite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression for dengues basic offspring number (Q), the mean number of viable offspring produced by one female adult during its entire lifetime, is derived asQ=AVAV+AV+VVV.For a given temperature T0, the expected population size of each mosquito life stage is modeled and used to initialize the system, using the temperature on the first day (T0): A(T0)=K(11/Q(T0)) and V(T0)=K(11/A(T0))AV(T0)/VV(T0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The value of dengues basic reproduction number is R0=(V/Nh)a2VhhV/VVh(VV+VV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Temperature-Dependent_Parameters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ento-epidemiological dengue model included seven entomological parameters that were dependent on temperature (T, in degrees Celsius) (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These parameters included the transition rate from aquatic to adult mosquito life stages (AV), mortality rate of aquatic (AV) and adult (VV) mosquito life stage, intrinsic oviposition rate of adult mosquito life stage (VV), extrinsic incubation period of adult mosquito life stage (VV), and both the human-to-vector (hV) and vector-to-human (Vh) probabilities of transmission per infectious bite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We followed the same functional equations for these parameters as in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 and 37, which were based on temperature-controlled experiments performed on Aedes aegypti populations,AV(T)=0.1310.05723T+0.01164T20.001341T3+0.00008723T43.017×106T5+5.153×108T63.42×1010T7AV(T)=2.130.3787T+0.02457T26.778×104T3+6.794×106T4VV(T)=RHF(T,RH)(0.86920.1599T+0.01116T23.408×104T3+3.809×106T4)VV(T)=5.4+1.8T0.2124T2+0.01015T31.515×104T4VV(T)=(3.3589×103Tk)/298×exp((1,500/R)(1/2981/Tk))1+exp((6.203×1021)/R(1/(2.176×1030)1/Tk)),where Tk is in degrees kelvin,hV(T)=1.044×103T×(T12.286)×(32.461T)1/2vh(T)=0.0729T0.97.In addition, we have included an adult mortality factor based on relative humidity (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature and relative humidity are converted to a vapor pressure measure, VP=6.1110^(7.5T/(237.3+T)/10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is converted to a relative humidity factor (RHF) based on the following rules: If 10less_thanVPless_than30,RHF=1.20.2VP, and if VP30,RHF=0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10, we used a number of fixed parameters including the human latency period (1/h = 2 d), the human infectious period (1/h = 4 d), and the human population size of Lahore, Karachi, or Mingora.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a sensitivity analysis on the mosquito carrying capacity (K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We fitted the biting rate and the reporting rate, using a maximum-likelihood framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fitting_the_First_Introduced_Case_into_Lahore_and_Mingora_from_Karachi__Using_the_Epidemiological_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare our importation estimates from the mobile phone data, we estimated the first introduced case into both Mingora (Babuzai tehsil) and Lahore, using only the dengue case data for these locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the same ento-epidemiological framework, we estimated the date of the first introduced case to Mingora or Lahore (T0) for a range of reporting rates ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the same biting rate and carrying capacity for Karachi, although we recalculated the seven entomological parameters based on the daily temperatures in Mingora or Lahore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both locations, we varied the reporting rate (=0.03,0.06,0.1,0.3,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9) and estimated T0 using a maximum-likelihood framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Mingora, we estimate T0 is between days 210 and 231.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, day 231 (August 19) is the date of the first reported case in Mingora.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Lahore, we estimate T0 is between days 124 and 242.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, 95% of the cases occurred after day 259 (September 16), which is 4 mo after day 124 and 2 wk after day 242.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a range of reporting rates (for comparison the fitted reporting rate for Karachi is 0.03), we estimated the date of the first introduced case (T0), using the ento-epidemiological framework described in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For low reporting rates (below 30%), T0 increases with the reporting rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For high reporting rates, the values remain constant at 231 (Mingora) and 130 (Lahore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introductions_into_Other_Tehsils_from_Karachi  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We simulated the introduction of infected travelers from Karachi to all other tehsils based on either the mobile phone data or a gravity model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first estimated the number of infected individuals in Karachi each day, using the ento-epidemiological framework described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each simulation we selected the percentage of infected individuals in Karachi who traveled to another tehsil (range of 10%, 20%, or 30%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This percentage provided an estimate on the number of infected travelers from Karachi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The destination for each infected traveler was determined based on the actual distribution of trip destinations from Karachi per day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then varied the probability that these infected visitors in all other tehsils would impact the dengue dynamics in that location and sampled a binomial distribution with a fixed probability (probability varied from 0.001 to 0.9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each fixed percentage of infected individuals who travel and probability (P), we ran 200 simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introductions_from_Swat_to_Lahore  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Swat epidemic peaked 2 mo earlier than the Lahore epidemic; we also investigated the possible role of importation from Swat to Lahore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First we compared travel from Swat tehsils that have had at least 15 cases of dengue (Alai, Alpuri, Babuzai, Bahrain, Barikot, Charbagh, Chiksar, Dassu, Kabal, Kalam, Khwazakhela, Mamund, Matta Khararai, Matta Sebujni, and Peshawar) to the amount of travel from Karachi to Lahore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the CDR data, the amount of travel from Karachi to Lahore is an order of magnitude greater than the amount of travel from Swat to Lahore (number of trips per day from Karachi to Lahore, median, 18,980; min, 10,130; max, 21,940) (number of trips per day from Swat to Lahore, median, 4,463; min, 2,556; max, 5,345).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We modeled the dengue dynamics in Swat, using the same ento-epidemiological framework described in Materials and Methods with =0.03, T0=210,a=0.66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_aegypti_Suitability_in_Pakistan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A. aegypti have been observed in many parts of Pakistan, including at least 13 major cities, based on a genetic population structure study conducted in 2009 and 2010 (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Karachi, the vector has been present in all parts of the city since at least 2000 (39), with a follow-up study in 2010 (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been hypothesized that malaria control programs in the 1950s reduced the A. aegypti population and since the early 2000s the tire trade has spread the vector to other parts of Pakistan from Karachi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dengue_Temperature_Suitability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used a relative dengue suitability index, a function proportional to vectoral capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measure is based on temperature and relative humidity and does not take into account other factors such as population density or percentage urban, which has been shown to impact Aedes environmental suitability (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We defined dengue suitability as a function of temperature Zx(T) that is proportional to vectoral capacity (V) for a given location x (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values of Zx(T) approximately equal to zero indicate that the environment does not permit onward transmission and can be used to determine the timing of the geographic and temporal limits of dengue transmission in Pakistan,V=ma2VeVVVV,where m is the ratio of adult female mosquitoes to humans, a is the human blood feeding rate, VV is the instantaneous per-capita death rate of adult mosquito females, and VV is the length of the extrinsic incubation period for the pathogen (complete equations in SI Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model, VV is also scaled by a mortality factor based on absolute humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Letting =mVV, Zx(T)=expVV(T)VV(T)/VV(T)2V(T)=a2(eVV(T)VV(T)/VV(T)2), where Z(T) effectively measures the relative number of infectious mosquitoes supported in an environment with temperature T, given a constant ,a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the poor epidemiological data to estimate ,a in many locations in Pakistan, Zx(T) provides a relative measure of vectoral capacity for a location x and temperature T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
