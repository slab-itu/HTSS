Fluctuating radiocarbon offsets observed in the southern Levant and implications for archaeological chronology debates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observe a substantive and fluctuating offset in measured radiocarbon ages between plant material growing in the southern Levant versus the standard Northern Hemisphere radiocarbon calibration dataset derived from trees growing in central and northern Europe and North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This likely relates to differences in growing seasons with a climate imprint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is significant for, and affects, any radiocarbon application in the southern Levant region and especially for high-resolution archaeological datingthe focus of much recent work and scholarly debate, especially surrounding the timeframe of the earlier Iron Age (earlier Biblical period).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings change the basis of this debate; our data point to lower (more recent) ages by variously a few years to several decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considerable work has gone into developing high-precision radiocarbon (14C) chronologies for the southern Levant region during the Late Bronze to Iron Age/early Biblical periods (1200600 BC), but there has been little consideration whether the current standard Northern Hemisphere 14C calibration curve (IntCal13) is appropriate for this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured 14C ages of calendar-dated tree rings from AD 1610 to 1940 from southern Jordan to investigate contemporary 14C levels and to compare these with IntCal13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data reveal an average offset of 19 14C years, but, more interestingly, this offset seems to vary in importance through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While relatively small, such an offset has substantial relevance to high-resolution 14C chronologies for the southern Levant, both archaeological and paleoenvironmental.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, reconsidering two published studies, we find differences, on average, of 60% between the 95.4% probability ranges determined from IntCal13 versus those approximately allowing for the observed offset pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such differences affect, and even potentially undermine, several current archaeological and historical positions and controversies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Jordanian juniper (JJ) samples, on average, yield older 14C ages compared with the corresponding IntCal13 values (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average offset for the collected JJ data, calculated as a Delta_R query in OxCal 4.3 (27) versus IntCal13 with curve resolution set at 1 y with a neutral prior of 0 ± 20, yields a posterior of 20.6 ± 4.5 14C years for the AA data and 19.1 ± 2.8 14C years for the OxA data (Fig 2C), or 18.6 ± 2.5 14C years if the OxA and AA datasets are combined (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3S5 and Tables S4 and S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these values are very comparable with the average 19 ± 5 14C years offset determined previously for plants growing in Egypt (7, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the offsets we observe are represented in data from more than one TZM tree, indicating a general pattern and ruling out any single sample/tree issue (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, by way of independent replication and confirmation, another ordered series of JJ samples from a different location (4 km NNW of Al-Bayda, site code BADG, 30°2518N, 35°2658E) (Fig 1A) also exhibit similar and contemporary 14C offsets versus IntCal13 (SI Appendix, sections 1 and 2 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7S17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, importantly, it is also evident that this 14C offset appears to fluctuate over time (Fig 2 A and B and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3, S5, S6, and S8S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while real and relevant for 14C dating and analysis in the southern Levant, this situation also suggests that it is likely inappropriate to consider any average offset value, or potential correction, as generally relevant or applicable for any specific period without having data available for that specific time interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While no correlation of the changing offset is evident with reconstructed precipitation for southern Jordan (24), there do appear associations between an increased offset and warmer temperatures as reconstructed from Red Sea corals in the period after AD 1835 (28) (Fig 2B), or generally for the extratropical NH (29), and with reversals in IntCal13 which correspond to increased solar irradiance (1, 3, 6, 29) (Fig 2A and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3, S6, and S8S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The offset period 16851762 (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S3), for example, starts around the change from the cool and (in the Mediterranean) dry conditions in the 17th century leading to the Maunder Minimum (peak 16451700), and corresponds especially to the warmer, post-Maunder Minimum conditions, particularly the long, stable, wetter period 17001750 noted in much of the Mediterranean (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite expected variability in the 14C measurements of the AA versus OxA laboratories on the same material, the fluctuating offset is clear, independently, in the data from both laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The boxes illustrated in Fig 2B offer a subjective breakup of the data, indicating four possible time divisions, with two boxes offering little significant average offset and two boxes indicating a significant offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With one partial exception, at AD 1855, the OxA 14C data on known-age annual plant material from Egypt produced similar age estimates (and, even for the 1855 exception, the JJ data from both AA and OxA show a consonant shift to more recent 14C ages centered at this year).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The JJ 14C ages for some periods compare very well with values from the Southern Hemisphere (SH) 14C calibration dataset, SHCal13 (2) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, the JJ 14C data lie midway between the NH and SH 14C calibration curves, with offsets around half the average interhemispheric offset of 43 ± 23 14C years (2) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laboratory quality controls at both the AA and OxA laboratories (SI Appendix, section 2) and the dating of other known age samples indicate good agreement and only negligible differences for midlatitude NH samples with IntCal13 for both AA (31, 32) and OxA (Fig 3 B and C and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S18 and S19) (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the consistent and fluctuating 14C offsets observed for these JJ samples by both the AA and OxA laboratories versus IntCal13 appear real.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The explanation proposed for the observed Egyptian offset (7, 12) was the different, almost opposite, growing season (winter to spring) for plants in Egypt in antiquity (before the Aswan Dam constructions in the 20th century AD) versus the spring and especially summer growing season for the central and northern European and northern North American trees comprising the Holocene IntCal13 dataset (1, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these near-opposite growing seasons correspond to periods of peak variability in natural (premodern) intraannual 14C level fluctuations, growing-season variability could readily account for the 2.5 14C offset observed for Egypt (6, 7, 13, 3438).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Juniper trees in southern Jordan grow from autumn to early summer (24, 25), also largely in antiphase with trees in central and northern Europe and northern North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, 14C ages on known-age wood from conifer trees growing at higher elevations in the northern Levant (Bcharrê, northern Lebanon), western Cyprus (Stavros tis Psokas), and western Turkey, which have growing seasons spanning, variously, from spring to summer (depending on temperature and moisture availability) (3943), typically show no measureable offset (6, 44), even when the Jordanian trees are exhibiting larger offsets from IntCal13 (e.g., AD 16851760, 18351910) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If we consider the plant taxa typically recovered from archaeological contexts in the southern Levant and subject to 14C dating, these have traditional growing seasons (subject to some intraregional geographic variations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas a first group of crops comprising wheat, barley, oats, peas, lentils, and vetch grow winter to spring (with harvest April to May), a second group comprising chickpeas, sesame, flax, millet and some grapes, figs, and pomegranates grow later (harvest June to August), and a third group comprising other grapes, figs, pomegranates, and olives grow after that (harvest September through November; e.g., olives flower April to May, fruit grows in the summer, and harvest is around November) (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a growing-seasonrelated 14C offset versus central and northern Europe should apply to the first group, but not the second group, and then apply again, partially to more fully, to the third group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth periods for native tree species contributing charcoal at archaeological sites in the southern Levant likewise vary, but the typical pattern sees a period of dormancy over the hot, dry, summer months (42), so much of the growing season will be out of phase with central and northern European oak trees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we examine the 121 14C dates listed in one major study on Iron Age Israel as representative (17), 44% are on seeds/grains/semolina, 33% are on olive pits, 22% are on charcoal, and just 1% are on grapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the majority of these samples likely fall outside the main spring to summer growing season represented by central and northern European oaks (46)source of the earlier first millennium BC calibration data (1)and so would be affected by a growing-season 14C offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, a systematic growing-seasonrelated 14C offset seems unlikely to be the sole explanation for the JJ 14C data, since the offset appears to vary over time from significant to insignificant values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The offset trend is most clear during regional warming periods, e.g., after AD 1835 (28) (Fig 2B), or in the period following the Maunder Minimum (AD 17001750) (in Results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such changes in climate likely modified the local growing season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, warmer conditions probably brought both the start and end of the growing season forward in the southern Levant, exaggerating the growing-season offset versus central and northern Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increased scale of observed offset from the early 20th century might be associated with the increased Suess effect from fossil fuel use evident over Europe from about this time (47) (and thence transport to the East Mediterranean), especially since the Suess effect, which produces older observed 14C ages, peaks on an intraannual basis in the winter months for the NH (34, 35, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would thus be reflected in the JJ wood growing across the winter months, and act to exaggerate differences in 14C values within the NH when compared with wood reflecting spring and especially summer 14C values, as IntCal13 comprises (1), when the Suess effect is at its annual minimum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the larger offsets observed in our data in the mid to later 19th century (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Fig S3) occur before any plausible Suess effect and therefore likely reflect natural processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our finding of a fluctuating 14C offset for the southern Levant versus IntCal13 (1) (and so against the IntCal13 14C record from central and northern European and North American wood) potentially complicates previous studies where average offsets identified from particular periods or sets of samples were then considered as generally relevant through time, in particular in the case of Egypt (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 and 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, in cases like the southern Levant, where there appears to be a potential substantive growing-season (or other) difference which may provide a basis for intraannual offsets in 14C values as recorded in plant matter, our dataset indicates the need for a regional calibration time series if appropriate corrections are to be made for any particular time interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where such calibration time series are not yet available (namely, before AD 1610 for the southern Levant case at present), our dataset better indicates the circumstances under which a likely potential range of error may apply for earlier periodsassuming that similar conditions and process apply in earlier periods and accepting some possible variationsrather than offering any specific average correction factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we consider the combined OxA and AA dataset in Fig 2A (as in SI Appendix, Fig S3), then, overall, the offset is around 19 ± 3 14C years (SI Appendix, Fig S4A) applying an OxCal Delta_R calculation (27) with a neutral prior of 0 ± 20, or 16 ± 5 14C years comparing observed values versus (linear interpolated) IntCal13 (1) values and errors (so around 2 to 2.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values and the ones for the separate OxA and AA datasets (Fig 2C) are all strikingly similar to the 19 ± 5 14C years offset observed previously from plant material from Egypt (7, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where an offset applies, this suggests the approximate scale of a likely minimum southern Levant offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the offset between the JJ and IntCal13 across two (subjectively selected) intervals with larger apparent offsets, between AD 16851762 and between AD 18181912, is a little larger at about 24 ± 5 14C years (SI Appendix, Fig S5), or around 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such possible offsets (or intraannual variations) of, overall, around 2 to 3 are plausible in terms of the known cycle and scale of natural premodern (preindustrial) intraannual 14C variations (7, 13, 3438).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings highlight that it is important now to extend the time period of comparison if we are to determine whether such a scale of offset for the southern Levant occurs regularly at times when there are reversals and plateaus in the 14C calibration curve and/or regional or wider general warming episodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the currently available comparison, AD 16101910, we might anticipate the possibility of offsets relevant to 14C dating in the southern Levant ranging from about 19 ± 5 14C years to 24 ± 5 14C years at such times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The findings reported here have immediate implications for high-resolution archaeological dating in the southern Levant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the period AD 16101910 is representative in terms of a fluctuating offset versus the NH IntCal13 dataset, then, for substantial periods, and especially those where there are reverses or plateaus in the 14C calibration curve and/or a local or wider warming climate regime, there is likely a small, fluctuating, but substantive 14C offset in operation in the southern Levant which is of relevance to 14C dating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact on archaeological and other 14C dating will vary over time because this offset appears to fluctuate and because of the shape of the 14C calibration curve (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the potential scale of this issue, based on our JJ dataset (Fig 2A and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3S5), we consider a possible modification of the IntCal13 14C calibration curve (1) for the period 1200700 BC, covering the debated Iron Age chronology period in the southern Levant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply the average 24 ± 5 14C years adjustment observed across the periods exhibiting a substantive offset in our dataset (SI Appendix, Fig S5) to those parts of the IntCal13 curve which exhibit reversals or plateaus in 14C values (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Needless to say, this is an approximate and subjective adjustment; the exercise is aimed to be indicative and not robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The potential impact of these offsets on real archaeological cases is then illustrated by looking at the changes in calendar date ranges achieved with, versus without, these offsets (Fig 4A) in two high-profile examples: the initial dating of Tel Rehov in northern Israel, central to the early Iron Age and history debate in Israel (14), and the dating of Khirbat en-Nahas in southern Jordan, central to redating the rise of Iron Age Edom (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dates are on cereals, olive pits, seeds, and (in one case) charcoal for Tel Rehov, and charcoal and seeds (Phoenix dactylifera) for Khirbat en-Nahas, and all should likely reflect any contemporary southern Levant 14C offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We model the published Tel Rehov 14C dates (minus the calendar date estimates) as a sequence in OxCal (27) with, and without, the above offsets, and, for Khirbat en-Nahas, we rerun the published Bayesian dating model with, and without, the above offsets (Fig 4B and SI Appendix, section 2 and Tables S6 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare the relevance of determining a specific record of such offsets through time, versus merely applying a general average (Delta_R) correction, we also consider the same data but applying a general 19 ± 5 14C years Delta_R correction (as, e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7 and 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calibrated calendar age ranges for the elements of the Tel Rehov and Khirbat en-Nahas site sequences are shown from the nonmodified IntCal13 dataset, with the general 19 ± 5 14C years correction, and with the specific contextualized approximate/estimated southern Levant modified calibration curve (Fig 4A) in Fig 4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is notable that there is variation, and, in a number of cases, considerable variation, in the most likely 68.2% ranges, comparing the IntCal13 ranges with either the general 19 ± 5 14C years adjustment or the data from the estimated JJ adjusted calibration curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 17 cases shown highlight that the application of a general 19 ± 5 14C years offset tends to create larger differences in most cases (in 76% versus 24% of cases) versus the JJ adjusted curve, which tries better to model a plausible fluctuating scenario in keeping with observed data AD 16101910.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This situation highlights the likely problems created if a simple average correction is applied to a geographic area when, in fact, the offset in question appears to fluctuate through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, however, we may note that every shift is to lower or more recent calendar age ranges (whichever adjustment is considered), which is significant when considering recent debates over absolute dates for the Iron Age archaeological periods in the southern Levant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we compare the 95.4% probability ranges, there are, in several cases, greater overlaps, but, even so, in a number of cases, there are substantial differences, and again the shifts are to lower or more recent calendar ages compared with the nonmodified IntCal13 ranges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we consider the Fig 4B comparisons between the IntCal13 ranges and the JJ adjusted ranges (comparing the calendar range of overlap versus the calendar years of nonoverlap between the IntCal13 and JJ adjusted curve ranges: Fig 4B, Top, stars), then 14 of 17 (82%) of the most likely 68.2% probability ranges vary by 50%, and 12 of 17 (71%) of the most likely 95.4% ranges vary by 20%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While not always large, the scale of variations evident in many cases is sufficient to be substantive in considerations of Iron Age chronology, especially as current debates over Iron Age chronology in the southern Levant focus on intervals of only a few decades to 50 y to 100 y (1320, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Available paleoclimate data for the southern Levant for the earlier Iron Age are inconclusive, but, after indications of cooler and arid conditions in the period around the close of the Late Bronze Age through initial Iron Age 33003000 BP (5155), there are some (not always consistent) suggestions of wetter and/or warming conditions and increased solar irradiance 30002800 BP in the East Mediterranean region (refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52, 54, and 5658; note that we adjust the ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  57 timescale following their maximum age correction to match the age of the Santorini eruption as in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might suggest some exaggeration of regional growing-season 14C offsets in this period, especially around the plateau/reversal in the 14C record 28502800 BP/900850 BC (1), and hence that a larger offset, at least comparable to those identified in the recent periods AD 16851762 and AD 18181912, is relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although, overall, the 14C offset identified here produces what may seem to be relatively small dating changes, these are revealed to be of a scale that is important for high-resolution chronological work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are especially important for the contested and detailed chronology debates in archaeological scholarship on the southern Levant region, particularly for those focused on differences of only a few decades to 50 y to 100 y in recent high (or conventional) versus low chronology debates (1320, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we recommend that users must proceed with caution when dating plant material from the southern Levant with a winter to spring growing season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also seems likely that the offset we observe fluctuates, and thus is not best compensated for via a static, systematic, adjustment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This potentially complicates the previously proposed Egyptian offset (7, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The offset we observe is also relevant to other high-resolution work in the southern Levant based on detailed 14C chronology, such as paleoenvironmental investigations (52, 54), or for the correct association of radiocarbon-dated contexts and time series with geomagnetic intensity series which show important changes in the earlier Iron Age period in the southern Levant region (59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growing season (and climate) related 14C offset we identify changes and undermines the basis and assumptions in existing 14C work in the southern Levant, and especially in those periods where a larger offset likely applies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, the effect of the offset can be substantial, and of the scale of the existing range of scholarly debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This 14C offset therefore requires attention, and, in particular, further work is necessary to better define its history since it appears to be time-varying (likely with climate associations as these affect growing seasons), especially when attempting to integrate 14C chronology closely with history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ideally, a southern Levant radiocarbon calibration curve is required, or at least a longer comparison curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 14C offset observed in this study highlights a topic of general relevance to the radiocarbon field in cases where, within the same hemisphere, there are substantial differences in growing seasons (and hence conditions) for plants compared with the standard growing season represented by the midlatitude IntCal13 (1) 14C calibration dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present case, for example, the offset observed points toward more recent (lower) age ranges being more likely for some intervals in the earlier Iron Age in the Southern Levant, but for reasons not currently discussed in the high versus low scholarly debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We sampled native juniper (J. phoenicea) timbers in historical structures at TZM in southern Jordan (30°1517N; 35°2735E) (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, sections 1 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employing standard dendrochronological methods (22, 23), the TZM historical timbers were cross-dated and placed in absolute calendar time, AD 16101940, against an existing J. phoenicea reference chronology from southern Jordan, dating AD 14691995 (24, 25) (Fig 1B and SI Appendix, section 1, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2, and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Known-age 5-y sections of the TZM tree rings were dissected with a steel blade under a binocular microscope from the TZM timbers for 14C dating at the AA and OxA accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C laboratories (SI Appendix, section 2 and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A sequence of ordered, but not known-age, tree-ring samples from the BADG site (30°2518N, 35°2658E) (Fig 1A) were also dated at the AA and OxA AMS 14C laboratories (SI Appendix, section 2 and Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant 14C ages were then compared against IntCal13 (1) (e.g., SI Appendix, Table S4), and also OxA data on known age plant material from 18th to 19th century AD Egypt which have been argued to demonstrate a 19 ± 5 14C years offset for plants growing in Egypt in premodern times (7) (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3, S5, S6, and S8S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where stated (in the text, or where a figure plot indicates r:1 at the top), the five-calendar-year resolution IntCal13 record was modeled to one-calendar year resolution by linear interpolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the 14C data employed the OxCal software (27) version 4.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OxCal runfiles with the data and coding employed for Fig 4B are listed in SI Appendix, Tables S6 and S7, and the OxCal runfile for the analyses in SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S11 are in SI Appendix, Table S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example (employing the relevant data in SI Appendix, Table S2), the OxCal runfile for the analysis shown of the OxA data in Fig 2C is listed at SI Appendix, Table S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
