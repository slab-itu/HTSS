Roles of density-dependent growth and life history evolution in accounting for fisheries-induced trait changes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rapid anthropogenic trait changes in fish stocks is a highly publicized ocean conservation issue, yet the relative contributions of evolutionary and ecological dynamics are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present an integrative empirically based simulation model to determine the role of these contributions in the worlds largest cod stock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantitatively evaluate predictions with different density-dependent growth models using historical stock-specific data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of evolution required for explaining observed maturation trends is small, yet with weakly density-dependent growth, critical for preventing stock collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of evolution in explaining trends is diminished when density-dependent growth is present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study reveals how interactions among evolution, ecology, and fisheries influence stock dynamics and harvest sustainability, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches to fisheries management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relative roles of density dependence and life history evolution in contributing to rapid fisheries-induced trait changes remain debated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 1930s, northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua), currently the worlds largest cod stock, experienced a shift from a traditional spawning-ground fishery to an industrial trawl fishery with elevated exploitation in the stocks feeding grounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since then, age and length at maturation have declined dramatically, a trend paralleled in other exploited stocks worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These trends can be explained by demographic truncation of the populations age structure, phenotypic plasticity in maturation arising through density-dependent growth, fisheries-induced evolution favoring faster-growing or earlier-maturing fish, or a combination of these processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use a multitrait eco-evolutionary model to assess the capacity of these processes to reproduce 74 y of historical data on age and length at maturation in northeast Arctic cod, while mimicking the stocks historical harvesting regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that model predictions critically depend on the assumed density dependence of growth: when this is weak, life history evolution might be necessary to prevent stock collapse, whereas when a stronger density dependence estimated from recent data is used, the role of evolution in explaining fisheries-induced trait changes is diminished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our integrative analysis of density-dependent growth, multitrait evolution, and stock-specific time series data underscores the importance of jointly considering evolutionary and ecological processes, enabling a more comprehensive perspective on empirically observed stock dynamics than previous studies could provide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Model_Overview  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use an individual-based model that follows the evolution of four key life history traits: somatic growth capacity, two traits describing the probabilistic maturation reaction norm (PMRN), and reproductive investment (27): by combining quantitative genetics with ecological processes at the individual level, we derive knowledge on how individuals adapt to the selection pressure from fishing mortality, and thereby affect the fish stock at the population level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each genetic trait has a heritability that allows us to calculate the environmental variance in the initial population, and this environmental variance is kept constant through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic traits are assumed to be normally distributed with mean initial trait values and genetic variances determined by the coefficient of genetic variation (CV) in the initial population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The traits are expressed phenotypically by random draws from a normal distribution with means equal to the respective genetic trait (see Table S2 for initial values) and with the corresponding environmental variances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Offspring inherited genetic trait values from their parents by drawing randomly from normal distributions with means equal to the midparental value and variances equal to one-half of the genetic variance of the considered trait in the initial population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the first year in the simulation, the genetic means, heritabilities, and trait distributions could change freely as determined by the processes of maturation, somatic growth, reproduction, and natural and fishing mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These processes were applied sequentially in each year to all individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The genetic growth capacity gG specifies the maximum growth potential of an individual, which would be realized in the absence of density dependence, that is, when population biomass equals 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic PMRN intercept iG and slope sG affect how an immature individuals probability to mature pm changes as a function of its age a and length l and is given by pm=[1+exp((llp50,a)/v)]1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length lp50,a is where the maturation probability pm is equal to 50% at age a, as given by lp50,a=iP+sPa, with a phenotypic intercept iP and slope sP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameter v is determined by the lower bound probability pu (25%) and the upper bound probability pl (75%) of the maturation envelope, together with the PMRN width w, as given by v=w/ln((pl11)/(pu11)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For more information, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27 and references therein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reproductive investment is measured in terms of the gonadosomatic index GSIG, defined as the ratio of gonadic mass to somatic mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotypic gonadosomatic index GSIP and the conversion factor,  (needed to account for the higher energy content of gonadic tissue relative to somatic tissue), determine the length of a mature individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A females fecundity f is given by the individuals length l and gonadosomatic index phenotype GSIP,f=kljGSIPD, where D is the weight-specific packing density of oocytes, and k and j are allometric constants relating body length to body mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our model does not account for pleiotropy or genetic linkage between the traits because the genetic traits evolve independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sex is assigned randomly at birth, assuming a 1:1 primary sex ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females and males are otherwise identical and treated equally, with their mating success assumed to be proportional to their gonad mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mating is random with replacement, allowing individuals to mate with several different partners, as assumed for batch spawners like Atlantic cod (77, 83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in detail in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27, there is a cost to evolving fast growth, implemented through a trade-off between gG and survival; the derivation of the parameter gmax describing this trade-off is discussed below (S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Parameterization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Natural mortality (for the modeling of fishing mortality, see below) originates from newborn mortality, the cost of growth, and a constant background natural mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density-dependent newborn mortality is determined by an estimated BevertonHolt stockrecruitment relationship, depending on the spawning stock biomass and a climatic variable, sea surface temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of newborn recruits is then calculated by backcalculating the predicted number of 3-y-olds, assuming an annual total natural mortality rate of 0.2 y1 as assumed by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in its virtual population analyses (VPAs) (84).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The survival probability of the newborn offspring of a spawning pair equals the number of newborn recruits divided by the total fecundity of the spawning population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modeled growthsurvival trade-off describes the reduction in the amount of energy available for maintenance and survival as growth is increased (S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Parameterization; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the background natural mortality and the additional mortality resulting from the growthsurvival trade-off yield natural mortalities equal to 0.2 y1 (84).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An important feature of our model is that evolution can be switched on or off according to different model variants (2224, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolution can take place only when genetic variation is present: high genetic variation allows for faster evolutionary responses, whereas low genetic variation constrains the pace of evolution (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We vary the evolvability of each trait in terms of its CV (given by the ratio of genetic SD and genetic mean) in the initial population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We run our model for alternative combinations of the CVs of the four evolving life history traits, thereby manipulating their evolvability, to assess the amounts of evolution required to provide a good match with the observed maturation trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the genetic variances, our model is parameterized from empirical data available for NEA cod, including those representing the initial mean life history trait values, annual fishing mortalities (Fig S1A), the stockrecruitment relationship, and the density-dependent growth relationship (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the model is initialized, emergent properties arise that include the trait genotypes and phenotypes, as well as stock abundance and biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Density-Dependent_Growth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To account for the density dependence of growth, an individuals phenotypic length increment gP,D,t in year t is assumed to be a decreasing function of the total stock biomass B3+,t of individuals aged 3 y and older in year t. We estimated two density-dependent growth models based on available data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first uses annual mean lengths at age of juvenile cod captured during the Barents Sea winter survey from 1978 to 2009 (84) to estimate annual length increments; we describe this model as representing the contemporary time period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Representative length data characterizing juvenile growth are not available before 1978, and we therefore estimated a second growth model using an alternative source of data collected for a different range of years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covering the period 19311950, we calculated the mean annual growth increment as length at first spawning divided by age at first spawning; we refer to this period as the historical time period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter method assumes linear growth before maturation (in agreement with observations; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  74) and that age at first spawning is accurately estimated (not rigorously validated, but showing only small changes over time and variability among age readers; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By construction, it underestimates interannual variation in growth, because the growth until maturation is equally attributed to all juvenile ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both growth models and associated time periods, the annual estimates of total stock biomass for ages 3 y and older are based on stock assessment modeling conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR) and the ICES (84, 85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the time series for the period 19312005 does not have truly annual temporal resolution (as explained above) and does not suggest any statistically significant deviation from linearity, density-dependent growth for the historical period 19311950 was estimated using the simplest possible statistical model across years t:gt=g0bB3+,t,[S1a]where gt is the observed mean length increment in the population in year t; g0 is the intercept, describing mean growth in the absence of density dependence; and b is the slope coefficient, describing the strength of density dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our individual-based model, g0 thus corresponds to an individuals maximum phenotypic growth capacity gP,t (determined by its genetic growth capacity gG in conjunction with environmental variation not related to density) and gt to its realized phenotypic length increment gP,D,t after accounting for density dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endpoint of the historical period was chosen so as to provide enough data for the estimation, while maintaining a clear temporal separation between the historical and contemporary periods; the exact year is arbitrary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data for the contemporary time period are of higher quality and allow controlling for several key environmental variables, as well as comparison of different functional forms (linear versus exponential).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On this basis, density-dependent growth for the contemporary time period 19782009 was estimated through the following statistical model across years t:gt=g0exp(bB3+,t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1b]The parameters g0 and b were estimated by regressing log-transformed mean annual growth increments for ages 05 y in the winter survey on total cod biomasses B3+,t (84), annual values of the station-based winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index (https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data/hurrell-north-atlantic-oscillation-nao-index-station-based), mean annual water temperatures from the Kola Section (0- to 200-m depth; courtesy of the Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography in Murmansk, Russia), and log-transformed capelin abundances (84).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To parameterize Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1b, we used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) (86) to select the best model among candidate models including all explanatory variables and their second-order interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best model turned out to include all four explanatory variables and the interactions between capelin abundance and water temperature, water temperature and NAO, and total cod biomass and NAO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameter g0 was then obtained for the mean environmental conditions, by setting the NAO index to zero and capelin abundance and water temperature to their observed means (2.5 × 109 kg and 4.1 °C, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The goodness of fit for the historical and contemporary growth models is R2 = 1.6% and 73%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the contemporary growth model provides a good fit with the data, whereas the historical growth model does not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when both models are applied over the full range of biomass levels observed during 19322005, the contemporary growth model predicts growth at high biomass levels that is in good agreement with observations from the historical period, whereas the historical growth model fails to provide a good fit with growth at low biomass levels (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fishing_Mortality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our model, fishing occurs separately in the feeding grounds and spawning grounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the feeding grounds, fishing is size selective with minimum-size limits within the range recorded for NEA cod from the 1980s onward (87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the spawning grounds, only mature individuals are fished and no minimum-size limit is applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mimic the historical fishing pressures, we use estimates of the annual fishing probabilities from the feeding grounds and spawning grounds covering the period 19322005 (data provided by the IMR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These estimates are obtained using a method that relies on the Baranov catch equation, canonically assuming a natural mortality rate of 0.2 y1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method takes as inputs the maturity ogive, the estimated numbers of fish in the population and in the catch per age and year (available from the stock assessment; refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  84 and 85), and the estimated numbers of fish caught on the spawning grounds (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32 and official Norwegian catch statistics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant age-specific estimates of the annual fishing probabilities are geometrically averaged over the ages from 5 to 12 y (for the feeding grounds, with the lower age corresponding to the age of full recruitment to the fishery) or over the ages from 7 to 12 y (for the spawning grounds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for the time spent by mature fish on the spawning grounds, for an assumed annual duration of 3 mo or one-quarter of the year, the fishing probability of mature fish on the feeding grounds is given by 1(1p0)3/4, where p0 is the annual fishing probability of immature fish on the feeding grounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A constant mean fishing mortality rate was estimated and applied for the years before 1932, to represent the earliest period of fishing (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When using the historical growth model (describing weak density dependence), the nonevolutionary model with all four CVs set to 0 predicts stock collapse (i.e., population extinction) around 1980, which obviously did not happen in reality (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when considering an alternative maturation schedule (obtained by pooling the PMRNs of cohorts from 1932 to 2005, which results in higher survival, earlier maturation, and the avoidance of stock collapse in the nonevolutionary model), the match with the empirical maturation trends remains very poor when evolution is absent and the historical growth model is used (S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative Maturation Model, Fig S2, and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the best (likelihood maximizing) evolutionary model variant when using the historical growth model reproduces the observed trends in age and length at maturation well (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support the hypothesis that trait evolution has contributed to the stocks dynamics during the 20th century, assuming that the historic density-dependent growth relationship is accurate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When using the contemporary growth model (describing strong density dependence), a model variant with low CVs performs best (by likelihood), suggesting that, for this growth model, a good match with the data can be achieved with little fisheries-induced evolution (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is possible because with stronger density dependence, fishing results in significantly faster growth, which in turn promotes significantly earlier maturation via phenotypic plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This greater scope for growth-related maturation plasticity means that less evolution is required to explain the observed maturation trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The top-ranked model variants are similar when evaluated using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), which combines a measure of fit to the data (likelihood) with a penalty (58) for each positive CV (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these model variants, the CVs for the two maturation traits are consistently low (0% or 2%), and this also applies to the CVs for reproductive investment (04%), regardless of the applied growth model (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the top-ranked model variants, the CVs for growth are consistently high (14%) when the historical growth model is used, but consistently low (04%) when the contemporary growth model is used (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This occurs because more growth evolution is required to match the observed maturation trends when the density dependence of growth is weak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the top-ranked evolutionary model variants, we can thus conclude as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the PMRN intercept shows a slow and steady evolutionary decline from 1950 onward, because selection from the feeding-ground fishery favors earlier maturation (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the PMRN slope and GSI evolve very little, with the GSI showing a tendency to increase over time (Table 1 and Fig S3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, growth capacity evolves more quickly, particularly when the historical growth model is used (Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the model variants are selected solely based on matching the empirical time series of age and length at maturation, they perform well in predicting the empirical time series of other stock characteristics, including length at age (Fig S4), phenotypic growth rate (Fig S5A), and recruitment at age 3 y (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although the overall qualitative trends are similar, the total stock biomass estimated from a stock assessment model consistently exceeds that predicted by our model (Fig S5C and S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison with Other Observed Trends).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Also, our model generally matches the spawning stock biomass estimated from the stock assessment model during the earlier part of the time series, but less well in recent years (Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S4_Alternative_Maturation_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Motivated by the finding of stock collapse when using the density-dependent growth model for the historical period (19322005; Fig 1 A and B), we apply our nonevolutionary model to an alternative maturation model, obtained by pooling PMRNs over the cohorts of 19322005 (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This alternative maturation model predicts higher survival and avoids stock collapse through earlier maturation but, as shown in Fig S2, yields only a very poor fit with the empirical maturation trends (the log-likelihood equals 228.64 and the AIC difference equals 95.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S6_Comparison_with_Other_Observed_Trends  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Even though the evolvability of traits in our model is calibrated solely based on matching the observed trends in age and length at maturation, our model performs well, for both density-dependent growth models, also with respect to matching the trends in length at age (Fig S4) and phenotypic growth (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our model succeeds in capturing the trend observed in spawning stock biomass, except for the strong increases in 1935 and 1946 (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In absolute terms, however, our models match with observed spawning stock biomasses is good only until the 1980s, after which the model fails to predict the pronounced increase in spawning stock biomass observed from 1990 onward (Fig S5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model-predicted total biomass is consistently lower than reported from virtual population analyses by ICES (84, 85).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For phenotypic growth, our model performs well throughout the whole time period (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average number of recruits (at the age of 3 y) is also predicted quite well; however, our model does not capture the four to five substantial pulses in recruitment that gave rise to strong age classes (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The worlds largest cod stock, NEA cod, was recently reported to be at the highest biomass levels ever recorded (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other fish stocks, like those of northern cod around Newfoundland, have collapsed due to, among other factors, high fishing pressure (60, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although NEA cod has historically also experienced high fishing pressures, with a mean fishing probability of 49% per year from 1932 to 2006 (27), it has persisted and even thrived.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are likely multiple reasons for the continued success of the NEA cod fishery, but the predictions of our model suggest, in the case of weakly density-dependent growth, that evolution has contributed to preventing stock collapse and sustaining the substantial fishing pressure the stock has experienced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our analyses show that density-dependent growth is also critically important for interpreting the observed trends in life history traits and stock dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is highlighted by how predictions differ depending on whether the density dependence of growth is assumed to be strong or weak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When growth is strongly density dependent (i.e., for the contemporary growth model), the performance of the nonevolutionary model and best-fitting evolutionary model variants are statistically similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though some of the tested evolutionary model variants fit the data better (i.e., had a higher likelihood and a lower AIC) than the corresponding nonevolutionary model, the AIC difference of 0.6 between the nonevolutionary model and the evolutionary model variant with lowest AIC is small (and in this case, only one CV was positive, yet small) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is generally accepted that all models within an AIC difference of 2 of the best-fitting model have similar empirical support (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several other predictions are sensitive to the growth model used (Table 1 and Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, stock collapse (i.e., population extinction) is predicted when the density dependence in growth is assumed to be as weak as that estimated for the historical period and there is no concurrent evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the historical growth model predicts much more growth evolution than the contemporary growth model (Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason is that the historical trends in age and length at maturation can partly be explained by increased phenotypic growth, which can arise in two ways: growth is strongly density dependent (so the reduction in biomass from fishing enables faster phenotypic growth) or growth evolves to be faster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the best-fitting model variants have a high CV of growth if growth is weakly density dependent or a low CV of growth if growth is strongly density dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although it is not possible to determine with certainty which growth model is more accurate, the weight of evidence suggests that the contemporary growth model is more reliable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contemporary growth model has a high explanatory power and enables a superior fit to the observed trends in length at age (especially for older ages; Fig S4), supporting a model with strongly density-dependent growth and less growth evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the quality of the data used to estimate the contemporary growth model is higher and additional environmental variables could be accounted for (S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Description), lending good empirical support to this model and providing evidence for more strongly density-dependent growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, aquaculture studies of Atlantic cod (62, 63) suggest a high genetic variance in growth, and previous studies of other species found evidence for harvest-induced evolution of growth (10, 29, 64, 65), suggesting that weaker density dependence and more evolution of growth are possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility is that the strength of density-dependent growth has varied over time, which could happen if, for example, ecosystem conditions have changed (66, 67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our analyses reveal less fisheries-induced evolution in NEA cod than previous studies of this and other marine fish stocks (3, 8, 35, 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, our model variants with higher CVs of the maturation traits produce poorer matches with the time series data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could indicate a large contribution from phenotypic plasticity in explaining historical dynamics in NEA cod, with less contribution from evolutionary change than previously thought (28, 35, 50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of lower CVs, PMRN evolution predicted by our top-ranking model variants is considerably slower and smaller in magnitude than predicted by other eco-evolutionary models (2224, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, those previous models were not specific to NEA cod; for example, two of these models were for a generic Atlantic cod stock (22, 23) and one was for smallmouth bass (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When examining CVs similar to those assumed in these previous models, we also predict more PMRN evolution; but by comparing with empirical data, these higher rates of evolution result in unrealistically low ages and lengths at maturation for this stock (27) (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall magnitude of change in the PMRN found in our study is also smaller than what has been previously inferred for NEA cod (35), as well as for other fish stocks (8, 65, 6870).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is only by statistically matching our model predictions with empirical trends under different scenarios of density dependence that we come to these different conclusions about the likely magnitude of fisheries-induced evolution in NEA cod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reasons why previous empirical estimates of PMRN dynamics differ from our model-predicted PMRN trends are unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we can point out several key assumptions that may contribute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the PMRNs of individuals are genetic traits in our model, whereas empirical estimates of PMRNs are based on phenotypic data, which themselves are subject to measurement error (including unaccounted environmental effects) and other assumptions (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we assume linear PMRNs, whereas empirically estimated PMRNs can be nonlinear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because PMRNs can often be estimated only for a few ages, robust extrapolation of their shapes beyond the empirically well-covered age range is not possible, hampering the identification of nonlinearities in their shapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the nonlinearities of empirically estimated cod PMRNs are not strong (9, 34, 35) and are therefore unlikely to have a large impact on maturation dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, increasing the CVs of the PMRN intercept and slopein our current model implementationwidens the population-level PMRN, and thereby enables earlier maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative way of implementing increases in these two CVs is to simultaneously reduce the individual-level variability in maturation, such that the population-level variability remains unchanged (S7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher Genetic Variances).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could favor higher CVs of the PMRN intercept and slope among the best-fitting model variants and result in better agreement with the estimated PMRN trends, offering an interesting challenge for future research (S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Limitations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our model predicts the evolution of increased growth capacity, a finding that might seem unexpected given earlier experiments (29, 71, 72) but is in agreement with model-based studies (22, 23, 40, 73) and theory (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A closer look reveals a logical explanation for faster growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most fish, growing faster causes maturation earlier in life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By evolving a higher growth capacity, individuals can thus mature earlier, with a higher probability of reproducing before being caught by the fishery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a response is expected to occur when the fisherys minimum-size limit is low enough that both immature and mature fish are harvested (22, 40), as is the case for NEA cod in the feeding grounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By allowing growth capacity to evolve and by including phenotypic plasticity in maturation, we capture this selection pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model predictions are strengthened by their good match with data on length at age (Fig S4) and on phenotypic growth (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For NEA cod, phenotypic trends toward faster somatic growth (implying larger lengths at age) have indeed been documented for older age groups (74, 75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recognition that model-predicted maturation evolution is altered by growth evolution strengthens the case for including multiple evolving traits in life history models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our model predicts a genetically based increase in reproductive investment (GSI), the magnitude of this evolutionary change is so small that it would be difficult to detect in the wild.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is in accordance with empirical data: liver weight (standardized for body length) in NEA cod, a possible proxy of the energy available for reproduction (76), exhibited no more than a weak overall increase from 1946 to 2001 (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, no consistent temporal trends in reproductive investment have been detected (77), and as far as we know, no other empirical data published to date suggest genetically based changes in reproductive investment in NEA cod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous eco-evolutionary models have also predicted less fisheries-induced evolution of reproductive investment than for PMRNs or growth (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although our eco-evolutionary model is not the only one to address density-dependent growth simultaneously with life history evolution (24, 47, 57, 78), it quantitatively links model results to life history changes that have unfolded in a wild fish population as it was harvested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By mimicking the observed annual fishing mortalities experienced by this stock (Fig S1A), we are capturing underlying interactions between the resource and human behavior, as the historical fishing pattern is the outcome of how humans (e.g., fishers, managers, and society), among other factors, have interacted with the stock as it changed over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an added dimension that, although important, is typically neglected in most biological models used to predict trends in exploited populations and is another reason why tight coupling with empirical data is so powerful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model we present succeeds in capturing important aspects of the NEA cod stocks response to harvest, highlighting the necessity of including key feedbacks between ecology and evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the evolution of growth, often left out of models of fisheries-induced evolution, plays a prominent role in matching stock dynamics because of its interaction with maturation and reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that it is the simultaneous consideration of ecological and evolutionary dynamics that is required to explain the full breadth of observed trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using an empirically grounded eco-evolutionary life history model of NEA cod, we have shown that, although some evolution is needed to prevent stock collapse and therefore sustain harvest, density-dependent growth could account for much of the maturation change observed in this stock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach serves as an example of how the tight coupling of a calibrated eco-evolutionary model with empirical time series data can be used as a tool for designing sustainable harvest regimes as part of an integrated approach to ecosystem-based management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S7_Higher_Genetic_Variances  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain a good fit between model predictions and data on the age and length at maturation, a lower CV in the traits describing the PMRN is needed than what has been assumed in previous models (22, 23, 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, we observe less evolution of the PMRN than in other modeling studies (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In previous eco-genetic models not calibrated for specific stocks, the CVs were assumed to equal 8% (22, 73) or 6% (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare our results to these previous models, we ran our model with CVs in all traits set to either 8%, as considered by Dunlop et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22, 73), or 14%, the maximum value in our search grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results for both density-dependent growth models are shown in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support our main findings in Table 1, which suggest that the CVs do not have to be as large as 8% to match data on maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When using CVs equal to 8%, we predict higher rates of PMRN evolution, which are closer to the predictions by Dunlop et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For NEA cod, values lower than 8% or 6% produce superior fits to the data for this particular stock and for this particular set of conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When interpreting these results, it is important to reflect on how our model accounts for the probabilistic nature of maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An individuals maturation occurs randomly according to age- and length-dependent probabilities described by its PMRN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The span between this functions 25% and 75% contours is known as the PMRN width, which at the individual level in our model is kept nonevolving and independent of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A populations PMRN is given by averaging the PMRNs of all its individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus initialize our model by assigning individual-level PMRNs so that their average intercepts, their average slopes, and their widths match those of the empirically estimated population-level PMRN for 1932.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic variances in PMRN intercepts and slopes that we implement in the model for the initial population introduce variation around the populations mean PMRN intercept and slope and thereby widen the realized population-level PMRN width as the CVs of PMRN intercept and slope are increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For small CVs, this effect is negligible, whereas, for larger CVs, the realized population-level PMRN width in the model begins to exceed the empirically estimated population-level PMRN width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the model-predicted mean age at maturation in 1932 underestimates the observed value by about 1 y, as seen in Fig 1 (although the subsequent trends through time are better predicted).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig S6, when the PMRN CVs are as large as 14%, the underestimation of the initial age at maturation increases to 2 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It then also causes an underestimation of the initial length at maturation by about 15 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect thus penalizes models with larger CVs in our model selection, leading to larger differences, already in 1932 and then also beyond, between model predictions and observations as the two PMRN CVs are made larger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is uncertain what the true PMRN CVs are, which is one of our motivations for running scenarios for many possible combinations of CVs and letting the data decide which combinations have the most support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PMRN width is a poorly studied trait, with potential evolutionary dynamics we do not yet sufficiently understand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An interesting challenge for future research would be to explore PMRN-width dynamics further and to examine whether model variants with higher CVs receive better support when the effect described in the previous paragraph is removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One approach for doing this would be to reduce the widths assigned to individual-level PMRNs when increasing the PMRN CVs, so as to keep the initial population-level PMRN width in the model in agreement with the corresponding empirically estimated population-level PMRN width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such an adjustment is not expected to change two of the main conclusions of our study that (i) evolution is required to prevent stock collapse and (ii) phenotypic plasticity can partly account for the observed maturation trends when growth is strongly density dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S8_Model_Limitations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
General model limitations and simplifying assumptions are discussed in Dunlop et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (22), where also a sensitivity analysis of several model parameters can be found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth pointing out again here that, although we model multitrait evolution, we do not input any explicit genetic correlations between traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This choice is motivated by the lack of data on genetic covariances between traits in wild stocks of Atlantic cod and by our preference to keep the models parameterization as simple as possible given the already high complexity of other parts of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of trait covariances would be worth investigating in future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As mentioned in S7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher Genetic Variances, our model predictions are close to empirical observations for maturation in the initial simulation year (1932) when the CVs for the PMRN intercept and slope are low, but not when they are high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A better correspondence in the initial year could be achieved by reducing individual-level PMRN widths in accordance with the CVs assumed for the PMRN intercept and slope, which we therefore highlight as an opportunity for future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As mentioned in S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison with Other Observed Trends, compared with estimates from the ICES stock assessment models (91) our model-predicted total biomass is consistently lower and our model-predicted spawning stock biomass does not increase toward the end of the time series (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several possible explanations for these discrepancies, some relating to our model assumptions and others to potential issues with the biomass data in the stock assessment model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we use a constant minimum-size limit for fishing in the feeding grounds, whereas in reality size selectivity has varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we do not include interactions with other species or effects of environmental change, which could influence biomass through effects on growth and recruitment (92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the populations lengthweight relationship might not be constant through time as assumed in our model (75, 77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, the biomass estimates from ICES are model-based estimations from virtual population analyses and are therefore subject to their own set of assumptions: parts of this discrepancy might be due to uncertainty attached to those estimates (93).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the biomass discrepancy, the model-predicted lengths at age match historical data well, especially for the contemporary density-dependent growth model (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our eco-evolutionary model describes the life cycle of NEA cod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is built upon the model framework described by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22, and a full description of the model can be found in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore only focus on key elements below and provide additional details in the S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model is eco-genetic, containing ecological and genetic details that describe key features of an individuals life cycle, including birth and inheritance, growth of soma and gonads, sexual maturation, reproduction, and natural and fishing mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is empirically based and has multiple evolving life history traits that are expressed phenotypically, allowing for environmental variation and phenotypic plasticity to influence observed trait values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We model differential mortality regimes experienced by the stock in spawning and feeding grounds, but include no other spatial structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model is defined by statistical relationships and parameter values derived from empirical data available for NEA cod, including time series of fishing mortalities, density-dependent growth, and recruitment from 1932 to 2006.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our model describes quantitative inheritance and evolution of four life history traits: somatic growth capacity, reproductive investment (measured by the GSI), and the intercept and slope of the PMRN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Offspring inherit genetic trait values from their parents assuming normally distributed genetic variation around the midparental values (with the corresponding variance for each genetic trait equaling one-half of its genetic variance in the initial population), describing the effects of recombination, segregation, and mutation (22, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic trait values are expressed by drawing normally distributed phenotypic trait values with variances that equal the interindividual environmental variance estimated for each trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interannual environmental variation is included in the model through density-dependent growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotypes that better enable survival and reproduction will be selected for over time, changing the stocks trait distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emergent trait phenotypes of special interest are the age and length at maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the genetic trait values affecting these phenotypic traits change over time, trends in the stocks mean age and length at maturation have an evolutionary component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phenotypic plasticity occurs when a genotype is expressed as different phenotypes as a function of the environment (79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We include phenotypic plasticity in our model through density-dependent growth and PMRNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Density-dependent growth is included to account for the expected increase in per capita resource availability as population biomass is reduced by fishing (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Density-dependent growth has been observed in many species, including marine fish stocks (80), and our parameter estimation using time series data provides empirical support that it also occurs in NEA cod (S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Description).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model, an individuals phenotypically expressed growth rate is determined by reducing its genetic growth capacity as a function of population biomass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As phenotypic growth rates change with population biomass, the age and length at maturation shift along the PMRN (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The derivation of parameter values is fully described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27, with the most pertinent details highlighted here (all model parameters are listed in the S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Parameterization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial population-level mean trait values for the genetic traits are estimated from empirical data; the resultant genetic trait distributions of individuals in the population are then free to change through time depending on selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A unique feature of this study is the comparison between two different density-dependent growth models, the parameters of which are determined empirically (S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Description).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the historical growth model, we assume a relationship estimated from data for 19321950.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As fishing mortalities were lower during this time and because of the averaging that is inherent in estimating this model, the density dependence of growth inferred for this period is weaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the contemporary growth model, we assume a relationship estimated from data for 19782009.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density dependence of growth inferred for this contemporary period is stronger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mimic the fishing pressure experienced by the stock, we use data on the annual fishing mortalities in the feeding grounds and spawning grounds from 1932 to 2005 (S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Description).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The CV of a trait directly influences the rate of evolution and is equal to the genetic SD of the trait divided by the traits mean value (22, 55, 81, 82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate models with alternative rates of evolution, we vary the CV of each of the four traits in the initial population (24) independently from 0% to 14% in steps of 2% (ideally, optimization should be performed over the whole continuous range of CV values; restriction to a discrete set of values was chosen due to computational costs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, 24 = 16 model variants are analyzed (resulting from choosing a zero or positive CV value for each of the four traits) based on 84 = 4,096 CV combinations (resulting from considering eight CV values for each of the four traits).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, one model variant and one CV combination describe stock dynamics without any evolution (i.e., with all four CVs equaling zero), whereas all others correspond to evolution being possible in at least one of the traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each CV combination is run for 30 independent replicates (resulting in a total of 4,096 × 30 = 122,880 model runs) and their results are averaged for that CV combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The performances of all model variants and associated CV combinations are statistically evaluated, using the likelihood function and the AIC, by comparing model predictions for annual mean ages and lengths at maturation with 74 y of observations on maturation in NEA cod (S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Selection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S2_Model_Parameterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Parameter values for our model (Table S2) are based on published sources, data collected by the IMR, and survey data made available through the ICES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further details, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As reported above and in further detail in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27, we used a model-fitting exercise to fine-tune the strength of the trade-off between growth and survival, measured by the parameter gmax, for which directly applicable data are unavailable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model fitting has recurrently been used to derive unknown parameter values for stock assessment models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we precalibrated the nonevolutionary model to match stock dynamics during the period 19321950.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, log-likelihood (S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Selection) was used to select the value of gmax that maximizes the fit between model predictions and observed data on the age and length at maturation and phenotypic growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tested values of gmax (50200 cm in increments of 5 cm) cover those assumed in previously published versions of our model (22, 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Observed stock abundances and biomasses are scaled down by a factor of 100,000 to obtain a computationally feasible number of individuals to track in our model (50,000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model describes each individuals growth, maturation, reproduction, and mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the model parameters describing the density dependences of recruitment and growth are divided by this scaling factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, for presenting results, the modeled stock abundances and biomasses are multiplied by the same factor (100,000) to scale them up to the observed values, and thus recreate the realistic stock levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scaling does not affect the stocks ecological and evolutionary dynamics and simply means that the tracked individuals in the scaled-down model can be interpreted as superindividuals (88, 89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We vary the CVs of all four considered life history traits to determine the amounts of evolution needed to match the maturation trends for 19322005 (S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Selection).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolving populations with different CVs share the same mean genetic trait values in 1932.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For some combinations of CVs, the applied fishing mortalities cause stock extinction, defined as occurring when stock abundance fall below 20 mature superindividuals; these combinations are excluded from further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

S3_Model_Selection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Allowing each of the considered four life history traits to have a CV that is either zero or positive results in 24 = 16 different model variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assuming that the observed variablesaverage year-specific ages and lengths at maturation, that is, average year-specific ages and lengths of first-time spawning fishfollow normal distributions with means specified by the model variant and the associated four CVs, CV=(CVg,CVi,CVs,CVGSI), and denoting the observed average age and length at maturation in year t by at and lt, respectively, the corresponding model predictions by at(CV) and lt(CV), respectively, and the corresponding variances of the aforementioned normal distributions by a2 and l2, a model variants likelihood given the observations (at,lt) for t=tmin,,tmax is as follows:L(CV,a2,l2)=t=tmintmax12a/uaexp(12a2(atat(CV))2)×t=tmintmax12l/ulexp(12l2(ltlt(CV))2),[S2a]where tmin=1932 and tmax=2005 are the years at the beginning and end of the comparison period, which has a duration of T=tmaxtmin+1=74 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the likelihoods resulting for the 16 model variants span several orders of magnitude, we follow the custom of reporting log-likelihoods, lnL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unit-standardizing constants ua=1 y and ul=1 cm make likelihoods and log-likelihoods dimensionless, and thereby ensure that all terms contributing to the log-likelihood function are dimensionally commensurable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they affect the log-likelihood values reported in Table 1, they have no bearing on likelihood ratios and log-likelihood differences, and therefore do not influence the ranking of model variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unknown variances a2 and l2 are estimated so as to have maximum likelihood (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  90, pp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  354355):a2(CV)=1Tt=tmintmax(atat(CV))2,l2(CV)=1Tt=tmintmax(ltlt(CV))2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S2b]Substituting Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2b into Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2a yields the function L(CV), based on which maximum-likelihood CVs are determined for each model variant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the combination of CVs that maximizes this function, a model variants positive CVs are systematically and independently varied from 2% to 14% in steps of 2%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper bound is chosen based on empirical observations (74, 77) and previous models (22, 23, 73), and the discretization is chosen to ensure computational tractability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To account for the fact that model variants with a larger number of positive CVs have more flexibility in matching the data (and may therefore be considered inappropriately advantaged when ranked just according to their likelihood), we also assessed model variants according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC):AIC=2lnL+2p,[S2c]where p is a model variants number of positive CVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table S1 shows the resultant ranking of model variants according to their log-likelihood, together with the corresponding AIC differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A short version of this table is included in the main text, as Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Our model is presented in detail in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Description provides a broad overview and describes model aspects that are of particular relevance to this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our models parameterization is detailed in S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Parameterization, the ranking of differently parameterized models is explained in S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Selection, an alternative maturation model is examined in S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative Maturation Model, and the population-level dynamics of the four evolving life history traits are shown in S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolving Traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison with Other Observed Trends and S7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher Genetic Variances provide supplementary results on how our model predictions match other observed trends and on how they change for higher levels of genetic variation, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model Limitations discusses key model limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
