Racial bias in pain assessment and treatment recommendations, and false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present work examines beliefs associated with racial bias in pain management, a critical health care domain with well-documented racial disparities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, this work reveals that a substantial number of white laypeople and medical students and residents hold false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites and demonstrates that these beliefs predict racial bias in pain perception and treatment recommendation accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also provides the first evidence that racial bias in pain perception is associated with racial bias in pain treatment recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, this work provides evidence that false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites continue to shape the way we perceive and treat black peoplethey are associated with racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Black Americans are systematically undertreated for pain relative to white Americans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examine whether this racial bias is related to false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites (e.g., black peoples skin is thicker than white peoples skin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Study 1 documented these beliefs among white laypersons and revealed that participants who more strongly endorsed false beliefs about biological differences reported lower pain ratings for a black (vs. white) target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Study 2 extended these findings to the medical context and found that half of a sample of white medical students and residents endorsed these beliefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, participants who endorsed these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patients pain as lower and made less accurate treatment recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants who did not endorse these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patients pain as higher, but showed no bias in treatment recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that individuals with at least some medical training hold and may use false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites to inform medical judgments, which may contribute to racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In study 1, we first establish that individuals without medical training endorse beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites and demonstrate that these beliefs are related to racial bias in pain perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recruited 121 participants, 92 of whom met our a priori criteria (i.e., white, born in the United States, native English speakers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants gave informed consent in accordance with policies of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Virginia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants reported the amount of pain they would feel across 18 scenarios (e.g., I slam my hand in a car door; scale: 1 = not painful, 2 = somewhat painful, 3 = moderately painful, 4 = extremely painful) and were then randomly assigned to rate the pain of a gender-matched black or white target across the same scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants also rated the extent to which 15 biological differences between blacks and whites are true or untrue on a six-point scale (1 = definitely untrue, 2 = probably untrue, 3 = possibly untrue, 4 = possibly true, 5 = probably true, 6 = definitely true; see Table 1 for a list of the items, and SI Text and Table S1 for additional descriptive information for the measure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report results using a composite averaging the false items about biological differences between the black body and the white body for each participant ( = 0.92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide analyses using all items in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted all of the analyses using continuous measures of false beliefs and pain ratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, participants endorsed 23.82% (SD = 24.01) of the biological beliefs and 22.43% (SD = 22.93) of the false beliefs specifically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 73% of the sample endorsed at least one of the false items (i.e., indicated that an item was possibly, probably, or definitely true; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We regressed pain ratings on target race, false beliefs, and their interaction, controlling for age, gender, and self-ratings of pain (see Table S3 for the correlations between covariates and dependent measures for both studies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous work, results revealed a main effect of target race [ = 0.07, SE = 0.03, F(1,85) = 5.50, P = 0.021, p2 = 0.06, such that participants reported lower pain ratings for the black vs. white target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was qualified by the predicted interaction between target race and false beliefs [ = 0.07, SE = 0.03, F(1,85) = 4.36, P = 0.040, p2 = 0.05; Fig 1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simple slope analyses revealed that participants who endorsed fewer false beliefs (1 SD) did not differ in their pain estimates for a black vs. a white target [ = 0.01, SE = 0.05, F(1, 85) = 0.02, P  greater than  0.250].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, target race did predict racial bias in pain ratings among participants who endorsed more false beliefs (+1 SD) [ = 0.14, SE = 0.05, F(1,85) = 9.78, P = 0.002, p2 = 0.10], such that participants who rated the black target reported lower pain estimates than did participants who rated the white target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, among this sample, the bias emerged because participants high in false beliefs rated the pain of the black target lower and the pain of the white target higher than did participants low in false beliefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, relative to participants low in false beliefs, they seemed to assume that the black body is stronger and that the white body is weaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study 1 thus demonstrates that white adults without medical training endorse at least some beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites, many of which are false and fantastical in nature (e.g., black peoples blood coagulates more quickly than white peoples blood).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Study 1 also demonstrates that these beliefs are related to racial bias in pain perception among a sample of white adults without medical training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the well-documented, pervasive racial disparities in pain management, understanding who might contribute to this racial bias and why is of paramount importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we next examined whether people with some degree of medical training also endorse these beliefs, and if so, whether these beliefs are associated with racial bias in pain perception and pain treatment recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Study 2 extends the findings of study 1 in at least three important ways: (i) it examines racial bias in a relevant contextmedicineusing medical cases similar to those used in medical training; (ii) it extends our investigation to a sample with at least some medical trainingmedical students and residents; and (iii) it considers a critical downstream outcomeracial bias in pain treatment recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We collected data from a total of 418 medical students and residents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two hundred twenty-two met the same a priori criteria as in study 1 and completed the study (first years, n = 63; second years, n = 72; third years, n = 59; residents, n = 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants gave informed consent in accordance with policies of the IRB of the University of Virginia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After consenting, participants read two mock medical cases about a black and a white patient and made pain ratings (scale: 0 = no pain to 10 = worst possible pain) and medication recommendations (dummy coded for accuracy: 1 = accurate, 0 = inaccurate) for each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also completed the same measure of beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites as in study 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We again averaged the 11 items that captured our variable of interest ( = 0.92) (see Table 1 and Table S1 for descriptive information; analyses for the composite with all items can be found in Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, participants endorsed 11.55% (SD = 17.38) of the false beliefs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 50% reported that at least one of the false belief items was possibly, probably, or definitely true (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These percentages are noticeably lower compared with those in study 1 (50% vs. 73%); however, given this sample (medical students and residents), the percentages for false beliefs are surprisingly high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we examined whether those who endorsed false beliefs exhibited a racial bias in pain assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We modeled pain ratings as a function of target race (as a repeated measure), false beliefs (as a between-participants measure), and their interaction, controlling for age, gender, and medical cohort.,ยง Results revealed only the predicted target race by false beliefs interaction [F(1,211) = 9.56, P = 0.002, G2 = 0.02; Fig 2A].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To decompose this interaction, we conducted simple slope analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We constructed a difference score to reflect racial bias in pain perception, subtracting black pain scores from white pain scores; greater, positive scores indicate that a participant rated the white patient as feeling more pain than the black patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simple slope analyses indicated that participants who endorsed more false beliefs (+1 SD) rated the black target as feeling less pain than the white target [ = 0.45, SE = 0.20, t(211) = 2.24, P = 0.026].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, participants who endorsed fewer false beliefs (1 SD) rated the black target as feeling more pain than the white target [ = 0.48, SE = 0.20, t(211) = 2.34, P = 0.020].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, as in study 1, participants in study 2 who endorsed false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites exhibited a racial bias in pain perception similar to the bias shown in previous work (1117).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, participants who did not endorse such beliefs exhibited a bias in the opposite direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next modeled the accuracy of treatment recommendations (coded as 1 = accurate, 0 = inaccurate) as a function of target race (as a repeated measure), false beliefs (as a between-participants measure), and their interaction, controlling for age, gender, and medical cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once again, we found only the predicted interaction between target race and false beliefs [F(1,192) = 5.68, P = 0.018, G2 = 0.01; Fig 2B].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To decompose this interaction, we again conducted simple slope analyses on the difference score in treatment recommendation accuracy for the black vs. white target (white accuracy minus black accuracy; greater, positive scores indicate greater likelihood of recommending an accurate treatment for a white vs. black target).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses indicated that participants who endorsed more false beliefs (+1 SD) were less accurate in their treatment recommendations for the black target compared with the white target [ = 0.15, SE = 0.06, t(192) = 2.47, P = 0.014].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, participants who endorsed fewer false beliefs (1 SD) did not differ in their treatment recommendation accuracy [ = 0.06, SE = 0.06, t(192) = 1.05, P  greater than  0.250].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, participants who endorsed more false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites showed a racial bias in the accuracy of their treatment recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants who did not endorse such beliefs showed no bias in treatment recommendation accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also examined the relationship between racial bias in pain perception and racial bias in treatment recommendation accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We correlated racial bias in pain perception (white pain minus black pain) with racial bias in treatment recommendation accuracy (accuracy for white patient minus accuracy for black patient), covarying out age, gender, and medical cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed a significant and sizable positive correlation, such that greater racial bias in pain ratings was associated with greater racial bias in the accuracy of treatment recommendations (r = 0.46, P less_than 0.0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted, racial bias in pain perception is related to racial bias in the accuracy of treatment recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Last, we conducted a mediation analysis to test whether racial bias in pain perception mediated the racial bias in treatment recommendation accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When adding racial bias in pain assessment (white pain minus black pain) to the model predicting racial bias in treatment recommendation accuracy, false beliefs was no longer a significant predictor [B = 0.05, SE = 0.04, F(1,191) = 1.22, P  greater than  0.250, p2 = 0.01], whereas racial bias in pain perception continued to predict racial bias in treatment recommendation accuracy [B = 0.25, SE = 0.04, F (1,191) = 44.44, P less_than 0.0001, p2 = 0.19], suggesting mediation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study 2 demonstrates that, similar to white laypersons in study 1, many white medical students and residents hold beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites, many of which are false and fantastical in nature, and that these false beliefs are related to racial bias in pain perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, study 2 also reveals that white medical students and residents who endorsed false beliefs showed racial bias in the accuracy of their pain treatment recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, participants who endorsed more of these beliefs reported that a black (vs. white) target patient would feel less pain and they were less accurate in their treatment recommendations for the black (vs. white) patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the effect sizes for these findings were not large (p2 = 0.03 and 0.04), the practical importance is significant: those endorsing more false beliefs rated the pain of a black (vs. white) patient half a scale point lower and were less accurate in their treatment recommendations 15% of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to white medical students and residents who endorsed false beliefs, those who did not endorse (or endorsed fewer) false beliefs reported that a white (vs. black) target patient would feel less pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opposite bias perhaps reflects real-world differences, as previous work has shown that black patients tend to report greater pain than do white patients (7, 24, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opposite bias could also reflect participants attempt to compensate for known racial disparities (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13 for a similar explanation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, these medical students and residents did not exhibit a racial bias in treatment recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, endorsing fewer false beliefs was associated with the perception that whites feel less pain but not with insufficient treatment recommendations for white patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, endorsing more false beliefs was associated with perceptions that blacks feel less pain and a commensurate insufficient treatment recommendation for black patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It thus seems that racial bias in pain perception has pernicious consequences for accuracy in treatment recommendations for black patients and not for white patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unexpectedly, shifts in racial bias as a function of false beliefs stemmed from shifts in perceptions of the white target and not the black target in study 2 (it stemmed from both shifts in perceptions of the white target and black target in study 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although perhaps counterintuitive, this pattern of results is consistent with research on intergroup bias demonstrating that discrimination often occurs due to ingroup favoritism rather than outgroup hostility (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present case, it is possible that shifts in perceptions of the white target (and not the black target) reflect this kind of bias; it is possible that these shifts reflect positive (empathic) cognitions about white ingroup members rather than negative (callous) cognitions about black outgroup members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Limitations of the present work offer avenues for future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For practical reasons, we used survey methods to document medical students and residents beliefs and racial bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work will need to test whether white and nonwhite medical personnel in more advanced stages of their career also hold beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites, and if so, whether these beliefs have consequences for pain assessment and treatment in real medical contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work may also delve into the nature of the racial bias: whether it reflects ingroup favoritism rather than outgroup derogation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distinction may be useful for the development of interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These limitations aside, studies 1 and 2 make at least three important contributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, they provide the first evidence that racial bias in pain assessment is associated with racial bias in the accuracy of pain treatment recommendations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, they reveal that a substantial number of white peoplelaypersons with no medical training and medical students and residentshold beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites, many of which are false and even fantastical in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of medical personnel (students and residents with at least some medical training) endorsing such beliefs in modern times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the current studies demonstrate that these beliefs are associated with racial bias in perceptions of others pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in study 2, that bias seemed to result from shifts in perceptions of the white targets pain more so than perceptions of the black targets pain, suggesting that perceptions of whites frailty may shape racial bias in pain perception as much, if not more, than perceptions of blacks strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Concluding_Remarks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This last year marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark 1985 Report of the Secretarys Task Force on Black and Minority Healthmore commonly known as the Heckler Reportthe first comprehensive documentation of racial disparities in health by medical experts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This report put a national spotlight on the pervasive racial inequities in health and issued a resounding call to eliminate health disparities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this call was met with a surge in research efforts and substantial changes in medical programs, policy, and legislation, the ultimate goal of eliminating racial disparities remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Racial disparities in health and health care continue to be a problem in the United States, a point underscored by the US Department of Health and Human Services clarion call to continue to take action toward ending health disparities (minorityhealth.hhs.gov/Blog/BlogPost.aspx?BlogID=68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present work sheds light on a heretofore unexplored source of racial bias in pain assessment and treatment recommendations within a relevant population (i.e., medical students and residents), in a context where racial disparities are well documented (i.e., pain management).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It demonstrates that beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whitesbeliefs dating back to slaveryare associated with the perception that black people feel less pain than do white people and with inadequate treatment recommendations for black patients pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Participants gave informed consent in accordance with policies of the IRB of the University of Virginia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After consenting, participants were asked to provide their age and gender so the survey program could route the participant to a gender-matched target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They then rated the amount of physical pain they would feel across 18 scenarios (e.g., I slam my hand in a car door, I cut myself with a sheet of paper) using a four-point scale (1 = not painful, 2 = somewhat painful, 3 = moderately painful, 4 = extremely painful).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were then randomly assigned to rate the pain of a gender-matched black or white target across the same 18 scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, participants completed a 15-item measure of beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites that are true or untrue on a six-point scale (1 = definitely untrue, 2 = probably untrue, 3 = possibly untrue, 4 = possibly true, 5 = probably true, 6 = definitely true; see list of items and descriptive information below and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 15 items, 4 were true, including 3 items pertaining to disease and morbidity (e.g., blacks are less likely to contract spinal cord diseases); 11 items were false statements about blacks and whites (e.g., black peoples blood coagulates more quickly than white peoples blood), and of these, 8 were in the direction of black strength and white frailty (see previous example) and 3 were in the direction of white strength and black frailty (e.g., whites have a better sense of hearing compared with blacks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compose our conceptual variable of interestfalse beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whiteswe created an average rating of the 11 false items ( = 0.92; see bold items in Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that one item about racial differences in bone density is tricky; bone strength is strongly associated with lifestyle and diet, and research on racial group differences in bone density and its relationship to fracture risk is mixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a recent review of the literature on ethnic differences in bone health concluded that there are numerous factors that are crucial to consider when investigating bone strength between racial groups and that bone density alone cannot account for fracture risk (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this mixed evidence, we exclude this item from our composite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report results using the false beliefs composite, but we provide descriptive information and analyses using a composite of all items in Tables S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both composites yielded similar patterns of results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All analyses were conducted using continuous measures of false beliefs and pain ratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this measure, participants provided demographic information, including their race/ethnicity, age, nationality, and primary language.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See Table S3 for correlations between covariates (age, gender, self-ratings of pain) and pain ratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
