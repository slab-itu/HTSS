Link of a ubiquitous human coronavirus to dromedary camels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results raise a scenario for the natural history of a ubiquitous respiratory coronavirus (CoV) that has established itself in humans after it was likely acquired from camels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario reminds us of the pandemic potential of the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, an agent that is thought to be acquired from camels without presently causing sustained human-to-human transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The four human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are globally endemic respiratory pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV) is an emerging CoV with a known zoonotic source in dromedary camels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known about the origins of endemic HCoVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studying these viruses evolutionary history could provide important insight into CoV emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In tests of MERS-CoVinfected dromedaries, we found viruses related to an HCoV, known as HCoV-229E, in 5.6% of 1,033 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human- and dromedary-derived viruses are each monophyletic, suggesting ecological isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One gene of dromedary viruses exists in two versions in camels, full length and deleted, whereas only the deleted version exists in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deletion increased in size over a succession starting from camelid viruses via old human viruses to contemporary human viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live isolates of dromedary 229E viruses were obtained and studied to assess human infection risks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The viruses used the human entry receptor aminopeptidase N and replicated in human hepatoma cells, suggesting a principal ability to cause human infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, inefficient replication in several mucosa-derived cell lines and airway epithelial cultures suggested lack of adaptation to the human host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dromedary viruses were as sensitive to the human type I interferon response as HCoV-229E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies in human sera neutralized dromedary-derived viruses, suggesting population immunity against dromedary viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although no current epidemic risk seems to emanate from these viruses, evolutionary inference suggests that the endemic human virus HCoV-229E may constitute a descendant of camelid-associated viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCoV-229E evolution provides a scenario for MERS-CoV emergence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

HCoV-229ERelated_CoVs_Are_Endemic_in_Arabian_and_African_Camels  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For a targeted screening by RT-PCR, nasal swabs were obtained during 20142015 from 1,033 dromedary camels in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Kenya.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All specimens were tested for HCoV-229Erelated CoVs by a real-time RT-PCR assay capable of detecting HCoV-229E, ACoV, and genetically distant 229E-related bat CoVs (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RNA detection rate in dromedaries was similar in sampling sites [4.0% in KSA, 6.7% in Kenya (2, P = 0.06)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean virus concentration in respiratory specimens was 3.1 × 107 (range: 1.6 × 1037.2 × 108) copies per milliliter of swab suspension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fecal samples from 387 Arabian dromedaries were tested, all with negative results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exact age information was available for 272 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-PCRpositive animals (n = 16, mean age = 4 mo, range: 124 mo) were significantly younger than RT-PCRnegative animals (n = 246, mean age = 23 mo, range: 0108 mo; t test, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the temporal and geographic range of HCoV-229Erelated CoV in dromedaries, we tested 364 sera sampled during 19832014 in six different countries on the Arabian Peninsula and in Africa for antibodies by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oldest antibody-positive sera had been taken in 1997.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Older sera from Sudan and Somalia that had previously been tested positive for MERS-CoV did not show antibodies against HCoV-229Erelated CoV (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seroprevalence in dromedary camels from the Arabian Peninsula was significantly higher than in samples taken during the same time in Kenya (86.3% vs. 16.0%; 2, P less_than 0.001), and was also higher than the average of all positive-testing sample collections from Africa (86.3% vs. 25.8%; 2, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Younger animals had lower seroprevalence rates compared to older animals (Kenya: 6.6% vs. 33% in 15 calves and 15 adults tested; KSA: 66% vs. 73% in 39 calves and 15 adults tested).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because HCoVs can sometimes occur as coinfections, all 58 dromedaries testing positive for HCoV-229Erelated CoV were tested additionally for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two dromedaries from KSA tested positive for both CoVs (3.5%), demonstrating that coinfection with these CoVs is possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isolation_of_HCoV-229ERelated_CoV_from_Dromedaries_in_Cell_Culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because samples from Kenya had been stored in denaturing preservation buffer, virus isolation was only attempted on fresh specimens from KSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-PCRpositive samples were inoculated on human hepatoma (HuH-7), VeroE6 (monkey kidney), Caco-2 (human colon carcinoma), Caki-3 (dromedary kidney), HEF (primary human esophageal fibroblast), and LGK-1-R.B (alpaca kidney) cells, followed by daily microscopic inspection for cytopathic effects (CPEs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four of 17 samples produced a CPE 23 d postinoculation on HuH-7 and Caki-3 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPE formation and complete cell death were consistently observed 1 d earlier on Caki-3 cells than on HuH-7 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolation was successful down to viral RNA concentrations of ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 × 106 copies per milliliter, which is comparable to results obtained for MERS-CoV isolation (22) (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus growth in cell culture is described in more detail in Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Serum_Antibodies_Do_Not_Prevent_Virus_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because dromedaries can be infected with MERS-CoV in the presence of high antibody titers in sera (23), all sera from dromedaries yielding virus isolates were tested by IFA using HEK-293 cells that express the HCoV-229E spike protein from a eukaryotic expression plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All but one serum sample showed high end-point titers against the HCoV-229E spike protein (range: 1:8001:3,200) that did not interfere with successful virus isolation in cell culture, suggesting similarities between MERS-CoV and HCoV-229Erelated viruses in dromedaries (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genomic_and_Phylogenetic_Comparison_of_Bat-__Dromedary-__and_Human-Derived_229E-Related_CoVs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The full genomes of five HCoV-229Erelated dromedary CoVs (four from KSA and one from Kenya), as well as a contemporary primary cell culture isolate taken from one of the authors (I.E.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  during an episode of acute rhinitis in 2015 (designated HCoV-229E/BN1/GER/2015), were determined by combined next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full-genome alignments included all major genetic lineages of HCoV-229Erelated bat CoVs (14) and ACoV (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human viruses included strains isolated 46 y ago (reference strain inf-1), 23 y ago (strain USA/993-50/1993), 6 y ago (strain 0349/NED/2010), and 1 y ago (HCoV-229E/BN1/GER/2015).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dromedary viruses differed from ACoV by 1.2% and from HCoV-229E by 7.88.7% of their genomic sequence, which was consistent with these viruses forming part of the same CoV species (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within dromedaries, HCoV-229Erelated CoVs from Kenya differed by 1.4% from viruses found in KSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, while this study was finalized, Sabir et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20) presented a study on MERS-CoV in dromedaries from KSA, wherein HCoV-229Erelated sequences were observed but not virologically characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All sequences presented in that study fell within the diversity of novel HCoV-229Erelated viruses described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most mutually distant viruses from Sabir et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20) are included in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In phylogeny, all dromedary- and human-associated viruses clustered with high statistical support, sharing a common ancestor with one of the three known phylogenetic lineages of bat-associated viruses (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Camelid- and human-associated viruses fell into two well-supported clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Kenyan dromedary virus clustered in a basal sister relationship to all Arabian viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests a phylogenetic history similar to the history of MERS-CoV, in whose phylogeny the deepest nodes can be projected to African dromedaries, whereas higher nodes are projected to dromedaries on the Arabian Peninsula (8, 14, 24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alpaca-associated virus fell within the known diversity of dromedary viruses, consistent with a viral spillover from dromedary camels to Alpacas, potentially in a husbandry context as hypothesized earlier (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the HCoVs, the tree topology reflected the different times of isolation of viral strains, with older viruses branching from older nodes, suggesting a correct representation of the evolutionary process by the applied phylogenetic algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A schematic representation of dromedary-associated 229E-related CoVs is shown in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown previously that 229E-related CoVs from bats have an additional ORF8 compared with HCoV-229E (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intact ORF8 was found in all HCoV-229Erelated dromedary viruses sequenced in this study, except the Kenyan virus, which is phylogenetically distinct from Arabian viruses and contains a small in-frame deletion (I in Fig 1 C and D, details are provided in Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this position (I), the alpaca-associated virus shows a slightly larger deletion that is further extended in size in the human viruses (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A parsimonious model for the acquisition of the deletion suggests that the initial deletion event occurred in a virus lineage that was ancestral to HCoV-229E, the alpaca virus, and the Kenyan virus (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Arabian viruses might stem from another part of the pool of African viruses wherein ORF8 is intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of an ORF8 was demonstrated by RT-PCR and sequencing of a typical subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) with fused message leader and body elements (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Three other ORF8 deletions are only present in human viruses and may have occurred de novo in humans, because they were enlarged in plausible chronological sequence via older to contemporary human strains (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A putatively recent timing of the spillover of ACoV from dromedaries into captive alpacas is consistent with the presence of the largest of all ORF8 deletions among camelid viruses in ACoV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The spike protein S1 domains of all camelid-associated viruses were similar to those domains in human viruses, and contained deletions as opposed to bat viruses (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to phylogeny, the deletion would have occurred in a common ancestor to all dromedary and human viruses (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nucleocapsid genes of HCoV-229Erelated CoVs differ per host and geographic region in a pattern that suggests African and Arabian virus lineages to have been in isolation from each other, as well as from human viruses, for a considerable time (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dromedary-Derived_Viruses_Use_the_HCoV-229E_Entry_Receptor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Viral receptor use is a major barrier against cross-host transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact receptor-binding domain (RBD) of HCoV-229E is unknown (2628), but its location can be mapped to the C terminus of the spike S1 subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1D, camelid viruses are highly similar to human HCoV-229E strains in this genomic region (five to seven different sites, 94.796.2% identity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The receptor for HCoV-229E is human aminopeptidase N (hAPN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of human, dromedary, feline, and porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) sequences yielded no immediate insights into receptor compatibility, except that the degree of sequence identity was highest between hAPN and dromedary APN (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The putative spike-interacting domain was not conserved between human and dromedary APN genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the ability of the dromedary-related viruses to use the HCoV-229E receptor functionally, infection experiments with HEK-293 cells expressing hAPN were conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to unmodified HEK-293 cells, which were susceptible to neither HCoV-229E nor the dromedary-derived viruses, HEK-293-hAPN cells enabled replication of HCoV-229E and dromedary viruses, demonstrating that both viruses use hAPN (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm these findings, we infected HuH-7 cells in presence of a polyclonal hAPN antibody to block the RBD on the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection with both tested HCoV-229Erelated dromedary viruses was inhibited by hAPN antibodies, whereas untreated cells showed virus replication (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dromedary-Derived_Viruses_Are_Sensitive_to_the_Interferon_Response_in_Human_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to receptor-mediated cell entry, the type I interferon (IFN) response may constitute an important barrier against human infection with HCoV-229Erelated camel CoV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HuH-7 cells pretreated with pan-species IFN at low (100 IU/mL) and high (1,000 IU/mL) concentrations, all tested viruses showed reduced production of viral RNA in comparison to untreated cells (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell culture-adapted strain HCoV-229E inf-1 showed the strongest suppression of replication compared with the contemporary HCoV-229E/BN1/GER/2015 and both dromedary-derived viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greatest inhibition by IFN pretreatment was observed for all viruses 24 h postinfection (hpi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After high IFN dose preincubation, the dromedary viruses were inhibited ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50-fold and the wild-type human virus HCoV-229E/BN1/GER/2015 was inhibited ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  80-fold, which we do not consider a significant difference (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 48 hpi, the human virus had recovered its replication level in cells pretreated with even high IFN concentration, whereas replication of both dromedary viruses was still reduced by up to 15-fold after pretreatment with high IFN doses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dromedary-Derived_Viruses_Do_Not_Replicate_Efficiently_in_Cell_Culture_Surrogates_of_Mucosal_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because permanent cell cultures show differences and defects in organ-specific gene expression, we conducted replication experiments in cell cultures derived from mucosal tissues: Caco-2 cells from human colon carcinoma, as well as A549 cells derived from human lung adenocarcinoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we used polarized human airway epithelial (HAE) cell cultures derived from primary lung cells whose phenotype is maintained in such a way that cilial and mucus-producing functions are recovered in an in vitro mucosal model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HAE, Caco-2, and A549 cells are known to be susceptible to infection with HCoV-229E inf-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection experiments were conducted with the dromedary-derived viruses and HCoV-229E, using high virus concentrations (multiplicity of infection = 0.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For HAE cells, we used increasing virus infection doses up to 50,000 plaque-forming units and assessed different growth temperatures, resembling the temperatures in the upper and lower airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although HCoV-229E replicated efficiently, none of the dromedary-associated viruses replicated in any of the used culture models (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To begin to understand the nature of the replication block, the intracellular occurrence of sgRNA transcripts was tested by RT-PCR (Fig 3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In A549 cells and HAE cultures, sgRNA was transcribed by all viruses, suggesting that replication was not prevented in the stage of viral entry and initial stages of replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dromedary-Derived_Viruses_Are_Neutralized_in_Vitro_by_Human_AntiHCoV-229E_Serum_Antibodies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the capability of human antibodies to neutralize the HCoV-229Erelated dromedary viruses, a microneutralization assay was established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human neutralizing antibody titers against HCoV-229E are known to be very low in general (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We screened our serum archive for human sera that had measurable neutralization titers against HCoV-229E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among 96 antibody-positive sera, eight were identified that were able to neutralize HCoV-229E at titers of at least 1:20, which, according to our experience and according to Miyazaki et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (29), is considered a high neutralizing titer against HCoV-299E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of these sera neutralized infection by the dromedary-derived 229E CoVs ACN4 and JCN50 at measurable titers of at least 1:10, consistent with a close antigenic relatedness of HCoV-229E and dromedary-derived 229E CoVs (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we characterize a diverse group of alpha-CoVs related to HCoV-229E with regard to evolution, history of host associations, and potential to cause infections in the human system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of 229E antibodies in dromedaries over a large geographic area suggests widespread and long-established viral circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation matches the greater genetic diversity of dromedary-associated viruses compared with human viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seroprevalence rates were generally lower in Africa as opposed to the Arabian Peninsula, pointing at population density effects associated with intense husbandry in Arabia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of antibodies in older samples taken in 1983 and 1984 should not be regarded as evidence against the presence of the virus in dromedaries at that time, because the size and geographic coverage of these samples were limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density and connectivity of African flocks sampled in 19983/1984 may have been too low to ensure widespread infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comprehensive assessment of genetic diversity provides new implications regarding the putative evolutionary history of HCoV-229E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Camelid-associated viruses are likely to have diverged from a larger viral diversity in bats as shown previously (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The habitat ranges of the involved bat species suggest a geographic origin on the African continent (8, 9, 13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because camels were not introduced to Africa earlier than 5,000 y ago (30), the acquisition and zoonotic spillover to camels would have taken place after this time, providing an important biogeographic reference for studies of the evolution of human CoVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emergence of these viruses in camelids would have coincided with a deletion in the spike S1 subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because human- and camelid-associated viruses are monophyletic, phylogeny does not allow differentiation between an ancient acquisition of human viruses from camelids and an acquisition by both hosts from a common source (e.g., bats).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the ORF8 gene of HCoV-229Erelated CoVs from African dromedaries contains a signature deletion around nucleotide positions 2738 that reoccurs in an enlarged version in all human viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also occurs in an enlarged version in ACoV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas human viruses carry only the deleted version, dromedary viruses contain at least two different ORF8 versions (full and deleted).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the possible explanations, it seems most likely that the ancestral human virus would have been sampled from a larger viral diversity existing in camelids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transmission may or may not have involved additional hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two alternative hypotheses for this genes derivation in human viruses can largely be excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a direct acquisition from a bat reservoir is unlikely because ORF8 genes with the signature deletion have not been found in bats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, acquisition of a deleted ORF8 gene from camelid viruses at a later point is largely excluded by the monophyly and chronologically ordered internal branching of human viruses, suggesting ecological isolation and absence of opportunities for recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gradual expansion of the ORF8 signature deletion in human viruses and the acquisition of additional ORF8 deletions are ongoing from old through recent isolates, suggesting a host transition that is not ancient and still involves genetic change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, a gradual deletion of an accessory gene of unknown function was also observed for the SARS-CoV after transition to humans during the middle and late phases of the SARS epidemic (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It remains to be determined whether the loss of gene function in SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E has involved an attenuation of pathogenicity during circulation in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a general concept, it has been hypothesized that viruses that are long associated with their hosts develop an attenuated pathogenicity during adaptation (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In dromedary camels, the MERS-CoV seems to cause no or only mild disease (3336).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, all samples were collected from healthy-looking animals, suggesting low pathogenicity in camels for HCoV-229Erelated viruses as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, other aspects, such as the higher rate of infection in calves versus adult animals, point to an infection pattern similar to MERS-CoV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of severe respiratory disease and abortion in alpacas from which ACoV was originally isolated could reflect a lack of adaptation to alpacas (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because ACoV was observed only in one spatiotemporally restricted outbreak and not in feral alpacas, it seems possible that alpacas acquired the virus in captivity (e.g., in husbandry together with dromedary camels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental infection studies will be necessary to understand the symptoms caused by 229E infection in camelids and alpacas better.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering the high infection prevalence, as well as the high virus concentrations in the dromedary respiratory tract, it appears likely that humans in Africa and the Middle East are frequently exposed to HCoV-229Erelated dromedary viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed virus concentrations are in the same range as concentrations observed for MERS-CoV (33, 37), which should suffice to infect humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because 229E viruses endemic in humans and dromedaries are distinct on the genome level, discriminative molecular and serological markers might enable epidemiological laboratory studies to confirm or exclude the sporadic acquisition of HCoV-229Erelated dromedary viruses by humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ORF8 and the nucleocapsid gene may constitute appropriate markers for this purpose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because ORF8 might affect virulence, dromedary-associated 229E viruses could pose a threat to humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The availability of live-virus isolates in the present study has enabled a provisional assessment of indicators of virulence and transmissibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that HCoV-229Erelated viruses are able to use the same cell entry receptor as HCoV-229E (i.e., hAPN), suggesting a principal capability of infecting human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, failure to replicate in mucosa-derived cell cultures and differentiated HAE cultures predicts a low overall capability of the novel viruses to replicate in the human respiratory or enteric tract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the novel viruses were at least as sensitive as wild-type HCoV-229E against type I IFN in cell culture, predicting the existence of a relevant level of innate immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the demonstration of serological cross-neutralization points to the existence of population immunity, which predicts limited epidemic risks associated with these viruses in contemporary human populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primordial virus acquisition in humans would have met an immunologically naive human population in which limited onward transmission may have been established easier, leading to adaptive changes and an optimization of viral traits facilitating transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, these findings provide important implications on the origin of a human respiratory virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotypic assessment of live viruses suggests an existing but limited epidemic risk for humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings raise a scenario for the emergence of MERS-CoV, which also represents a dromedary-associated virus that has limited potential to infect humans but has not as yet established sustained human-to-human transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Livestock species, including species that are of regional importance such as camels, should be systematically tested for viruses capable of infecting humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Respiratory swabs from dromedaries were sampled in Kenya and KSA in 2014 and 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stored sera from KSA as well as the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Egypt were available from previous studies (1719).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sera were sampled between 1983 and 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral RNA was purified using the MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testing for 229E-CoV RNA was done as described previously (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were deposited under GenBank accession nos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KT253324-27 and KU291448-49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serology by recombinant HCoV-229E spike protein IFA has been described previously (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sampling of dromedaries, usage of stored biological specimens, and international shipment thereof were done under governmental research clearances or approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (reference no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2014.05.15) at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Nairobi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on animal handling, sampling, cell culture methodology, and virus and antibody detection are provided in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Sera were tested by a recombinant HCoV-229E spike protein IFA as described previously (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serum samples were used at a dilution of 1:80.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection was based on a goat anti-llama IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody previously shown to be suitable for dromedary samples (1719).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogeny  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phylogenetic analyses were done using MrBayes version 3.1 (40) utilizing a GTR+G+I nucleotide substitution model, 2 million generations sampled every 100 steps, and HCoV-NL63 as an outgroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trees were annotated using TreeAnnotator V1.5 and visualized using FigTree V1.4 from the BEAST package (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombination was tested using RDP V4.0 (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Virus_Isolation_and_Virus_Strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell lines HuH-7 (human hepatoma), VeroE6 (monkey kidney), Caco-2 (human colon carcinoma), Caki-3 (dromedary kidney), HEF (primary esophageal human fibroblasts), and LGK-1-R.B (alpaca kidney) were used for virus isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were cultured as described previously (22, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Respiratory samples were incubated onto cells either unfiltrated and supplemented with Pen/Strep (Life Technologies) and Amphotericin B (GE Healthcare) or filtrated through a sterile filter (0.45-µL pore size; Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon detection of a CPE, supernatants were tested by specific real-time RT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two live-virus isolates of the dromedary-derived 229E-related viruses, termed ACN4 and JCN50, were used for the in vitro experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, strain HCoV-229E inf-1 (44) and a low-passage (passage 3) wild-type (wt) isolate of HCoV-229E were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of all virus stocks was done by plaque titration on HuH-7 cells as described previously for MERS-CoV (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Virus_Growth_Kinetics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For growth kinetics, HuH-7 cells were infected in triplicate with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 plaque-forming units for each virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were washed twice with PBS and growth medium containing 10% (vol/vol) FCS was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were quantified by titration on HuH-7 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For assessment of human mucosa-derived cell lines, A549 and Caco cells were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IFN_Susceptibility_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HuH-7 cells were incubated with growth medium containing type I IFN at a concentration of 100 IU/mL, 1,000 IU/mL, or no IFN (untreated) 16 h prior to infection in triplicate with HCoV-229E, ACN4, and JCN50 at an MOI of 0.1 pfu/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a 1-h incubation, the supernatant was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication was assessed by a real-time RT-PCR and titration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Receptor_Use_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293T was transformed by lentiviral transfer of the hAPN gene and grown under puromycin selection (cells subsequently designated as HEK-293T-hAPN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Untransformed HEK-293T cells served as controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were infected with HCoV-229E inf-1, HCoV-229E wt, ACN4, and JCN50 in triplicate with an MOI of 0.5 plaque-forming units per cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For receptor-blocking experiments, HEK-293T-hAPN cells were preincubated with 10 g/mL polyclonal goat anti-hAPN antibody (ab93897; Abcam) for 1 h at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half of the antibody solution was stored, and cells were subsequently infected in triplicate by adding viruses at an MOI of 0.001 for 30 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was discarded, and medium with antibody solution was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At time points 0, 24, 48, and 72 hpi, samples from supernatants were taken for quantification by real-time RT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HAE_Cultures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Primary HAE cultures from human donors were prepared as described previously (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once polarized, they were infected with 50,000, 5,000, and 500 plaque-forming units of each virus and incubated at 33 °C and 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were harvested 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi and quantified by real-time RT-PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_sgRNA_Transcripts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Testing for sgRNA of N and the camel ORF8 protein used a leader-specific primer (CoV229E-sgRNA-rtF), as well as primers and probes targeting sequences downstream of the start codons of the respective ORFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to fluorescent probe readouts, RT-PCR products for both sgRNAs were analyzed on agarose gel and sequenced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: CoV229E-sgRNA-rtF, CTT AAG TRY CTT ATC TAT CTA YAG ATA G; CoV229E_sgRNA_N_rtR, TTG CCC TTT CTA GTT CTG AAA CG; CoV229E_sgRNA_ORF8_rtR, CCA ACT WAA AAM CAC AYA CAA ACC A; CoV229E_sgRNA_N_rtP, 6-carboxyfluorescein-ATA CCT CGT AAT TTG GTA CCC AYC AAC-6-carboxy-N,N,N,N-tetramethylrhodamine; and CoV229E_sgRNA_ORF8_rtP, 6-carboxyfluorescein-TYR TTC AAT TGT TAG TTG YTG CTA AYT CAG-carboxy-N,N,N,N-tetramethylrhodamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assays used the SSIII RT-PCR kit (Life Technologies) with 400 nM concentrations of each of the primers, as well as 200 nM probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal cycling involved 10 min at 55 °C for reverse transcription, followed by 3 min at 95 °C and 45 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 56 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microneutralization_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HuH-7 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate 1 d before infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred plaque-forming units of each virus were preincubated in parallel with diluted serum for 1 h at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection was performed in duplicate for 1 h at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 72 h under fresh medium, cells were fixed with formalin, stained, and assessed for the presence of CPEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
