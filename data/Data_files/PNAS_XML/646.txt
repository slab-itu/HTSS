Bison phylogeography constrains dispersal and viability of the Ice Free Corridor in western Canada  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Ice Free Corridor has been invoked as a route for Pleistocene human and animal dispersals between eastern Beringia and more southerly areas of North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the significance of the corridor, there are limited data for when and how this corridor was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothetical uses of the corridor include: the first expansion of humans from Beringia into the Americas, northward postglacial expansions of fluted point technologies into Beringia, and continued use of the corridor as a contact route between the north and south.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use radiocarbon dates and ancient mitochondrial DNA from late Pleistocene bison fossils to determine the chronology for when the corridor was open and viable for biotic dispersals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corridor was closed after 23,000 until 13,400 calendar years ago (cal y BP), after which we find the first evidence, to our knowledge, that bison used this route to disperse from the south, and by 13,000 y from the north.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our chronology supports a habitable and traversable corridor by at least 13,000 cal y BP, just before the first appearance of Clovis technology in interior North America, and indicates that the corridor would not have been available for significantly earlier southward human dispersal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the opening of the corridor, multiple dispersals of human groups between Beringia and interior North America may have continued throughout the latest Pleistocene and early Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the utility of phylogeographic analyses to test hypotheses about paleoecological history and the viability of dispersal routes over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Bison_Phylogeography_to_Infer_the_Chronology_of_the_Ice_Free_Corridor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Advances in paleogenetic approaches and DNA sequencing technologies have enabled the recovery of large datasets of populations sampled over time (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although DNA preservation and the chronological range of radiocarbon dating have limited ancient DNA studies largely to the last 50,000 y, this temporal interval spans two events that were undeniably important in shaping the present-day distribution of biodiversity: the transition into and back out of the LGM, which reached its peak 26,00019,000 cal y BP (19), and the global expansion of human populations (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some genetic signal of both of these events is retained in living populations, paleogenetic data provide temporal snapshots of phylogeographic structure that may not be otherwise detectable (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, paleogenomic data from ancient Europeans has revealed present-day Sardinians to be more closely related to the ancestral human population in Europe than to any other present day population, which probably reflects a genetic replacement associated with the expansion of agriculture (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paleogenetic data have also been used to test hypotheses about the influence of humans on the phylogeography of other species, for example, via domestication (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bison (Bison sp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are an ideal taxon for assessing when the corridor was open and available for biotic dispersals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although bison taxonomy is complex, with up to several dozen species named based largely on skull and horn morphology (26, 27), the first bison to enter North America from Asia during the Pleistocene are generally referred to as the steppe bison, Bison priscus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bison are one of the most abundant large mammals recovered from faunas within the western interior of North America, although previous studies have provided only limited radiocarbon and mitochondrial data from the corridor region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bison are one of the first species for which ancient DNA data were used to reconstruct changing patterns of population structure spanning tens of thousands of years at continental scales (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, unlike many of their Pleistocene counterparts such as mammoths (Mammuthus), horses (Equus), and lions (Panthera), bison survived the extinction event at the end of the Pleistocene and persist in North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bison genomes, however, contain the signature of a genetic bottleneck at the end of the Pleistocene that can be used to test hypotheses about how ice age environmental changes affected their distribution and abundance (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous work using radiocarbon and ancient DNA data demonstrated that bison mitochondrial genetic diversity (but not necessarily their morphological diversity) (26) is phylogeographically partitioned across North America and has been since the LGM (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although bison survived the interval of glacial coalescence both north and south of the continental ice sheets, population bottlenecks and barriers to gene flow affected their mitochondrial diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the time the glaciers began to retreat, bison populations that had been isolated to the south of the continental ice sheets were mitochondrially distinct from their contemporary northern counterparts in Beringia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mitochondrial clade of southern bison, including the two present-day bison subspecies in North America, the plains bison (B. bison bison) and wood bison (B. b. athabascae), shares a common ancestor dating to the period of glacial coalescence 15,00022,000 cal y BP (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the identification of bison from this southern clade within and north of the corridor region can be interpreted as reflecting northward dispersal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the appearance of bison from a Beringian mitochondrial clade further south in interior North America can be interpreted as southward dispersal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we report new radiocarbon dates and mitochondrial haplotype data from fossil bison recovered from the corridor region and adjacent areas in Beringia (Fig 1, Table 1, and Dataset S1) and use these data to assess when the corridor opened and was available as a dispersal route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to resolving the chronology for when the corridor was open, we use a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to infer the timing and directionality of dispersals for ancient bison between the north and south.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific evolutionary history of bison mitochondria make this an ideal genetic marker to assess the timing and viability of the corridor and thereby provide insights relevant not only to bison, but also to other species, including humans, that may have used the corridor to disperse between Beringia and interior North America during the late Pleistocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A_Refined_Chronology_for_the_Opening_of_the_Postglacial_Corridor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To infer the chronology of the corridor linking Beringia and interior North America, we generated radiocarbon dates from 78 North American bison fossils, 49 of which were recovered from the corridor region (Table 1 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sites included Clover Bar and Charlie Lake Cave in western Canada (Fig 1), both of which previously yielded dates in the time frame of interest (11,50013,500 cal y BP) (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Charlie Lake Cave fossils were also associated with archaeological materials (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated mitochondrial haplotypes from 45 of these dated fossils, including from 18 of the 22 from Clover Bar and Charlie Lake Cave that fall within the time frame of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used these and previously published haplotypes to estimate a mitochondrial genealogy for a total of 192 late Pleistocene, Holocene, and present-day North American bison, including 37 from the corridor region and within the time frame of interest (Fig 1, Fig S1, Table 1, and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To facilitate discussion, we divide the mitochondrial genealogy into two major clades, clade 1 and clade 2, which are based on the most deeply diverging lineages within the mitochondrial tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also highlight several well-supported subclades within these two major clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our recovered genealogy is similar to previously published mitochondrial genealogies for bison (11, 29), in which the most striking feature of the tree is the clustering of all present-day bison into clade 1a, with a maternal common ancestor that postdates the LGM (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased density of new postglacial bison included in our analysis refines the pattern of extinction of clade 2, within which the latest surviving lineages tend to cluster together both phylogenetically and geographically (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clade 2a comprises a late-surviving population of bison that appears to be geographically restricted to southern Yukon and interior Alaska and includes a fossil that dates to as recently as 325490 cal y BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clade 2b is geographically isolated to the region of the postglacial corridor and includes a skull recovered from Banff National Park that dates to 305430 cal y BP (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increased phylogeographic clustering during postglacial times, compared with before the LGM, probably reflects a trend toward physical isolation of bison populations as open habitats were largely replaced by spruce forest and increasing paludification across northwestern Canada (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pattern of bison dispersal into the postglacial corridor provides increased resolution of both the timing of establishment of an ecosystem that can support grazing herbivores and the capacity for the animals to traverse this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously published dates for a horse from Vauxhall, Alberta (10), and a bison from Tsiigehtchic, Yukon (29), indicate a postglacial corridor route had begun to form at both the northern and southern ends by at least 13,500 cal y BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bison from clade 1a were present in the southern corridor near present-day Calgary by 13,43012,875 cal y BP, and bison from clade 2b were in northeastern British Columbia by 13,17513,045 cal y BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The postglacial corridor was fully open for dispersals by 13,000 cal y BP, when multiple overlapping radiocarbon dates belonging to bison from all three late-surviving clades (Fig 2; clades 1a, 2a, and 2b) are found at the Clover Bar site (Fig 1 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that bison from all three late-surviving clades are present during this same interval is crucial; although we cannot determine with confidence the direction of dispersal of bison from clade 2b, our analyses indicate a northern origin for bison from clade 2a (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bison from clades 1a and 2b were present in stratigraphic subzones IIbd at Charlie Lake Cave for 1,000 y before the end of the Pleistocene, from 12,500 to 11,500 cal y BP (28) (Fig 1 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These corridor bison were part of a diverse megafaunal community that included American lion (Panthera leo atrox), horse, western camel (Camelops hesternus), caribou (Rangifer tarandus), tundra muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), helmeted musk oxen (Bootherium bombifrons), and mammoth (1, 31), further supporting the notion that the area was productive habitat at the end of the Pleistocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on present understanding of the biogeography of many of these mammal taxa, there is a general hypothesis that, apart from the clade 2a bison, most of the taxa that recolonized the corridor region came from the south, including horses, lions, camels, and muskoxen (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data presented here and elsewhere demonstrate the critical role that continental ice sheets and the postglacial corridor played in biogeographic patterning among species and populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For many mammalian taxa, paleontological and genetic data reveal distinct separation of populations north and south of the ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, despite our conclusion that bison disperse into the postglacial corridor from both the north and south, we find only limited evidence of dispersal beyond the region of the corridor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the only evidence of dispersal completely through the corridor is the occurrence of a bison from clade 1a at Liard River, Northwest Territories, at 12,39012,035 cal y BP, which corresponds to a northward dispersal (Fig 2B and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly to bison, several other taxa with Eurasian origins, such as caribou and American lion, probably traversed the corridor region before the LGM and established populations in the southern interior of North America (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the responses of these species to deglaciation and environmental change at the end of the Pleistocene varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, although bison from the south dispersed as far north as the Liard River, there is no mitochondrial evidence of further northward expansion into Alaska and Yukon during the Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mitochondrial data suggest that all present-day wolves (Canis lupus) in the North American subarctic and arctic are descended from a population that was south of the continental ice sheets during the LGM and that dispersed northward during the postglacial period (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results have two key implications for the role of the postglacial corridor as a pathway for biotic exchange between Beringia and interior North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the opening of the postglacial corridor may have favored south to north, rather than north to south dispersal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed biome reconstructions indicate that southern and central portions of the deglaciating corridor in this time range featured potentially more productive grasslands, open spruce woodlands, and boreal parkland, whereas northern portions of the corridor were marked by alpine, herb, and shrub tundras (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Southward dispersal may also have been limited for biological reasons, for example, if southern bison were better adapted than northern bison to the expanding grasslands within the corridor region (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the interval of time during which it is feasible to transect the corridor may have been limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bison, the barrier to further dispersal may have been the relatively quick replacement of grasslands at the northern end of the corridor by increasingly closed spruce forests, which are difficult for grazing herbivores such as bison to transect (26, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Consequences_of_the_Postglacial_Corridor_Chronology_for_North_American_Human_Prehistory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The expansion of bison into the corridor region provides proxy evidence for when this route was viable for human populations and, in doing so, allows further refinement of New World human settlement scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human genetic and archaeological evidence indicate that eastern Beringia and parts of the Americas well south of the ice sheets were populated by 14,000 cal y BP, suggesting that migration out of Beringia probably began more than 15,000 cal y BP ago (15, 3436).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our chronology for the opening of the postglacial corridor indicates that a fully habitable corridor connected Beringia and interior North America by 13,000 cal y BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This timing precludes the postglacial corridor as a southward route for initial human dispersal into the Americas, the corollary being that the first indigenous peoples leaving Beringia probably took a coastal route or potentially moved through western North America before glacial coalescence (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We find that a bison belonging to the northern clade (2a) reached the Edmonton area by 13,000 cal y BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore possible that established northern human populations also reached the central corridor by this time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence from the archaeological record supports this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Alaskan archaeological sites including Swan Point, Mead, Broken Mammoth, Tuluaq, and Dry Creek, which were occupied from 14,000 to 11,500 cal y BP, feature a variety of projectile technologies, sometimes associated with microblade industries (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar microblade technologies are present at Vermilion Lakes (Banff National Park) and Charlie Lake Cave by 11,500 cal y BP (28, 40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, human genetic data from Upward Sun River, Alaska, show founding New World mitochondrial haplotypes B2 and C1b in Alaska at 11,500 cal y BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small, isolated groups of people may therefore have continued to disperse from Beringia to interior North America well after the corridor region opened (14, 16, 41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our bison data also suggest that biotic conditions favored northward rather than southward movements through the corridor, paralleling archaeological data involving fluted point technology (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bison clade 1a, which originates south of the ice sheets during the period of coalescence, predominates in our corridor sample, with one instance occurring as far north as the Liard River by 12,200 cal y BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oldest recognizable Clovis complex sites in North America are estimated to range from 13,000 to 12,600 cal y BP (8, 36), which slightly postdates our chronology for the opening of the southern end of the corridor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Anzick child burial in Montana that dates to 12,600 cal y BP (43), and slightly earlier evidence for human hunting of western camels and horses at Wallys Beach, 420 km north of the Anzick site (17, 43), document the presence of people at the southern end of the corridor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluted point density maps indicate that this technology diminishes in frequency from the south to the north in the corridor region, consistent with the northward spread of this technology (1, 12, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 12,500 cal y BP, fluted points are present at Charlie Lake Cave in British Columbia (along with clades 1a and 2b bison) and in sites in Alaska (13, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the last several decades, phylogeographic research has evolved from being largely qualitative in nature to benefitting from a diversity of statistically rigorous approaches to detect evolutionary structure over both geographic space and, with the addition of paleogenetic technologies, over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate the power of this approach to address a longstanding question in New World biogeography, specifically whether and when an ecologically viable corridor linked Beringia and interior North America during the late Pleistocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Until now, much of the research concerning the corridor region has focused on whether or not the corridor was the initial pathway for early human inhabitants of the New World.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data from fossil bison help shift scientific attention to a different first: the LGM coalescence of the ice sheets marked the first time in the Quaternary that the corridor did not exist as a biogeographic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the corridor opened, bison populations that had been isolated for millennia, in Beringia and in interior North America, entered the deglaciated region from both its northern and southern ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human populations in eastern Beringia and interior North America had similar possibilities to re-engage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the human case, this involved the added cultural complexity that would accompany societal interactions in an era where exotic raw materials and technological ideas began to circulate widely in the Americas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing genetic and archaeological evidence continue to support the idea that the corridor was a route for dispersal in both directions, with consequences for biological and technological diversity on both sides of the receding ice sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Radiocarbon_Dating  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collagen was extracted from bone and tooth samples using ultrafiltration methods outlined in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44 and radiocarbon dated using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at the Keck laboratoryUniversity of California (UC) Irvine (UCIAMS), the Center for AMS (CAMS) at Lawrence Livermore National laboratory, or Beta Analytics (Table 1 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMS dates were calibrated using the IntCal13 calibration curve (45) in OxCal v4.2 (https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal/OxCal.html) and are reported with 1 standard deviation (SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For samples that were redated at UCIAMS (SFU 1848, SFU 1849, SFU 3429, and SFU 15004; Dataset S1), we used only the new dates for the calibration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All dates reported in the text are in calendar years before present, unless otherwise noted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DNA_Extraction__PCR__Cloning__Library_Preparation__Target_Enrichment__and_Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To facilitate comparison with previously published data from bison, we isolated 600 bp of the hypervariable portion of the mitochondrial control region (CR) from 45 Canadian bison bone and tooth samples, dated to the late Pleistocene and Holocene (Table 1 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed DNA extraction, library preparation, and PCR setup in dedicated ancient DNA facilities at the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) and UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) that were physically isolated from modern molecular biology research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the sample, we extracted DNA from 100 to 250 mg bone powder using one of two methods that are highly optimized for the recovery of ancient DNA molecules (46, 47), performing one negative extraction control for every five to eight processed samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To generate CR sequence data, we used a mixture of four approaches: (i) direct Sanger sequencing of PCR products, (ii) Sanger sequencing of cloned PCR products, (iii) Illumina amplicon sequencing of PCR products, and (iv) mitochondrial target enrichment followed by Illumina sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For approaches iiii, we amplified the target CR fragment either in a single PCR amplification or as a series of overlapping fragments, depending on the preservation of the sample (primer combinations are provided in Table S1) (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed PCR in 25-L reactions with the following components: 20 g rabbit serum albumin, 0.25 mM dNTPs, 1× High Fidelity buffer, 1 U Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Life Technologies), 2.4 mM MgSO4, 0.4 M of each primer, and 1 L DNA extract, with the following cycling conditions: 12 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at variable annealing temperature (Table S1), 45 s at 68 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C, with the middle three steps repeated for 50 cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cleaned PCR products using either Millipore 96 plates or Sera-Mag SpeedBeads (ThermoScientific) in 18% (wt/vol) PEG-8000, the latter of which followed the bead-based reaction clean-up protocol of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For approaches iiii above, we then used one or more of these approaches to assess the accuracy of the resulting PCR amplicon sequences: (i) bidirectional direct sequencing on AB3730xl genetic analyzers at the PSU Genomics Core Facility or the UC Berkeley DNA Sequencing Facility, using BigDye v3.1 chemistry (Life Technologies); (ii) cloning PCR products using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturers instructions, followed by selection and PCR amplification of six to eight colonies following ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11; and/or (iii) pooled sequencing of barcoded PCR products using the Illumina MiSeq platform, in which PCR products derived from the same sample were pooled in equimolar ratios and turned into Illumina DNA libraries using ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49 with modifications from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These indexed libraries were then pooled in equimolar ratios and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform using v2 150-bp paired-end chemistry, following the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the fourth data generation approach described above, we constructed Illumina DNA libraries as above directly from the DNA extract.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then enriched these libraries for the whole bison mitochondrial genome using biotinylated RNA baits (MYbaits v2; MYcroarray), following the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These enriched libraries were then sequenced on the MiSeq as described above, but using v3 75-bp paired-end chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Consensus_Sequence_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For data generation approaches i and ii, we assessed sequence quality manually and called consensus sequences using Lasergene v9 (DNASTAR) or Geneious v6.1.6 (Biomatters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For approaches iii and iv, we binned the short-read data by index, and then removed adapters and merged paired-end reads using SeqPrep (https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For approach iii, we removed primer sequences from merged and remaining unmerged reads using in-house scripts and mapped each read to both Bison bison (GenBank: NC_012346) and B. priscus (AY748705) CR reference sequences using BWA v0.6.1 (51), resulting in two datasets per sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We called consensus sequences using Geneious with the base agreement threshold set to 75% and the minimum coverage set to 50×.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For approach iv, we aligned merged reads to the reference B. bison mitochondrial genome sequence using an iterative assembler MIA (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We called bases that had 3 times coverage and 67% agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis, we then trimmed the resulting consensus sequence to the 600-bp target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We combined data from all four approaches to create robust consensus sequences for each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we identified conflicts between sequences resulting from the different approaches, we either performed additional analyses or coded conflicting sites as ambiguous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unsequenced regions are considered missing data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phylogeographic_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We aligned the 45 new CR sequences to a dataset of 147 previously published, radiocarbon dated or present-day, North American bison CR sequences (Dataset S1), using Se-Al (Sequence Alignment Editor; v2.0a11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed a Bayesian phylogeographic analysis using BEAST v1.8.3 (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assumed a generalized time-reversible evolutionary model, with gamma distributed rate variation and a proportion of invariable sites (GTR+G+I), a strict molecular clock with a rate calibrated using the median calendar ages of each radiocarbon dated specimen, and the flexible skygrid model of the coalescent process (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To infer the timing and directionality of movement between Beringia and interior North America, we adopted the discrete phylogeographic model described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  55, assigning each sample to either the North or South population based on whether the sample originated to the north or south of 60° N, which archaeological data and simulation studies indicate was the final barrier to a corridor (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simplify interpretation of the results, the two present-day bison that were sampled at locations just north of this cutoff (at 60° and 61.4°) were classified as southern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To learn about ancestral movements between north and south, we estimated the posterior distribution of the time of north-to-south and south-to-north movements using Markov Jumps (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique exploits dynamic programming and tricks from numerical analysis to efficiently compute the expected number and timing of specific transitions within a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) that conditions only on the directly observed end states at the tips of phylogenetic tree on which the CTMC acts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting posterior distribution of transition times naturally incorporates uncertainty in the tree and estimated CTMC rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ran two MCMC chains for 50 million states each, sampling the posterior states of all model parameters and trees every 5,000 states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discarded the first 10% of samples from each run as burn-in, combined the remainder using LogCombiner v1.8.3, and computed posterior means, posterior SDs, and 95% highest posterior density intervals in Tracer v1.6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We summarized the combined set of posterior trees and identified the maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree using TreeAnnotator v1.8.3, which we visualized using Figtree v1.4.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
