Vibrational coherence transfer in the ultrafast intersystem crossing of a diplatinum complex in solution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observation of vibrational wave packets allows tracking the pathways of energy relaxation in nonadiabatic surface crossing events of (bio)molecular systems, such as conical intersections or charge transfer processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify transfer of vibrational coherence in the course of conversion between electronic excited states of different spin in a diplatinum complex in solution, as an example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retention of coherence is due to the fact that the conversion rate is dramatically accelerated in an acetonitrile solvent due to the strong solvation of higher-lying electronic states that then provide the channel for the coherent population flow from the singlet to the triplet state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results highlight the role of the environment in controlling the pathways of energy flow and conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigate the ultrafast transient absorption response of tetrakis(-pyrophosphito)diplatinate(II), [Pt2(-P2O5H2)4]4 [hereafter abbreviated Pt(pop)], in acetonitrile upon excitation of its lowest singlet 1A2u state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with previously reported solvents [van der Veen RM, Cannizzo A, van Mourik F, Vlek A, Jr, Chergui M (2011) J Am Chem Soc 133:305315], a significant shortening of the intersystem crossing (ISC) time (less_than1 ps) from the lowest singlet to the lowest triplet state is found, allowing for a transfer of vibrational coherence, observed in the course of an ISC in a polyatomic molecule in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Density functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of Pt(pop) in acetonitrile and ethanol show that high-lying, mostly triplet, states are strongly mixed and shifted to lower energies due to interactions with the solvent, providing an intermediate state (or manifold of states) for the ISC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the larger the solvation energies of the intermediate state(s), the shorter the ISC time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the latter is smaller than the pure dephasing time of the vibrational wave packet, coherence is conserved during the spin transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results underscore the crucial role of the solvent in directing pathways of intramolecular energy flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experimental procedures, setup, and data analysis are described in SI Appendix, sections SI and SII, and in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39 and 54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we excite the sample [a room temperature solution of Pt(pop) in acetonitrile] with 360-nm pump pulses having a typical bandwidth of 2 nm and energy of 150 nJ, focused into a 100-m-diameter spot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probe pulse is a white-light supercontinuum from 340 to 600 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After focusing it onto the sample (35-m diameter at focal spot), it is coupled into a 100-m multimode fiber and sent to a spectrometer to be spectrally resolved and detected on a single-shot basis by means of a fast complementary metaloxidesemiconductor array detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pump pulses are chopped at one-half the laser repetition rate, which is also that of the probe pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The computational methods are described in SI Appendix, section SIII, and refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5557.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, we use an explicit solvent model by performing ab initio MD simulations within the QM/MM framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantum box contains a Pt(pop) molecule (38 atoms), while the classical box includes four Na+ ions for balancing the negative charge of Pt(pop) and 1,624 MeCN molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electronic energy was computed using B3LYP exchange and correlation functional with dispersion-corrected atom-centered potentials correction (5860) for dispersion forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, SOC between all excited singlet and triplet states has been computed at the same steps using the WangZiegler formalism (61) as implemented in the Amsterdam density functional code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the T1 state and the photoexcited S1 state have the same symmetry and their potential energy surfaces are nearly parallel, the forces acting on the nuclei are almost identical in both cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that we can perform a BornOppenheimer MD simulation on the T1 state, which also reflects the dynamics on the S1 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This considerably reduces the computational cost and makes the ES dynamics study of Pt(pop) feasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The UV-visible absorption spectra of Pt(pop) dissolved in different solvents are shown in SI Appendix, Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They display spectral features due to the d*  p transition: an intense dipole-allowed S0  S1 band centered around 360370 nm, and a weak S0  T1 band around 440460 nm (44, 45, 52, 62, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region below 320 nm shows three bands (SI Appendix, Fig S1, arrows) that are more solvent sensitive than the lower-lying d*  p transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These bands are notably weaker than the singlet S0  S1 band, but about 510 times stronger than the S0  T1 transition, pointing to a partial dipole- and/or spin-forbidden character.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nature of the UV bands was recently addressed by ZÃ¡li et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (62), using spinorbit TDDFT with an implicit solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They concluded that these bands involve transitions from lower-lying predominantly ligand-localized molecular orbitals to the LUMO, which can be approximately described as LMMCT states, all having a predominantly triplet character, with some singlet contribution (SI Appendix, Table S2, bottom row).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UV range additionally contains a manifold of states with negligible oscillator strengths from the GS (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2A shows a timewavelength (t) plot of the transient absorption of Pt(pop) in MeCN upon excitation at 360 nm into the blue wing of the S0  S1 band (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows several positive and negative signals, with rich oscillatory patterns on them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These oscillations are due to vibrational wave packets in the GS and ESs, as discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cuts at fixed time delays yield the transient spectra, shown in Fig 2B, while those at fixed wavelengths yield the time traces shown in Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on our previous studies in other solvents (40, 51) and on the molecular parameters of the S0, S1, and T1 states (SI Appendix, Table S1), the assignment of the various features in Fig 2 is straightforward: (i) the negative signal in the 360- to 390-nm region is due to the GS bleach (GSB) as this is where the GS singlet absorption band lies (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further confirmed by the time traces at 371 and 379 nm (SI Appendix, Fig S2), which show a clear oscillatory pattern due to a vibrational wave packet of the PtPt stretch mode in the GS (120 cm1; SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This wave packet is generated by impulsive stimulated Raman scattering as previously reported (40); (ii) the negative signal in the 390- to 430-nm region corresponds to stimulated emission (SE) from the S1 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this is where the fluorescence from this state was reported in other solvents (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows a clear damped oscillatory pattern (see the 411-nm trace in Fig 3), with a frequency of 150 cm1, which is typical of the S1 state as extracted from low-temperature steady-state spectroscopic studies (40, 44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oscillation amplitude decreases significantly over 1 ps; (iii) in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40, the ES absorption (ESAS) of the S1 state appeared in the 430480 nm region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2A, we indeed find a region of positive signal, which exhibits an oscillatory pattern with the same frequency, phase, and damping as the SE signal (compare traces at 411 and 458 nm in Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S2); (iv) in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51, the ESA of the T1 state was clearly visible in the 450- to 550-nm region along with its oscillatory pattern at a frequency of 157 cm1 (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2, the region 500 nm shows a positive signal with an oscillatory pattern that grows in amplitude during the first picoseconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is clearly seen on the 537-nm trace of Fig 3, which exhibits the frequency typical of the T1 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth of the absorption and oscillation amplitude in the latter, concomitant with the decay of the oscillations in the S1 state, imply that population flows from the S1 state to the T1 state (Fig 3), along with a transfer of vibrational coherence in the course of an ultrafast ISC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The further damping of the oscillations in the triplet state is due to dephasing as we discuss below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coming to Fig 2B, the various transient spectra therein displayed for t less_than 1 ps have strongly varying amplitudes and positions due to the fact that the cuts at the different time delays are affected by the oscillations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the oscillations have died away, the transient spectra at 5 and 30 ps contain only the GSB centered at 370 nm and the T1 ESA centered at 470 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The narrowing of the latter between 5 and 30 ps is due to slow vibrational cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, the main differences between acetonitrile and the previously investigated solvents (40) is the prompt appearance and gradual decay of the S1 state population (411- and 458-nm traces in Fig 3), the concomitant rise of the T1 state population, and the emergence of coherent oscillations in the T1 state (537-nm trace).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reflects a significant acceleration of the ISC, since the signal of the T1 state reaches its maximum amplitude by 1 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SE trace at 411 nm is particularly interesting because it reflects the decay of the S1 state population, analogous to what would be reported by spontaneous fluorescence (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This probe wavelength samples the outer turning point of the S1 state according to the steady-state fluorescence spectrum (40), with no overlap with other signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore a neat representation of the wave packet evolving on the S1 state, showing a clear damping of the amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed the datasets of Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S2 by a global fit (GF) (for details, see SI Appendix, section SI.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The function used to fit the entire set of time traces (SI Appendix, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1) is a sum of exponential terms (reflecting incoherent population kinetics) and damped (or growing) sine functions (reflecting coherent vibrational wave packet dynamics).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present data are best fitted with three exponential time constants (13), sine terms with frequencies due to the GS and the two ESs, along with their respective damping constants, either due to population decay, or to dephasing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retrieved parameters are given in Table 1 and are compared with the results obtained upon 280-nm excitation, which only show the wave packet dynamics in the T1 state (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is useful to note that those features, which reflect kinetic and dynamical signals of the T1 state under 360-nm excitation, are in excellent agreement with those retrieved under 280-nm excitation, except for 1, which is a population time and should differ because of different population mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extract exponential times of 700 Â± 100 fs and 3.8 Â± 0.4 ps (Table 1), while the oscillations in the S1 state have the characteristic frequency of 150 cm1 (40) and a damping time of 1.1 Â± 0.1 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3.8 Â± 0.4 ps is identical to the vibrational relaxation time in the triplet state derived from the results under 280-nm excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters for the latter (e.g., see the 537-nm ESAT trace) exhibits a gradual rise of its oscillation amplitude in 900 Â± 100 fs at the characteristic frequency of 157 cm1, followed by a damping with a time constant of 2.5 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter two values are in excellent agreement with those obtained under 280-nm excitation (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GF of the entire dataset confirms these values, and the agreement with the experimental data is very satisfactory (Fig 3 and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we applied a Fourier analysis to the oscillatory parts of the datasets, after subtracting the exponential parts, as explained in SI Appendix, section SII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fast Fourier transform maps showing the frequency as a function of probe wavelength are presented in SI Appendix, Fig S3, and the reported frequencies for the S0, S1, and T1 states are in excellent agreement with Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the decay of the S1 state is reflected by the rise of the T1 state, we attribute the 700- to 900-fs time constant to the S1  T1 ISC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The damping time of the S1 wave packet of 1.1 Â± 0.1 ps is longer than this ISC time but significantly shorter than the typical 1.72.5 ps (pure) dephasing time reported for the S1 state of Pt(pop) in other solvents (Table 2) (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the damping time of the singlet wave packet (Table 1) convolutes pure dephasing (or decoherence) with the ISC-mediated population decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the optical Bloch picture (41), the (measured) total dephasing rate is given by the following: 1/t2 = 1/(2t1) + 1/t2*, where t1 is the population decay (here, the ISC time of 700900 fs) time and t2* is the pure dephasing time (1.72.5 ps in all solvents; Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these values, one arrives at t2 = 0.961.28 ps, which compares favorably with the measured value of 1.1 Â± 0.1 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfer of coherence is possible because the decoherence time (2 ps) is two to three times longer than the ISC time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all other solvents, the ISC time was 412 times longer than the decoherence time (40), so that the coherence is lost well before the ISC occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The GF allows extracting the decay-associated spectra (DASs), which are shown in SI Appendix, Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 500- and 3.8-ps DASs are identical to those reported for the T1 state under 280-nm excitation (51), reflecting similar decay and vibrational cooling processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 700-fs DAS exhibits a broad negative component between 470 and 550 nm, which is red-shifted with respect to the 500-ps DAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reflects the fact that, upon ISC, the T1 state is populated in high vibrational levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also shows an additional minimum at 420 nm, which is due to the SE signal and a maximum at 450 nm, which corresponds to the S1 state ESA (Fig 2) (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this DAS captures all of the signals that characterize the kinetic evolution of the S1 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the solvent effect on the vertical excitation energies of the S1 and T1 states (SI Appendix, Fig S1 and Table S2) is not significant, the marked solvent-dependent S1  T1 ISC rate seems to qualitatively correlate with the shifts of the UV bands with respect to the S1 and T1 states (SI Appendix, Table S2), that is, the redder the UV bands, the faster the ISC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although the UV bands in DMF and MeCN are the red-most shifted and lie at virtually the same energy (SI Appendix, Fig S1 and Table S2), MeCN still shows an order of magnitude faster ISC than DMF (less_than1 vs. 11 ps).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These significant solvent effects on the ISC rate suggest that an additional state (or states) may be mediating the ISC from S1 to T1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was already suggested by Milder and Brunschwig (53), who interpreted the temperature dependence of the picosecond S1 fluorescence in frozen H2O:glycerol matrices as being due to ISC via an intermediate primarily triplet ligand field (LF) state, and they estimated the barrier between the S1 and this state to be in the 1,2001,900 cm1 range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extremely fast relaxation channel to the T1 state we recently reported upon 280-nm excitation of Pt(pop) and which bypasses the S1 state (51), strongly supports the presence of a predominantly triplet state(s) that lie in the same region as the S1 state and maybe the one(s) mediating the S1  T1 ISC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The above considerations suggest that the lower these intermediate state(s), the faster the ISC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as we show hereafter, the intermediate state is not LF as suggested in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The TDDFT calculations (with implicit solvent) (62) at the S0 and S1 state geometries report an energy gap between the S1 state and next higher states, which is far too large (4,000 cm1) to account for the ISC activation energies (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that the use of an implicit solvent is not sufficient to rationalize the present observations, and it calls for an explicit description of the solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, using QM/MM MD simulations, we rationalize the observations as described hereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In these simulations, the QM part (the metal complex) is treated at the B3LYP/DFT/TDDFT level of theory (for details, see SI Appendix, section SIII).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the quality of the method, we computed the absorption spectrum of the system using structures sampled along a GS MD trajectory simulated in the NVT (canonical) ensemble at 300 K. The experimental singlet absorption band is compared with the simulated one in SI Appendix, Fig S5, for the MeCN and EtOH solvents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the approximations used in the dynamics (classical nuclei, QM/MM interface between the complex and the solvent, and the limited sampling), the agreement between the two is very good (with a red shift of the theoretical spectra of about 0.10.2 eV), justifying the use of this approach for the further analysis of the ES properties and dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extra structures of the theoretical spectra (high- and low-energy shoulders) are related to the classical nature of the PtPt bond vibration that leads to an enhancement of the expectation values at the turning points and therefore to sidebands in the simulated absorption profile (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4 shows the HOMO-1 to LUMO+2 KohnSham (KS) orbitals computed for the GS optimized (minimum energy) geometry (upper line) and for two other structures taken from the dynamics in the T1 state at 600 and 1,800 fs after their initiation (second and third line, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear from this figure that the orbitals are strongly distorted as a result of strong mixing of the GS-optimized orbitals in the ES and that this mixing evolves with time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Table S3 shows the state energies and associated character composition of the lowest singlet and triplet states in MeCN calculated 600 and 1,800 fs after photoexcitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S1 and T1 states are populated by a transition from the HOMO to the LUMO, while the T2 state(s) are from the HOMO to the mixed-character unoccupied KS orbitals (SI Appendix, Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that, due to the mixing of orbitals in our explicit solvent calculations, the symmetry-based labeling and ES characters are no longer applicable in the course of ES evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we label the ESs according to their energy ordering (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy ordering and spatial distribution of the frontier orbitals in the S1 (T1) and T2 states is induced by time-dependent local interactions of the excited molecule with the solvent molecules, in the course of the dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the HOMO conserves its d* character (SI Appendix, Table S4), while the first three unoccupied orbitals become a linear combination of the LUMO, LUMO+1, and LUMO+2 orbitals of the optimized GS structure (Fig 4, first line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the LUMO+1 and LUMO+2 solvent-exposed orbitals of the optimized structure (62) are distorted by the effect of the solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To illustrate the effect of the strong solvation of the T2 state(s), SI Appendix, Fig S6 shows the time evolution of the S1 and T2 state energies as well as of the PtPt bond along a trajectory propagated in the T1(S1) state, for two different solvents: (i) acetonitrile and (ii) ethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aim of this figure is by no means to quantitatively account for the experimental ISC rates but to qualitatively show the trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, only a single trajectory was simulated for each solvent due to the computational cost of the QM/MM simulations; therefore, the present calculations lack statistical averaging (which would require several tens of simulations to be significant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SI Appendix, Fig S6, the amplitude of the energy fluctuations of the S1 and T2 state is large (typically, 0.5 eV), but the most important result is that the average energy of the T2 state(s) and their molecular orbital representations (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Table S3) depart considerably from the ones obtained for the GS optimized structures with an implicit solvent (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of the dynamical interaction between the electronically excited complex and the solvent, a strong mixing of the high-lying LMMCT ESs occurs, which leads to a significant lowering of the corresponding state energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the highly symmetric states labeled d3Au, b3Ag, d1Au, and b1Ag in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  62 (characterized by excitations from the predominantly metal d* orbital to pop-delocalized orbitals) are replaced in the fluctuating explicit solvent by states arising from asymmetric orbital mixing (differently stabilized by the solvent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the mixed-character T2 state(s) occasionally cross the S1 state in the course of the ES dynamics (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These points of energy degeneracy, along with the large SOC constants (100500 cm1) between the S1 and T2 states, favor ISC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, extensive statistical sampling would be needed to relate the frequency of crossing events to the significantly different ISC rates in EtOH and MeCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To get further insight into the origin of the solvent effects on the ISC, we plot in SI Appendix, Fig S8 the ES radial distribution functions (RdFs) of the H, C, and N (in MeCN) and H, O, and C (in EtOH) atoms with respect to the bridging (Ob) and the polar (Op) oxygen atoms (defined in SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data show that the solvent H atoms preferentially point toward the Ob atoms, while the N (of MeCN) and O (of EtOH) distributions peak at larger distances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coordination numbers for all atomic species (radial integration of the RdF) are also shown (dot-dashed traces).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of an H peak below 2 Ã in the EtOH RdF suggests the formation of a radially arranged pseudoH-bond network between solute and solvent molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in the case of MeCN, the RdF for the H atoms has its first maximum above 2 Ã, and it is significantly broader than its equivalent in EtOH, suggesting a more labile solvation shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same applies to the RdF of the neighboring C atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These trends are more visible in the case of the RdFs measured from the Ops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The case of EtOH shows a well-defined first solvation shell (SI Appendix, Fig S10), while in MeCN no clear solvent structure is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Very recently, MÃ¸ller and coworkers (65) reported calculations of the water solvent structure around Pt(pop) and presented RdFs that bear strong resemblance to those of EtOH in SI Appendix, Fig S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ISC time in water is 13.7 ps (40), and the fact that the solvation shell shows, like EtOH, a higher degree of order than MeCN suggests that the higher disorder in the latter favors mixing and solvation of the higher LMMCT states and thus a faster ISC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also interesting to note that the [Pt2(-P2O5(BF2)2)4]4 compound, with an electronic structure similar to Pt(pop) but a much more rigid ligand cage, exhibits an S1 lifetime of 1.6 ns (63), orders of magnitude longer that Pt(pop).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there seems to be a connection between the ligand/solvation shell structure and the mixing and solvation of the LMMCT states, which calls for further theoretical studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pt(pop) is unstable in the gas phase, but the protonated [Pt(pop) + 2H]2 anionic species is stable and was recently characterized by mass spectrometry and time-resolved pump-probe photoelectron spectroscopy (66, 67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This species exhibits the same absorption bands as Pt(pop) in solution, suggesting very similar energetics of the lowest triplet and singlet states, but also of the higher-lying UV bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrafast experiments (67) showed that the S1 state undergoes a decay accompanied by a concomitant rise in population of the T1 state with the same rate as the ISC in MeCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this may be fortuitous, it does raise an interesting question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In [Pt(pop) + 2H]2, the two protons were calculated to be coordinated with polar oxygens at both ends of the molecule (see figure 2 of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  66), leading to a significant lowering of the molecular symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this would favor mixing of ESs, it may also suggest that a kind of microsolvation; mainly targeting the Op atoms is sufficient to strongly affect the energetics of the intermediate T2 state(s) and open the fast channel for ISC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MeCN, the probability of symmetry lowering is higher due to a less structured solvation shell and so would also be the case of solvating dynamically the ES upon interaction with the polar oxygens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative explanation for the gas phase results is that symmetry breaking is introduced by the two protons, which may simply make the ISC allowed between the S1 and T1 states, but considering their nested potential curves this seems unlikely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As mentioned in the Introduction, several cases of ultrafast ISC in transition metal complexes have been reported (2, 3438, 49), but whenever vibrational wave packets appeared, they were exclusively observed in the final state of different spin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented here show a clearcut transfer of vibrational coherence during an ISC event, which underscores the importance of solvent effects in intramolecular dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental data show that the wave packet created in the S1 state (with a frequency of 150 cm1) is coherently transferred to the T1 state (157 cm1) over several oscillation cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is remarkable that the wave packet frequency increases after this transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this can be understood considering that a wave packet is a coherent superposition of several vibrational wave functions with a certain energy spread, determined by the pump laser spectral width, in the present case 550 cm1, that is, it spans three to four vibrational levels of both S1 and T1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This and the very close vibrational frequencies in the two electronic states make it possible to have a vibrational coherence appearing in the T1 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present case of ultrafast ISC induced by the mixing and solvation of states that mediate the spin change is different from the case reported in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  68 and 69, where coherence transfer occurs in an ultrafast ISC event in the ClF molecule trapped in rare gas matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter, excitation of the dissociative 11 state leads to the vibrational wave packet switching to the bound 3 state in less_than0.5 ps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ultrafast spin flip is due to coherent caging of the fragments by the matrix at the asymptotic limit where singlet and triplet state are nearly degenerate, thus compensating for the weak SOC constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The picture that emerges from the present experimental and theoretical results is schematically shown in Fig 1, where the T2 state(s) depicted with red dashed line is (are) those that mediate the ISC but probably also cause the direct population of the triplet state upon UV excitation reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy of the T2 intermediate state(s) is determined by the solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QM/MM simulations show how differential shifts and mixings of molecular ESs due to dynamical solvent effects (fluctuations) can induce new relaxation channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is of importance in photochemistry as large polyatomic molecules consist of various types of states: valence, charge transfer, or Rydberg, which have largely different interactions with their environment such that the respective intramolecular potential surfaces can be strongly shifted and their crossing points, for example, at conical intersections, can end up strongly modified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

We reported on the transfer of vibrational coherence from a singlet to a triplet state in an ultrafast ISC induced by the solvent environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show an ISC on the timescale of 0.70.9 ps from the S1 to the T1 state in acetonitrile, 1030 times faster than in other solvents (40, 53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We rationalize the observation of coherence transfer on the basis of the following: (i) the S1(1A2u)  T1(3A2u) ISC time (0.7 ps) is faster than the decoherence time of the wave packet in the singlet and triplet states (typically 1.72.5 ps), so that coherence is preserved during and after ISC; (ii) an intermediate state (or group of states, labeled T2) is mediating the ISC, whose existence is inferred from QM/MM MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These states, of predominantly triplet character, result from the solvent-induced dynamic mixing and strong solvation of higher lying LMMCT states, so that in MeCN they are degenerate with the S1 state; (iii) the MD simulations also suggest that symmetry breaking may be crucial for the acceleration of the ISC, as the solvation shell is much more structured in EtOH and H2O (slow ISC) compared with MeCN (fast ISC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
