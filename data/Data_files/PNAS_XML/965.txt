Li-rich antiperovskite superionic conductors based on cluster ions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lithium superionic conductors with Li+ conductivity that is comparable with that of the organic liquid electrolytes are critical for the development of practically useful all-solid-state batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that cluster-based lithium superionic conductors can have very high conductivities of 102 to over 101 S/cm at room temperature, low activation energy under 0.210 eV, a giant band gap of 8.5 eV, and desired mechanical properties that entail great flexibility and can inhibit the dendric growth of Li metal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high Li+ conductivity of the materials results from the thermal excitation of quasirigid unit modes of the cluster ions and the exceptionally large channel size created by mixing large cluster ions together with the elementary ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enjoying great safety, high power, and high energy densities, all-solid-state batteries play a key role in the next generation energy storage devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their development is limited by the lack of solid electrolyte materials that can reach the practically useful conductivities of 102 S/cm at room temperature (RT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, by exploring a set of lithium-rich antiperovskites composed of cluster ions, we report a lithium superionic conductor, Li3SBF4, that has an estimated 3D RT conductivity of 102 S/cm, a low activation energy of 0.210 eV, a giant band gap of 8.5 eV, a small formation energy, a high melting point, and desired mechanical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mixed phase of the material, Li3S(BF4)0.5Cl0.5, with the same simple crystal structure exhibits an RT conductivity as high as 101 S/cm and a low activation energy of 0.176 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high ionic conductivity of the crystals is enabled by the thermal-excited vibrational modes of the cluster ions and the large channel size created by mixing the large cluster ion with the small elementary ion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Geometry_Optimization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DFT calculations are carried out to optimize the unit cell of the super-LRAP using PerdewBurkeErnzerh generalized gradient approximation for exchangecorrelation functional (44) implemented in the VASP package (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projector augmented wave (46) pseudopotential method and an 8 × 8 × 8 Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh are used in the calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cutoff energy is 550 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy convergence is set to 106 eV, and the force convergence is set to 0.005 eV/Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The van der Waals interaction [as implemented in the DFT + D2 method (47, 48)] is considered during the optimization calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Internal_Charge_Distribution_of_the_Clusters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bader charge analysis is used to obtain charge distribution of the clusters in the studied crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lattice_Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phonon dispersion relations of the super-LRAP are calculated using the density functional perturbation theory with the van der Waals interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geometry of the unit cell is optimized with an energy convergence of 108 eV and force convergence of 104 eV/Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phonon frequencies are first calculated on a q grid of 5 × 5 × 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frequencies for other q points are then interpolated from the calculated points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

q-RUMs_of_the_Super-LRAP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The q-RUMs of the studied materials are found by mapping the phonon eigenvectors of a model system containing rigid superhalogen ions to the eigenvectors of the studied system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model system is created and calculated using an improved version of CRUSH code (4951).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Potential_Terms_Created_by_BF4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The interaction potential created by each of the BF4 units on the Li+ ion can be expressed by a multipole expansion:(r)=140[qr+prr3+12ijrirjr5Qij+...],[S1]where q = e is the total charge of the BF4 superhalogen ion, and r is the vector from boron at the center of one BF4 unit to the Li+ ion; p is the dipole moment generated by the charge distribution inside one BF4 unit:p=i=14qiFRiFqr=i=14qiFriF,[S2]where qiF = 0.25e is the charge on each F atom in the model (Fig 2A), Ri represents the coordinates of each F atom, and ri is the relative coordinate of each F atom from the boron center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qij is the quadrupole term:Qij=k=14qk(3RikRjkR2ij),[S3]where qk is the charge on each F atom, and Rik is the ith coordinate of the kth F atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1, both the dipole and the quadrupole terms are determined by the orientational symmetry of the BF4 unit inside the cubic cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thermodynamics_and_Superionic_Conductivity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are conducted using a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell and 1.0-fs time step in a constant pressure and constant temperature (NpT) ensemble to study the thermodynamics of the material at 400 and 600 K. To study the Li+ transport, AIMD simulations with 2.0-ps time step and constant volume and constant temperature (NVT) ensemble are carried out at 550, 650, 750, 900, and 1,000 K using a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell with one Li+ vacancy to speed up the ion hopping process (17, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At each temperature, the AIMD lasts over 130 ps after a 40-ps preequilibrium run to make the linear fitting to the averaged MSD of Li+ converge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diffusion coefficient (D) at each temperature is calculated by fitting to the MSD according toD=limt[16t[r(t)]2],[S4]with r(t) as the displacement of Li+ at time t. The conductivity () is then calculated from the NernstEinstein relation=DNe2kT,[S5]with N being the number of ion pairs per 1 cm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other symbols have their customary meaning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation energy Ea is obtained by using the Arrhenius model:=ATexp(EakT),[S6]where A is the fitting parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Elastic_Constants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Instead of using the strainstress method (48) and the equation of state (52, 53) to calculate the elastic tensors and the modulus, we take advantage of the cubic symmetry of Li3SBF4 and calculate the elastic tensors of the material by using the following relations (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subscripts of  denote the directions of motion of the atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Youngs modulus (E), shear modulus (), and the Poissons ratio () are then calculated asE=c112+c12c112c122c11+c12[S7]=c44[S8]=c12c11+c12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S9]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model_Study_of_a_Barium-Doped_Li3OCl_Crystal  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using AIMD simulations combined with experimental measurements, Goodenough and coworkers (22) reported that the advanced superionic conductivity (with RT   greater than  102 S/cm and activation energy Ea = 0.06 eV) of the A32 × 0.005Ba0.005OCl (A = Li or Na) glass is accompanied by large dielectric constant of the material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism that they proposed is that, because of the amorphous state of the glass, there exist some dipole-rich clusters, such as AO and A2O, which can rotate and coalesce because of dipoledipole interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dipole-rich clusters may even condense to form negative chain segments when they are aligned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These will significantly reduce the bonding of A+, leading to the activation energy of 0.06 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the amorphous glass system is different from the crystalline systems of Li3OCl and Li3SBF4 studied here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the AIMD approach that we used in this work to obtain the activation energy and the ion transport mechanism have been proved to be suitable for the crystalline systems as evidenced in the literature (17, 25, 55, 56), such a method will not be applicable to the A32 × 0.005Ba0.005OCl (A = Li or Na) glass system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain the activation energy and extrapolate the RT conductivity, the Arrhenius model has to be valid for the entire temperature range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With AIMD, one can only obtain apparent ion diffusion within affordable simulating timescale at relatively high simulation temperatures, and the Arrhenius model must hold at these high temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Li32 × 0.005Ba0.005OCl glass, however, the glass transition temperature is only about 75 °C (375 K) (20), and the behavior becomes non-Arrhenius beyond this temperature, because the glass becomes liquid or rubber alike.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attaining a reliable activation energy by fitting the Arrhenius model to the diffusion coefficients from AIMD around RT will be prohibitively expensive and beyond our computational power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to study the superionic conductivity of the glass by using the Arrhenius model, we adopt the following strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a 3 × 3 × 3 supercell of Li3OCl with one intrinsic Li+ defect and one Li substituted by one Ba.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the 2+ valence state of Ba, an additional Li vacancy is created in the supercell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We carry out AIMD on the supercell at one high simulation temperature (1,900 K) without melting the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3 × 3 × 3 supercell is the largest that we can use in such a simulation according to our computational power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The doping concentration of Ba in such a supercell is still much higher than that of Li32 × 0.005Ba0.005OCl (less_than0.2% Ba vs. Li).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, such a model system will emphasize the effects of Ba doping and Li vacancy on the ion conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S1 shows the MSD of various atoms from the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One can see that the system is not melting, since Cl and O have almost zero MSD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent Li+ diffusion is accompanied by large Ba2+ movements (as indicated by the large MSD of the atom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been reported that tensile strain can greatly increase the ion conductivity of Li3OCl because of linear reduction of the migration barrier with the strain (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the Arrhenius model, the conductivity ratio between the strained (s) Li3OCl and the unstrained (0) one iss0exp(EakBT),[S10]where Ea  3.3 ×  (electronvolts) is the reduction of the activation energy of Li+ caused by the tensile strain  (percentage) in the lattice (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the doped Ba will introduce strain in the Li3OCl lattice, especially when Ba moves through the lattice as shown by MSD in Fig S1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the average strain in the lattice parameter caused by Ba is about 2.5% (0.025), which corresponds to a reduction of the activation energy by Ea  3.3 × 0.025  0.08 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the original activation energy of Li3OCl is about 0.3 eV (25), the activation energy of the Ba doped system will be (0.3  0.08) = 0.22 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the diffusion coefficient extracted from the MSD in Fig S1B, the Li+ RT conductivity of the Ba-doped system can be calculated by the Arrhenius model to be about 1.7 × 103 S/cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is about 14 time higher than the calculated RT conductivity (0.12 × 103 S/cm) of Li3OCl (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the real RT conductivity of Li3OCl is about 0.85 × 103 S/cm, the real estimated RT conductivity of the Ba-doped system should be  greater than 102 S/cm (14 × 0.85 × 103 = 1.9 × 102 S/cm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We want to emphasize that, to use the Arrhenius model, the current Ba-doped model system does not include the effect of amorphization of atoms, where freely rotating clusters and chain segments are present (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is probably why the estimated activation energy 0.22 eV is still larger than the experimental 0.06 eV of the glass and the estimated RT conductivity is still smaller than the experimental 2.5 × 102 S/cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is also an overestimation of the strain caused by Ba in our modeled system, because the doping concentration of Ba in our supercell is larger than that of the real glass system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the presence of tensile strain in the glass is reasonableother than the strain caused by the doped Ba, strain is likely to be produced when the glassy state is formed from liquid by cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tensile strain would create more room in the glass, allowing the dipole-rich clusters to rotate and coalesce freely as well as align into chain segments according to external fields, which is consistent with the result of Goodenough and coworkers (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, with Ba doping, the model system is more likely to melt and become amorphous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S5 shows the melting state of the Ba-doped Li3OCl at a simulation temperature of 2,000 K when the pure Li3OCl will not start melting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe clusters, such as LiO and Li2O, as well as chain segments in such state, which agrees with what was reported by Goodenough and coworkers (22) for the case of Na+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
