Cavitation onset caused by acceleration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this paper we propose an alternative derivation of the cavitation number and validate the threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed dimensionless number is more suitable to predict the cavitation onset caused by a sudden acceleration rather than a large velocity as prescribed by the traditional cavitation number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systematic experiments were conducted for validation, confirming that the alternative cavitation number predicts the threshold at which cavitation will occur (Caless_than1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Striking the top of a liquid-filled bottle can shatter the bottom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intuitive interpretation of this event might label an impulsive force as the culprit in this fracturing phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, high-speed photography reveals the formation and collapse of tiny bubbles near the bottom before fracture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation indicates that the damaging phenomenon of cavitation is at fault.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cavitation is well known for causing damage in various applications including pipes and ship propellers, making accurate prediction of cavitation onset vital in several industries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the conventional cavitation number as a function of velocity incorrectly predicts the cavitation onset caused by acceleration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unexplained discrepancy leads to the derivation of an alternative dimensionless term from the equation of motion, predicting cavitation as a function of acceleration and fluid depth rather than velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two independent research groups in different countries have tested this theory; separate series of experiments confirm that an alternative cavitation number, presented in this paper, defines the universal criteria for the onset of acceleration-induced cavitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two cases of cavitation onset introduced by large accelerations in low-speed flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A bottle filled with water accelerated by the impact of a mallet on the top (A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A test tube filled with silicone oil accelerated by an impact with the ground (B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both image sets correspond to the impact (first frame), tiny bubble appearance (second frame), bubble expansion (third frame), bubble collapse and cracking (fourth frame), and crack propagation/failure (fifth frame).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the time between each event is different, the overall behavior is very similar (Movies S1S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative timing of bubble collapse and fracture incidence suggests that implosion-induced waves are likely responsible for fracture initiation, although further investigation into fracture mechanisms in the case studies presented here would be necessary to confirm this observation (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relationships between cavitation and structural damage are well-documented elsewhere in biological and man-made systems (2731).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High-speed photographs of an empty glass test tube (upper row) and partially silicone oil filled test tube (bottom row) dropped from the same height onto the floor (200 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impact with the floor did not introduce damage to the glass for the empty case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impact with the floor causes a cavitation bubble at t = 0.25 ms for the silicone oil-filled case, which collapses at 0.35 ms. Fracture immediately develops at the location where cavitation occurs after the cavitation bubble collapses, rather than at the bottom of the test tube (impact location).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Typical values and order-of-magnitude analysis of the parameters in the experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Theory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We propose an alternative cavitation number based on acceleration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consider a vertical, cylindrical column of liquid undergoing an impulsive acceleration in the vertical direction as shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the assumption that the liquid is inviscid and incompressible and has a velocity magnitude significantly smaller than the acceleration (v/t), as is commonly known (11, 2426), only the pressure gradient and acceleration remain (11), and the NavierStokes equations are reduced tovt=1p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]Integrating Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 along the centerline of the liquid from the free surface to the bottom of the column (assuming the depth of the liquid is h), denoting the magnitude of the vertical component of v/t as a, and solving for the pressure difference in the liquid column yieldsprpb=ah,[3]where pr is the reference pressure at the free surface and pb is the pressure at the bottom of the column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cavitation is likely to occur when pbless_thanpv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we can establishCa=prpvah[4]as an indicator of cavitation onset when the flow undergoes a violent acceleration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to this expression as the quiescent cavitation number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To gain physical insight into the interpretation of the quiescent cavitation number, gravitational acceleration can be introduced and Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 can be reformulated asCa=(prpv)/gha/g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Gravitational acceleration is not an essential term in the cavitation number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is included here to enable a formulation with explicit physical meaning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numerator is the maximum nondimensionalized force that the pressure difference can provide (similar to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) and the denominator is the nondimensionalized inertial force the liquid experiences under acceleration (in contrast to the fluid momentum of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, once the inertial forces exceed the maximum pressure difference (i.e., Caless_than1), cavitation is likely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when Ca1 the pressure is large enough to balance the vacuum introduced by acceleration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, cavitation is not likely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Setup  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
More details about the experiments can be found in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two separate groups independently conducted the following experiments with different setups and measurement techniques to validate Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 or 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The group from Utah State University and Brigham Young University (USU/BYU) used a cylindrical cavitation tube built from transparent acrylic (1, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cavitation tube was fitted with a pressure tap to control internal pressure and an accelerometer with a maximum measurable acceleration of 1,000 g (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2A and 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment was performed with internal reference pressures (pr) of 85.7, and 19.0 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high-speed camera was used to image the cavitation tube to detect the presence of cavitation bubbles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cavitation tube was filled with distilled water to various depths (h) and the tube was accelerated by striking the top with a rubber mallet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The group from Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT) used glass test tubes filled with silicone oil or ethanol of varying depth (h) impacting vertically on a flat rigid surface after free fall (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1B and 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acceleration and appearance of cavitation bubbles was estimated with calibrated high-speed video.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3 reports the experimental results from the two groups; oranges and reds are from the USU/BYU group and blues and greens are from the TUAT group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vertical axis and the horizontal axis show the numerator and the denominator of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Open markers represent cavitation detection and closed markers represent no cavitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black solid line is plotted according to Ca=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the open markers are distributed in the region of Caless_than1 (shaded green in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, closed markers dominate the region where Ca1 (shaded orange in Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the proposed cavitation number explains the trend for a wide range of accelerations and water column depths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The influence of the reference pressure pr is shown in Fig 3B and the influence of diameter and fluid type in Fig 3C as zoomed-in regions of Fig 3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the more difficult to apply or ambiguous result of the conventional cavitation number C1 and the values proposed by numerical simulation Ca1 (23), our data suggest that the onset of cavitation is located in a region near Caless_than1, regardless of the reference pressure, inner diameter of the tube, liquid column height, and fluid type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Summary  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this paper we introduced an alternative formulation of the cavitation number that captures the cavitation onset caused by acceleration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, the conventional cavitation number C (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) can inaccurately predict that no cavitation will occur when cavitation may, in fact, be occurring in suddenly accelerated flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the impact of a fluid-filled bottle with the ground can cause cavitation (Fig 1) although the velocities are too small to predict using C. Thus, we propose an alternative cavitation number Ca (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4) by applying the equation of motion, resulting in a replacement of the momentum term in C (velocity) with an inertial one in Ca (acceleration) in cases of acceleration-induced cavitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple sets of independent experiments were conducted by two separate groups to test the theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results show that cavitation occurs for Caless_than1 (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), consistent with the theoretical prediction, establishing that the alternative cavitation number Ca is a reasonable criterion for the onset of acceleration-induced cavitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alternative cavitation number can potentially be used as a criterion for brain injury caused by impact-induced cavitation (5, 6), prediction of water hammer (4), and potentially applied to the development of safety devices (e.g., helmet design).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

USU_BYU_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An acrylic tube (55.0 mm inner diameter) is partially filled (h=1200 mm) with distilled water (=1.0×103 kg/m3, pv=2.3×103 Pa, and =1 cSt).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acceleration is introduced by striking the top of the tube with a mallet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pressure in the tube is controlled by a vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An accelerometer is connected to the bottom of the tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tube is illuminated by a backlight and images are recorded by a high-speed camera [Photron APX, SA-3, or Phantom V-1610, 3,000 to 100,000 frames per s (fps) and 0.1 mm per pixel].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that a very short paper focusing primarily on the artistic nature of a similar set of photographs rather than the scientific findings was recently published (1) and an early derivation of Ca was given in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TUAT_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A glass test tube (inner diameter 8.027.2 mm, tube thickness 1 mm) is partially filled (h=5120 mm) with silicone oil (=1.0×103 kg/m3, pv=7.0×102 Pa, and =10 cSt) or ethanol (=8.0×102 kg/m3 and pv=6.0×103 Pa, and =1 cSt).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tube is held above the floor (22135 mm) by an electromagnet until it is released.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tube is illuminated by a backlight and images are recorded by a high-speed camera (Photron SA-X, up to 90,000 fps and 0.1 mm per pixel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basic concept of the experimental setup is similar to previous research (3, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acceleration, a, is determined by the high-speed camera images, measuring the impact speed (sum of the downward speed of the tube just before the impact and the upward speed just after the impact) and dividing the impact speed by the duration of the collision of the tube bottom with the floor (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that results appearing in this paper mirror our previous report (3) that focused on the motion of the gasliquid interface rather than the onset of cavitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Supporting_Information  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Material_Stiffness  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiments similar to the ones reported in the paper were conducted with containers made from softer materials: a polypropylene container and a glass-coated container with a thin layer of silicone rubber on the inside walls (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental results show that the theoretical prediction proposed in the research holds well for five-orders-of-magnitude changes in container stiffness (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Non-Newtonian_Media  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiments were repeated with a gelatin gel (porcine skin G6144; Sigma-Aldrich) in test tubes and found that the theory held even for this nonfluidic material that is often used to simulate human tissue in bullet impact studies (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data show that cavitation occurs when Ca less_than 1, similar to other liquids tested in the paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this dataset illustrates the similar nature of the phenomenon in gelatin, a thorough investigation of more varied viscoelastic soft matters and/or non-Newtonian fluids is warranted in future studies based on these findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculation_Examples_and_Order-of-Magnitude_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The conventional cavitation number is calculated asC=prpv12v2,[S1]where pr and pv are the reference pressure and the vapor pressure of the fluid, respectively, is the density, and v is the local velocity in the fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the experiments conducted at USU/BYU and TUAT the typical values of the parameters and the order-of-magnitude analyses in test cases are listed in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
