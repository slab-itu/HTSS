Dopamine in the medial amygdala network mediates human bonding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Early life bonding in humans has critical long-term implications for health, productivity, and well-being in society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, neural mechanisms of bonding are typically studied in rodents, and no studies to date had examined the neurochemistry of human social affiliation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study utilizes a state-of-the-art technology to demonstrate that human maternal bonding is associated with striatal dopamine function and the recruitment of a corticostriatalamygdala brain network that supports affiliation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simultaneous probing of neurochemical responses and whole-brain network function in mothers watching their infants provides a unique observation into an affiliating brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results advance the mechanistic understanding of human social bonding and promote basic and clinical research in social neuroscience, development, and psychopathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Research in humans and nonhuman animals indicates that social affiliation, and particularly maternal bonding, depends on reward circuitry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although numerous mechanistic studies in rodents demonstrated that maternal bonding depends on striatal dopamine transmission, the neurochemistry supporting maternal behavior in humans has not been described so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we tested the role of central dopamine in human bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied a combined functional MRI-PET scanner to simultaneously probe mothers dopamine responses to their infants and the connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), the amygdala, and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which form an intrinsic network (referred to as the medial amygdala network) that supports social functioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured the mothers behavioral synchrony with their infants and plasma oxytocin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this study suggest that synchronous maternal behavior is associated with increased dopamine responses to the mothers infant and stronger intrinsic connectivity within the medial amygdala network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, stronger network connectivity is associated with increased dopamine responses within the network and decreased plasma oxytocin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that dopamine is involved in human bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with other mammals, humans have an unusually complex social life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complexity of human bonding cannot be fully captured in nonhuman animal models, particularly in pathological bonding, such as that in autistic spectrum disorder or postpartum depression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, investigations of the neurochemistry of social bonding in humans, for which this study provides initial evidence, are warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The medial amygdala network (in red) includes the medial sector of the amygdala along with a set of connected regions in the NAcc, rostral hypothalamus, vmPFC, PCC, and sgACC (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The map is based on 150 healthy adults and reflects a whole-brain intrinsic connectivity analysis seeded in the right medial amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous research shows that stronger intrinsic connectivity within this network is associated with larger and more complex social networks (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The connectivity and dopamine response within the network were tested for association with maternal bonding behavior and plasma oxytocin levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that dopamine secretion within the medial amygdala network recruits the network to support human bonding (green arrowheads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We predicted that synchronous mothering would be associated with an enhanced dopamine response within the network that specifically signifies the own-infant over the unfamiliar-infant condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Behavioral_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bonding behavior was evaluated with two indices of motherinfant synchrony: motherinfant vocalization synchrony and maternal attunement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motherinfant synchrony is the temporal contingency of behavior between a mother and her infant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To synchronize, a mother needs to be sensitive to her infant and adjust her behavior dynamically according to the infants cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Motherinfant vocalization synchrony measures the temporal matching of motherinfant vocalizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As part of typical human bonding behavior, mothers and infants tend to synchronize their vocal communication (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated vocalization synchrony as the percentage of time during a 2-min unconstrained interaction in which mothers and infants were vocally synchronized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our sample, mothers and infant synchronized vocalizations for 013% of the time, with a mean of 4% and median of 2.36%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the median, we divided the sample into two groups: high and low vocalization synchrony groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Maternal attunement is a broader measure of synchrony that traces how well the mother accommodates her vocal stimulation to the infants affect and social engagement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maternal voice helps regulate the infants attention and affect (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, mothers attune their vocal communication not only to the infants vocalizations but also to a broader set of affective cues, such as infants arousal levels and social engagement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to this broader aspect of synchrony as maternal attunement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maternal attunement measured the time in which mothers provided vocal stimulation while the infant was showing signs of positive affect (the infant is content and socially engaging).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our sample, maternal attunement ranged from 027% of the time in the 2-min unconstrained interaction, with a mean of 10.7% and a median of 10.8%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Age, race, or education level did not predict maternal attunement or motherinfant vocalization synchrony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results of this study demonstrate that human maternal bonding is associated with dopamine responses in the NAcc and pallidum and with the strength of intrinsic connectivity within the medial amygdala network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, stronger intrinsic connectivity in the medial amygdala network is associated with increased within-network dopamine levels tested simultaneously and with lower plasma oxytocin levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data provide evidence indicating that dopamine is involved in human bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When humans interact, their appetitive behaviors synchronize (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synchrony has been shown to improve prosocial behavior in infant macaques (16, 17), among healthy children (1), and in children with autistic spectrum disorder (1821).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence presented here, which links synchrony to dopamine, provides initial evidence that dopamine is involved in the prosocial effects of synchrony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Behavioral synchronization demands dynamic adjustment of ones behavior to the dyadic partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, synchronous mothers had stronger dopamine responses to their own infant in the NAcc and pallidum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rodents, dopamine in the NAcc regulates appetitive maternal behaviors (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response to a salient event, dopamine in the NAcc releases the pallidum from GABA inhibition to disinhibit (or activate) motor pathways that execute appetitive behavior toward the pups (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this study, linking human behavioral synchronization to dopamine, join the rodent literature and mark dopaminergic function in the NAcc and pallidum as a regulatory pathway of appetitive bonding behavior in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The infants films are salient social stimuli that elicit striatal dopamine responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike high-synchrony mothers, low-synchrony mothers showed increased dopamine responses in the unfamiliar-infant condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation for this finding could be the novelty of the unfamiliar infant (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, in synchronous mothers dopamine responses to the mothers own infant are stronger than those to a novel infant, possibly because the mothers own infant is extremely salient to her (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the clinical realm, such salience-specificity is known as primary maternal preoccupation (23), which describes a mothers complete focus on her infant while disregarding all distractions (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low maternal preoccupation is linked to PPD and nonsynchronous parenting (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our sample none of the mothers had a psychiatric diagnosis; however, low-synchrony mothers did not show differential dopamine responses that favor their own infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of a differential response could represent a relative deficit in their infant saliency with regard to other infants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, beyond increased saliency, the dopaminergic patterns measured here might represent the selectivity of maternal attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primate mothers and sheep show a selective bonding to their own young (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, D2 receptors in the NAcc are important for the formation of selective social bonds (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, in humans the increased D2-mediated dopaminergic responses in the NAcc in the own-infant condition as compared with an unfamiliar-infant condition may reflect the involvement of D2 receptors in a mothers selective attachment to her own child.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study reports a finding for a second key element in human maternal bonding: the medial amygdala network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that the strength of connectivity within the medial amygdala network is a reliable predictor for social affiliation (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results extend those findings by demonstrating that the network is specifically involved in maternal bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our results extend previous studies on the neural basis of maternal bonding (4, 6) by showing that bonding behavior relies not on the discrete function of the NAcc, amygdala, and mPFC (3) but instead on the synchronous firing in these regions as a network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medial amygdala network includes the medialrostral hypothalamus (6), which contains the medial preoptic area (MPOA) (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MPOA has a dominant role in maternal behavior in every mammalian species examined experimentally (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides evidence for the involvement of this region in human bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This evidence helps integrate animal and human studies conceptually and suggests that homologous striatal circuitry has evolved to include broader neural connections with the human cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medial amygdala network possibly supports synchronous affiliation by coordinating two functions: reward and mentalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synchrony appeared to be intrinsically rewarding to humans and nonhuman primates and to activate reward circuitry (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to reward, synchrony relies on mentalization (i.e., the ability to represent the partners intentions and anticipate behavior) (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medial amygdala network includes subcortical reward regions, such as the NAcc, hypothalamus, and amygdala, which are potentially important for motivating and regulating behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The network also includes cortical regions, such as the vmPFC, sgACC, and PCC, which are consistently reported to support mentalization (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the subcortical and cortical regions, and particularly the connectivity between them, promote synchronous bonding by coordinating cortical circuitry that supports mentalization to striatal reward circuitry that supports behavioral regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linking behavior to dopamine in cortical regions of the medial amygdala network extends the contribution of this study beyond the rodent literature because it marks a possible role for dopamine in the higher social cognition needed for human bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous findings have suggested a possible mechanistic role for dopamine in intrinsic network function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, several studies showed that patients with Parkinsons disease, who suffer from a dopaminergic deficiency, have abnormal default-mode network connectivity, which is restored after treatment with the dopaminergic precursor l-dopa (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In healthy humans, l-dopa increased the connectivity in several networks, and the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol decreased the connectivity in those networks (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This evidence converges with the results of this report to support a possible role for dopamine in network regulation and thus in human cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding could have important implications for neuropathologies of the dopaminergic system, including Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, addiction (30), and possibly social dysfunction and PPD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analysis of plasma oxytocin yielded intriguing results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxytocin, which is considered a prosocial hormone (2), was negatively correlated to the medial amygdala network, which is considered a prosocial network (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal models revealed that central oxytocin projections from the hypothalamus to the striatum have both inhibitory and excitatory pathways affecting dopaminergic receptors in the NAcc and amygdala [summarized in figure 3 from Numan and Young (2)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The negative correlation between oxytocin and the medial amygdala network requires further investigation of the oxytocindopamine interplay in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Studying postpartum mothers in a behavioral PET-fMRI paradigm involved some limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mothers responses to their own infants were compared with their responses to unfamiliar infants and are thus relative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies should administer an additional control condition measuring baseline levels of raclopride BPnd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, previous studies have observed both left and right NAcc involvement in maternal synchronization, but this study only observed the right NAcc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies suggest a role for D2 asymmetry in motivation, with D2 receptors in the right hemisphere involved in behavioral regulation, which is important for synchrony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future mechanistic studies should evaluate a possible lateralization in striatal function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, animal models do not show that dopamine acts in the pallidum to regulate maternal behavior, but there is strong evidence that dopamine acts on the MPOA to stimulate rodent maternal behavior (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human medialrostral hypothalamus, where the MPOA is located (26), is medially adjacent to the pallidum, so it is possible that the pallidal dopamine observed here actually reflects dopamine transmission into the rostral hypothalamus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future investigation of the rostral hypothalamus in human bonding, using neuroimaging with improved spatial resolution, is of high importance because of this brain areas homology to rodents MPOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these methods are inherently correlational and cannot provide information about the causal nature of the reported relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our study focused on positive interactive behavior and did not model maternal dopamine responses to an infants distress, a subject for future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although motherinfant synchrony associated with maternal dopamine responses across ages, age could account for some neural variability and may be an important aspect to consider in future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The evidence reported here encourages future research on the neurochemistry of human bonding, including additional neurotransmitters such as central oxytocin and opioids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our results may be useful for clinical research testing the involvement of dopamine and the medial amygdala network in PPD and developmental psychopathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dopamine within the medial amygdala network potentially promotes human bonding and thus could play a considerable role in optimal human development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nineteen mothers (age range 2142 y) and their infants (age range 424 mo) completed the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants had no psychiatric history and were not breastfeeding or pregnant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board approved the study, and all mothers signed an informed consent before participating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During a visit to a subjects home, study staff collected video recordings of the mother and the infant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mothers were then invited to participate in two consecutive PET-fMRI scans during which the mother viewed films of her own infant and an unfamiliar infant, in changing order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While lying in the scanner, mothers passively watched footage of infants playing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimuli included a 20-min movie of their own infant during solitary play followed by a 5-min rest and then a 20-min movie of the unfamiliar infant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radiotracer was injected 10 min into the first film, and PET data collection continued for 90 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the second scan, mothers watched the same components of the stimuli with the order of the infants reversed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial order of the movies was randomized across participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Combined_PET-fMRI_Scanner  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PET data were acquired using the Siemens BrainPET scanner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prototype device consists of a head-only PET insert (BrainPET) that fits in the bore of the 3-T Total Imaging Matrix Trio MRI scanner (Siemens Healthcare).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the 192 BrainPET detector modules consists of a 12 × 12 array of 2.5 × 2.5 × 20 mm lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) crystals read out by a 3 × 3 array of magnetic field-insensitive avalanche photodiodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A PET-compatible circularly polarized (CP) transmittal coil and an eight-channel receive array coil were used to acquire the MR data simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MRI_and_fMRI  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structural data were acquired using a T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with a gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence [repetition time (TR) = 2,530 ms, echo time (TE) = 1.63 ms, inversion time (TI) = 1,200 ms, flip angle = 7°, and 1-mm isotropic voxels].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MRI data analysis was performed using FreeSurfer (surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) and included unpacking, reconstruction, motion correction, intensity normalization, spatial normalization, white matter segmentation, registration, segmentation, and labeling of cortical and subcortical structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For intrinsic connectivity analysis, whole-brain fMRI data were acquired with an echo-planar sequence during 6-min resting-state periods (TR = 3,000 ms; TE = 30 ms; 3.0-mm isotropic voxels, 47 slices).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze the resting-state fMRI data, a temporal bandpass filter removed frequencies  greater than 0.08 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the intrinsic functional connectivity strength of the medial amygdala network, we created spherical volumes around the right medial amygdala seed and the rest of the nodes (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (For a complete list of the bilateral network coordinates Table S2.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each participant, we computed pairwise correlation coefficients between the mean BOLD signal time course of the medial amygdala seed and every target region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pairwise correlation coefficient values were averaged in each hemisphere to represent a composite measure of connectivity across the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then Fishers r-to-z transformations were calculated and used to assess the correlations between the strength of intrinsic network connectivity and maternal attunement, central dopamine, and plasma oxytocin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavioral_Coding_of_MotherInfant_Synchrony  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure bonding behavior, 2-min interaction videos were coded for motherinfant synchrony by trained coders (For a detailed description of the coding scheme, Table S3) (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four categories of behavior (vocalization, gaze, affect, and touch) were coded for each dyadic partner, and then the temporal synchronization of those behaviors was computed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose to operationalize synchrony using behavioral contingencies of vocalization because vocalization is an outgoing appetitive behavior central to bonding (10, 32), which relates to dopamine (33), and can be measured accurately in both mothers and infants (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
[11C]raclopride, a selective D2 receptor antagonist, was synthesized from the O-desmethyl raclopride precursor and [11C]methyl iodide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthesis and subsequent purification by HPLC were performed according to Farde et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35) with minor modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [11C]raclopride (10.2 ± 1.67 mCi) was injected i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as a manual bolus for each scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative dopamine response (depicted in Fig 2) was indexed as [11C]raclopride BPnd(own infant)  [11C]raclopride BPnd(unfamiliar infant)] × 100/[11C]raclopride BPnd(unfamiliar infant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endogenous dopamine response in the own-infant condition (depicted in Fig 4) was indexed as [11C]raclopride BPnd(own infant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Blood for oxytocin analysis was drawn before the MR-PET scans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were spun right after extraction at 1,163 × g for 10 min and stored at 20 °C until assayed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma oxytocin was assayed at the Brigham Research Assay Core Laboratory using the Enzo Life Sciences Immunoassay ELISA Kit (catalog no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AD1-900-153A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Emission data were acquired in list-mode format for 90 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each coincidence event, the line of response joining the two crystals in which the two 511 keV photons were detected was rebinned into sinogram space using nearest neighbor approximation and axial compression (span 9 and maximum ring difference 67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sinogram consisted of 192 angular projections and 256 radial elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculation of random coincidences was performed by sorting the delayed coincidences into delayed single maps from which the total singles rate as well as the variance reduced random were estimated (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity data were acquired with a plane source scanned in 16 positions (with a 22.5° angular step), 4 h per position, and the normalization sinogram was derived from these data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The head attenuation map was generated from the MR data (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scatter coincidences sinogram was obtained using a calculated method based on the single scatter estimation method (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To correct for head motion over the duration of the scan, head motion estimates were derived offline from the MR data for all the echo planar imaging-based acquisitions and were used to correct the dynamic PET frames before image reconstruction (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, the list-mode dataset was first divided into frames of variable duration according to the pharmacokinetic protocol (i.e., 8 × 10 s, 3 × 20 s, 2 × 30 s, 1 × 60 s, 1 × 120 s, 1 × 180 s, 8 × 300 s, and 4 × 600 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motion correction was subsequently applied separately to each of these frames.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The head attenuation and scatter correction sinograms were estimated only in the reference frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The motion-corrected PET volumes corresponding to each of the frames were reconstructed using the standard Ordinary Poisson Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OP-OSEM) 3D algorithm from motion-corrected prompt and random coincidences, normalization, attenuation, and scatter coincidences sinograms using 16 subsets and six iterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reconstructed volume consisted of 153 slices with 256 × 256 pixels (1.25 × 1.25 × 1.25 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BPnd (11) of [11C]raclopride was the primary outcome measure of the PET scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BPnd refers to the radioligand molecules that are specifically attached to a neuroreceptor (as opposed to free radioligand in the tissue) and is the typical measure when using a reference tissue method (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional analyses were performed using COMKAT (40) and a reference tissue model with the timeactivity curve derived from the cerebellar cortex as a reference (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cerebellum was chosen as reference region because it does not contain specific D2 receptor-like binding sites and can be used for the determination of nonspecific binding and free radioligand in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BPnd values for all subjects were imported to SPSS for group analyses and correlated (in Pearson correlation analyses) to indices of behavioral synchrony, resting-state BOLD in the medial amygdala network, and plasma oxytocin levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
