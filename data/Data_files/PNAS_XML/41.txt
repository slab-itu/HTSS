Elevation of 20-carbon long chain bases due to a mutation in serine palmitoyltransferase small subunit b results in neurodegeneration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sphingolipids are essential in eukaryotes and are particularly important in neural tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, sphingolipids have an 18-carbon (C18) long chain base (LCB) backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, low-abundance sphingolipids containing LCBs of 16 or 20 carbons have also been discovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet their specific functions and biological significance is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work demonstrates that elevation of 20-carbon LCBs and/or sphingolipids containing C20 LCBs has detrimental neurodegenerative effects in the brain and the retina, leading to perturbation of protein homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work describes, for the first time to our knowledge, the specific pathological roles of a class of low-abundance LCBs in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sphingolipids typically have an 18-carbon (C18) sphingoid long chain base (LCB) backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although sphingolipids with LCBs of other chain lengths have been identified, the functional significance of these low-abundance sphingolipids is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LCB chain length is determined by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) isoenzymes, which are trimeric proteins composed of two large subunits (SPTLC1 and SPTLC2 or SPTLC3) and a small subunit (SPTssa or SPTssb).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the identification of an Sptssb mutation, Stellar (Stl), which increased the SPT affinity toward the C18 fatty acyl-CoA substrate by twofold and significantly elevated 20-carbon (C20) LCB production in the mutant mouse brain and eye, resulting in surprising neurodegenerative effects including aberrant membrane structures, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins on membranes, and axon degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work demonstrates that SPT small subunits play a major role in controlling SPT activity and substrate affinity, and in specifying sphingolipid LCB chain length in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our studies also suggest that excessive C20 LCBs or C20 LCB-containing sphingolipids impair protein homeostasis and neural functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Stellar_Mutation_in_Sptssb_Causes_Multiple_Pathological_Features_in_the_Central_Nervous_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Stellar mutant arose in the ABy/J background from the Translational Vision Research Models program (P.M.N.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at The Jackson Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterozygous Stellar mutants were identified by the appearance of shiny flecks in the fundus of the eye (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Classic recombination mapping followed by high-throughput sequencing of an exome capture library generated from Stellar mutants (details in Fig S1A and Methods), identified an adenine-to-thymine transversion at nucleotide 167, in the coding region of the Sptssb gene that encodes a small subunit of mammalian SPT (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutation (SptssbSt) causes a histidine-to-leucine change at amino acid 56 (H56L), in a residue that is highly conserved among vertebrates (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The homozygous Stellar eyes have a great number of shiny flecks (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the homozygotes develop early onset ataxia, exhibit reduced body weight (Fig S1C) and usually die prematurely around 10 wk after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ataxic phenotype of the mutants prompted us to examine their brains in greater detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first examined the cerebellum, a region of the brain important for motor control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As early as 2 wk after birth, abnormal neurofilament H (NF-H) accumulation was observed in the cerebellar white matter (Fig 2 A and B), typically a sign of axon degeneration (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no obvious cell death or degeneration of cerebellar neuronal somas was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar abnormal neurofilament accumulation is also present in the mutant optic nerve (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close examination of these structures by electron microscopy revealed degenerating axons filled with electron dense material and vacuoles (Fig 2 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further characterize the location and nature of the shiny flecks in the mutant fundus, we examined the retina by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and histochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OCT images illustrate numerous hyperreflective areas in the inner (IPL) and outer plexiform layers (OPL) of the mutant retina (Fig S2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is confirmed by the presence of abnormal vacuolar structures, mainly in the OPL and IPL, shown by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detail of these structures was revealed by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) as aberrant membranes (Fig 3C and Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed abnormal vacuolar structures in many regions of the brain, including the deep cerebellar nuclei, brainstem (pons and medulla), midbrain, pontine nuclei, thalamus, and isolated areas in hypothalamus, as early as 12 wk after birth (Fig 3 D and E and Fig S2 DI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abnormal vacuolar structures were also found in heterozygous Stellar mice, even at a younger age, i.e., 8 wk, but were much more sparse in both the brain and the retina compared with age-matched homozygotes, although the numbers of these structures also increased with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TEM revealed many of these aberrant structures to be in close proximity to the nucleus where the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is localized, appearing as cytoplasmic cavities with distinct delimiting membranes, at 2 wk after birth (Fig 3F and Fig S2J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 5 wk after birth, these abnormal structures were found primarily at the periphery of cells or in extracellular space (Fig S2K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ubiquitinated_Protein_Accumulation_in_Stellar_Mutant_Brains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observation of ER-associated membrane structures at the early age, e.g., 2 wk after birth, led us to hypothesize that ER functions might be impaired in Stellar mutant cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, wild-type and Stellar mutant brain sections were stained with antibodies against binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP, also known as 78kD glucose regulated protein or GRP78), an ER molecular chaperone that is normally up-regulated by the unfolded protein response upon ER stress, and for ubiquitin, which can detect ubiquitinated protein accumulation that is often associated with ER stress and proteotoxicity (20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many cells in brainstem in the 2-wk-old homozygous Stellar mutants clearly displayed BiP accumulation, indicating ER protein homeostasis might be impaired (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, widespread ubiquitinated protein accumulations were indeed observed in many brain regions (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, at 2 wk of age, the accumulated ubiquitinated proteins were localized on membranous structures, and in some cases close to the nucleus or ER (Fig 4 EH and Fig S3), indicating that they may be associated with the abnormal intracellular membrane structures that accumulate in older animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest that ER function and protein homeostasis are impaired by the Stellar mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abnormal_Membrane_Structures_Are_Largely_Neuronal  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the cell types harboring the abnormal membrane structures, cell-typespecific markers were examined on brain sections of Stellar homozygotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons and astroglia were detected by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against a neuronal marker neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) and a glia marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most abnormal membrane structures were associated NeuN-positive cells at 2 wk of age (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close examination clearly revealed that many of these structures were in the NeuN-positive cells, suggesting that these structures were at least in a subset of neurons (Fig 5 A and B, Insets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abnormal structures were also present in areas enriched with GFAP-positive cells (Fig 5C), but it is unclear whether they were associated with glia solely based on GFAP stain, due to the branching staining pattern of glia cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to further determine the localization of these structures, we stained brain sections with a ubiquitin antibody and an antibody against NeuN or GFAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the ubiquitin-positive deposits were in general associated with NeuN-positive neurons (Fig 5 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close examination clearly showed that there were intraneuronal ubiquitin-positive membrane-like structures (Fig 5 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, these ubiquitin-positive structures were never found inside GFAP-positive cells (Fig S4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that the abnormal membrane-like structures are mainly in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the pathology observed is intrinsically neuronal, we examined the expression of Sptssb in the brain, by taking advantage of a Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP2) Sptssb knockout mouse strain in which a lacZ gene in the knockout cassette is under the control of the Sptssb promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We stained the SptssbKO/+ heterozygous mouse brain with X-gal to show the -galactosidase expression (Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-gal stain was found highest in thalamus and pontine nuclei, and also pronounced in spinal cord, brainstem (medulla and pons), deep cerebellar nuclei, midbrain, fields of Forel and mammillary nuclei in the hypothalamus, and periform cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, X-gal stain was very low or nonexistent in other regions, such as cerebellar cortex, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the brain regions showing expression of Sptssb, or X-galpositive, coincide with the regions harboring abnormal membrane structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further examined the cell-type identity of Sptssb-positive cells in the SptssbKO/+ heterozygous brain by performing immunohistochemistry following X-gal staining, using NeuN and GFAP antibodies that label neurons and glia, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most X-galpositive cells were also NeuN-positive (Fig 5 JL, Fig S4 EG, and detail shown in Fig 5 MO), although occasionally a small number of X-galpositive cells were NeuN-negative (Fig 5 PR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, X-gal stain-positive cells were rarely GFAP-positive (Fig S4 HJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that Sptssb is mainly expressed in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Collectively, our results suggest that the abnormal membrane structures were largely associated with neurons in which Sptssb was expressed, indicating that the effect of the Sptssb mutation is most likely intrinsic to neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Stellar_Mutation_Caused_Elevation_of_C20_LCB_Biosynthesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because Sptssb encodes a small subunit of SPT, to test if the Stellar mutation affected the chain-length composition of LCBs and sphingolipids with different LCBs in vivo, we performed sphingolipid profiling using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the heterozygous SptssbStl/+ and homozygous SptssbStl/Stl brains, steady-state levels of sphingolipids with C18 LCBs, such as C18 sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and a few ceramide species containing C18 sphingosine, were modestly increased or unchanged (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the levels of C20 sphingosine increased by 2- to 3-fold in the homozygotes and about 1-fold in the heterozygotes (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, C20 S1P increased 1-fold in the homozygous SptssbStl/Stl brains (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, the level of ceramide with C20 sphingosine was also elevated, but not all of the ceramide species exhibited the same magnitude of change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the ceramide species with C20 sphingosine, the ceramide with C18 fatty acyl group (C18:0 and C18:1 ceramide, or formally called d20/C18:0 and d20/C18:1 ceramide, respectively) displayed the most dramatic change of more than 15-fold (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a similar increase of C20 LCBs and ceramides with C20 LCBs but not C18 LCBs and ceramides with C18 LCBs in the eye (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude, therefore, that the Stellar mutation is either a hyperactive or constitutively active allele of Sptssb that primarily promotes the synthesis of low-abundance C20 LCBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the difference of C20 LCB levels in the brain parallels the phenotypic severity in heterozygous and homozygous brains, indicating that there is a dosage effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then set out to measure the SPT enzymatic activity in the mouse brain using microsomes prepared from wild-type and mutant Sptssb brain homogenates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SptssbStl/Stl brains displayed a minor increase of SPT activity compared with the wild-type brains when the C16 palmitoyl-CoA was used as the fatty acyl-CoA substrate (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the C18 stearoyl-CoA was used as the fatty acyl-CoA substrate, the SPT activity in the SptssbStl/Stl brains is about onefold higher than that in the wild-type brains (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that the Stellar mutation of Sptssb indeed increases SPT activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether the mutation in SPTssb affected the affinity of the SPT complex toward the C18 fatty acyl-CoA substrate and/or promoted formation of an active SPT complex, we performed enzyme kinetics analyses with brain microsomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results showed that the affinity of the SPT complex with a mutant SPTssb has two times higher affinity (50% lower Kx, based on Hills equation, equivalent to Km in MichaelisMenten kinetics) toward the substrate (Fig 7 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total amount of the active SPT complex (measured by Vmax) was slightly increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data show that C18 fatty acyl-CoA substrate affinity is increased in the mutant compared with the wild type, suggesting that the Sptssb mutation is a gain-of-function mutation mainly resulting in higher substrate affinity of SPT, ultimately leading to increased C20 LCB production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Research in recent years has found that SPT can produce LCBs other than the commonly known C18 LCB, but in vivo LCB profiles have been missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, it was largely unknown whether different LCBs possess specific molecular functions and pathogenic roles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide a clear snapshot of the LCB content in the nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the brain and the eye, amounts of C20 LCBs, though lower than levels of C18 LCBs, are not negligible under the normal physiological condition in adult wild-type mouse brain and the eye, indicating that this class of LCBs may have physiological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, C20 LCBs were first found in some ganglioside species in the mammalian brains and were shown to increase with age (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results clearly demonstrate that unregulated production of C20 LCBs is detrimental, leading to axon degeneration and aberrant accumulation of membrane structures (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More interestingly, ubiquitin-positive proteins are deposited on these abnormal membrane structures (Fig 4 and Fig S3), indicating that protein homeostasis, i.e., membrane protein targeting and/or degradation, is impaired by excessive C20 LCB-containing sphingolipids in Stellar mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase of C20 LCBs in the Stellar mutant (SptssbH56L) tissues also suggests that under physiological conditions, the full processing capacity of SPT complexes containing wild-type SPTssb is suppressed, supporting the idea that C20 LCBs and C20 LCB-containing sphingolipids have important functions and their production is regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, it is unknown whether the suppression of SPT activity can be achieved solely through regulation by the ORM family proteins, or other mechanisms could also be in play (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact mechanism of this suppression will be addressed in future studies, but as our kinetics data suggest, SPTssb is likely involved in regulating SPT complex affinity toward the C18 fatty acyl-CoA substrate, and the H56L mutation increases the intrinsic catalytic activity or reduces negative regulation of the SPT heterotrimer by increasing the affinity toward an otherwise low concentration substrate (Fig 7 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been demonstrated in budding yeast that heat shock leads to a spike of LCB biosynthesis, causing a moderate increase of C18 LCBs and a dramatic increase of C20 LCB levels (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elevation of LCBs is essential for activation of signal transduction pathways required for heat stress adaptation (24, 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the biological significance of having different LCB chains in both the yeast mammalian cells is still not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, our results in mammalian eye and brain provide critical support to the functional significance of the emerging complexity of bioactive sphingolipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Experiments using mice have been approved by The Jackson Laboratorys Animal Care and Use Committee according to national and international guidelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mouse_Strains  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ABy/J-Stellar mutant was identified as an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutation from the Translational Vision Research Models Program (P.M.N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), and maintained by mating between heterozygous and wild-type siblings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Sptssb knockout mouse, C57BL6/N(Cg)-Sptssbtm1b(KOMP)Mbp/J, was obtained from the KOMP2 consortium at The Jackson Laboratory and maintained by crossing between heterozygous siblings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genome_Mapping_and_High-Throughput_Genome_Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For genome mapping, heterozygous mutant Stellar mice of the ABy/J background were outcrossed with C57BL/6J mice and affected F1 mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutants, with retinal flecks, were detected after dilation of pupils with 1% atropine using a Heine Omega 500 indirect ophthalmoscope with a 60-diopter aspheric lens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An initial genome scan was performed with backcrossed mice using polymorphic microsatellite markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional markers were used to refine the map position to a minimal interval of 12 cM on chromosome 3 (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For high-throughput sequencing, high-quality genomic DNA was prepared from heterozygous mutant mice for exome capture and sequencing with an Illumina HiSeq2500.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequencing reads within the confidence interval were filtered against known polymorphisms between C57BL/6J and ABy/J strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genotyping_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Allele-specific genotyping of the Stellar mice was done by PCR using annealing temperature at 65 °C, with primers LZO110 (5-CGTGAAGGAGTATTTTGCCT-3), LZO111 (5-CCACATATTTTGGAGAACCTTCCCAAGCCAGGCGGTTGA-3), and LZO112 (5-AATTCCCAAGCCAGGCGGATCT-3) at ratio 4:1:3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wild-type and the mutant PCR products are 174 bp and 192 bp, respectively, and were separated on a 3.5% (wt/vol) MetaPhor agarose gel by electrophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping of Sptssbtm1b(KOMP)Mbp mice was performed according to the protocol on The Jackson Laboratory website (jaxmice.jax.org/protocolsdb/f?p=116:2:0::NO:2:P2_MASTER_PROTOCOL_ID,P2_JRS_CODE:12164,023424).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Histology_and_Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histology and immunohistochemistry were conducted as described (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, mice were perfused intracardically with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and brains postfixed before dehydration and embedding in paraffin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For immunohistochemistry, 5-µm sections were subjected to antigen retrieval in boiling 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6), followed by incubation at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies in PBS with 0.03% Triton X-100 and 5% (vol/vol) normal donkey serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, 1:200) were used for fluorescent detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were treated with 0.01% Sudan Black in 70% (vol/vol) ethanol to quench autofluorescence before counterstaining with DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For X-gal staining, mice were perfused intracardically with 2% (wt/vol) polyformaldehyde and postfixed for 1 h. Brains were either embedded in 5% (wt/vol) low melting point agarose and cut as 100-µm sections using Vibratome (Leica) or immersed in sucrose series, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT, and cut as 10-µm sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining was performed as described (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After X-gal staining, selected 10-µm sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry using antibodies against NeuN and GFAP, respectively, followed by incubation with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated ExtrAvidin, and (3,3)-diaminobenzidine stain as described (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Goat polyclonal anti-GRP78/BiP antibody (Santa Cruz, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sc-1050), rabbit polyclonal anti-BiP antibody (Cell Signaling, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3177), and rabbit polyclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (DAKO, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Z0458) were used at a 1:200 dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (Cell Signaling, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3936) was used at a 1:800 dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament-H (cat no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2826) and neurofilament-M (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2838) were purchased from Cell Signaling and used at a 1:200 dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against NeuN (Abcam, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  177487) and GFAP (DAKO, cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Z0334) was used 1:500.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorophor-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Life Technologies and used at 1:200 dilutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were perfused intracardically with a solution containing 1.2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde and 0.8% glutaraldehyde, and brains were processed for transmission electron micrography using a standard procedure (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lipid_Extraction_and_Analyses_of_Sphingolipids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electron spray ionization (ESI)/MS/MS analysis of endogenous sphingosine bases, sphingoid base-1-phosphates, and ceramide species (C18-sphingoid base) was performed on a Thermo Fisher TSQ Quantum triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, operating in a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) positive ionization mode, using a protocol modified from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, cell pellets corresponding to about 13 × 106 cells or brain homogenates corresponding to exactly 1.5 mg of protein [i.e., half brains homogenized in 20 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mM KCL, 2 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche), using a Tissue Tearor homogenizer (Biospec Products)] were fortified with internal standards (C17 d-erythro-sphingosine or C17 Sph), C17 sphingosine-1-phosphate (C17 Sph-1P), N-palmitoyl-d-erythro-C13 sphingosine (C13/C16-Cer), and heptadecanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C18/C17 Cer), and extracted with an ethyl acetate/isopropanol/water (60/30/10 vol/vol) solvent system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After evaporation and reconstitution in 100 L of 1 mM ammonium formate in 0.2% formic acid in methanol, samples were injected into the HP1100/TSQ Quantum LC/MS system and gradient eluted from the BDS Hypersil C8, 150 × 3.2 mm, 3-m particle size column, with 1.0 mM methanolic ammonium formate/2 mM aqueous ammonium formate mobile phase system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peaks corresponding to the target analytes and internal standards were collected and processed using the Xcalibur software system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitative analysis was based on the calibration curves generated by spiking an artificial matrix with the known amounts of the target analyte synthetic standards and an equal amount of the internal standards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target analyte/internal standard peak-area ratios were plotted against analyte concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target analyte/internal standard peak-area ratios from the samples were similarly normalized to their respective internal standards and compared with the calibration curves, using a linear regression model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sphingoid bases and their ceramide derivatives with 20-carbon atoms in the LCB, for which no synthetic standards are available, were quantitated using calibration curves of their C18 counterparts, taking advantage of the fragmentation pattern that is conserved for all (C13, C16, C17, C18, and C20) LCBs and their ceramide derivatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying consistent mass spectral conditions of collision assistant dissociation (CAD); 35 eV and ESI, all sphingoid bases and related ceramides undergo uniform transition from initial molecular ion (M+1) to the respective sphingoid backbone secondary ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, calibration curves, generated from authentic standards of the typical, C18-sphingosine and ceramides, can be used for quantitation of other, e.g., C20, counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phosphate contents of the lipid extracts were used to normalize the MS measurements of eye sphingolipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphate contents of the eye lipid extracts were measured with a standard curve analysis and a colorimetric assay of ashed phosphate (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microsomal_Membrane_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Brain tissue was homogenized in buffer containing 10% (vol/vol) glycerol, 50 mM Tris (7.5), 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM ME, 1 mM PMSF, 1 g/mL aprotinin, 1 g/mL pepstatin A, 1 g/mL leupeptin, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate using a 15-mL potter homogenizer for 1520 strokes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was spun at 100,000 × g for 45 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pellet was homogenized in 20 mL of the above buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting pellet was homogenized in 0.51.0 mL of 30% (vol/vol) glycerol, 50 mM Tris (7.5), 1 mM ME, 1 mM EGTA, 1 g/mL aprotinin, 1 g/mL pepstatin A, and 1 g/mL leupeptin and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SPT_Assay_Using_Brain_Microsomes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reaction was started by adding 200 µg of microsomal membrane to a reaction mixture (final volume 300 µL) containing 50 mM Hepes (8.1), 20 µM BSA, 50 µM pyridoxal phosphate, 3 µM serine, 20 µCi 3H serine, and the indicated concentration of palmitoyl- or stearoyl-CoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the 20-min reaction time, NH4OH to a final 0.25 M was added, followed by the addition of 1.5 mL of CHCl3:methanol (1:2), and vortexed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long chain bases were extracted by adding 1 mL CHCl3 and 2 mL of 0.5 M NH4OH, vortexing and centrifuging briefly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper aqueous layer was aspirated off and the lower layer was washed with 2 mL of 30 mM KCl and centrifuged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The washing was carried out three times and 0.83 mL of the sample was dried and counted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All numeric data except the enzyme kinetics data were graphed with GraphPad Prism 6 and statistical analyses were performed using unpaired t test, or one-way ANOVA with multiple comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzyme kinetics studies were plotted and analyzed by using the kinetics mode of the SigmaPlot software (SYSTAT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
