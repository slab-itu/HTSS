title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exon skipping of FcRI eliminates expression of the high-affinity IgE receptor in mast cells with therapeutic potential for allergy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We identified an innovative use for the technique of antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping to specifically target and down-regulate IgE receptor expression in mast cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exon skipping is typically used as part of personalized medicine, where a mutant exon is skipped after sequencing the patients affected genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach, however, targets a nonmutated gene and an exon that is critical for surface IgE receptor expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It does not require a personalized approach with genetic sequencing or multiple iterations of oligonucleotides that would require clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the diseases to be treated with this technology are ideal for local delivery of the oligonucleotides by aerosols or topical cream formulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Allergic diseases are driven by activation of mast cells and release of mediators in response to IgE-directed antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are no drugs currently available that can specifically down-regulate mast cell function in vivo when chronically administered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe an innovative approach for targeting mast cells in vitro and in vivo using antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping of the -subunit of the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcRI) to eliminate surface high-affinity IgE receptor (FcRI) expression and function, rendering mast cells unresponsive to IgE-mediated activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As FcRI expression is restricted to mast cells and basophils, this approach would selectively target these cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the success of exon skipping in clinical trials to treat genetic diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, we propose that exon skipping of FcRI is a potential approach for mast cell-specific treatment of allergic diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Loss_of_FcRI_with_FcRI_Exon_Skipping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first tested whether AONs could be efficiently transfected into mast cells using a control 25-mer FITC-conjugated morpholino AON in primary mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We achieved  greater than 95% efficiency in mouse BMMCs at 24 h (Fig 1 A and B) with no evidence of cytotoxicity as determined by propidium iodide staining (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The naturally occurring truncation of MS4A2 exon 3 leads to loss of the first two transmembrane domains of FcRI resulting in the expression of t-FcRI that does not traffic to the plasma membrane nor associate with FcRI (9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we predicted that skipping exon 3 of MS4A2 following FcRI AON treatment would result in preferential production of t-FcRI instead of FL FcRI as well as loss of expression of surface FcRI, which is dependent on FL FcRI (9, 1214).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attempted to induce exon skipping with AONs designed to target Ms4a2 exon 3 at the intronexon boundary and identified that FcRI AONs dose-dependently induced exon skipping of FcRI mRNA as indicated by RT-PCR compared with cells transfected with an equivalent 25-mer standard control AON (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether exon skipping leads to loss of surface expression of FcRI, we used flow cytometry to measure surface FcRI expression in mouse BMMCs and found that it was reduced after 10 µM FcRI AON treatment by 95.6 ± 0.4% (n = 5; P less_than 0.001) (Fig 1D), thus virtually eliminating FcRI expression (efficiency of transfection was 95%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the exon-skipping data (Fig 1C), the effects of FcRI AONs on surface FcRI expression were also dose dependent (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Degranulation_and_Calcium_Influx  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In view of the loss of surface FcRI expression with FcRI AON transfection, we tested whether there were corresponding reductions in responses to antigen in BMMCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a dose-dependent decrease in degranulation in response to DNP with increasing concentrations of FcRI AON, and degranulation was eliminated with 10 µM FcRI AON (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One micromolar FcRI AON resulted in 80% reduction in surface FcRI expression (Fig 1C) whereas the reduction in degranulation was lower (25%), although significant (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible explanation for this finding is that the number of FcRI receptors and signaling capacity appears to exceed the requirements for degranulation, an explanation in agreement with studies reported in RBL-2H3 mast cells (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although FcRI numbers vary during the cell cycle (24) and among different mast cell types, with estimates from 130,000 in human lung mast cells (25) to 290,000 per cell in RBL-2H3 cells (23) and 120,000380,000 in human cord blood-derived mast cell/basophil cultures (26), it is likely that mast cells in general harbor surplus FcRI as significant degranulation is observed with aggregation of a few hundred receptors (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The specificity of FcRI AON treatment was next determined by its effect on thapsigargin-induced degranulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although FcRI-dependent degranulation was eliminated in BMMCs, thapsigargin-induced degranulation was unaffected by FcRI exon skipping (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found the same pattern for calcium mobilization with robust inhibition of the calcium signal in response to FcRI aggregation whereas the response to thapsigargin was unaffected (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with thapsigargin, IgE-mediated calcium influx is dependent upon store-operated calcium entry (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, FcRI exon skipping appears to selectively target IgE-dependent activation without disrupting cell responses to other stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Signaling__Cytokine_Release__and_Migration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the effects of FcRI exon skipping in BMMCs on cell signaling events that regulate both degranulation and de novo cytokine synthesis and in particular whether residual weak signals that fail to stimulate degranulation were still sufficient to induce synthesis of cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected from the diminished calcium signal, we found no significant FcRI-mediated phosphorylation of PLC1 with FcRI AON transfection, and unlike FcRI-mediated activation, thapsigargin does not induce phosphorylation and acts independently of PLC (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of AKT and ERK are more distal signals than PLC1 phosphorylation, but phosphorylation of both of AKT and ERK were also markedly reduced by FcRI exon skipping (Fig 3 A, C, and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to PLC1, the AKT and ERK pathways are activated by thapsigargin, but neither AKT nor ERK phosphorylation was affected by FcRI exon skipping (Fig 3 A, C, and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Low-level activation of mast cells can result in the production of cytokines without evidence of acute signaling events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such example is IgE alone, which did not elicit rapid phosphorylation of PLC1, AKT, or ERK (Fig 3 AD), but did cause release of the cytokine GM-CSF after 6 h (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, this release, as well as that induced by IgE plus antigen to induce FcRI aggregation, was blocked by FcRI exon skipping without affecting thapsigargin-induced GM-CSF release in BMMCs (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also examined the effects of exon skipping on antigen-mediated BMMC migration (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard control AON-treated BMMCs that were sensitized with IgE migrated toward antigen (DNP-BSA), but FcRI AON-treated BMMCs did not (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, BMMC migration mediated through KIT, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF) was not reduced and if anything it was enhanced by FcRI exon skipping, although not to a statistically significant extent (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data indicate that FcRI exon skipping selectively and substantially abrogates FcRI-dependent responses in BMMCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Survival_and_Proliferation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the classical view that IgE binding to FcRI on mast cells primes mast cells for activation by bivalent/multivalent antigens, it is now recognized that IgE binding to FcRI leads to activation of mast cells to release prosurvival cytokines that maintain viability of the cells (2931).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of external supporting cytokines, mast cells rapidly undergo apoptosis, which is suppressed by the addition of IgE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, elevation of tissue IgE during allergic diseases, such as the lung in asthma or the skin in AD, could contribute to increased mast cell numbers by promoting cytokine release and mast cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore tested whether FcRI exon skipping would also eliminate the prosurvival effect of IgE on mast cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BMMCs were deprived of the culture growth-promoting cytokine, IL-3, for 24 h after transfection with AONs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the course of 72 h, IgE almost completely protected mast cells from cell death and apoptosis after withdrawal of IL-3 in control AON-treated BMMCs (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, treatment of BMMCs with FcRI AON, which resulted in loss of surface FcRI expression (Fig S1), eliminated the protective effect of IgE after IL-3 withdrawal (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent decrease in FcRI expression in the presence of IgE we believe reflects the decreased affinity of MAR-1 for FcRI once it is occupied by IgE (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, FcRI exon skipping could potentially suppress the prosurvival effect of elevated IgE in vivo and thus the increase in mast cell population as well as reduce IgE-dependent degranulation in allergic disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the effects of FcRI exon skipping (day 0) on mast cell proliferation in the presence of IL-3, while monitoring both surface FcRI expression (Fig S2) and proliferation using a CellTrace Violet dilution assay (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the proliferation occurred between day 5 and day 7 with a population of cells appearing with diluted CellTrace dye at day 7 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no difference in proliferation in the absence or presence of FcRI exon skipping at either 5 or 7 d. There was a population of BMMCs treated with FcRI AON that began to express FcRI on the surface at day 7, despite all of the cells at day 5 being negative for surface FcRI (Fig S2), suggesting that these cells were regaining FcRI expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gating the populations of cells based on surface FcRI expression and plotting CellTrace Violet fluorescence demonstrated that the cells expressing surface FcRI were the cells that had proliferated (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data most likely indicate that, although overall proliferation is not affected by FcRI AON treatment, BMMCs that do proliferate dilute the FcRI AON between daughter cells, thus reducing exon-skipping efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Passive_Cutaneous_Anaphylaxis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As proof-of-concept of therapeutic utility, we sought evidence that the FcRI exon-skipping approach is effective in vivo, having in mind the possibility of delivering FcRI AONs locally to affected tissues in allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localized administration of FcRI AON would take advantage of its specificity toward FcRI-mediated responses and restrict targeting to mast cells in the affected tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used the well-established model of passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) to test the efficacy of localized delivery of the AONs by means of the Vivo-Morpholino AONs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this approach, we observed a partial but substantial reduction in PCA reaction with administration of FcRI AON compared with control AON (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of total RNA isolated from skin adjacent to the injected ears by qualitative RT-PCR revealed that the administration of FcRI AON had resulted in exon skipping in vivo (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency of exon skipping in vivo was less than that observed in BMMC cultures, which is consistent with the partial reduction in the PCA reaction compared with near-complete block of degranulation in BMMCs (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that, in this PCA model, as in cell culture, FcRI receptors are saturated with DNP-specific IgE, whereas in a naturally occurring allergic disease only a minor fraction of receptors may be occupied by an allergen-specific IgE and thus could be more susceptible to FcRI exon-skipping therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_Allergic_Dermatitis_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As further evidence of therapeutic potential for FcRI AON administration, we used an established allergic dermatitis model using toluenediisocyanate (TDI) to sensitize the mice as described in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FcRI AON or standard control AON were injected into the ears either after sensitization and before TDI challenge (Fig S3) or with once-weekly injections for 4 wk during sensitization to demonstrate improvement over time (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these models, we were able to assess both the immediate and late-phase allergic responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the immediate response at 1 h postchallenge and the late-phase response at 24 h postchallenge were markedly reduced after weekly injections of FcRI AON compared with standard control AON (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 24 h postchallenge, we performed histological analysis of the ears for inflammation by assessing cellular influx and edema in the H&E-stained skin sections and identified a significant reduction in inflammation with FcRI AON treatment (Fig 5 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured inflammatory cytokines in the ear skin 24 h postchallenge and found markedly reduced levels with FcRI AON treatment compared with standard control AON-treated mice (Fig 5 DG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were observed if FcRI AON treatment was administered after the mice were sensitized (Fig S3), although the efficacy was less than in mice receiving five injections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that FcRI AON treatment reduces both early and late-phase inflammatory responses in a TDI-induced allergic dermatitis model and that repeated administration of FcRI AONs could have prophylactic potential for treating allergic inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proof-of-Principle_in_Human_Mast_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To confirm that the findings in our mouse models translate to humans, we next tested whether exon skipping of FcRI resulted in reduced FcRI expression and IgE-dependent degranulation in human mast cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The human MS4A2 gene contains AT-rich regions in the splicing donor or acceptor sites at the intronexon or exonintron boundaries of exon 3 reducing RNA binding affinity of AONs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for human mast cells, we could achieve exon skipping, but with less efficiency than with BMMCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection of LAD-2 cells with an FcRI AON resulted in around 75% exon skipping as demonstrated by reduction in FL FcRI mRNA assessed with quantitative RT-PCR (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This degree of exon skipping resulted in a significant reduction in surface FcRI expression of 50% (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next confirmed that the reduction in FcRI surface expression with FcRI AON transfection resulted in reduced IgE-dependent degranulation by cross-linking biotinylated IgE with streptavidin and identified a significant reduction in IgE-dependent degranulation (Fig 6C) without observing any change in thapsigargin-induced degranulation (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data demonstrate that FcRI AONs act comparably in human mast cells as they do in mouse mast cells, although further refinement and screening of human constructs is required to achieve optimal exon skipping in human mast cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Current treatments for allergic diseases generally rely upon neutralizing the effects of inflammatory mediators or dampening of the inflammatory response with steroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more desirable approach would be to suppress release or production of inflammatory mediators by targeting the principal effector immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting mast cell FcRI signaling pathways has been suggested given the preeminent role played by this cell and receptor in allergic disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the same kinases and signaling molecules are used by other receptors in various immune cells, and targeting these signaling molecules is unlikely to achieve the required specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting FcRI directly by inhibiting binding of IgE to FcRI is problematic because cross-linking FcRI with anti-FcRI antibodies mimics activation by antigen-inducing anaphylactic degranulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An approach with some clinical success is the use of omalizumab, a humanized anti-IgE antibody that binds to the Fc fragment of IgE, blocking its binding to FcRI (for review, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because omalizumab binds to IgE directly, it does not activate mast cells or interact with FcRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a potential limitation is that other cells, such as dendritic cells (3335), express a trimeric form of FcRI (lacking FcRI expression) that functions in antigen presentation where IgE binding to trimeric FcRI may have immunoregulatory functions to dampen allergic responses (3436).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the purpose of achieving selective targeting of mast cells and avoiding the limitations of previous therapies, the FcRI subunit appeared to be one promising candidate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetrameric FcRI contains  and  subunits associated with dimeric  subunits, whereas trimeric FcRI consists of just the  and dimeric  subunits (12, 33, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, expression of tetrameric FcRI is restricted to mast cells and basophils, whereas trimeric FcRI that lack FcRI are expressed on dendritic and other cell types (12, 3335).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to being exclusively located in mast cells and basophils, FcRI is critically required for trafficking of FcRI to the cell surface in mast cells (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although FcRI has been considered as a mast cell-specific target in recent years (9, 10, 12, 38), the problem was how to effectively target FcRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delivery of siRNA or shRNA to silence FcRI is not totally effective in mast cells even with use of lentiviral delivery techniques and results in 5080% reduction of protein expression (9, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore considered the innovative approach of forcing the cell to produce an alternative splice variant of FcRI (t-FcRI) that does not associate with FcRI or FcRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current study indicates that this approach works efficiently by eliminating surface FcRI expression and function, rendering mast cells completely unresponsive to IgE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has significant implications on not only immediate mast cell activation and the wheal and flare reaction, but also on cytokine release and the late-phase allergic response, which we demonstrate is also reduced in an allergic dermatitis in vivo model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, because IgE and FcRI act as prosurvival and chemoattractant factors for mast cells (28, 40), AON-induced exon skipping of FcRI might reduce mast cell numbers in affected tissues by reducing mast cell recruitment and survival, thus increasing the efficacy of the drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are currently examining this in chronic allergy models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we demonstrate FcRI exon skipping in vivo as a proof-of-concept for further development of AON-mediated altered splicing of FcRI as a therapeutic approach for allergic diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our studies provide important proof-of-concept data for developing AON-induced exon skipping of FcRI as a therapeutic and/or preventative treatment for allergic diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro and in vivo mouse studies demonstrate surprisingly potent efficacy in vitro with a knockout effect and a more variable, but still impressive effectiveness in vivo with some mice exhibiting no histological evidence of inflammation 24 h after TDI challenge in the allergic dermatitis model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we demonstrate that efficient exon skipping can be achieved in skin mast cells in vivo, a limitation is that effective delivery of AONs into mast cells in skin is limited by diffusion of drug within the skin and the surface area of skin that can be infiltrated by intradermal injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systemically administered AONs distribute poorly into the skin and topical administration would be more desirable delivery mechanism for skin disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AON system that we describe here is probably best suited for topical application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To develop this approach further, we need to identify effective methods of delivery over larger surface areas of skin and into other tissues of interest such as the airways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional limitation is that the sequence of the human MS4A2 gene is less conducive to exon skipping than the mouse Ms4a2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the experimental dermatitis model illustrated the full potential of the AON approach in mice, it is apparent that more refined AON configurations might be needed to achieve this in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite these challenges, we believe that this approach has the potential for clinical application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AON-mediated exon skipping is emerging as a promising gene therapy approach with the advantage that it does not alter the genome and is reversible with cessation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exon skipping has been effectively used for rare genetic defects where frameshift mutations in genomic DNA lead to loss of protein function (for reviews, see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1820).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, two new drug applications for the AON drugs Drisapersen (BioMarin Pharmaceutical) and Eteplirsen (Sarepta Therapeutics) to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy have been filed with the Food and Drug Administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, exon skipping is predominantly used for rare genetic disorders that require gene sequencing, a personalized gene therapy approach, and separate clinical trials and approvals for each exon targeting AON, causing a burden on development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have devised an AON approach to alter splicing of FcRI with the potential of treating allergic conditions such as asthma and atopic dermatitis, which are amenable to inhaled or topical treatments, respectively, and not associated with a specific genetic defect, thus eliminating the need for a personalized approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that this could be a viable approach for treatment of allergic diseases and a mast cell-specific therapeutic strategy that, we believe, has the potential to translate into the clinic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

BMMCs were transfected as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were cultured for 32 h and then BMMCs were sensitized with 100 ng/mL anti-DNP IgE (SPE7 clone) for 16 h (DNP-stimulated cells only), and some cells were not sensitized with IgE (all other conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BMMCs were stimulated, and signaling was carried out according to previous protocols using human mast cells (9, 39, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, 5 × 105 BMMCs were stimulated with the indicated stimulus in 100 µL of Hepes buffer plus 0.04% BSA for 2 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 2 min, boiling lysis buffer was added, and samples were syringed to disrupt genomic DNA as described (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblotting was carried out as described (8) using the phosphorylation-specific antibodies: anti-PLC1 (Tyr783), anti-Akt (Ser473), and anti-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-actin clone AC-15 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a loading control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRDye (680RD or 800CW)-labeled secondary antibodies (1:20,000) were used to label both phosphorylated and total proteins simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were visualized and quantified using an Odyssey CLx imager (LI-COR Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Proliferation_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BMMCs were washed once with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 2 × 106 BMMCs was stained with CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, cells were stained for 15 min, followed by addition of 5× volume of complete RPMI medium 1640 with 10% (vol/vol) FBS at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BMMCs were pelleted and transfected as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BMMCs were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 30 ng/mL recombinant mouse IL-3 at 37 °C for 57 d and stained with Aqua live/dead (Invitrogen) and FITC-FcRI (eBioscience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometry was performed on an LSRII flow cytometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dead cells were gated out using the Aqua live/dead stain with an additional gate set for the single-cell population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Apoptosis_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BMMCs (2 × 106) were transfected with standard control AON or FcRI AON as indicated above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To allow sufficient time for the AON to be effective, BMMCs were incubated for 24 h in complete RPMI medium 1640 containing 30 ng/mL recombinant mouse IL-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometry for surface FcRI expression was performed at 24 h, and loss of surface FcRI expression was complete by 24 h. BMMCs were then washed with complete RPMI medium 1640 and cultured in fresh medium with or without 30 ng/mL recombinant mouse IL-3, and with or without 1 µg/mL anti-DNP IgE (SPE7 clone) as indicated, to examine the effects of IL-3 withdrawal and IgE on BMMC survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seventy-two hours after cytokine removal, BMMCs were stained with Aqua live/dead, FITC-FcRI antibody, and analyzed for apoptosis with PE-Annexin V (eBioscience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dead cells were assessed by examining Aqua live/dead staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apoptotic cells were assessed by Annexin V staining after gating out dead cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Passive_Cutaneous_Anaphylaxis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess efficacy of FcRI exon skipping in vivo, we used the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis model using morpholino AONs linked through the terminal 3-N to an octaguanidinium dendrimer (Vivo-Morpholino) (purchased from Gene-Tools).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty microliters of 0.5 mM standard control AON or FcRI AON (100 µg of AON) was injected intradermally into one ear and 20 µL of PBS into the other control ear of each mouse at day 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-four hours later, the AON or PBS injections were repeated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 48 h, 75 ng of anti-DNP-HSA IgE (in 20 µL of PBS) was injected into the AON-treated ears and 20 µL of PBS was injected into the control ears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 72 h, 200 µg of DNP-HSA in 200 µL of PBS containing 0.5% Evans blue dye was administered by i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection to all mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min, mice were killed with CO2 gas, and AON-treated and control ears were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ears were minced and 700 µL of formamide was added to the tubes containing ear tissue and incubated for 2 h at 55 °C to extract the Evans blue dye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evans blue dye extracted into the filtered formamide extract was measured by absorbance in a plate reader set at 620 nm and calculated as fold increase in dye infiltration in the AON-treated ear compared with the internal control ear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For a subset of mice, skin tissue was retrieved from the side of the head near the base of the ear after the ears had been removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skin tissue retrieved was within 10 mm of the AON injection site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removed skin was immediately placed in RNAlater and stored at 4 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following day, the tissue was removed from RNAlater and submerged in lysis buffer from the RNAeasy plus mini-kit (QIAGEN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skin tissue was then lysed and homogenized using the TissueRuptor (QIAGEN) mechanical homogenizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was isolated from the homogenized lysate using the RNAeasy plus mini-kit with added QIAShredder step according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RT-PCR was carried out as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Allergic_Dermatitis_TDI_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Female 6-wk-old BALB/cAnN were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were housed in groups of four mice per single ventilated cage under controlled lighting (a 12-h lightdark cycle), temperature (22 ± 3 °C), humidity (55% ± 15%), and ventilation (at least 10 complete fresh-air changes per hour).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standard rodent chow and water were available ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All aspects of the current study were conducted in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Program of the North Carolina State University (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Protocol No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13-111-B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
