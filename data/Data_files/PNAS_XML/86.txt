Mutations in the linker domain affect phospho-STAT3 function and suggest targets for interrupting STAT3 activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Examination of mutants in linker domain of STAT3 suggests contacts with both the DNA binding and SH2 domains that may cause structural changes and affect pSTAT3-dependent transcription, opening the possibility of new targets for drug inhibition of pSTAT3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crystallography of the cores of phosphotyrosine-activated dimers of STAT1 (132713) and STAT3 (127722) bound to a similar double-stranded deoxyoligonucleotide established the domain structure of the STATs and the structural basis for activation through tyrosine phosphorylation and dimerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reported earlier that mutants in the linker domain of STAT1 that connect the DNA-binding domain and SH2 domain can prevent transcriptional activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the pervasive importance of persistently activated STAT3 in many human cancers and the difficulty of finding useful drug candidates aimed at disrupting the pY interchange in active STAT3 dimers, we have examined effects of an array of mutants in the STAT3 linker domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have found several STAT3 linker domain mutants to have profound effects of inhibiting STAT3 transcriptional activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these results, we propose (i) there is definite functional interaction of the linker both with the DNA binding domain and with the SH2 domain, and (ii) these putative contacts provide potential new targets for small molecule-induced pSTAT3 inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mutations_in_STAT3_Affecting_Function__The_K551_Residue  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crystal structures of STAT1 and STAT3 have been available since 1998 (3, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The STAT1 was human (3) and STAT3 was mouse (4), but their amino acid sequences are identical except for E at 706 in STAT3 (human) and D in STAT3 (mouse) plus an S insertion at 701.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures showed a great similarity including in the linker domain (Fig S1 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linker domains feature four major helical regions in both proteins (Fig S1 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To begin a search for STAT3 linker domain mutants that might affect function, we naturally started with K551, which is the cognate residue to K544 identified earlier in STAT1 (2224) that was required for effective strong DNA binding and transcriptional activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mutated K551 in STAT3 to alanine and transfected a transcriptional reporter construct into a STAT3-negative cell line (A4; provided by G. Stark, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland) to test for IL-6 transcriptional induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After IL-6 induction for 4 h, the wild-type protein gave a robust (35-fold) transcriptional increase (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, STAT3, known to be ineffective in in vivo transcriptional activation (18), gave less than a twofold increase above background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The STAT3 mutant K551A gave a very weak transcriptional response (less than 10% of wild type in many different experiments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, residue K551 in STAT3 clearly has a key functional role (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested the STAT3 K551A mutant for its DNA off rate by binding to a 32P-labeled M67 SIE nucleotide probe for 15 min followed by addition of unlabeled oligonucleotide and sampled at increasing amounts of time to check for DNA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Just as was the case for STAT1 mutated in residue K544, the off rate for STAT3 K551A was much faster than the wild-type protein whether tested as tyrosine phosphorylated pure protein or in a nuclear extract from transfected IL-6treated cells (Fig 3B and data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the unlabeled oligonucleotide chase, there was a 5060% loss of bound wild-type STAT3 only after 40 min, but a virtual absence of bound STAT3 K551A in 1 min (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is further noteworthy that to obtain a DNA bound signal at the start of the off-time assay required three times as much pSTAT3 K551A as wild-type pSTAT3 (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

STAT3_Mutagenesis_in_Other_Sites_of_the_Linker_Domain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Yang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  experiments (22, 23) had explored other STAT1 mutants of highly conserved residues in the linker domain of STAT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We proceeded to check the effects of mutations in some of these same and additional sites in the STAT3 linker domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are 105 residues in the linker, 62 of which are identical to those in STAT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four longer helical elements of the linker domain include 53 residues, 45 of which are the same in STAT1 and STAT3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is an 10-aa loop between the last two helices, which is also highly conserved and includes the K551(STAT3) and K544 (STAT1) residues discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the STAT1 studies, a number of conserved tryptophans were mutated because of the suggestion that this amino acid plays an outsized role in stabilizing protein structure (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The STAT1 residues W539, W555, and W557 are cognate in STAT3 with W546, W562, and W564.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first of these residues is in the highly conserved loop just upstream of the final long helix in each of the two STATs, which, as noted, contains the K551 (STAT3) and K544 (STAT1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other tryptophan residues are in the last helix of the linker domain (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The STAT1 W539A greatly reduced transcriptional activation (22), and the mutation in the cognate W546A in STAT3 produced a threefold reduction (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the off time of the STAT3 W546A was approximately twofold faster than wild-type protein (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspection of the crystallographic structure of STAT3 revealed that residues K551 and W546 are in close proximity to glutamic acid E434 in the DNA binding domain (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore mutated E434 to alanine to test a possible function of this predicted interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STAT3 E434A showed a 60% reduction in activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the double mutant EE434/435AA had been described earlier in the literature as dominant negative STAT3 mutant (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that EE434/435AA has greatly impaired transcription activity (10% of wild-type STAT3; Fig 1A) as well as faster off times from DNA (80% loss of DNA binding in 6 min; Fig 3D), a phenotype that mirrors the K551A mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with a predicted cooperativity between residues K551 and W546, double mutation W546A/K551A caused a slightly greater loss in activity than K551A alone (5% of activity remaining; Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results taken together strongly support K551:E434:W546 functional interactions within the linker domain, which are then communicated through the linker domain, perhaps also involving E435 to affect the STAT3 function via contacts with the DNA-binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated the importance of conserved tryptophan residues in the last helix of the linker domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the mutation STAT1 W555A had no effect on transcription, STAT3 W562A showed a 50% reduction in activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of residues W557 (STAT1) and W564 (STAT3) impaired transcription by 90% and 75%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, both W557 in STAT1 and W564 in STAT3 when changed to alanine produced less protein than wild type, potentially because the mutant protein was unstable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stability of STAT3 W564A was tested after construct transfection comparing wild-type and mutant proteins in cells treated with cycloheximide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The W564A protein declined 70% within 4 h of cycloheximide treatment, whereas the wild-type protein was stable (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of a contact of the last helix in STAT3 by a single amino acid change appears to lead to protein instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the original STAT1 crystallography paper, the proximity and, therefore, possible interaction of residues in the last helix in the STAT linker domain with either the DNA binding domain or the SH2 domain, were pointed out (see figure 5 and accompanying discussion in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in STAT3, there is an unstructured loop in the SH2 domain just distal to the arginine-containing pocket to which the phosphotyrosine from the partner monomer is bound (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This loop comes close to the residues in helix 8 of STAT3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, S611 in the STAT3 SH2 loop is close to W564 (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [This final helix (residues 561 to 574) is called helix 10 in STAT1 and helix 8 in STAT3 because other short (3- to 5-aa-long) helical regions received different numbering.]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The region of the final linker domain helix proximate to this SH2 domain loop contains several charged residues, D566, D570, K573, and K574 downstream from the tryptophan residues (W562 and W564) discussed earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the crystal structure of STAT3, these residues are also close to the SH2 loop discussed above (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore made the constructs D566A, D570A, D570K, K573A, and K574A in STAT3 to test for effects on transcriptional activation and on dephosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these mutations had a drastic negative effect on transcription (Fig 1A) with activities between 2% and 15% of wild-type STAT3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly D566A, D570A, and especially D570K showed increased background reporter activity and low levels of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation before IL6 induction despite serum starvation for 18 h that effectively removed traces of tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type STAT3 and other linker domain mutants (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because STAT3 can be activated by many tyrosine kinases other than receptor-bound JAKs (11), we tested to see whether the constitutive STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation activation was due to either src, a constitutive kinase for STAT3, or to the tec kinase that is activated in PI3K-transformed cells (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibitors specific for each of these kinases did not affect the low but distinct constitutive Y705 phosphorylation in the transfected D570K mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutant D570K produced a striking phenotype that requires a more detailed description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite high levels of induced tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig 1B), the low level of background transcriptional activity of D570K consistently decreased after initial IL-6 stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to not responding to IL-6induced transcription, D570K remained persistently bound to DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In off-time experiments with purified protein and radiolabeled oligonucleotides, D570K remained bound to DNA in the presence of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides for 2.5 h (Fig 4 A and B show time course over 100 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same long-term binding was obtained for the D570A mutant that remained bound to DNA for 2.5 h although stimulating transcription only 5% as well as wild type (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_STAT3_Linker_Domain_Mutants_on_Phosphorylation__Nuclear_Entry__and_Dephosphorylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The closure of the STAT activation cycle involves dephosphorylation and return of the monomer molecules to the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently this dephosphorylation event is thought not to occur on DNA but only after departure from DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vinkemeier and colleagues investigated these events by using a clever strategy with STAT1 (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positively charged residues were placed within the contact sites in the DNA binding domain known from the crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutant produced a phosphorylated STAT1 dimer that binds tightly to both specific STAT binding sites and nonspecific sites but does not leave or become dephosphorylated, supporting the conclusion that dephosphorylation requires departure from the template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that the TC45 phosphatase is the responsible protein in the cell nucleus for dephosphorylation and that the purified enzyme will dephosphorylate DNA-free molecules in a cell-free context and the in vitro reaction can be inhibited by furnishing specific DNA-binding sites (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To complete the investigation of the effect of the STAT3 mutants described in this work in the whole cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, we next determined whether cytoplasmic activation and accumulation in the nucleus was affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
No experiments of which we are aware have begun observation of this cycle in short times after exposure to an activating ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5A shows that nonphosphorylated STAT3 in these transfected cells is partitioned approximately equally between nucleus and cytoplasm, as has been ascribed in other cells (39) to nuclear shuttling of nonphosphorylated STAT3 (and STAT1; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within 30 s of IL-6 treatment, cytoplasmic pSTAT3 is detectable compared with untreated cell extracts with a gradual rise to a maximum in 510 min (Fig 5A and first sample in Fig 5B in which cells were treated with IL-6 for 10 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear entry of pSTAT3 is evident in 1 min after IL-6 treatment and steadily increases for the 5 min of observation (Fig 5A) to a total of approximately twofold less than in the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated transit time of a dimeric STAT3 from cytoplasm to nucleus from this data are on the order of a few minutes at most.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 5B uses the quick-acting general kinase inhibitor staurosporine, at 10 min, to stop further pSTAT3 formation, allowing the examination of the dephosphorylation of nuclear pSTAT3 (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dephosphorylation of nuclear STAT3 in these transfected A4 cells after IL-6 activation is not nearly as rapid as is STAT1 after IFN- activation in HeLa cells where the cytoplasmic pSTAT1 is gone 15 min after staurosporine treatment and all nuclear pSTAT1 is gone in 45 min (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present experiments, cytoplasmic pSTAT3 declines slowly in staurosporine, and the decline in the nucleus is only approximately two- to fourfold in 45 and 90 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the same analysis, the K551A mutant with the rapid off rate from DNA and 510% of wild-type STAT3 transcriptional stimulation was dephosphorylated completely within 45 min in the nucleus and within 90 min in the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because TC45, the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation, is nuclear, nuclear entry has to occur for dephosphorylation to be completed (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also tested the effect of staurosporine on the D570K mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During in vitro off time measurements, D570K was much more stable than wild-type pSTAT3 (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with staurosporine left nuclear pSTAT3 D570K at the same level for 2.5 h (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result differs radically from wild-type protein, which has a nuclear pSTAT3 half decay time of 40 min, and in staurosporine it becomes completely dephosphorylated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results imply all the D570K molecules remain bound to DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not know at this point whether all molecules are bound to true STAT target sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, as noted above, the K551A mutant, which has a faster than normal off time, is dephosphorylated much faster than wild-type protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All these results agree with the Vinkemeier laboratorys conclusion (37) that there is no discernible dephosphorylation of a mutant that persistently binds DNA compared with wild-type protein and support the conclusion that disengagement from DNA is required before dephosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So we have, by accident, engineered a single amino acid mutant, D570K, that fails to drive transcription, remains bound to DNA for hours, and is not dephosphorylated in vivo as is wild-type protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Interpretations_of_STAT3_Linker_Mutants_Through_Examination_of_Linker_Domain_Structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table S1 gives the biochemical phenotype of the mutants discussed in this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 shows portions of the crystallographic structure of STAT3 (principally the linker domain) and the residues of wild-type protein where mutations and/or potential contacts were made (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we make an attempt based on plausible expectations from proximity of potentially interactive amino acids to provide a possible structural explanation of the functional effect of some of the mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, in the K551 region, the positively charged epsilon NH2 group of the lysine side chain is close enough (2.83.1 Å) to the negatively charged glutamic acid E434 in a loop within but not contacting DNA in the DNA-binding domain to engage in hydrogen bonding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the pyrrole ring of the tryptophan residue 546 is also close enough to hydrogen bond with E434 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recall that mutagenesis of either K551 or W546 to A resulted in less stable binding to DNA (faster off time).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alanine substitutions, K551A and W546A, would disrupt these potential H bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structures of STAT3 with these mutations are required to provide further insight into why there is such a dramatic effect on the stability of DNA binding with what might have been anticipated to be a small physical change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we considered the position of the side chains of the negatively charged residues D570 and the positively charged K573 and K574 in the last helix of the linker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D570 could interact with either K573 or K574.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of the side chains of these residues seems close to residues in the DNA-binding domain or to the SH2 domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why these potential interactions would cause the strong DNA binding of D570K, is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in its most extended conformation, the lysine side chain of the D570K mutant would be at least 3.5 Å from the DNA backbone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A crystal structure would be most valuable to understand this mutant (D570K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, as noted earlier, the proximity of the last helix of the linker domain in STAT1 was noted to be quite close to a loop in the SH2 domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In STAT3, the same SH2 loop region exists close to the last helix in the linker domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SH2 loop is 1015 residues downstream from the pocket containing residue R609, which is crucial for the pY705 on a tail from the opposite STAT monomer to bind, producing the phosphorylated dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The W564A mutant in the last helix lowered the transcription rate three- to fourfold, and the side chain of the W564 hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl group of S611.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfection of the W564A produced decreased transcription but apparently did so by destabilizing the protein (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon completion of the structure of STATs 1, 3, and 5 and the initial and growing demonstration of the widespread importance of STAT3 as a driver in human cancer (33), great effort has been applied to blocking STAT3 function by interrupting the interlocking SH2 Y705 interaction that renders STAT3 an active dimeric transcription factor (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using excellent wet chemistry and computer-assisted methods, many compounds have been created that attack this target, several successfully, reducing tyrosine 705 phosphorylation, inhibiting tumor cells in culture, and even effecting a modest inhibition of human tumor xenografts in mice (20, 4245).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no molecule has been devised or unearthed that has adequate specificity and pharmacologic efficacy to provide hope that this obvious anticancer target will soon yield an effective anti-STAT3 drug in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As has been known for more than 20 years, effective DNA binding of activated STATs and subsequent transcriptional activation depends on residues in the DNA-binding domain (46), but the Yang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  results with STAT1 suggested and the present results provide conclusive evidence that effective DNA binding also depends on residues in the linker domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The logical implication is that the linker domain has a previously insufficiently appreciated structural role in maintaining an effective DNA-binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that linker domain mutants reveal key residues that enforce the presumptive structural role of the linker domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If small molecules can be found that effect the same structural changes that the presently described mutants cause, they would be of great interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The STAT3-destabilizing effects of the K551A mutant could well rest on the K551-E434 contact, which provides a possible target for disruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the transcriptional inhibition of W564A mutation affords another target, the W564S611 interaction, which destabilizes the STAT3 structure (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Perhaps the most intriguing but admittedly puzzling lead comes from the D570K mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That this abnormally tight DNA binding mutant that does not drive transcription and resists dephosphorylation says a mutation can cause what appears to be not only a disabling mutation but suggests a molecule that permanently disables not only a pSTAT3 molecule but for as long as binding persists, disables a STAT3 site on a chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work (crystal structure first) is definitely in order for this puzzling result, plus a determination of whether this tight association persists through, or even affects, DNA replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, the usefulness of these results may be to focus attention on the fact that residues relatively distant from what has been the well-attended main arena of interestSTAT3 DNA binding at defined sites and SH2-phosphotyrosine interchangesuggests that STAT3 functions (and STAT function in general) might be affected through subtle interactions of neighboring STAT domains on each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cell culture and reagents are described in detail in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments were performed with STAT3 null A4 colon cancer cells derived by homologous recombination, a gift of G. Stark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase reporter assays, transfection assays, and cell extracts were all standard procedures, and purification of tyrosoine phosphorylated STAT3 proteins are fully described in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While completing this work, we learned from a private confidential communication that the compound described by Y. Li et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (47) as a STAT3 inhibitor binds in a crystal structure in a pocket formed at the junction between the DNA binding domain and the linker domain as the basis for STAT3 inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Cell_Culture_and_Reagents  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
STAT3-null A4 cells were derived from human DLD1 colon cancer cells by homologous recombination (48) and were kindly provided by G. R. Stark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were grown in McCoys 5A medium with l-glutamine (HyClone), supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 g/mL) (Gibco-BRL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before experimental treatment, cells were serum starved (1% or no FBS) overnight, and all treatments were carried out in the absence of serum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human IL-6 (BioLegend) and the recombinant soluble form of the human IL-6 receptor (Sigma) were used at concentrations of 20 ng/mL or 80 ng/mL (IL-6) and 25 ng/mL or 100 ng/mL (IL-6-R) as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staurosporine (Abcam) was used at a concentration of 1 M, cycloheximide (Sigma) at a concentration of 100 g/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STAT3, and phospho-Y705 STAT3 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M2 agarose and Flag-peptide were purchased from Sigma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extraction buffers were complemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Halt; Thermo Scientific) and phosphatase inhibitor (Simple Stop; Gold Biotechnology) before use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Site-Directed_Mutagenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mammalian expression constructs for STAT3 mutants were generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) using mouse STAT3 in vector pcDNA3.1 as template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mutants were sequenced over the entire reading frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression constructs for protein purification from mammalian cells were generated by inserting a Flag-tag between amino acid residues 197 and 198 in the coiled-coil domain of STAT3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The internally Flag-tagged wild-type STAT3 was then used as template for consecutive QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis to introduce point mutations in linker and DNA binding domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Luciferase_Reporter_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transient transfections for reporter assays were carried out in 24-well plates with 1.0 × 105 cells per well by using 100 ng of 2-M luciferase reporter (200 to 100; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49), 4 ng of Renilla plasmid and 100 ng of STAT3 expression constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) and grown overnight in serum-free medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-two hours past transfection, cells were left untreated or treated with IL-6 and soluble IL-6-R for 4 h. Luciferase assays were performed by using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase activities were normalized against Renilla luciferase activity of the cotransfected internal control plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each transfection was performed in duplicate, and results were confirmed in three to five independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Purification_of_Tyrosine_Phosphorylated_STAT3_Proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A4 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and transfected with 15 g of internally Flag-tagged STAT3 expression constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transfected cells were serum-starved overnight (1% FBS) and kept for an additional 23 h in serum-free medium before induction with IL-6 and IL-6-R for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-cell lysates [20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 280 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT and 0.5 mM PMSF] were prepared from two dishes and incubated with 20 L of M2-resin for 4 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beads were washed three times with BC buffer [20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF] containing 300 mM KCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (BC3000.1% Nonidet P-40) followed by one wash with buffer BC1000.1% Nonidet P-40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bound Flag-tagged proteins were eluted with two consecutive incubations with 25 g/mL Flag-peptide in BC1000.1% Nonidet P-40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elutions were carried out at room temperature (RT) for 15 min each in a total volume of 100 L. Elution fractions were analyzed side by side with input and supernatant fractions by SDS/PAGE with phospho Y705-STAT3 antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of purified phospho STAT3 was estimated by SDS/PAGE and silver staining (Pierce) by comparing signal intensity of STAT3 bands to known amounts of BSA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical yields were 300 ng of purified tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

EMSA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA binding activity of STAT3 mutants was assayed with 32P-labeled m67 probe (5-CATTTCCCGTAAATCGTCGA-3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probe was prepared by end-labeling of double-stranded oligonucleotides with [-32P] ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purified in vivo phosphorylated STAT3 proteins (26 ng) were incubated with 0.019 pmol of probe in binding buffer (20 L) containing 15 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 82 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.43 mM EDTA, and 10% (vol/vol) glycerol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaction mixtures were incubated for 15 min at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure dissociation rates from DNA, a 40-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides was then added for the indicated times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STAT3DNA complexes were loaded onto a running 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide 37.5:1) in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA, and electrophoresed at 130 V for 2.54 h at RT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gel was dried and exposed to X-ray film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bands were quantified by using ImageJ software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Transient transfections for activation and dephosphorylation studies were carried out in 50-mm dishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 9.0 × 105 A4 cells were seeded the day before and transfected with 1.5 g or 3.0 g of STAT3 expression constructs (1.5 g of wild-type STAT3, D570K, or D570A, 3.0 g of K551A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA amount was adjusted empirically to yield approximately equal expression of different proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were serum-starved overnight (1% FBS) and incubated for an additional 34 h in serum-free medium before induction with IL-6/IL-6-R. Activation studies used 80 ng/mL IL-6 and 100 ng/mL IL-6-R for indicated times (0.55 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dephosphorylation studies used 20 ng/mL IL-6 and 25 ng/mL IL-6-R for 10 min, followed by treatment with 1 M staurosporine for the indicated times (10150 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were collected on ice and resuspended in hypotonic buffer [20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 10 mM KCL, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10-min incubation on ice, cytoplasmic fractions were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 s. Pellets were washed with sucrose buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 320 mM sucrose) and extracted with high salt buffer [20 mM Hepes pH 7.9, 420 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20% (vol/vol) glycerol].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear extracts were collected after 30-min incubation on ice by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
