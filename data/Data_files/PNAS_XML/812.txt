title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protective major histocompatibility complex allele prevents type 1 diabetes by shaping the intestinal microbiota early in ontogeny  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This report brings a new perspective on the decades-old question of how MHC and HLA complexes can potently protect against a variety of autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that protection by the MHC-II E:E complex operated via modulation of the composition of the intestinal microbiota during a critical early window of ontogeny, associated with modification of the local immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings prompt a model of HLA/MHC-mediated protection from autoimmunity, and raise the question of whether disease-protective alleles in other human autoimmune diseases or models thereof might operate by a similar mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also argue that treating infants and pregnant mothers with antibiotics should be minimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Certain MHC-II or HLA-D alleles dominantly protect from particular autoimmune diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, expression of the MHC-II E:E complex potently protects nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, which normally lack this isotype, from spontaneous development of type 1 diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the underlying mechanisms remain debated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated MHC-IImediated protection from type 1 diabetes using a previously reported NOD mouse line expressing an E transgene and, thereby, the E:E complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E16/NOD females vertically protected their NOD offspring from diabetes and insulitis, an effect that was dependent on the intestinal microbiota; moreover, they developed autoimmunity when treated with certain antibiotics or raised in a germ-free environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic and proteomic analyses revealed NOD and E16/NOD mice to host mild but significant differences in the intestinal microbiotas during a critical early window of ontogeny, and transfer of cecal contents from the latter to the former suppressed insulitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, protection from autoimmunity afforded by particular MHC/HLA alleles can operate via intestinal microbes, highlighting potentially important societal implications of treating infants, or even just their pregnant mothers, with antibiotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

E16_NOD_Dams_Transmitted_Protection_from_Insulitis_and_T1D_Vertically_to_Their_NOD_Progeny  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the maternal and neonatal environments can influence diabetes development in both NOD mice (21) and humans (22), we began by investigating whether protection from diabetes could be vertically transferred from an E16/NOD dam to her NOD progeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diabetes incidence was compared in cohorts of female NOD mice born to either NOD dams mated to E16/NOD sires or to the reciprocal combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD progeny of E16/NOD dams had a significantly reduced incidence (39% vs. 65%) and delayed onset (21 vs. 14 wk of age) of diabetes vis á vis NOD progeny of NOD dams (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since multiple checkpoints are involved in the development of T1D, we investigated whether insulitis was also affected, and found that the NOD progeny of E16/NOD dams had significantly reduced insulitis as well (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genetic imprinting, maternal antibody transfer, and microbiome colonization are all possible mechanisms for such vertically transmitted protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the microbiota can protect NOD mice from disease development in certain circumstances (17), we tested whether maternal microbes were responsible for E-mediated vertical suppression of insulitis by giving vancomycin in the drinking water of E16/NOD mothers during their last 710 d of pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This treatment resulted in an insulitis frequency in NOD progeny of E16/NOD dams that was significantly higher than that of offspring from their untreated counterparts, and was indistinguishable from that of progeny from standard NOD dams (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, E-mediated protection from autoimmunity was, at least to a degree, vertically transmitted to NOD progeny and was microbiota-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Treatment_with_Certain_Antibiotics_Induced_Insulitis_and_Altered_the_Intestinal_Microbiome_in_E16_NOD_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This conclusion implied that disruption or loss of the microbiota in E16/NOD mice might induce autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a first approach to evaluating this possibility, we gave female E16/NOD mice antibiotics in the drinking water, choosing vancomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, and ampicillin to survey a broad range of microbe sensitivities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oral treatment from 3 to 6 wk of age with vancomycin or metronidazole, but not with neomycin or ampicillin, induced insulitis in a fraction of the E16/NOD mice (Fig 2A); when it appeared, islet infiltration could be quite severe (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the fraction of E16/NOD mice showing insulitis under these conditions was quite low, this result contrasted with the extremely rare and mild insulitis observed with their untreated counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we sought to further optimize the treatment protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effectiveness of vancomycin treatment showed a clear age-dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Giving this antibiotic either from the last 710 d of pregnancy until 3 wk after birth (optimally) or from 3 to 6 wk of age induced insulitis in E16/NOD mice, but administering it from 6 to 10 wk of age did not (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since oral vancomycin is not systemically absorbed, it appeared that disruption specifically of the intestinal microbiota might induce autoimmunity in a fraction of E16/NOD mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We addressed this possibility by characterizing the fecal microbiome of vancomycin-treated pregnant dams, their progeny, and control mice unexposed to vancomycin by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, oral administration of vancomycin changed the intestinal microbiome (reflected in feces) of the E16/NOD pregnant dams; the altered maternal microbiome was transmitted to their progeny, persisting through 10 wk of age (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of unweighted UniFrac distances, with each dot representing the microbiome of an individual mouse, indicated that mice directly or indirectly exposed to vancomycin clustered separately from those that received no antibiotic (Fig 2E, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most interesting, the altered microbiota was transmitted from vancomycin-treated E16/NOD dams to pups that had not been directly exposed to vancomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this observation and the expected normalization of microbial flora over time, the maternal microbiomes clustered closer to those of their 3-wk-old than their 10-wk-old progeny (Fig 2E, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, we generated germ-free (GF) NOD and E16/NOD mice, and compared their degrees of insulitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sixty percent of GF E16/NOD mice showed substantial insulitis, with a severity similar to that of both their GF NOD littermates and standard NOD mice (Fig 2 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short then, data from both the antibiotic-treatment and GF-housing experiments argued that microbes were critical elements of E-mediated protection from NOD diabetes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the effects were not completely penetrant, it is important to keep in mind that only a few untreated E16/NOD individuals from our colony, of the hundreds examined over the past 25 y, exhibited any insulitis (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

E16_NOD_Mice_Hosted_a_Distinct_Intestinal_Microbiome_Early_in_Ontogeny  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Islet autoimmunity begins when diabetogenic -cellderived self-antigens first appear in the pancreas-draining lymph nodes (PLNs) at days 1518 in NOD mice (23), which also corresponds to the time when lymphatic connections from the gastrointestinal tract to the PLNs develop (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we tested whether expression of the E molecule impacted the microbiome of 18-d-old mice via 16S rRNA gene sequencing of cecal contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid detecting spurious associations between E-molecule expression and microbial taxa due to maternal or cage effects, we compared only cohoused NOD (n = 25) and E16/NOD (n = 25) littermates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The -diversity of the cecal contents microbiome was significantly higher in E16/NOD than in NOD mice, and -diversity was significantly lower, indicating that the microbiomes of the two types of mice were distinct (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taxonomic comparisons by generalized linear mixed-effects modeling revealed a higher representation of microbes from the order Clostridiales [false-discovery rate (FDR) -corrected P = 1.2 × 103] and a lower proportion of the genus Blautia (FDR-corrected P = 7.2 × 106) in the microbiomes of E16/NOD mice (Fig 3C, Fig S1, and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since certain tissue-associated microbes may engender specific immune responses, we next investigated whether cecal tissue-associated microbes were differently represented between E16/NOD and littermate NOD mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the findings in cecal-content microbiomes, a higher representation of microbes from the order Clostridiales (FDR-corrected P = 1.4 × 107) and a lower proportion of the genus Blautia (FDR-corrected P = 2.7 × 1014) were present in the cecal tissue microbiomes of E16/NOD mice (Fig 3C, Fig S1, and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The microbiota differences were not uniform in all mice from different cages (Fig S1), suggesting redundancy in the range of microbes affected by the E molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we sought to identify combinations of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affected by E (and interfering with diabetes) by constructing Random Forest classifiers of E or N genotypes based on the microbiome profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While success rates of 8087% could be obtained, these proved not significantly different from chance by permutation analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also exploited a metaproteomic approach to investigate microbial protein expression in feces from littermate E16/NOD vs. NOD mice at day 18 and day 70 (n = 24 mice in total).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbial proteomic data were aggregated according to both functional and taxonomic annotations (1,078 different functional-taxonomic features identified).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Diversity was again significantly higher in E16/NOD individuals at day 18 and day 70.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Diversity analysis revealed a strong cage/littermate effect at day 18, and clustering by mouse genotype at day 70 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both the genomic and proteomic data argued that the E16/NOD and NOD microbiota were distinct during early life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intestinal microbiomes of E16/NOD mice showed increased -diversity, which has been associated with protection from T1D in genetically susceptible mice and humans (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To directly confirm this conclusion, we compared the ability of intestinal microbiota from E16/NOD vs. NOD donors to protect NOD recipients from insulitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD mice gavaged twice weekly from 2 to 5 wk of age with E16/NOD cecal contents had a significantly reduced insulitis severity (median insulitis score of 0.55 vs. 1.23) compared with that of controls gavaged in parallel with NOD cecal contents (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparing_the_IgA-Bound_Repertoire_of_Cecal_Bacteria_in_NOD_and_E16_NOD_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore one possible mechanism for E-mediated, microbiota-dependent protection in the NOD model of T1D, we investigated the IgA response to gut bacteria in NOD and E16/NOD littermates born to NOD mothers, using the recently developed IgA-seq method (27), to interrogate the composition of microbes that are bound, or not, to IgA molecules in the intestinal contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E16/NOD and NOD littermates did not differ in the flow cytometric frequency or mean fluorescence intensity of IgA-coated cecal bacteria (Fig S3), contrary to previous data demonstrating fluctuations in the proportion of IgA+ stool bacteria depending on the host MHC allele (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our IgA-sequencing data, direct comparisons between the genotypes revealed no OTUs that had significantly different IgA-coating index (ICI) values for either age group (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the LEfSe biomarker discovery tool (28) flagged a handful of OTUs that were overall differentially IgA-coated between NOD and their E16/NOD counterparts (Fig 4 C and D), albeit with rather low scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All four of the OTUs with higher representation in the E16/NOD IgA-coated microbiomes were from the order Clostridiales, while those with higher representations in NOD microbiomes were from the orders Clostridiales, Oceanospirillales, and Pseudomonales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When displayed on a per mouse basis and accounting for cage of origin, it appeared that the differential signals were scattered, with little uniformity, and were mostly due to a few mice (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We again applied a Random Forest approach to identify an effect of E on IgA coating of combinations of microbes, but no groups of OTUs were identified whose ICI significantly distinguished (by permutation testing) the two genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Investigating_the_Intestinal_Immune_System_in_E16_NOD_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we explored whether the early-life microbiome alterations found in E16/NOD mice were associated with changes in the intestinal immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The innate and adaptive immune-system cell populations of the lamina propria of the large and small intestines, PLNs, Peyers patches, cecal patch, and spleen showed no robust differences in E16/NOD vs. NOD littermates, according to fraction and number of CD4+ T-helper cells expressing IFN-, IL-17, IL-10, or IL-22, CD8+ T cells, and myeloid cell populations, such as CD103-expressing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since MHC-II expression on innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) is necessary to maintain homeostasis with commensal microbiota (29), we also compared the number and frequency of ILCs expressing the transcription factors Gata-3 or Ror, along with the number and frequency of ILC3 expressing IFN-, IL-17, or IL-22, and found no consistent differences (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did observe an increased regulatory Treg cell frequency in the cecal lamina propria of E16/NOD mice at day 18 (Fig 5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there were similar populations of Treg in the small and large intestines, Peyers patches, cecal patch, and the PLNs (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An association between certain MHC and HLA class II alleles and protection from particular autoimmune diseases, notably T1D, was discovered decades ago; yet the mechanisms underlying this dominant protection have remained mysterious.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we showed that commensal microbes drove E-mediated protection from autoimmune diabetes, and that expression of the E complex shaped the intestinal microbiome during a critical early window of ontogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How might E complex expression shape the intestinal microbiota in young NOD mice?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that an additional restriction element, the E complex, could allow immune responses against additional microbial antigens, thereby shaping the developing microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, there could be an effect on the nascent IgA repertoire via presentation of additional microbial antigens, and IgAs are known, in turn, to shape the intestinal microbiota (19, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested the hypothesis that the type of MHC class II allele present would influence the affinity and specificity of the IgA produced in response to the intestinal microbiota of young E16/NOD vs. NOD mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we saw no differences in the composition of IgA-bound bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, IgA binding may alter microbial localization and function without detectible impacts on microbiota composition, as has been reported in some contexts (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, E expression might influence antimicrobial peptide (AMP) secretion from intestinal epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the E complex on APCs, leading to more cognate interactions with CD4+ T cells, could enhance APC activation, which in turn could trigger intestinal epithelial cells to secrete AMPs, known to impact intestinal microbiota localization and composition (32, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, E complex expression might promote host production of a microbe-specific metabolic substrate, conferring a selective advantage to specific microbes that can use this resource (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
How does the E16/NOD intestinal microbiota prevent autoimmunity?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A likely possibility is that the microbiome influences the development of the local intestinal immune system that, in turn, somehow prevents insulitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the intestinal microbiome changes in E16/NOD mice occurred at the time insulitis typically initiates (3 wk of age) (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This timing corresponds to a wave of islet cell apoptosis (35) and establishment of a lymphatic connection between the intestinal immune system (24) and the PLNs, which is critical for the development of insulitis and T1D (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The notion of an intestinal impact on the development of T1D is supported by studies in humans and mice, and is often referred to as the leaky gut hypothesis (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of a role for the E complex working via such mechanisms, cell transfer experiments indicated that protection is mediated by the E-expressing macrophage or dendritic cell lineage (13), which is supported by genetic ablation studies showing a requirement for E-expression on the CD11c+ but not CD19+ cell lineage (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation of increased Treg cell proportions in the cecum of E16/NOD mice could represent an effect of early-life microbial stimulation on CD11c+ tolerogenic dendritic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Ooi et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (38) have recently reported that the dominant protective effect of HLA-DR1 allele on development of Goodpastures disease can be attributed to shaping of the self-epitopespecific Treg repertoire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Perhaps our studys most important message is a societal one, assuming a translation of our findings on the NOD model to human T1D patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibiotic treatment of infants, or just their pregnant mothers, can potentially subvert ordinarily potent diabetes-protective genetic elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The generation of E16/NOD mice has previously been described (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harvard Medical School.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diabetes_and_Insulitis_Assessments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diabetes and insulitis were assessed as previously described (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insulitis was scored by two independent readers who were blinded to the identity of the slides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gavage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NOD mice were gavaged biweekly starting at 2 wk of age using a 22-gauge straight oral gavage needle (VWR 20068-608) with either NOD or E16/NOD cecal contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Antibiotic_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For antibiotic treatment, 1 g/L of ampicillin sodium salt (Sigma), 1 g/L of metronidazole (Acros Organics) plus the sweetener Equal 2.5 g/L, 0.5 g/L vancomycin hydrochloride (Acros Organics), or 1 g/L of neomycin (Fisher BioReagents) were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pregnant dams were provided with 0.5 g/L of vancomycin hydrochloride in their drinking water during the last 710 d pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sample_Collection_and_DNA_Isolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fresh fecal pellets, cecal contents, and cecal tissues were collected into sterile Eppendorf tubes under a laminar flow hood and stored at 80 °C until processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic DNA was isolated as previously described (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

16S_rRNA_Gene_Sequencing_and_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4 variable region was performed at the Broad Institute or Biopolymers Facility at Harvard Medical School on the Illumina MiSeq platform using the protocol previously described (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were processed and curated using QIIME v1.9.0, as pick_closed reference otus.spy (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control for maternal and cage effects, each samples -diversity value was normalized by dividing it against the mean -diversity value calculated from all mice from its cage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cage-normalized -diversity value was then used for comparisons between NOD and E16/NOD mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare -diversity, weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances were calculated between each pair of NOD mice and each pair of E16/NOD mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control for maternal and cage effects, UniFrac distances were calculated between cohoused littermate pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Linear_Mixed_Effect_Modeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data files from QIIME were analyzed in the R environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taxon differential abundance was calculated for the taxa that have greater than 1% relative abundance across all tested samples using generalized linear mixed-effects models with genotype and sample type as fixed effects and cage number as random effects (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple tests were corrected for FDR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IgA-Seq_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cecal content was collected from NOD and E16/NOD littermates, and frozen at 80 °C until further use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sorting of IgA-bound cecal bacteria was carried out as previously described (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_Intestinal_Cells_for_Immunologic_Analysis_and_Flow_Cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Small intestine, cecum, and colon lamina propria cell suspensions and flow cytometry were prepared as previously described (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cecal patch was removed from the cecum before this tissue was used for the preparation of the lamina propria cell suspensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
E16/NOD mice were maintained at the Jackson Laboratory, from where they were periodically imported into our specific pathogen-free facility at the New Research Building at Harvard Medical School.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were then bred at the New Research Building and their progeny used for experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were maintained free of segmented filamentous bacteria, which were confirmed by routine testing of mouse feces for the presence of segmented filamentous bacteria by PCR, as previously described (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Litters were weaned at 1821 d of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOD and E16/NOD littermates remained cohoused.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GF E16/NOD mice were generated by Caesarian-section delivery of E16/NOD and NOD pups under aseptic conditions and fostering to GF Swiss-Webster dams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GF NOD mice were also kindly provided by A. Chervonsky, Department of Pathology, Committee on Immunology, The University of Chicago, Chicago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were confirmed to be GF by aerobic/anaerobic culture and 16S rRNA gene PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harvard Medical School.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diabetes_and_Insulitis_Assessments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Starting at 10 wk of age, mice were tested weekly for the onset of diabetes by screening their urine glucose levels (Diastix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After two consecutive positive urine glucose levels, the onset of diabetes was then confirmed by blood glucose measurement  greater than 300 mg/dL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were screened until 40 wk of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the evaluation of insulitis, pancreata were dissected and immediately fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich), then embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with H&E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each islet was given a score with 0 = no insulitis, 1 = peri-insulitis, and 2 = insulitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least 50 islets were scored for most samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composite insulitis score for each mouse is calculated as follows: two times the number of islets with insulitis plus the number of islets with peri-insulitis divided by the total number of islets per pancreas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cecal_Contents_and_Tissue_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For cecal luminal content sample collection, the cecum was opened longitudinally and gently vortexed in 50-mL Falcon tubes with 5 mL of sterile PBS to release the cecal contents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cecal contents were transferred into three sterile 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 0.8 × g for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cecal tissues were washed three times in sterile PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were immediately placed on dry ice and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

16S_rRNA_Gene_Sequencing_and_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequencing was performed according to manufacturers specification with the addition 530% PhiX and generation of paired-end 250 base pair in length reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overlapping region were stitched together and further processed in a data curation pipeline implemented in QIIME v1.9.0 as pick_closed reference otus.spy (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OTU tables were then filtered to remove very low abundance OTUs (less_than0.00005%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples with fewer than 10,000 sequences were excluded from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The - and -diversity metrics were calculated using OTU tables rarified to 10,000 sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Greengenes database, release May 2013, was used for analysis requiring a phylogenetic tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values were calculated using unpaired t test with 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Metaproteomic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Proteins were extracted from stool samples as described previously, without any differential centrifugation step as pretreatment (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide mixtures were generated according to the filter-aided sample preparation with minor modifications detailed elsewhere (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide mixtures were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) interfaced with an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano LC system (Thermo Scientific), according to established procedures and parameters (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide identification was carried out using Sequest-HT as search engine, Percolator as peptide validator tool (both embedded in Proteome Discoverer v1.4), and an in-house mouse gut metagenomes assembly as sequence database (to which mouse and soybean sequences from UniProt, release 2015_03, were appended), as detailed in an earlier study (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional and taxonomic annotation of database sequences were carried out by extracting protein family information upon blastp search (e-value threshold 105) against the SwissProt database (release 2015_03), and performing lowest common ancestor-based classification with MEGAN5 (47) upon blastp search (e-value threshold 105) against the NCBI-nr database, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal component analysis of metaproteomic data were carried out using Perseus (coxdocs.org/doku.php?id=perseus:start).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Preparation_of_Cecal_Contents_for_Gavage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ceca from three to five 6- to 10-wk-old NOD or E16/NOD mice were dissected, opened longitudinally in a laminar flow hood, and contents were separated from tissue by manually shaking for 10 s in 5 mL/cecum of cold, sterile PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cecal tissue was removed and the large aggregates were allowed to settle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cecal liquid was decanted off into sterile Eppendorf tubes and stored at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

IgA-Seq_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cecal content was collected from NOD and E16/NOD littermates, and frozen at 80 °C until further use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sorting of IgA-bound cecal bacteria was carried out as previously described (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, cecal contents were homogenized by bead-beating in Lysing Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cecal slurry was filtered through 40 M cell strainers and centrifuged to obtain a bacterial pellet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria were blocked with 10% rat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS containing 1% BSA, and then labeled with a PE-conjugated anti-IgA antibody (Clone mA-6E1; eBioscience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were separated into IgA+ and IgA fractions by FACS on a FACSAria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria were pelleted and stored at 80 °C until the DNA extraction step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was isolated from the bacterial pellets by phenol-chloroform extraction and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of IgA-coating for any given OTU, also known as the ICI, was calculated as the ratio of the OTU relative abundance in the IgA+ fraction to its relative abundance in the IgA fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
