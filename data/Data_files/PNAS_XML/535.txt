title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A paradox of transcriptional and functional innate interferon responses of human intestinal enteroids to enteric virus infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding hostenteric virus interactions has been limited by the inability to culture nontransformed small intestinal epithelial cells and to infect animal models with human viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report epithelial responses in human small intestinal enteroid cultures from different individuals following infection with human rotavirus (HRV), a model enteric pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-sequencing and functional assays revealed type III IFN as the dominant transcriptional response that activates interferon-stimulated genes, but antagonism of the IFN response negates restriction of HRV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exogenously added IFNs reduce HRV replication, with type I IFN being most effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights a paradox between the strong type III transcriptional response and the weaker functional role of type III IFN in human enteric viral restriction in human small intestinal cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The intestinal epithelium can limit enteric pathogens by producing antiviral cytokines, such as IFNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type I IFN (IFN-/) and type III IFN (IFN-) function at the epithelial level, and their respective efficacies depend on the specific pathogen and site of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the roles of type I and type III IFN in restricting human enteric viruses are poorly characterized as a result of the difficulties in cultivating these viruses in vitro and directly obtaining control and infected small intestinal human tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infected nontransformed human intestinal enteroid cultures from multiple individuals with human rotavirus (HRV) and assessed the host epithelial response by using RNA-sequencing and functional assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dominant transcriptional pathway induced by HRV infection is a type III IFN-regulated response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early after HRV infection, low levels of type III IFN protein activate IFN-stimulated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this endogenous response does not restrict HRV replication because replication-competent HRV antagonizes the type III IFN response at pre- and posttranscriptional levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, exogenous IFN treatment restricts HRV replication, with type I IFN being more potent than type III IFN, suggesting that extraepithelial sources of type I IFN may be the critical IFN for limiting enteric virus replication in the human intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

HIEs_Demonstrate_Minimal_Intraculture_Variability_by_Microarray_Analysis__and_the_Epithelial_Transcriptional_Response_to_HRV_Infection_Is_Reproducible_Across_HIEs_from_Different_People  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HIEs are novel, physiologically active, nontransformed cultures that are increasingly used to study human pathogenhost interactions (5, 8, 9, 39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first evaluated the variability in the transcriptional response to HRV infection in HIEs by analyzing transcriptomes from one jejunal HIE culture by microarray analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent HIE cultures (individual j11) were mock-inoculated or inoculated with HRV (strain Ito) at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three technical replicates for each condition were analyzed at 6 and 10 h post infection (hpi), as HRV-infected cells lyse by 14 hpi (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of infected cells was 51.4 ± 14.7% (mean ± SD of triplicate cultures) as assessed by flow cytometry, demonstrating that the HRV-infected cultures contain infected cells and uninfected bystander cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal component analysis showed that the first principal component (time point in hpi) explained 42% of the variance in the global gene expression profiles, indicating that time point is an important covariate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second principal component explained 22% of the variance and discriminated the expression profiles based on infection status (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although time and infection status influenced HIE transcriptional profiles, the intraculture transcriptional profiles for a specific combination of time and infection status clustered together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next evaluated interculture variability in the HIE response to HRV infection by microarray analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jejunal HIEs from three individuals (j2, j3, and j11) were mock- or Ito-HRVinfected at a high MOI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentages of HRV-infected cells were 52.9% (j2), 43.9% (j3), and 47.7% (j11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hierarchical clustering of global gene expression profiles accounting for time point revealed that HIEs first clustered by each individual and then by infection status (Fig 1B), indicating significant baseline variability between HIEs derived from different individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess if the response to HRV infection was conserved between HIEs from the three different people, we calculated gene expression fold changes with HRV infection across more than 20,000 transcripts from each individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a significant correlation between HRV-induced transcriptional changes in the three individuals HIEs; the lowest correlations of 0.18 at 6 hpi (between j2 and j11) and 0.31 at 10 hpi (between j3 and j11) correspond to P values less_than2.2 × 1016 (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, 18 genes at 6 hpi and 28 genes at 10 hpi ranked in the top 100 up-regulated genes in each of the three HIEs transcriptional profiles (P less_than 105 for both time points, permutation-based approach; Materials and Methods and Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis of these genes revealed that 16 of 18 and 15 of 28 were ISGs at 6 and 10 hpi, respectively (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, despite a baseline variability at the transcriptional level between HIEs from different individuals, all three mounted a conserved ISG transcriptional response to HRV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA-Sequencing_Analysis_of_HIEs_Reveals_IFN_Signaling_Is_the_Dominant_Pathway_Induced_by_HRV_Infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) experiment on mock- and HRV-infected HIE cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq more accurately measures transcriptional activity than microarrays, particularly of low-expressing genes (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because minimal transcriptional variability was observed between samples from the same individual (Fig 1A), one mock- and one HRV-infected culture of HIEs from two individuals (j2 and j11) were sequenced at 6 hpi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 25% of the RNA-seq reads in the two infected samples mapped to the rotavirus genome, confirming that the infection was robust (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison of microarray and RNA-seq experiments showed significant correlation between baseline gene expression estimates (Spearman correlation R = 0.67, P less_than 2.2 × 1016).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcripts present at levels  greater than 8 in the microarray dataset (referred to here as medium- and high-expressing genes) correlated relatively well with transcript levels in the RNA-seq dataset (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was a wide distribution of transcript levels in the RNA-seq dataset for genes with expression less_than8 in the microarray dataset, confirming that RNA-seq improved the quantification and resolution of transcript levels for low-expressing genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify genes involved in the HIE response to infection, differential expression analysis was performed using HIE origin (j2 or j11) and infection status as the explanatory variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a total of 230 genes differentially expressed by infection status [false discovery rate (FDR) less_than 0.05], 172 were up-regulated and 58 were down-regulated (Fig 2C and Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of these 230 genes revealed that the pathways most affected by HRV infection were IFN signaling (P = 9.8 × 1021) and activation of IRF by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (P = 2.7 × 1012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Examination of those genes that significantly changed with infection (FDR less_than 0.05) and also had an absolute log2 fold change 1 revealed 63 genes, all of which were up-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of these 63 genes again demonstrated that the top induced pathway during HRV infection was IFN signaling (P = 9.6 × 1016; Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these 63 genes, 55 were ISGs and three were IFNs; all three belonged to the type III IFN family (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type I (IFNB1) and type III IFN (IFNL1) had similarly low basal expression levels in the mock-inoculated HIEs (Fig 2D, purple symbols), but only type III IFN (IFNL1, IFNL2, IFNL3) was significantly up-regulated with infection (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified baseline expression levels of ISGs (total, n = 295) in the mock-inoculated HIE cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene-set enrichment analysis showed that ISGs were significantly up-regulated in HRV-infected cultures (P less_than 2.2 × 1016, KolmogorovSmirnov test; Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, IFN-ISG signaling is the dominant pathway induced at the transcriptional level in HRV-infected HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_ISG_Response_to_HRV_Infection_of_HIEs_Is_Regulated_by_Signaling_Through_the_Type_III_IFN_Receptor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Infection-induced gene expression changes were verified by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcript levels of multiple IFNs and ISGs were compared between mock- and HRV-infected jejunal HIE cultures at 6 hpi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The type III IFNs were highly up-regulated in infected cultures from six individuals, with 23(log10) increases in transcript levels of IFNL1 and IFNL2, whereas type I IFNs were only slightly up-regulated (less_than110-fold; Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ISGs constituted the majority of the top up-regulated genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six ISGs (IFI44L, IFIT1, RSAD2, MX1, OAS2, and HERC5) with varying basal expression levels (Fig 2D, red symbols) were assessed for their fold up-regulation by RT-qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up-regulation in the infected cultures ranged from 2.7-fold (MX1) to 35.3-fold (IFIT1; Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the robust induction of the type III IFNs and minimal to no induction of type I IFN (IFNA2 and IFNB1) transcripts, we hypothesized that ISG induction was regulated by signaling through the type III IFN receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this hypothesis by performing HRV infection in the presence of blocking antibodies to the type I or III IFN receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basal expression levels of the six previously tested ISGs in mock-inoculated HIEs from six individuals were not significantly different with or without blocking antibody treatment (P  greater than  0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 6 biological replicates), suggesting minimal to no baseline IFN regulation of these six ISGs in mock-inoculated HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, type III IFN (IFNL1 and IFNL2) transcriptional levels were not significantly different between HRV infections performed with or without type III IFN receptor-blocking antibody treatment (P  greater than  0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 6 biological replicates), indicating that this antibody did not induce nor suppress IFNL transcriptional activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, HRV infection performed in the presence of blocking antibodies to the type III IFN receptor significantly reduced the induction of the six ISGs analyzed, ranging from a 66% reduction in MX1 transcript levels to an 81% reduction in RSAD2 transcript levels compared with HRV infection without receptor-blocking antibodies (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximum (100%) up-regulation of each ISG corresponds to the fold inductions shown in Fig 3B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HRV infection in the presence of a control antibody (isotype matched to the type III IFN receptor-blocking antibody) did not decrease ISG levels compared with infection without antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection performed in the presence of blocking antibodies to type I and type III IFN receptors failed to further suppress ISG levels compared with type III IFN receptor blockade alone (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that signaling through the type III IFN receptor largely regulates ISG induction in response to HRV infection in HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of IFN-ISG transcriptional kinetics at three additional time points showed that IFN transcripts were present at 3 hpi and decreased by 1 log10 at 10 hpi, at which point their levels plateaued (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, up-regulation of ISG transcripts (assessed by using IFI44L as a marker) was not observed at 3 hpi but was present by 10 hpi, demonstrating that the type III IFN response preceded the ISG response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that HRV infection of HIEs results in robust up-regulation of type III IFN, which in turn activates the type III IFN receptor and leads to the induction of ISGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

HRV_Replication_in_HIEs_Is_Not_Restricted_by_Endogenously_Produced_IFN  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HRV infection of epithelial cells in the HIE model induced a type III IFN-regulated ISG response, and IFN receptor signaling appeared to start between 3 and 6 hpi, as ISGs were up-regulated at 6 hpi but not at 3 hpi (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether the endogenous host IFN response can restrict rotavirus replication, HRV replication was assessed in the presence of IFN-receptor blocking antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that inhibiting the host IFN response by blocking IFN signaling would increase virus titer yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, blockade of neither the type I nor type III IFN receptors during multiple rounds of replication significantly increased viral yields by 60 hpi (P = 0.75, KruskalWallis test; Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, neither replication of Ito-HRV nor RRV was enhanced by simultaneous blockade of type I and type III IFN receptors for 60 h (P  greater than  0.05, MannWhitney U test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that, although homologous HRV and heterologous RRV induce a type III IFN response at the epithelial level (Fig S2), this host cell response does not restrict viral growth because rotavirus grows to similar titers regardless of whether the type III IFN response is neutralized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Different_Strains_of_Rotavirus_and_a_dsRNA_Analog_Preferentially_Induce_IFNL_over_IFNB_in_HIEs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The preceding experiments were primarily performed with the human strain Ito, genotype G3P[8].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotavirus infection of HIEs recapitulates the host-range restriction observed in vivo; human strains infect and replicate at higher levels than animal strains such as simian RRV in HIEs (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether the type III IFN induction in response to Ito-HRV infection was strain-specific, HIEs were infected at the same MOI with an additional human strain (Wa, G1P[8]) and a simian strain (RRV; G3P[3]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Irrespective of virus strain, the pattern of IFN induction was similar; all three strains led to increased fold induction of IFNL1 compared with IFNB1 (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, IFNL1 levels were significantly higher in HIEs infected with HRVs than with RRV, suggesting that type III IFN transcriptional intensity is strain-specific depending on the host susceptibility in HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we evaluated if the preferential up-regulation of IFNL1 instead of IFNB1 with rotavirus infection was intestinal segment- or rotavirus-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Responses of 12 different individuals HIEs showed that IFNL1 induction in response to HRV infection was not significantly different across the three sections of the small intestine (P = 0.28, KruskalWallis test), but IFNL1 fold up-regulation was 10100-fold more than IFNB1 in each intestinal section (Fig 5A) despite similar basal expression levels of the two IFNs in uninfected HIEs (Fig 2D, purple symbols).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested the response to the dsRNA analog poly(I:C), which causes robust induction of the type I IFN system in transformed and nontransformed cell lines (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike rotavirus or other viruses (24, 44), poly(I:C) does not antagonize IFN transcriptional responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the response to rotavirus, all 12 HIEs treated with poly(I:C) exhibited significantly increased IFNL1 transcript fold up-regulation (range, 419225,332 fold) compared with IFNB1 (range, 1142 fold; Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that HIEs preferentially respond to rotavirus and dsRNA stimuli with type III IFN rather than type I IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The specific rotavirus PAMP(s) recognized by cellular pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotavirus replication was not thought to release free dsRNA genome into the cell (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, dsRNA has recently been detected independent of viroplasms in animal rotavirus-infected MA104 cells (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dsRNA is a potent PAMP for many other viruses (47), and it is therefore pertinent that the dsRNA analog poly(I:C) and HRV induced similar IFN transcriptional profiles in HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining HIEs for dsRNA and the viroplasm marker nonstructural protein (NSP2) revealed their colocalization in the cytoplasm of infected cells as well as dsRNA independent of viroplasms (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate the presence of viroplasm-independent dsRNA in HRV-infected cells that could be the PAMP recognized by cellular PRRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Majority_of_IFNL_Transcript_in_HRV-Infected_Cells_Is_Not_Translated_into_Detectable_Type_III_IFN_Protein  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Blockade of the type III IFN receptor reduced ISG up-regulation (Fig 3C), suggesting that type III IFN (IFN-) protein was secreted during infection and engaged its receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, either (i) HRV replicated despite high quantities of type III IFN protein or (ii) low levels of type III IFN protein produced during infection were sufficient to induce ISGs but insufficient to restrict viral growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN protein production was evaluated in supernatants from mock-inoculated and HRV-infected HIE cultures by ELISA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite robust up-regulation of IFNL1 transcripts at 6 hpi (Fig S3A), IFN-1 and IFN-2/3 proteins were below the limit of detection in the supernatant from infected HIEs at multiple time points (648 hpi) and under multiple different conditions, including from a homogenate of supernatant and cell lysate (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggested that HRV infection induced type III IFN protein at levels below the limit of detection of standard ELISAs but sufficient to induce ISGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was confirmed by observing that exogenous treatment of HIEs with concentrations of IFN-1 protein below the limit of detection of standard ELISAs (less_than2 U/mL; Materials and Methods) induced ISGs (Fig 6A) to similar levels as HRV (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotavirus infection of transformed cells also induces the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High but similar levels of IL-8 were detected in HIE supernatants from mock- and HRV-infected samples previously tested for IFN (P  greater than  0.05 at each time point, MannWhitney U test; Fig S3B), showing that not all host proteins were as affected by HRV infection as type III IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rotavirus antagonizes IFN production pretranscriptionally in a variety of cell lines (HT29, Caco-2, and 293T) through degradation of factors involved in IFN transcription (35, 4951).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed robust type III IFN transcription with HRV and poly(I:C) treatment (1001,000-fold increases; Fig 5), but protein was detected only from poly(I:C)-treated HIEs at 8 hpi (Fig 6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next evaluated the possibility of rotavirus-mediated inhibition of IFNL1 translation in HIEs treated with HRV and/or poly(I:C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN-1 protein levels were below the limit of detection from mock- and HRV-infected HIEs, but were 224 pg/mL from poly(I:C)-treated HIEs at 20 hpi (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IFN-1 protein level significantly decreased to 41 pg/mL when poly(I:C)-treated HIEs were also infected with HRV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data (Fig 6 B and C) indicate a rotavirus-mediated posttranscriptional partial suppression of host IFNL1 mRNA translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, IFN-1 protein from HIE supernatant was below the limit of detection by ELISA (sensitivity, 2 pg/mL) for each of the four conditions described in Fig 6C at 20 hpi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rotavirus antagonism of the host response is primarily mediated through the nonstructural proteins NSP1 and NSP3, which are present only in cells infected with replication-competent virus (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed if viral antagonism of the IFN response in HIEs was a replication-dependent process by treating HIEs with purified, inactivated HRV particles that contain the dsRNA genome, structural proteins, and can enter cells but do not transcribe viral mRNAs or express nonstructural proteins (16, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivated HRV induced 10-fold higher transcript levels of IFNL1 and IFNB1 compared with replication-competent virus early after infection (Fig 7A), demonstrating that the robust IFNL1 transcriptional response induced by replication-competent HRV is partially antagonized at a pretranscriptional state by infectious virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, high levels of IFN-1 protein were detected from HIEs treated with inactivated (i.e., replication-incompetent) HRV (Fig 7B), but only if infection was performed in the presence of antibody to the type III IFN receptor, suggesting that secreted IFN-1 protein rapidly bound its receptor and did not remain free in the supernatant for an extended duration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar technique of using receptor-blocking antibodies to enhance cytokine detection has been described for IL-4 (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, IFN transcriptional induction in HRV-infected HIEs is replication-independent, but pre- and posttranscriptional antagonism of the IFN response in HRV-infected HIEs is replication-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Exogenous_IFN_Treatment_Restricts_Rotavirus_Growth_in_HIEs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Endogenously produced IFN did not restrict HRV growth in HIEs (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, endogenous type III IFN restricts animal rotavirus replication in mice (54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mouse epithelium was thought to produce the type III IFN in vivo, although immune cells can also produce type III IFN (54, 56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, murine type I IFN predominantly originates from lamina propria immune cells during rotavirus infection (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulated the presence of surrounding lamina propria immune cells by adding IFN before infection to compare the potential of exogenous type I and type III IFN to restrict rotavirus growth in HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anti-rotavirus efficacy of type I IFN vs. type III IFN was compared by pretreating HIEs for 24 h with escalating doses of IFN-1 or IFN-1 ranging from 100 to 10,000 U/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN was subsequently washed off, and the HIEs were infected with HRV at a low MOI to allow for multiple rounds of replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN-1 and IFN-1 inhibited HRV replication, but inhibition by IFN-1 was weaker than IFN-1 at all concentrations (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximal inhibition of HRV replication by IFN-1 (79%) was achieved at 1,000 U/mL of IFN-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, each 10-fold increase in IFN-1 concentration reduced viral replication by 10-fold, with replication 90% inhibited with 100 U/mL of IFN-1 and completely inhibited with 10,000 U/mL IFN-1 (Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our studies focused on IFN-1 and IFN-1 because we did not find differences in transcriptional up-regulation between IFNL1-3 and because IFNB1 was the only type I IFN that was even slightly up-regulated (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, heterogeneity in the antiviral properties of different type I and type III IFN variants has been reported with respect to other viruses (59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare efficacies of alternative type I and type III IFNs, HIEs were pretreated with IFN-3 (type III IFN) or IFN-2 (type I IFN) and compared with their analogs, IFN-1 and IFN-1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant difference between the two type III IFNs; both reduced viral replication by 80% (Fig 8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, pretreatment with IFN-1 was significantly more protective than IFN-2, indicating heterogeneity in the anti-rotavirus efficacy of the different type I IFNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The HRV replication cycle in HIEs is rapid, with new progeny virus present by 7 hpi (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the time needed for IFN to establish an antiviral state, HIEs were treated for 6 or 24 h with IFN-1 or IFN-1 before HRV infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following 6 h of pretreatment, IFN-1 and IFN-1 reduced viral replication by 62% and 93%, respectively (Fig 8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h of pretreatment, the antiviral efficacy of IFN-1 increased an additional 26% (88% protection), whereas the antiviral efficacy of IFN-1 was only slightly enhanced to 99% after 24 h of pretreatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, exogenous IFN-1 induced a faster and more effective anti-rotavirus state in epithelial cells than IFN-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The protective effects of IFN- in acute rotavirus infection in mice are enhanced by IL-22, which also cured chronic murine rotavirus infection (54, 61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the HIE model, pretreatment with IL-22 decreased HRV replication by 54% (Fig 8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, IL-22 did not significantly enhance the efficacy of low-dose (100 U/mL) or high-dose (1,000 U/mL) IFN-1 under the conditions tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conjunction with the results from Fig 8A, these data demonstrate that the anti-HRV efficacy of IFN- saturates between 80% and 90% in HIEs, regardless of whether higher doses or an additional cytokine (IL-22) are used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IFNs are typically present at very low basal levels before infection in vivo and are induced following detection of microbial PAMPs during infection (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simulate this condition, HIEs were first infected with HRV and, 1.5 h later, exogenous IFN-1 or IFN-1 was added to the maintenance media for the duration of the infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 24 and 48 hpi, viral growth in IFN-1- or IFN-1treated HIEs was reduced by 5055% (IFN-1) and 79% (IFN-1) compared with that in untreated HIEs (Fig 8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral growth was not further restricted by treating HIEs during infection with a combination of 1,000 U/mL IFN-1 and 1,000 U/mL IFN-1 compared with 1,000 U/mL IFN-1 alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HIEs provide a new model to evaluate the human small intestinal epithelial response to infection and assess human host effects by generating HIEs from multiple individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the basal human epithelial transcriptome differs significantly between HIEs from different individuals, and this person effect was more pronounced than the response to enteric viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings highlight that transcriptional data from single individual sources, such as cell lines, may have limited generalizability as they cannot capture the distinct transcriptional signatures exhibited by different individual sources and across small intestinal segments (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inherent variability captured in the HIE model provides a unique opportunity to study similarities and differences in susceptibility to enteric infection among individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite a significant baseline person effect at the transcriptional level, all 14 lines of HIEs tested responded to HRV infection with a single predominant and conserved type III IFN-regulated ISG pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of a type I IFN response in these cells is consistent with the knowledge that murine type I IFN is produced by immune cells and not intestinal epithelial cells following murine rotavirus infection (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The innate type III IFN response in HIEs was preserved irrespective of rotavirus strain or replication competency or following treatment with the dsRNA analog poly(I:C), a potent PAMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rotavirus PAMP(s) that drives the type III IFN response is unknown, but rotavirus dsRNA is a potential candidate, as we and others (46) detected viroplasm-free dsRNA in the cytoplasm of rotavirus-infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dsRNA [mimicked by poly(I:C)] can induce type I and III IFN and is a key intermediate in the replication cycle of many viruses, including other major human enteric viral pathogens (13, 43, 47, 64, 65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that human intestinal epithelial cells are programmed to respond to viral dsRNA with type III rather than type I IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A preferential type III vs. type I IFN response to viral infection and dsRNA analogs does not appear to be common to all human epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas primary hepatocytes also respond to HBV/HCV and poly(I:C) predominantly with type III IFN (66, 67), primary lung epithelial cells respond to influenza virus infection and poly(I:C) with type I and III IFN (43, 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the type of IFN induced in response to infection appears to be cell- and/or virus-specific rather than a pan-epithelial intrinsic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific cellular factors that predispose induction of type III IFN or type I IFN are unclear because regulation of IFN is complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both types of IFN are induced by similar stimuli and generally rely on similar transcription factors, such as NF-B and the IRF family (30), but preferential activation of type III IFN may be influenced by other transcription factors (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, peroxisomal content (70) and cell differentiation status (70) may significantly influence type III IFN induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is notable that the rotavirus capsid protein VP4 has a peroxisomal targeting motif (71) and that rotavirus infection of HIEs requires differentiated HIEs (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether any of these factors influences the preferential type III IFN innate response of HIEs to HRV and poly(I:C) remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The predominant type III IFN response and its regulation of ISG induction observed in our studies with HIEs is consistent with previous studies reporting that murine intestinal epithelial cells from poly(I:C)-injected and murine rotavirus-infected mice exhibit equal or greater fold inductions of type III IFN than type I IFN transcripts (17, 55, 56, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with results using transformed human colonic cell lines that respond to rotavirus infection and poly(I:C) with type I IFN- at the transcript and protein levels, and type I IFN regulates ISG induction in these cells (16, 42, 72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transformed cells often have significant deficits in their response to pathogens, including in IFN signaling pathways (73, 74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It seems likely that this critical difference in IFN responses to rotavirus and poly(I:C) between immortalized cell lines and nontransformed HIE cultures is partially attributed to their transformation status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite robust up-regulation of type III IFN at the transcriptional level, rotaviral replication was not enhanced by neutralization of the type III IFN receptor in HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was unexpected because enteric viral replication (rotavirus, reovirus, murine norovirus) is enhanced in mice lacking the type III IFN receptor (5456, 75), even though it is notable that neutralization of the type III IFN response had a limited effect on reovirus replication (approximately twofold increase in viral transcripts) in a human colonic transformed cell line (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basis for the apparent discrepancy may be multifactorial and include differences in how the IFN system was blocked (neutralizing antibodies vs. receptor KOs), development of alternate compensatory pathways in IFN-KO mice, and/or differences in human and mouse type III IFN subtype expression (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of these differences, HRV infection inhibited the IFN response by HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most pathogenic viruses, including rotavirus, have developed ways to subvert IFN responses at multiple steps in their biologic pathways (24, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotavirus evades the host innate response primarily through its nonstructural proteins NSP1 and NSP3, and the structural protein VP3 has recently been shown to antagonize the cellular RNaseL antiviral response as well (33, 76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several in vitro models, rotavirus NSP1 inhibits the host IFN response by preventing IFN from being transcribed (35, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have shown that NSP1 acts as an adaptor that links the host CullinE3 ligase complex with -transducin repeat-containing protein (-TrCP), which is a necessary component for NF-Bmediated induction of IFN transcripts (77, 78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this interaction with the CullinE3 ligase complex, NSP1 facilitates the proteasomal degradation of itself and -TrCP (78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using HIEs as a model, it was further shown that -TrCP degradation by HRV was mitigated by inhibition of CullinRING ubiquitin ligases, demonstrating that HRV antagonizes IFN transcription by hijacking host proteins (78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not evaluate this in our studies, this mechanism may help explain the lower levels of IFN transcripts observed when HIEs were infected with replication-competent HRV compared with inactivated HRV, which does not produce NSP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although replication-competent HRV inhibited type III IFN transcription 10-fold compared with inactivated HRV, type III IFN transcripts were still robustly induced in replication-competent HRV-infected HIEs (100-1,000 fold) and are present at high levels in intestinal epithelial cells from rotavirus-infected mice (54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that the transcriptional regulatory pathways upstream of IFN induction remain at least partially intact in these models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, rotavirus can also inhibit host responses by decreasing translation of host mRNA through multiple mechanisms primarily via the protein NSP3 (24, 7981).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these mechanisms do not selectively antagonize IFN, production of IFN protein is likely reduced when there is a global decrease in host translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, translational inhibition is a potent method for HRV to antagonize the type III IFN antiviral response because IFN- protein was significantly decreased in HIEs infected with replication-competent HRV compared with inactivated HRV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because very low levels of IFN- protein are required to elicit the ISG responses observed in HRV-infected HIEs, our data suggest that minimal amounts of type III IFN protein were produced during HRV infection of HIEs: enough to induce ISGs but not enough to restrict viral growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest there may be a threshold level of IFN production and perhaps ISG production needed to restrict viral growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this represents the paradox of IFN responses in HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to HRV-infected HIEs, high levels of IFN- protein are detected in the small intestine from rotavirus-infected mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies examined whole small intestinal homogenates; therefore, the cellular origin of the IFN- protein could not be determined (17, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Murine intestinal epithelial cells were proposed to be the major source of IFN- protein in these homogenates because IFNL transcript levels were approximately four to five fold higher in intestinal epithelial cells than in hematopoietic cells (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our data demonstrate that IFNL transcripts do not parallel protein levels in epithelial cells during rotavirus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hematopoietic cells can produce IFN- protein in response to multiple viruses (57), and a recent study has demonstrated that steady-state IFN- in the intestine may actually originate from CD45+ hematopoietic cells rather than epithelial cells in uninfected mice (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the HIE and mouse data suggest that the predominant source of the IFN- protein in the small intestine in response to rotavirus infection may be of hematopoietic rather than epithelial origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lamina propria hematopoietic cells are the primary source of type I IFN during rotavirus infection in mice, rather than intestinal epithelial cells (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with our data in which HIEs produced no detectable IFN- protein in response to HRV, and blockade of the type I IFN system had minimal to no effect on transcription of the six ISGs assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the origin of type I IFN in humans, as in mice in vivo, is extraepithelial, such as from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simulated the effect of extraepithelial sources of IFN by exogenously treating HIEs with IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with type I IFN- was significantly more effective than type III IFN at restricting HRV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This differs from reports in mice, in which exogenous treatment with IFN- is more protective against enteric viral replication than type I IFN (55, 56), and type I IFN is primarily considered to inhibit systemic spread of enteric viruses (17, 56, 75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference may be a result of the type I IFN subtype tested; previous studies in mice and HIEs used an IFN- subtype rather than IFN- for exogenous treatment (17, 55, 56, 83); however, IFN-2 was significantly weaker than IFN- in restricting HRV growth in HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterogeneity in the host response to different type I IFNs has been previously characterized; IFN- binds the type I IFN receptor with greater affinity than IFN-2 (84), and other viral pathogens including LCMV and HCV have differing sensitivities to IFN- and IFN- (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the choice of type I IFN tested may have a significant impact on the evaluation of IFN antiviral efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that treatment with human type I IFN- potently decreases local spread and replication of enteric viruses in the human intestinal epithelium, but whether extraepithelial production of type I IFN during infection in vivo is of sufficient quantity or interacts with epithelial cells to impact homologous virus replication remains a question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ISGs required to limit HRV replication have yet to be identified, as individual ISG efficacy is virus-specific (31), but exogenous IFN- likely induces these ISGs to higher levels and/or at a faster rate than IFN- in the human intestinal epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A current limitation of the HIE system is that it lacks the microbiome, and immune cells have yet to be incorporated with the epithelial cells to create a model that recapitulates the complex cross-talk that occurs in the small intestine (85, 86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we partially simulated the role of immune cells on epithelial cells by exogenously adding IFN to HIE cultures, we were not able to evaluate the effects of epithelial-produced IFN- on immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmacytoid dendritic cells respond to exogenous IFN- as well as produce large amounts of type III and type I IFN protein (30, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the possibility of IFN-mediated cross-talk between intestinal epithelial cells and intestinal plasmacytoid dendritic cells and leaves open the prospect that epithelial-derived IFN- can act on and even induce its own production from immune cells because IFN- is an ISG itself (87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As HIE platforms and cellular coculture techniques are further developed, it will be possible to dissect such microbiomeimmuneepithelial interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better understand infectious disease pathogenesis, hostpathogen interactions are studied in model systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these models can yield differing results depending on the choice of host organism and pathogen strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly relevant for human infections because modeling human pathogens in vivo is often impractical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advances in the organoid/enteroid and transcriptomic fields provide much needed tools to study hostpathogen interactions in the human intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, RNA-seq of iPSC-derived human intestinal organoids treated with the human enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium revealed new insights into how the epithelium responds to bacterial infection with a proinflammatory transcriptional profile (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like Salmonella Typhimurium, many human enteric viruses also lack robust models, and our studies demonstrate that HIEs are a useful model to study the human enteric virus HRV (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, a complex hostpathogen interplay between the human intestinal epithelial type III IFN system and viral antagonism of this response is described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although epithelial-derived type III IFN has been proposed as a critical defense against murine enteric viruses (5456), our data are consistent with a recent report showing type III IFN does not significantly restrict homologous murine rotavirus infection (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the type III IFN system is activated in HIEs following HRV infection, the virus effectively evades this epithelial antiviral response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether other human enteric viruses similarly evade the type III IFN system remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent cultivation of human noroviruses in HIEs establishes HIEs as a relevant model for studying hostpathogen interactions of other human enteric viruses in addition to HRV (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limited role of type III IFN in restricting HRV replication in the human epithelium raises the question of whether virus-induced type III IFN has undiscovered biologic functions in the mucosal epithelium that are not directly antiviral but may have alternative effects on bystander epithelial and/or nonepithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that HIEs are derived from nontransformed human small intestinal tissue and can be generated from many different individuals, they provide a preclinical model for assessing the host response to human enteric pathogens and an additional system to evaluate if findings in animal models can be translated directly to human tissue or if important differences in these systems exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Microarray-Based_Transcriptome_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChips (Illumina) were used for microarray analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptome analysis was performed by using R statistical software (88).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two microarray experiments were performed: the first experiment included samples from a single individuals HIEs (j11) and the second with samples of HIE cultures from three individuals (j2, j3, and j11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first and second microarray experiments, 20,948 genes were defined as expressed and used in subsequent analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression values for these 20,948 genes were quantile normalized by using the normalize.quantiles() function of the preprocessCore R library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the microarray-acquired data is described in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

African green monkey kidney (MA104) cells were grown in Dulbeccos modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen and Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional cultures of HIEs were generated, cultured, and infected with rotavirus as detailed by Saxena et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each culture/sample of HIEs from an individual person contains many (50100) single 3D HIEs of varying size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calculations of MOI are based on the total number of cells within a sample of HIEs rather than the number of individual HIE units (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three different types of media were used to wash (complete medium without growth factors [CMGF()]), proliferate [complete medium with growth factors (CMGF+)], and differentiate/maintain (differentiation medium) the HIEs, which are detailed by Saxena et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific HIEs used in each experiment are referred to by the intestinal segment of origin followed by a number.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Culture codes beginning with d correspond to duodenal HIEs, j to jejunal HIEs, and i to ileal HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Viruses_and_Viral_Infections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RRV and HRV strains Wa and Ito were grown in MA104 cells in the presence of 2 g/mL of trypsin (Worthington Biochemical) and 10 mM CaCl2, titered by fluorescent focus assay (FFA) (37) and expressed in FFU.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MOI was calculated according to the formula (infectious virus based on FFA titers in MA104 cells)/(total number of cells), and MOI is represented as FFU per cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of cells in a sample of HIEs was quantified with a Coulter particle counter (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inoculum for infections performed at an MOI of less_than0.5 FFU per cell was a lysate of rotavirus-infected MA104 cells, and uninfected MA104 lysate was used for the mock inoculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inoculum for infections performed at an MOI of  greater than 0.5 FFU per cell consisted of purified triple-layered particles (TLPs) of rotavirus, and an equal volume of TNC (10 mM Tris·HCl, 140 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) buffer was used as the mock inoculum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TLPs were purified from viral lysate by using a CsCl gradient (89) followed by centrifugation (2 h, 35,000 rpm; SW 41 Ti rotor) through a 20% sucrose cushion in TNC buffer to remove excess cesium and then dialysis in TNC buffer using a Slide-A-Lyzer cassette (molecular weight cutoff, 3.5 kDa; Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove residual sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To make inactivated rotavirus particles, an aliquot of purified Ito-HRV TLPs was treated with 40 g/mL of psoralen-AMT (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A4330; Sigma-Aldrich) and UV-irradiated for 2 h (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inactivated-HRV produced no fluorescent foci on MA104 cells in an FFA, demonstrating replication incompetence of the inactivated viral preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIEs were infected with equal amounts (in micrograms) of Ito-HRV and inactivated HRV based on the protein concentration of each viral preparation, which was determined with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Viral infections, assessment of the percentage of infected cells by flow cytometry, and quantification of viral replication in 3D HIEs were performed as described by Saxena et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIEs were differentiated for 34 d before infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For infections performed at an MOI less_than0.5, viral inoculum was washed off after 11.5 hpi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HIE maintenance media applied after washing off nonadsorbed virus contained 0.5 mg/mL of porcine pancreatin (Sigma-Aldrich) to allow for multiple rounds of replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For infections performed at higher MOIs, viral inoculum was washed off after 11.5 hpi but did not include pancreatin in the subsequent maintenance (i.e., differentiation) media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HRV indicates Ito-HRV unless specifically stated otherwise, and all rotavirus preparations were treated with 10 g/mL of trypsin (Worthington) for 30 min at 37 °C before use in infections to activate the VP4 spike protein (89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the FFA to quantify viral titers was performed with MA104 cells to measure the amount of infectious virus in the HIEs and surrounding media, we evaluated the possibility that IFN in the media could inhibit rotavirus infection of MA104 cells during viral titration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stock aliquots of Ito-HRV were incubated with no IFN (control) or 1,000 U/mL of IFN-1 or IFN-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MA104 cells were then inoculated with control (Ito-HRV) aliquots or IFN-treated Ito-HRV aliquots for 1 h, washed twice, incubated overnight in DMEM, and fixed in cold methanol for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral titers were obtained by FFA as described (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The viral titers were equivalent in control and IFN-spiked aliquots, demonstrating that our results in Fig 8 were not confounded by titration of the HIE-produced rotavirus particles in the presence of IFN on MA104 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (3 m) of 3D HIEs (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect dsRNA, the mouse anti-dsRNA J2 antibody that detects dsRNA structures greater than 40 bp was used (1:100; Scions) (48, 90).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rotavirus viroplasmic marker NSP2 was detected by using a guinea-pig anti-NSP2 antibody at a concentration of 1:500 (91).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondary antibodies were used at a concentration of 1:500 (Rockland Immunochemicals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cytokines__Agonists__Antibodies__and_ELISA_Kits  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All human IFNs were obtained from PBL Assay Science and stored according to the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN concentrations were based on standardized international units, which were quantified by the manufacturer by using a cytopathic effect inhibition assay in which the EC50 of encephalomyocarditis virus infection on A549 cells is 1 U/mL of IFN, regardless of IFN subtype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human IL-22 was quantified by and purchased from PeproTech.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIEs were treated with high molecular weight poly(I:C) HMW (InvivoGen) by direct application of poly(I:C) suspended in CMGF() onto HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The type III IFN receptor was blocked with a polyclonal sheep antibody (25 g/mL) against the IL28RA subunit (cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AF5260, lot CCXR01; R&D Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, use of this antibody for blocking purposes has not been characterized or described before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we characterized the antibody for this new indication in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A mixture of antibodies was used to block the type I IFN system: polyclonal rabbit anti-human IFN- serum (6.88 × 102 NU/mL; cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  311301, lot 5896; PBL), protein A purified polyclonal rabbit anti-human IFN- (4.3 × 102 NU/mL; cat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  314051, lot 5277; PBL), and a monoclonal mouse anti-IFNAR2 antibody (10 g/mL; clone MMHAR-2, lot 5989; PBL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three of these anti-type I IFN antibodies were used together to block signaling through the type I IFN receptor; no experiment used only one or two of the anti-type I IFN antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We verified that blocking antibodies [anti-type III IFN receptor (anti-IL28RA) and anti-type I IFN system (anti-IFNAR2, antiIFN-, antiIFN-)] did not contain rotavirus-neutralizing antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stock aliquots of Ito-HRV were incubated with the blocking antibodies, followed by titration on MA104 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no significant change in viral titer compared with the control aliquots, indicating that the blocking antibodies were not contaminated with antibodies that influence the assessment of rotavirus infectivity (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the maintenance media during HRV growth experiments contains pancreatin, we also evaluated the stability of the receptor-blocking antibodies in the presence of pancreatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIEs were incubated with antibodies to the type I IFN or type III IFN receptors in the presence of 0.5 mg/mL pancreatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1 h, 100 U/mL of IFN-1 or 100 U/mL of IFN-1 was added to the HIEs, which were maintained in pancreatin-containing media for the duration of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 26 h of IFN treatment, the levels of the ISG OAS2 were evaluated in HIEs treated with IFN alone or with IFN and receptor-blocking antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with untreated HIEs, OAS2 was up-regulated in IFN-1treated and IFN-1treated HIEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when HIEs were incubated with IFN receptor-blocking antibodies before IFN treatment, OAS2 levels did not increase relative to untreated HIEs, indicating that the antibodies had the ability to block the effect of IFN even when the surrounding media contained pancreatin (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we confirmed that the antibodies blocked the inhibitory effect of IFN-1 and IFN-1 on rotavirus replication; viral growth was equivalent in control HIEs compared with HIEs that were pretreated with exogenous IFN in the presence of IFN receptor-blocking antibodies before infection (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The amounts of HIE-secreted IFN-1, IFN-2/3, and IL-8 were quantified by using ELISA kits from eBioscience according to the manufacturers protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the VeriKine Human IFN- ELISA kit (PBL) and the VeriKine-HS Human IFN- ELISA kit (PBL) were used to assess for IFN- secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values below the limit of detection by ELISA were represented as one half of the limit of detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limits of detection of IFN-1, IFN-2/3, and IFN- by ELISA were 8 pg/mL, 15.6 pg/mL, and 50 pg/mL (1.2 pg/mL for the VeriKine-HS Human IFN- ELISA), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the high sensitivity (2 pg/mL) of the IL-8 ELISA, the cell culture supernatant was initially diluted 1:20 for testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the IFN-1 ELISA (eBioscience) quantified IFN-1 amount by weight (in picograms) and the IFN-1 (PBL) used for HIE treatment was quantified by International Units, a standard curve was generated to assess the limit of detection by ELISA of PBL-obtained IFN-1 (units).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IFN-1 ELISA limit of detection of 8 pg/mL by weight corresponded to a limit of detection of 24 U/mL of IFN-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before assessing HIE supernatants for protein content by ELISA, HIEs were centrifuged at 400 × g for 3 min to pellet the cells from the supernatant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant was then collected and placed directly onto the ELISA plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify protein content from concentrated media (Table S1), supernatant was combined from multiple samples and was concentrated through an Amicon Ultra-4 filter unit with a 10-kDa cutoff per the manufacturers instructions (Merck Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Extraction_and_RT-qPCR_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immediately before RNA extraction, HIEs were centrifuged at 400 × g for 35 min, and the supernatant was discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNA was extracted from pelleted HIEs by using the QIAshredder kit and RNeasy Mini Kit followed by treatment with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen) for all experiments, including microarray and RNA-seq experiments, except for the experiments described in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3A and S4B, in which the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit was used (Zymo Research).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptional analyses performed in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38 were determined by RT-qPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RT-qPCR was performed (10) by using TaqMan primer-probe mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the following accession identification numbers: Hs99999905_m1 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GAPDH), Hs00601677_g1 (IFN-1, IFNL1), Hs00820125_g1 (IFN-2, IFNL2), Hs00265051_s1 (IFN-2, IFNA2), Hs01077958_s1 (IFN-1, IFNB1), Hs00174103_m1 (IL-8, IL8), Hs00915292_m1 (IFN-induced protein 44-like, IFI44L), Hs01911452_s1 (IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1, IFIT1), Hs00942643_m1 (2-5-oligoadenylate synthetase 2, OAS2), Hs00180943_m1 (HECT and RLD domain containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 5, HERC5), Hs00369813_m1 (radical S-adenosyl methionine domain-containing 2, RSAD2), and Hs00895608_m1 (MX dynamin-like GTPase 1, MX1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all transcriptional fold changes determined by RT-qPCR, total RNA was extracted from infected HIE cultures and compared with matched uninfected (mock-inoculated) HIE cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression levels were first normalized to GAPDH levels and analyzed by using StepOne version 2.1 software (Applied Biosystems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fold increase was calculated by application of the 2Ct method as previously described (97).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microarray-Based_Transcriptome_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Principal component analysis was performed on global gene expression data of the first microarray experiment by using the princomp() function of the stats R library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clustering analysis was performed on global gene expression data of the second microarray experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for time point as a covariate, gene expression values were corrected by regressing out the time point status for each gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, Spearman correlation of gene expression values was calculated between all possible sample pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete linkage clustering was performed on 1  Spearman coefficient by using the hclust() function of the stats R library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Correspondence between the global transcriptional responses to infection across HIEs from different individuals was assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene-expression fold changes between infected and uninfected cultures were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, Spearman rank correlation of the fold changes was calculated between the three HIEs from different individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the significance of gene overlap across the 100 most up-regulated genes, we used a permutation-based approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 100,000 permutations, we randomly selected 100 genes from the 20,948 expressed genes three times and counted how many genes were chosen all three times for each permutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA-seqBased_Transcriptome_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total RNA was extracted, and RNA-seq was performed on rRNA-reduced samples of RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reads acquired from RNA-seq were aligned to the human hg19 and hg38 reference genomes by using STAR (version 2.3.1) (92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Totals of 87%, 86%, 68%, and 68% of reads for samples j11-uninfected, j2-uninfected, j11-infected, and j2-infected aligned uniquely to the human genome, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reads from this RNA-seq experiment for each of the four samples were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus database under accession no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSE90796.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify rotavirus RNA sequences, the resulting unmapped reads were mapped against a preassembled database of all rotavirus genomes from GenBank using Bowtie 2 (93) with default settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For analysis of gene expression, read summarization was performed by using the featureCounts function of the Subread package (94) and the Ensembl gene annotation gtf file with genome-build-accession identifier NCBI:GCA_000001405.14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes with less than one read per 10 million sequenced reads in two or more samples were excluded from subsequent analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene-expression estimates were normalized for gene length and sequencing depth by using the DESeq2 normalization method (95).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondence between gene expression estimates derived from microarrays and RNA-seq was assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the gene symbols, 13,696 genes were profiled in the microarrays and RNA-seq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean expression levels of these 13,696 genes were calculated across the three uninfected samples from the second microarray experiment and the two uninfected RNA-seq samples independently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, Spearman rank correlation was used to evaluate correspondence between mean expression levels derived from microarrays and RNA-seq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential expression analysis was conducted by using R statistical software in conjunction with the DESeq2 (version 1.2.10) package (95).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, samples were normalized for sequencing depth by using the standard DESeq2 function estimateSizeFactors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DESeq2 modeling framework is based on the negative binomial distribution and uses the DESeq2 normalized gene counts as input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model, we accounted for a person effect and used infection status as the explanatory variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify ISGs in the RNA-seq dataset, the sequenced gene set was compared with the open-access Interferome version 2.01 database of IFN-regulated genes (96).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathway analysis was performed on genes identified by RNA-seq using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical analyses on data (not including microarray and RNA-seq results) were performed with Excel (Microsoft) and GraphPad Prism (GraphPad) software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For data with samples sizes 4, a nonparametric test such as the MannWhitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For data with samples sizes of three, an unpaired Students t test was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were considered significant when the P value or FDR was less_than0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For graphs plotted on a logarithmic axis, the data are represented as the geometric mean ± 95% confidence interval (CI) of the geometric mean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all other graphs, the data are represented as the arithmetic mean ± SD or SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are depicted as a single representative experiment from multiple repeat independent experiments or as a compilation figure of multiple independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Technical replicates refer to experimental replicates of HIEs from the same individual, and biological replicates refer to experimental replicates of HIEs from different individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
