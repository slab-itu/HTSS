Initial elevation bias in subjective reports  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peoples reports of their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are essential assessment tools in biomedical and social science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When subjective states have been studied over time, however, researchers have often observed an unpredicted and puzzling decrease with repeated assessments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results across multiple outcomes in four field experiments suggest that this pattern is due to an initial elevation bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is larger for reports of internal states than for behaviors and for negative mental states and physical symptoms than for positive states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This initial elevation bias needs to be considered in all types of research using subjective reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Peoples reports of their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are used in many fields of biomedical and social science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When these states have been studied over time, researchers have often observed an unpredicted and puzzling decrease with repeated assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When noted, this pattern has been called an attenuation effect, suggesting that the effect is due to bias in later reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the pattern could also be consistent with an initial elevation bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present systematic, experimental investigations of this effect in four field studies (study 1: n = 870; study 2: n = 246; study 3: n = 870; study 4: n = 141).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings show clear support for an initial elevation bias rather than a later decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bias is larger for reports of internal states than for behaviors and for negative mental states and physical symptoms than for positive states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We encourage increased awareness and investigation of this initial elevation bias in all research using subjective reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_1__Demonstrating_the_IELD_Effect_in_a_Diary_Study_of_Bar_Examination_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study 1 was a survey of recent law school graduates and their intimate partners carried out between 20012003 during the 4-wk period before the graduates took a state bar admissions examination and the week following the examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary goal of the survey was to study support processes (14), but the survey also had a design component to study the IELD effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Couples were assigned to one of four conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of couples (n = 393) were in condition 1: They completed twice-daily reports (morning and evening, hereafter AM and PM, respectively) for 44 d, starting 35 d before the examination, including the two examination days, and continuing for 7 d afterward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The twice-daily design allowed the initial report to be studied in absolute terms (first AM report) and more relative terms (reports in first day of study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conditions 2, 3, and 4, groups of couples were asked to make initial reports on day 22 (2 wk before the examination; n = 66), on day 35 (1 d before the examination; n = 27), or on day 44 (1 wk after the examination; n = 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examine IELD patterns for reports of anxious and vigorous mood, physical symptoms, and time spent studying (examinees only), using both within-subjects comparisons of respondents initial reports (day 1 of reporting) with matched subsequent reports (day 8 of reporting) and between-subjects comparisons of persons in condition 1 (the daily diary) with persons responding for the first time closer to the examination (conditions 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 illustrates the design and results for PM anxious mood reports for the examinees.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The examination was on days 36 and 37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The survey form for all four conditions was the same; it obtained right now reports of moods and retrospective reports of physical symptoms and time spent studying during the prior 24 h. One can see from Fig 1 (group 1) that PM anxiety generally increased from the first week of examination preparation to the days of the examination and that there was a remarkable recovery to low daily anxiety in the week following the examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern is completely consistent with theoretical and intuitive expectations of the effect of stressor temporal imminence (15) and supports a claim of construct validity for the daily measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that this pattern allows us to consider the group 1 diary reports on days 22, 35, and 44 as a standard that allows the bias of the initial reports on those days to be estimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also use this pattern to examine a more conservative estimate of bias for the first diary day of the series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stressor imminence predicts that days closer to the examination will be more distressing than days more distal to the examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anxiety on day 8, which is the same day of the week as day 1, should therefore be higher on average than on day 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insofar as the opposite is observed, an IELD effect can be conservatively estimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The day 1 minus day 8 comparison for AM anxiety yielded a Cohens d of 0.47 [t(285) = 8.28, P less_than 0.0001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We report IELD effects as if they are initial elevations rather than later declines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows us to represent the expected effects as positive in sign rather than negative.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison for PM anxiety yielded a d of 0.26 [t(284) = 4.50, P less_than 0.0001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cohens d (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10, p. 20) estimates were obtained by calculating the mean within-subject change and dividing it by the pooled between-subject SD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Cohen, small, medium, and large effect sizes for d are 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8, respectively; the AM anxiety effect size would thus be classified as medium and the PM anxiety effect size as small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1 shows the results for the within-subject IELD effects for anxious mood as well as for AM and PM vigorous mood, PM physical symptoms, and PM reports of how many hours the examinee spent studying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like anxious mood, there was a significant IELD effect for reports of physical symptoms [d = 0.39, t(288) = 5.28, P less_than 0.0001] but not for vigorous mood in the AM or PM, or for study time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next compared the anxious mood reports of the diary group at days 22, 35, and 44 with the reports of the three panels that completed the same survey form for the first time on those days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The between-subjects comparisons at day 22 revealed significant IELD effects for the negative experiences of anxious moods and physical symptoms but not for vigorous mood or study time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect sizes of the significant IELD effects tended to be larger for the between-subjects tests than for within-subject tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Cohens classification, the AM anxious mood effect [d = 0.82, t(332) = 5.46, P less_than 0.0001] and the PM physical symptoms effect [d = 0.80, t(332) = 5.72, P less_than 0.0001] were large, and the PM anxious mood effect was small to medium [d = 0.35, t(331) = 2.29, P less_than 0.03].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On day 35, the eve of the examination, only one outcome showed an IELD effect: Those in the diary group reported fewer physical symptoms than those in day 35-only group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As is apparent in Fig 1, there were no group differences in PM anxiety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, on day 44 there were large IELD effects for AM anxious mood [d = 0.84, t(263) = 3.83, P less_than 0.001] and physical symptoms [d = 0.88, t(266) = 4.32, P less_than 0.001] and a medium effect for PM anxious mood [d = 0.58, t(263) = 2.62, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the participants in condition 4 who were responding to the survey were typically on vacation following the examination, they reported elevated current anxious mood and physical symptoms in their first experience with the study survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is perhaps the most compelling reason from study 1 to conclude that the IELD pattern is due to an initial elevation and not to a later decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To check if the IELD effects were specific to examinees, i.e., only the member of each couple who was directly exposed to the stressor, we looked at the analogous pattern in the partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partners were in the same condition (diary or one of the panels) as their examinee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 shows that, like the examinees, the partners tended to report more anxious mood and physical symptoms on their first day relative to day 8, but they also reported a slightly elevated level of vigorous mood in the evening [d = 0.18, t(268) = 2.56, P less_than 0.001] on day 1 versus day 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The between-subjects contrasts at days 22, 35, and 44 for the partners produced consistent results: Comparing partners in panels to the relevant days for partners in the diary condition, panelist-partners reported higher levels of anxious moods in the AM and PM as well as physical symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects were typically large in magnitude, and it is noteworthy that they were observed even on the day before the examination, a point in time where a comparison of examinee outcomes showed almost no differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ee found no IELD effects for vigorous mood in any of the between-subjects comparisons for partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In sum, study 1 showed that IELD effects for daily reports of mood, physical symptoms, and study time were as large as d = 0.88 for examinees and d = 1.09 for partners, with median effect sizes of 0.26 (examinees) and 0.24 (partners) across all variables and times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effect sizes for subjective negative internal states and physical symptoms were larger (median effect of 0.54) than those for the more concrete behavior of study time (median effect 0.00) and for positive states (median effect 0.07).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, these results support an initial elevation bias rather than a later decline: As the examination approaches, participants are typically more anxious, but for group 1, the within-person comparison shows a decrease in anxiety from day 1 to day 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Groups 2 and 4 both show a distinct elevation on their starting day relative to group 1; this is particularly noteworthy for group 4, who on day 44 are reporting for the first time during the recovery period after the examination, when anxiety should be low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both examinees and partners who make their initial report on day 44 report levels of anxiety and physical symptoms that are remarkably elevated relative to what is expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_2__Demonstrating_the_IELD_Effect_in_a_Diary_Study_of_College_Examination_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study 2 conceptually replicates study 1, focusing on a shorter period of time before a less critical examination and varying the start dates in the diary design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It did not include partners or any start dates after the examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were college students preparing for premedical science examinations between the fall semesters of 2010 and 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were randomly assigned to start the diary survey on one of seven different days (ranging from 9 d to 2 d before the examination).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each participant, irrespective of when they started, was required to complete diaries for 14 consecutive days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They reported mood at waking, and at bedtime they reported mood, physical symptoms, and the amount of time spent studying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 shows how the average anxious mood (Upper Left) and physical symptom count (Lower Left) varied over days in each of the seven groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, if there were no IELD effects anxiety, would be expected to increase until the examination and then drop afterward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ignoring the initial responses, the expected pattern is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the initial responses reveal a pattern that is more consistent with an initial elevation bias rather than a later decline: One can see that the initial report tended to be higher than the adjacent reports across all seven groups, before coming back to what is presumably the phenomenologically real change (e.g., an increase in anxiety) as the examination approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 2 shows the estimated IELD effects for the AM and PM anxious mood and vigorous mood and PM physical symptoms and study time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These estimates are based on comparisons of the first reports of persons in groups 2 through 7 with the reports on the same day of participants who had started the diary process earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was a medium effect for AM anxiety [d = 0.56, t(225) = 5.98, P less_than 0.0001] but no evidence of an IELD effect for PM anxiety on the same day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there was no evidence of an IELD effect for AM vigor, but there was a small-to-medium effect for vigor reported in the evening [d = 0.38, t(225) = 3.27, P less_than 0.002].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also evidence of a small-to-medium effect for physical symptoms, which were reported only in the evening [d = 0.34, t(225) = 4.15, P less_than 0.0001], and also for PM reports of study time [d = 0.43, t(225) = 4.36, P less_than 0.0001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study 2 results can be compared with the between-person examinee results from study 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For AM anxious mood, the IELD effect was replicated, although it was smaller than the average effect reported in study 1; for the PM anxious mood effect there was no IELD replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, study 2 found IELD effects that were not apparent in study 1: positive mood (vigor) and the more objective report of study time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To what extent does the IELD effect confound inferences about the size of temporal effects?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data from study 2 provide a clue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2, Upper Left shows a sharp increase in anxiety as the examination draws near that drops dramatically after the examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the day before to the day after the examination the average drop in AM anxiety is 1.00 (SE = 0.12) in standardized effect units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Had the day before been the initial survey, we would expect from Table 2 that the change would be 0.56 larger: 1.56 rather than 1.00 (i.e., 1.56 times too large).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the change in reported PM physical symptoms from the day before to the day after the examination (Fig 2, Lower Left) is 0.18 (SE = 0.08).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IELD effect from Table 2 is 0.34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Had the first measure been biased by the IELD effect, the estimated effect of the examination would have been nearly three times (2.89) too large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude from this exercise that the impact of the IELD effect on substantive findings is not constant and needs to be considered in each context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These first two studies were both limited to the context of upcoming stressful events and to the use of diary designs, with reports made on sequential days about recent or current events and feelings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Is the IELD effect limited to this context and design?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In study 3 we examined whether IELD effects are found in a milder chronic stress context (everyday college life) rather than in an acute stressor context (examination preparation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study uses bimonthly measurement over 8 mo with a design that reduces the confounding of possible IELD effects with period effects (e.g., the beginning of fall semester, Thanksgiving) from first-interview effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Further, study 3 sought to specifically examine a potential phenomenological mechanism for the IELD effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the IELD may not result from a bias in reporting but from a phenomenologically real, albeit measurement-driven, change in state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous researchers (8) have proposed that the IELD may be observed for negative states, not because of a bias in reporting but because of genuine ameliorative effects of self-disclosure and study participation leading to later decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, participants beginning the study may experience increased self-awareness, which could increase emotional intensity (9), contributing to initial elevation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this possibility, study 3 includes surveys of a college roommates perception of the other roommates level of distress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For roommates providing repeated reports about another person instead of the self, a phenomenological effect would not be plausible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_3__Demonstrating_the_IELD_Effect_in_a_Panel_Study_of_College_Roommates_and_Testing_a_Therapeutic_Mechanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study 3 participants were undergraduate students (n = 870) who were recruited in the 20092010 academic year for a study of their experiences of college life; the timing and content of the surveys were unconnected with specific stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eighty-five percent of the participants were recruited as roommate pairs; half of these pairs were randomly chosen to report on their own college experience and the others to report on their roommates experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated online surveys were scheduled for October, December, February, and April, with participants randomly assigned to groups that began in October (n = 171 self-report; n = 124 roommate report), in December (n = 158 self-report; n = 127 roommate report), or in February (n = 162 self-report; n = 128 roommate report).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-report participants revealed their current anxious and vigorous mood, 6-wk recall of physical symptoms, and 6-wk recall of mental distress symptoms (K10 scale) (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Roommate-reporting participants rated mental distress symptoms for their college roommates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 3 shows estimates of the IELD effects for the self and roommate reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect estimates, which are based on repeated between-person comparisons, were obtained using a mixed-effects model that included an indicator of the initial assessment, an adjustment for periods close to scheduled examinations (December and April), and a person random intercept.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the IELD estimates for self-reports were significantly different from zero, but the magnitude of the effects was small (ranging from d = 0.15 for current vigor to d = 0.29 for own mental distress).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, studies 1 through 3 showed that IELD effects were omnipresent for self-reports of negative states and physical symptoms, with smaller, less robust effects for positive states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect was smaller in this study than in the previous two; this could be attributable to the change in design from diary to panel, the change in context from acute to chronic stress, or a combination of both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We were especially interested in whether the IELD would be present for participants reports of their roommates mental distress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the IELD is driven by a phenomenological effect, wherein ones experience of measurement drives an actual change in ones internal state, then the IELD would not be present when reporting about another person.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to this hypothesis, there was a significant IELD effect for mental distress reports on roommates [d = 0.13, t(341) = 2.45, P less_than 0.015].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another explanation of the IELD effect that remains plausible is the conversational norm mechanism, whereby participants interpret the repeated measurements as part of an ongoing conversation and, in an effort to follow norms, focus on providing relevant information and on updating previous information (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in study 1 participants were recruited from law schools to report on their bar examination preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One group was randomly selected to give their first report after the examination had taken place.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they were likely to have recovered from the stress of the examination held 7 d before, they might have assumed that the investigators were interested in how stressful the examination had been, even though the questions were phrased for current symptoms and problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Study 2 was also framed around stressful experiences; participants initial reports of negative states therefore may have been elevated by mixing their current state with their global sense of anxiety about the stressor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although study 3 was not framed about a specific stressful examination, it was announced to be about college life, which many students at competitive private universities might associate generally with stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The design of the first three studies confounded experience with the measures with the framing of what the researcher might want to know.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, participants first reports were also their first experience completing the measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Study 4 was designed to test the conversational norms mechanism by separating experience with the measures from the initiation of the conversation with the researcher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Study_4__Testing_the_Conversational_Norms_Mechanism_for_IELD_in_a_Single_Study_Versus_Sequential_Studies_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The final study, like study 2, again focused on undergraduates preparing for a difficult examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants were initially recruited (in 20112012) to participate in a study that was called the Examination Preparation Study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were randomly assigned to two groups: The participants in group 1 (n = 53) were simply asked to complete 14 d of diaries for the Examination Preparation Study (identical to group 1 in study 2), whereas participants in group 2 (n = 66) were given a more complicated story.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the night before the study was to begin, they were told that the Examination Preparation Study had reached its quota of subjects and that they would not be needed until a week later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then told that, if they were interested, they could participate in the interim in a 1-wk diary study that paid the same amount but that was on health run by a different faculty investigator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were told that the College Health Study focused on everyday health behaviors in college students and was not at all concerned with the upcoming examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two thirds of those in group 2, a subgroup we call group 2a (n = 44), agreed to be in the health study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They gave new informed consent for an ostensibly new faculty investigator and completed a weeklong diary study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants in the remaining subgroup, which we call group 2b (n = 22), chose not to participate in the health study, but all of them chose to begin the Examination Preparation Study a week later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we had three groups: Group 1 completed diaries on 14 consecutive days, from 11 d before to 2 d after their examination; group 2a completed diaries for the unrelated health study for 7 d, switched to completing diaries for the Examination Preparation Study on day 8, and continued until day 14; group 2b enrolled in the Examination Preparation Study but did not begin completing diaries until day 8 and then continued to day 14 (identical to group 7 in study 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These three groups are shown in Fig 2, Right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If the conversational norm mechanism were operating, on day 8, participants in both group 2a and group 2b would show an elevation compared with group 1: For group 2a and 2b, this day marked the start of a new conversation, whereas for group 1 this day merely continued the conversation they had already been having.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 4 and Fig 2, Right show that there were no between-persons IELD effects on day 8 for group 2a compared with group 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were, however, IELD effects for physical symptoms in within-subjects comparisons of day 1 with day 8 for group 1 and for both anxious mood and physical symptoms when group 2b was compared with group 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, consistent with studies 1 and 2, the effects appear to be initial elevations rather than later declines: The approaching examination would not be consistent with a reduction in anxiety and physical symptoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first report for group 2b is elevated compared with groups 1 and 2a in a deviation from the presumably phenomenologically real increase associated with the examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous researchers who noticed the unexpected and puzzling pattern of decline after initial assessments have labeled the pattern an attenuation effect, implying an artifactual change (i.e., later decline) in later reports (5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little systematic research about the size, scope, or basis of the effect has been done.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We addressed this gap in four field experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, we find attenuation to be a misnomer: Our findings are generally consistent with an initial elevation bias, not with a later decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is evident within persons, with reports of anxiety initially decreasing despite an approaching examination in studies 1, 2, and 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also strikingly evident between persons: Those participants who gave their first reports of anxiety 10 d after the bar examination showed marked elevation compared with those who had already provided reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, as illustrated in Fig 2 for both studies 2 and 4, initial reports for each group are elevated before subsequently converging into a coherent longitudinal pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the hypothesis that respondents were essentially receiving a treatment that ameliorated distress, leading to a later decline, was inconsistent with the results of study 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that study roommates reports on each other showed the same IELD pattern, contrary to the therapeutic mechanism proposed for genuine later decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The overall IELD effect is robust, appearing across multiple outcomes in four studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It appears across different study designs (intensive longitudinal vs. panel, reporting on the self vs. reporting on one's roommate, within-person and between-persons) and context (acute vs. chronic stress, for stressed persons vs. their romantic partners).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of the effect also varied, with larger effects for internal states than for behaviors and for negative states and physical symptoms than for positive states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly all the effect sizes we observed (median Cohens d in studies 1, 2, and 3: 0.26, 0.34, and 0.16, respectively) are likely to be of practical significance, whether in establishing clinical cutoffs for depression or physical discomfort or simply in establishing benchmarks for responses to questions of emotions, physical symptoms, and a host of other subjective reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that the robust IELD findings are likely to be due to initial bias and therefore that initial bias effects need to be considered when interpreting survey data on subjective reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present work has several important strengths: It presents experimental investigations of the pattern of decrease after initial reports in longitudinal research and systematically considers whether the pattern is a bias in initial elevation or later decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present a large body of evidence collected in four field experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental design allows us to demonstrate the effect between-persons as well as within-persons, and, further, the between-person comparisons support our proposal that the process of starting the study causes the initial elevation bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the replication of the initial elevation bias across each of these four field experiments eliminates potential artifactual explanations for the effect, such as an unanticipated secular event that affects reporting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are also limitations in the present work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, our four experiments were carried out with students or law school graduates who were either facing scheduled examinations or engaged in an academic semester.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We studied these participants because they were easily recruited and were willing to provide the intensive longitudinal data we required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they come from specialized populations, the IELD effects they displayed are consistent with similar effects that have been reported in epidemiological surveys (2, 17) of general populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar drops in self-reported symptoms from the first to second wave of data continue to be reported in studies of psychopathology (18, 19) and health behavior (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that the magnitude of the IELD effects will be studied as investigators become aware of the phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A second limitation is the range of possible mechanisms considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We proposed and tested two mechanisms, but further work is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we present paradigms for testing the phenomenological mechanism and the conversational norms mechanism, each of these merits a program of research beyond the scope of this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our initial findings are inconsistent with these two mechanisms, but they should not yet be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, these are but two of a variety of potential mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One in particular that we believe to be promising is a learning mechanism, whereby increasing familiarity with a measure leads to less extreme reporting (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A similar mechanismmeaning-makinghas been studied by Knowles and colleagues to explain an IELD effect at the microlevel, i.e., shifts in a single measurement session, within a single instrument, where participants responses to items presented early are more extreme than items presented later (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this pattern is consistent with IELD, it operates on a different scale from the one we have examined in the present research and so may operate by different psychological principles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Other examples of IELD effects that differ from the present work would include those on longer timescales or with less subjectivity in measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously cited Robins (2) who noted that incidence rates of mental disorders cannot be accurately estimated from retrospective lifetime prevalence surveys that show the IELD pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IELD effects of complex retrospective health surveys might be due to processes such as learning that endorsing screening questions leads to additional questions about the scope and severity of symptoms (6, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sought to eliminate such additional mechanisms in the work reported here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work speaks primarily to repeated measurement of subjective reports on current internal states and recent behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The implications of the initial elevation bias as demonstrated in our present work are nonetheless wide-ranging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A bias due to later decline would have been problematic for research using repeated measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an initial elevation bias potentially extends to all research using subjective reports, including cross-sectional designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such designs, the potentially biased first report is the only report.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When social scientists study reactions to national or world events, or when medical researchers screen for disorders, elevation biases lead to false conclusions and to false-positive identifications of screened participants who in fact do not have the disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Randomized studies will be resilient to the bias, but when baseline measures are taken the IELD effect can contribute to placebo effects in the control condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the IELD effect would not affect correlational studies if it were constant across individuals and variables, it could confound correlations if the magnitude varied with some characteristics of respondents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the request of a reviewer, we checked to see if the IELD effect interacted with gender or majority/minority status in studies 13, but we found no consistent effects for these variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This does not mean that the IELD effect does not vary with other personality or communication characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We urge survey researchers to add this effect to the list of other processes than can bias results, such as fatigue or acquiescence bias, and to look for possible bias in the survey results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recognizing an elevation bias leads to arguments in favor of designs that use repeated measurements, as they allow for the observation of and potential to adjust for the initial elevation bias, for example by dropping initial observations (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, researchers interested in subjective reports could consider providing prior experience with the given instrument before taking measurements of focal interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be seen as analogous to common procedures with other types of measurement that require practice or establishing a baseline (e.g., computer tasks using reaction times, physiological recordings).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hope that the present paper will increase awareness of IELD effects generally and the possibility of initial elevation bias in particular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
