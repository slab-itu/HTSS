Field-scale experiments reveal persistent yield gaps in low-input and organic cropping systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Meeting future food needs requires a substantial increase in the yields obtained from existing cropland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior global analyses have suggested that these gains could come from closing yield gapsdifferences between yields from small-plot research versus those in farmer fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, closing this gap requires knowledge of causal factors not yet identified experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results here suggest that yield gaps can be closed using farming practices that use conventional synthetic chemicals, but practices that rely more on biological managementas is the case throughout much of the developing world and in organic agriculturerequire renewed attention to field-scale resource demands and place greater emphasis on the importance of field-scale experimental research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Knowledge of production-system performance is largely based on observations at the experimental plot scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although yield gaps between plot-scale and field-scale research are widely acknowledged, their extent and persistence have not been experimentally examined in a systematic manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a site in southwest Michigan, we conducted a 6-y experiment to test the accuracy with which plot-scale crop-yield results can inform field-scale conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared conventional versus alternative, that is, reduced-input and biologically basedorganic, management practices for a cornsoybeanwheat rotation in a randomized complete block-design experiment, using 27 commercial-size agricultural fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearby plot-scale experiments (0.02-ha to 1.0-ha plots) provided a comparison of plot versus field performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that plot-scale yields well matched field-scale yields for conventional management but not for alternative systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all three crops, at the plot scale, reduced-input and conventional managements produced similar yields; at the field scale, reduced-input yields were lower than conventional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For soybeans at the plot scale, biological and conventional managements produced similar yields; at the field scale, biological yielded less than conventional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For corn, biological management produced lower yields than conventional in both plot- and field-scale experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wheat yields appeared to be less affected by the experimental scale than corn and soybean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventional management was more resilient to field-scale challenges than alternative practices, which were more dependent on timely management interventions; in particular, mechanical weed control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results underscore the need for much wider adoption of field-scale experimentation when assessing new technologies and production-system performance, especially as related to closing yield gaps in organic farming and in low-resourced systems typical of much of the developing world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Environment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Growing season precipitation varied greatly over the 6 y of this study, with a high of 540 mm in 2010 and a low of 207 mm in 2012, a regional drought year (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this period there was a year with an extremely dry summer (2012), two relatively dry years (2007 and 2009), and three normal-wet years (2008, 2010, and 2011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growing season rainfall distribution varied and was generally favorable for crop growth in the normal years of 2008, 2010, and 2011; generally poor with dry spells in 2007 and 2012; and intermediate in 2009.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The field-scale fields varied substantially in soil and topographical characteristics (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The within-field topographical gradient ranged from 2 m to almost 10 m in different fields with terrain slopes ranging from less_than19%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within individual fields, soil sand content varied from 2 to 95%, whereas clay content ranged from 35% to 2030%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bulk density in the soil plow layer (020 cm) also varied substantially, from 1.0 to 1.9 g cm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although in the majority of the studied fields, soil organic C in the plowed layer was in the 0.51.5% range, two fields in Conv and RI managements had isolated depression areas with soil C as high as 2.54.5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Field-Scale_Yields  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effect_of_Experimental_Scale  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparisons in yield performance of RI and Bio managements versus Conv in field-scale, MCSE, and LFL experiments are shown in Fig 3A, and comparisons between the field-scale and plot-scale experiments for each management practice are shown in Fig 3B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the MCSE does not have all three crop rotation phases present every year (Materials and Methods), to obtain the most consistent comparison among the experiments we used the field-scale and LFL data of the same crop that was present in that year at the MCSE site: corn yields from 2008 and 2011, soybean yields from 2009 and 2012, and wheat yields from 2007 and 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conclusions regarding the performance of our management practices obtained in plot-scale experiments did not well match the field-scale results (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepancy was most pronounced for the RI management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both plot-scale experiments, MCSE and LFL, the yields from RI and Conv managements were very similar to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Occasionally, in MCSE and LFL the RI yields were even numerically higher than those of Conv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the field-scale experiment the RI yields were significantly lower than those of Conv for all three crops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparisons between Bio and Conv managements for corn and wheat performance produced consistent results in the field-scale and in the plot-scale experiments (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bio yields were lower than those of Conv in both field-scale and MCSE experiments, either numerically (wheat in the field-scale experiment) or statistically (corn in both experiments and wheat in MSCE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there was a discrepancy in conclusions for soybean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the field-scale experiment, the soybean yields were much lower in Bio than in the Conv practice, whereas Bio and Conv yields were very similar in the plot-scale MCSE experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Conv practice the field-scale yields of all three crops were either very similar to plot-scale yields or even exceeded them; for example, in soybean and wheat the field-scale yields were significantly higher than those from LFL (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for RI management there was a tendency for lower yields in field-scale than in plot-scale experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Bio practice the results were inconclusive, with field-scale and MCSE yields similar for corn, field-scale yields lower than MCSE for soybean, and field-scale yields higher than MCSE for wheat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the differences between the experiments were less pronounced for wheat than for corn and soybean yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As expected, the variability in the field-scale fields was substantially higher than that in the MCSE and LFL plots (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all studied years the SEs from the field-scale experiment were substantially greateroccasionally as much as 510 times greaterthan those from the MCSE and LFL sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results demonstrate that for conventionally managed corn, soybean, and wheat, plot-scale experiments can accurately represent the yield performance of commercial fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for corn and soybean under reduced-input and biologically based management there was a tendency for higher plot-scale than field-scale yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in overall greater yield penalties due to reduced-input and organic managements in the field-scale experiment compared with the plot-scale observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the field-scale experiment the magnitudes of the differences between yields of conventional (Conv) and alternative (RI and Bio) managements were affected by weather variations and were particularly large in the years with optimal precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Effect_of_Environmental_Factors_on_Management_Performance_in_the_Field-Scale_Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Greater management differences in corn and soybean performances in years with more spring precipitation (Fig 2) are consistent with other studies that have reported more pronounced differences between biologically basedorganic and conventional practices in years with sufficient precipitation (21) and in irrigated systems (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some instances, improvement in soil hydraulic properties under organic management, including soil water holding capacity, has been proposed as a buffering mechanism leading to better plant performance in organically managed soils (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our study the modest difference in corn yields among Conv, RI, and Bio management in dry years was apparently not an outcome of soil improvement, but of a much greater drop in performance of Conv management crops compared with Bio during dry years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corn yield under Conv management dropped from 10 Mg ha1 y1 in optimal precipitation years to as low as 2 Mg ha1 y1 in the drought summer of 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Bio, the maximum corn yield was only 4 Mg ha1 y1, whereas in 2012 it was also 2 Mg ha1 y1, that is, similar to that obtained in Conv management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One possible explanation is that for Conv crops, which are adequately supplied with chemical fertilizer and pest control inputs, the availability of water is likely the main yield-limiting factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early season precipitation is known to be positively associated with corn and soybean grain yields and to influence yield response to management (2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike Conv crops, RI and especially Bio crops experience nutrient deficiencies and weed and pest pressures even in years with optimal precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nitrogen deficiencies might be particularly expressed when rainfall is sufficient to support high corn yield and are likely responsible for the most contrasting results in corn yield response to management and their relationships with precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Scale_Effects__Comparisons_of_Field_Versus_Plot_Scales  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Yield penalties for using alternative practices, such as Bio or RI, appear to be greater in the field-scale than in the plot-scale experiments (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the plot-scale MCSE the yields in Bio were 19% lower than Conv, the difference consistent in size with the published plot-scale literature results (68, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, an average yield loss across six corn, soybean, and/or wheat North American experiments (19, 2427), where organic management relied on the use of cover crops and not on animal manure inputs, was 19% [from a review by Seufert et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19) reported that for the majority of times the organic yields were about 1015% lower than the conventional, whereas 2030% yield losses in organic management occurred only in one third of the studied site-years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Bio yields from the field-scale experiment of this study were 40% lower than Conv (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, in all studied years after the establishment year of 2007, corn yields in the field-scale experiment Bio treatment were 45% lower than in Conv management, and wheat Bio yields were 30% lower than in Conv management (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bios soybean crop failed in 2009, whereas soybean yield reductions were 55%, 27%, and 88% in 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Likewise, the yield penalty due to using RI management was higher in the field-scale experiment than in the plot-scale MCSE and LFL (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 20082012, in contrast to 20% losses observed for RI management in the field-scale experiment, RI yields were numerically higher than Conv by 8% in the MCSE and by 13% in the LFL experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We explored two plausible reasons for the observed differences between the field-scale and the plot-scale results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the field-scale study and the plot-scale MCSE and LFL experiments are of different durations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MCSE experiment was established in 1989, and the LFL experiment was established in 1993.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the years, Bio management practices in both the MCSE (26, 27) and the LFL (28, 29) have resulted in higher levels of soil organic matter compared with Conv management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the more modest yield losses under Bio management in the MCSE and LFL could have resulted from improvements in soil organic matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this does not appear to be the case: MCSE yields from a 5-y period at the beginning of the study, that is, 19931997 (Fig S2), also show an 19% reduction in Bio yields compared with Conv management, similar to that in the 20082012 period of the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the difference between RI and Conv yields in 19931997 was very similar to that observed in 20082012, with RI crop yields 4% higher than Conv yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, then, gains in soil organic matter under Bio and RI managements at the MCSE do not seem to explain the much better yield performance at the plot-scale study compared with the field-scale study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, RI and, especially, Bio managements heavily rely on mechanical weed control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Timely and effective administration of mechanical weed control is routinely reported as a challenge even in plot-scale experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Cavigelli et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20) showed that weed competition accounted for about one quarter of yield losses in an organic management system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19) found that nearly all instances of substantially poorer organic yield performance in their 20 site-year data set were associated with lack of sufficient weed control in the organic system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, 2030% lower yields were associated with poor weed control in a summary of five experiments compiled by Posner et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (19), whereas no notable yield losses were observed when weed control was adequate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results have been shown in a 16-ha study in Australia, where yields in biologically based management systems were consistently suppressed by weed infestations (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the commercially managed fields of the field-scale experiment, achieving appropriate mechanical weed control appears to have been a greater challenge than at the plot scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The organic management of corn and soybean relied on the use of early summer cultivation and rotary hoeing to control weeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity of these weed control operations differed in the field-scale and MCSE experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the studied period the number of weed control operations in the MCSE experiment ranged from 4 to 7 per year (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Bio fields of the field-scale experiment the number of weeding operations was never greater than five, and sometimes as few as two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil finishing and preparation of the MCSE was also conducted more thoroughly than could be achieved in the field-scale fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, during the studied period, double-cultivation (cultivation conducted in opposite directions across the plots) was conducted in the MCSE plots twice, whereas only one field of the field-scale experiment was double-cultivated in only one of the studied years (MCSE and field-scale experiment agronomic logs at lter.kbs.msu.edu/datatables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the experience and resources needed to manage weeds with biologically basedorganic management are substantial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are also consistent with the role that timely field operations in general have been hypothesized to play in explaining the yield gap between plot-scale and field-scale crop performance (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Implications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are at least three important implications of these findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is that scaling from plot-level experiments to farm fields can be straightforward for conventional, chemically based management systems, but is significantly more challenging for systems that are more biologically based.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, extrapolation from plot to field scale can be expected to be a problem for any management practice that involves challenges in performing crop and soil management operations, for example, sowing or weed control operations requiring optimal timing, regardless of whether the system in question is conventional or organic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, researchers must be extremely careful when extrapolating plot-level results to farm fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, farmers must appropriately resource their adaptations of plot-tested management systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if plot-scale success is tied in part to frequent mechanical weed control applied in a timely manner, then equivalent field-scale success will likely be possible only when sufficient labor and equipment is available to duplicate these efforts at the farm scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this seems an obvious conclusion, it appears to be overlooked in practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolations and appropriate resourcing will be especially challenging in locations and futures with more variable climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second is the need for field-scale research, especially in low-input systems, largely absent today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High costs, along with land and labor requirements, are main reasons that large-scale experiments are so scarce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, lack of realization by the scientific community of how substantial the differences in plot-scale versus field-scale findings can be, especially for low-input systems with high management requirements, appears to be yet another reason for the shortage of replicated large-scale studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide data to raise awareness that (i) despite its costs, field-scale research is crucial for designing resource efficient systems that better match field resource heterogeneities and that (ii) farmer recommendations and policies based on poorly scaling plot-level research can cost the public more than investing in large-scale research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Third, findings suggest that addressing yield gaps among poorly resourced farmers may be especially intractable without additional resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seufert et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7) found organic performance in developing countries to be even more challenged than in developed countries (43% yield penalties for developing vs. 20% for developed countries).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that this difference will be still greater at the farm scale, emphasizing the special need in developing countries to create technologies that are less time-sensitive and make efficient use of labor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will be especially important where reduced-input farming is pursued out of necessity rather than choice, for example, in sub-Saharan Africa (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Research is sorely needed to design and extend the incorporation of adaptive management to low-input systems at field scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanisms are needed to better buffer these systems from edaphic and climatic variability and to better respond to fast-acting disturbances, such as weed outbreaks and short-term drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Corn, soybean, and wheat yields from plot-scale experiments well represented the yields obtained from commercial-size fields for conventional chemical-input intensive crop management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, findings from the plot-scale experiments were not always consistent with field-scale outcomes for corn and soybean in reduced-input and biologically based management systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Challenges associated with timely weed control appear to be a main cause for the discrepancy in our field-scale versus plot-scale comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in performance were particularly large during years with sufficient precipitation, whereas during drought years the differences in corn and soybean yields between alternative and conventional management practices were minimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings emphasize a critical need for field-scale studies to complement widely relied upon plot-scale experimentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such studies would be important for any management practice with extra labor, equipment, and/or timing requirements, but are especially important for low-input and biologically basedorganic cropping systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The three experiments that represented three spatial scales in this study were located in close proximity to one another on soils of the same series, were randomized replicated experiments, and implemented identical conventional and alternative management systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiments were conducted at the W. K. Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site located in southwest Michigan (42° 24' N, 85° 24' W, 288-m elevation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soils at KBS are well-drained loams developed on glacial outwash; dominant soil series are comingled Kalamazoo (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs) and Oshtemo (coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalfs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KBS receives 1,005 mm of annual precipitation and has mean annual temperature of 10.1 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yields of conventionally managed corn, soybean, and wheat at KBS are similar to both county and average US yields for rainfed crops (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional soil, climatic, and conventional yield details appear in Robertson and Hamilton (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The field-scale experiment included 27 cropped fields and was initiated in 2006, with grain yield data collection starting in 2007.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fields ranged in size from 6 to 36 ha, with two thirds of the fields 20 ha.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fields were managed as corn/soybean/winter wheat rotations using conventional, low-input, and biologically basedorganic management practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each phase of the rotation was represented in each of the studied years for a total of 3 crop phases (corn, soybean, or wheat) × 3 management practices × 3 replicate blocks = 27 fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Field assignments were blocked by field size such that each year there was one field less_than20 ha and two fields 20 ha in each crop of each management practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conventional management (Conv) followed Michigan-recommended field crop production practices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced- input management (RI) followed conventional practices with three exceptions: winter cover crops were integrated into the rotation, nitrogen fertilizer was reduced by 70% in corn and by 50% in wheat, and herbicide applications were two thirds reduced by banding herbicides within the rows and using mechanical cultivation to control between-row weeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cover crops consisted of cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), planted after harvest of corn and plowed under before soybean planting in May, and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), frost-seeded into the winter wheat crop in February and incorporated into the soil with tillage before corn planting 15 mo later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biologically basedorganic management (Bio) followed organic management-recommended practices and included the same cover crops as those used in RI, no nitrogen fertilizer, and only mechanical cultivation to control weeds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No treatments received manure or compost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chisel plowing (a conservation tillage practice common in the region) was implemented in spring in all three managements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed description of management practices is provided in Robertson and Hamilton (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crop varieties grown in Conv and RI were those recommended for conventional production (corn variety Dekalb DKC52-59; soybean variety Pioneer 92Y30 RR; soft red winter wheat variety Pioneer 25R47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Bio management we used varieties recommended for organic production (corn variety Blue River Hybrid 22A10; soybean Blue River 19AR1; soft red wheat variety Pioneer 25R47 untreated seed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compared the results from the field-scale experiment with results from two adjacent plot-scale experiments: the LTER main cropping system experiment (MCSE), established in 1989, and the living field laboratory (LFL), experiment established in 1993.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The management practices, main crops, and cover crops of the MCSE were identical to those used in the field-scale experiment, with the exception that only one phase of the rotation, that is, one crop species, was present each year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the MCSE each management practice is applied to six replicated 1-ha experimental plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed descriptions of the MCSE experiment and yield and yield variability comparisons among management practices have been reported by Kravchenko et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (13), Smith et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (34), and Robertson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The LFL experiment included Conv and RI treatments that were identical to those used in the MCSE and field-scale experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LFL experimental design is a split-split plot with four randomized complete blocks: management practice is the main plot factor, phase of the rotation is the split-plot factor, and cover crop is the split-split plot factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every crop phase was present every year, as in the field-scale experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual plots were 9.1 m × 20 m (0.018 ha), which accommodated 12 rows, spaced 0.76 m apart, for corn and soybean and rows 0.19 m apart for wheat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Soil analytical data for the MCSE and LFL and crop yield data for each of the five studied years (20072012) from each studied field-scale field are available at lter.kbs.msu.edu/datatables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sampling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In 2010 we collected 65 deep (090 cm) soil cores from 10 of the field-scale fields, with 4, 3, and 3 fields in Conv, RI, and Bio managements, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fields were selected to represent the diversity of soil and topographical characteristics of the studied area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil texture, bulk density, and soil organic C were measured in each core within 020, 2035, 3550, 5070, and 7090 cm depth increments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soils in the MCSE and LFL experiments were systematically soil-sampled on a schedule that included decadal deep profile sampling for the same soil properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Crop grain yields were collected via a combine harvester.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crop yields were measured by calibrated truck scale, and grain moisture was monitored using a grain moisture tester (DICKEY-John Corporation, Auburn, IL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data analyses were conducted using the PROC MIXED procedure of Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare management practices in the field-scale experiment across all years the statistical model included management practices, crop species, and their interaction as fixed factors; and years and interactions between years, crops, and management practices as random factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the blocking factor that grouped fields by size, the effect of individual fields nested within management practices and within the size blocks, and the interaction between crop species and fields were included as random factors in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because there were marked differences in variability of the three studied crops, we conducted heterogeneous variance analysis using the Repeated/group = crop statement in the PROC MIXED procedure (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interactions among the fixed factors were examined using a slicing approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean comparisons were conducted when the respective effects, either main, interaction, or slicing, were found to be statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences are reported either at 0.05 or at 0.1 levels of statistical significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all conducted analyses the assumptions of normality of the residuals and homogeneity of variances were checked, and either data transformations or analyses with heterogeneous variances were used as needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address the influence of experiment size on performance of the studied management practices the data of the field-scale, MCSE, and LFL experiments were combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the field-scale and LFL experiments in these comparisons we used only data from the crop that was grown in that year in the MCSE experiment, where, as mentioned earlier, only one phase of the rotation was present every year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical model for the combined analysis included experiments, crop species, management practices, and interactions among them as fixed factors, and blocks nested within each respective experiment as a random factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unequal variances among crops and experiments were handled by using the Repeated/group = crop × experiment statement in PROC MIXED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SEs for treatment means can be viewed as a measure of how accurately the means of the studied management practices can be estimated, given the study design, the number of replications, and the variability of different random sources present in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the accuracy of the studied experiments, we used their SEs as a response variable in the data analysis that was conducted separately in each year of each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SE comparisons among the management practices the model consisted only of the fixed effect of management practice and the random effect of blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The studied experiments had different numbers of replications, that is, three in the field scale, six in the MCSE, and four in the LFL experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to ensure unbiased comparisons among them in terms of their SE values, the data from only three randomly selected replications of MCSE and LFL studies were used in this analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
