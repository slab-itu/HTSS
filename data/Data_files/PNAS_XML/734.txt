title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Numbers of presynaptic Ca2+ channel clusters match those of functionally defined vesicular docking sites in single central synapses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Releasedocking sites have been considered from a morphological point of view as the sites where synaptic vesicles dock and fuse with the active-zone membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionally, docking sites limit the maximum number of vesicles released per action potential, determining synaptic strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now it has not been possible to establish a clear link between morphological and functional aspects of docking sites in mammalian brain synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent data suggest that calcium channels form several clusters in the active zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the number of the clusters matches that of functional docking sites and both parameters change in parallel with age and synaptic size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results we propose a one-to-one correspondence between docking sites and calcium channel clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many central synapses contain a single presynaptic active zone and a single postsynaptic density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vesicular release statistics at such simple synapses indicate that they contain a small complement of docking sites where vesicles repetitively dock and fuse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we investigate functional and morphological aspects of docking sites at simple synapses made between cerebellar parallel fibers and molecular layer interneurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using immunogold labeling of SDS-treated freeze-fracture replicas, we find that Cav2.1 channels form several clusters per active zone with about nine channels per cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean value and range of intersynaptic variation are similar for Cav2.1 cluster numbers and for functional estimates of docking-site numbers obtained from the maximum numbers of released vesicles per action potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both numbers grow in relation with synaptic size and decrease by a similar extent with age between 2 wk and 4 wk postnatal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the mean docking-site numbers were 3.15 at 2 wk (range: 110) and 2.03 at 4 wk (range: 14), whereas the mean numbers of Cav2.1 clusters were 2.84 at 2 wk (range: 18) and 2.37 at 4 wk (range: 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes were accompanied by decreases of miniature current amplitude (from 93 pA to 56 pA), active-zone surface area (from 0.0427 m2 to 0.0234 m2), and initial success rate (from 0.609 to 0.353), indicating a tightening of synaptic transmission with development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results suggest a close correspondence between the number of functionally defined vesicular docking sites and that of clusters of voltage-gated calcium channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Developmental_Changes_at_Simple_PFMLI_Synapses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present work, we examine how simple synapse properties evolve as a function of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we compare simple PFMLI synapses at postnatal day 13 (P13)P16 and P26P29 (respectively called 2-wk data and 4-wk data hereafter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 4 wk, however, the growing density of PFMLI innervation jeopardized the method of stimulation of individual PFs used previously to obtain simple synapse recordings (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, instead of using extracellular stimulation in the molecular layer, we used in the present work either local extracellular stimulation in the granule cell (GC) layer or paired GCMLI recordings (Fig 1A) (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in previous studies (9, 29), we obtained uniform event amplitudes in response to train stimulation, indicating that a single synaptic connection was stimulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a mean quantal excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) trace obtained from delayed asynchronous responses as a template, we deconvolved multiquantal EPSCs to estimate the number of SVs released by each stimulus (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fixed the extracellular Ca2+ concentration to 3 mM to optimize SV counting (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plots of mean released SV number as a function of stimulus number revealed a facilitation-depression sequence at both 2 wk and 4 wk (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 2 wk, the response peaked at the second stimulation as previously reported (29), whereas the 4-wk data displayed a lower initial mean value and a slower facilitation peaking at the third stimulation before converging with 2-wk data at the end of the train.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The success rate of the first response was lower at 4 wk than at 2 wk (Fig 1E), suggesting a lower release probability at 4 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore possible developmental changes of postsynaptic properties, we next plotted quantal size values derived from simple synapse recordings as a function of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This plot revealed a significant downward trend (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In view of previous evidence linking quantal size, number of postsynaptic receptors, and postsynaptic density (PSD) size (3638), these results suggest a decrease of the PSD size with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we fitted distributions of released SV numbers using a binomial model (Fig S1) (9), and we derived from these fits functional estimates of the number of docking sites, ND.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To improve the accuracy of ND estimates, ND was determined for the stimulus number corresponding to maximal release probability at the peak of synaptic facilitation (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plotting ND as a function of age revealed a significant decrease (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In simple GABAergic synapses, variations in quantal size are related with variations in ND, and both parameters are thought to scale with synaptic size (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether size variations could underlie the parallel downward trends observed for quantal size and ND, we plotted the quantal size as a function of ND, revealing a significant correlation between these two parameters (Fig 1H; unrestrained regression line in black; regression line through the origin in red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that a reduction of synaptic size could act as a common factor underlying changes in quantal size and in ND during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, simple synapse recordings reveal a parallel decrease of quantal size and ND with age, as illustrated in Fig 1 I and J for 2-wk and 4-wk group data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantal size values were 166 pA ± 16 pA at 2 wk (mean ± SEM; n = 21) and 85 pA ± 9 pA at 4 wk (mean ± SEM; n = 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ND values were 4.37 ± 0.45 at 2 wk (mean ± SEM; n = 19) and 3.20 ± 0.29 at 4 wk (mean ± SEM; n = 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial release probability per docking site (obtained in response to the first AP in a train) was 0.29 ± 0.05 at 2 wk and 0.14 ± 0.03 at 4 wk; corresponding maximum release probability values per docking site (obtained at the peak of facilitation, usually after the second AP at 2 wk and after the third AP at 4 wk) were 0.53 ± 0.03 at 2 wk and 0.41 ± 0.04 at 4 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Correcting_Mean_Docking-Site_Number_for_Recording_Bias  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before accepting the above ND values for further quantification, we asked whether these values could be biased due to our experimental procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, it seemed possible that large-size synapses with large quantal sizes and large ND values were overrepresented in our recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find simple synapses, we locally apply an elevated K+ solution, and we search for K+-evoked bursts of EPSCs with homogeneous amplitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synapses with high quantal size provide more prominent, more easily identifiable bursts and are therefore more likely to be selected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any bias to select high quantal sizes would be reflected by high ND values because the two parameters are correlated, as shown in Fig 1H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we compared the distribution of quantal sizes obtained in simple synapses with the distribution of quantal sizes obtained from miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of quantal sizes in simple synapse recordings should reflect that of mEPSCs if there were no bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that quantal sizes of evoked EPSCs (qEPSCs) and mEPSC amplitudes spanned similar ranges both at 2 wk (Fig 2 A and D) and at 4 wk (Fig 2 B and E) and that amplitude distributions for both types of signals shifted significantly to smaller values with age (Fig 2 C and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, small amplitudes were more prominent in mEPSC distributions, leading to lower mean values (93.2 pA at 2 wk and 55.6 pA at 4 wk) and higher skews (1.97 at 2 wk and 1.33 at 4 wk) compared with distributions of qEPSCs (mean: 129.0 pA at 2 wk and 87.3 pA at 4 wk; skew: 1.10 at 2 wk and 1.02 at 4 wk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicated that our analysis had a recording bias and that synapses with a large quantal size were overrepresented in our simple synapse recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To correct for this bias, we assumed in agreement with previous studies (10, 11, 31, 38) that both quantal size and ND are proportional to synaptic size, so that the ratio between the two parameters is constant across synapses at each of the two ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we calculated the ratio of average values between miniature and quantal-evoked events and multiplied ND values by this ratio (ratio: 0.72 for 2 wk and 0.64 for 4 wk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corrected ND values are 3.15 at 2 wk and 2.03 at 4 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of amplitude distributions for mEPSCs and qEPSCs suggested that missed synapses often had one to two docking sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After correction, the range of ND is 110 at 2 wk and 14 at 4 wk, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Parameters_of_Two-Step_Model_at_2_Wk_and_4_Wk  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We recently proposed that if a docking site becomes empty, reoccupancy depends on the supply of a new SV provided by an associated replacement site (two-step model) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key evidence for the two-step model came from an examination of variance-mean plots of cumulative numbers of vesicular release events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing such plots at 2 wk and 4 wk revealed a steeper increase of the cumulative variance with mean at 4 wk than at 2 wk (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monte Carlo simulations of these results indicated that, at 4 wk, the release probability of docked SVs is reduced for the first and second stimulation, possibly reflecting a decrease of the percentage of high release probability superprimed SVs (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, simulations indicated a reduction of the initial occupancy of the replacement site at 4 wk (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Identification_of_PFMLI_Synapses_in_SDS-Digested_Freeze-Fracture_Replica_Labeling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the 2D distribution of VGCCs in an AZ with nanoscale resolution, we performed SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling (SDS-FRL) for Cav2.1 because this VGCC subtype predominates in PF terminals (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was performed on sagitally cut cerebellar slices to match the conditions of electrophysiology experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For quantitative comparisons of morphological and physiological data, it is essential to restrict morphological results to the appropriate category of synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we next aimed at identifying PFMLI synapses in a replica sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MLI somata and dendrites could be unambiguously identified in a replica obtained from the molecular layer of the cerebellum as previously reported (Fig 3 A and B) (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MLI dendrites are free of spines, unlike PC dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunogold particles for Kv4.3, a specific marker for MLI (42), were observed on the protoplasmic face (P-face), confirming MLI identification (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sometimes found straight, unbranched, Kv4.3-negative aspiny dendrites in the molecular layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These profiles likely originate from Golgi cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the MLI exoplasmic face (E-face), we observed groups of densely packed intramembrane particles (IMP) representing PSDs of excitatory synapses (Fig 3D) (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On MLI dendrites, profiles occasionally displayed a transition between presynaptic P-face and postsynaptic E-face with an associated IMP cluster within the same synapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These profiles showed double labeling by AZ proteins and VGluT1 (Fig 3 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because VGluT1 is selectively expressed in PF boutons in the molecular layer (43), these results confirm that these profiles originate from PFMLI synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the presynaptic P-face of these synapses was flat, in contrast to the concave profile observed at PFPC synapses (33); this difference provides an additional criterium to distinguish between PFMLI and PFPC synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we occasionally found GABAergic synapses on MLIs by double labeling for AZ proteins and VGAT (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, experiments using triple labeling for VGluT1, VGAT, and AZ proteins revealed that the proportion of glutamatergic synapses in afferent MLI synapses was 97.9% (93/95), the rest (2.1%, 2/95) being GABAergic (i.e., MLIMLI synapses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates a very small proportion of inhibitory synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we could identify presynaptic AZ regions of PFMLI synapses by combining AZ protein labeling and morphological identification of MLIs in a replica, even though a small contamination of GABAergic synapses would be included in the synapses observed without VGluT1 and VGAT labeling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Morphological_Changes_of_PFMLI_Synapse_with_Age  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined developmental changes of the PSD area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PSD areas of excitatory synapses are associated with IMP aggregates that contain AMPA receptors (37) and that appear on the E-face of MLI dendrites (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we measured the IMP cluster area to estimate the PSD area (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the PSD area decreased from 2 wk (mean ± SD = 0.0407 m2 ± 0.0262 m2; Fig 4C) to 4 wk (mean ± SD = 0.0247 m2 ± 0.0131 m2; Fig 4D), a significant change (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine presynaptic changes with age, we measured the AZ area at 2 wk and 4 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PFMLI synapses, we could not find any distinctive structural feature to recognize the AZ region on the P-face of the presynaptic membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to locate the AZ, we labeled simultaneously three well-known AZ markers: RIM, ELKS, and neurexin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using 2-nm and 5-nm gold particles, respectively, for this mix of AZ proteins and for the Cav2.1 subunit (Fig 5 AF), we gathered PFMLI synapse images in which (i) an entire AZ region displayed its presynaptic P-face; (ii) this presynaptic P-face exhibited both 2-nm and 5-nm particles (Fig 5 CF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure the AZ area, we delineated a convex polygon using the outermost particles (2/5 nm) contained in one AZ (Fig 5 D and F and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyzed AZ area sizes at 2 wk and 4 wk by measuring the area of this polygon (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accord with previous results (e.g., 46), AZ size distributions were indistinguishable from those of PSD area at both 2 wk and 4 wk (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirming the above results on PSD area distribution (Fig 4E), we found that AZ area is larger at 2 wk (mean ± SD = 0.0427 m2 ± 0.0242 m2; Fig 5G) than at 4 wk (mean ± SD = 0.0234 m2 ± 0.0135 m2; Fig 5 H and I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, the size of PFMLI synapses sharply decreases with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that receptor density remains constant, as suggested by the finding of very high and homogenous AMPA receptor density at PFMLI synapses (37) and the finding of the close packing arrangement of IMPs both at 2 wk and 4 wk, these results indicate that AMPA receptor numbers decrease with age, in agreement with the smaller quantal size found at 4 wk compared with 2 wk (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1I and 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the presynaptic side, the decrease of AZ size is consistent with the decrease in ND obtained from functional measurements (Fig 1J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Analysis_of_VGCC_Distribution  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify morphological counterparts of docking sites, we next analyzed the VGCC labeling in individual AZs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of Cav2.1 labeling per AZ decreased slightly but significantly with age (mean ± SD: 16.8 ± 8.7 at 2 wk, and 13.9 ± 8.1 at 4 wk; Fig 5 JL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a previously reported method (33), we estimated Cav2.1-labeling efficiency in our replicas at 62% (see details in SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correcting the above Cav2.1-labeling numbers with this percentage yielded total mean VGCC numbers per AZ of 27 at 2 wk and 22 at 4 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further found that the number of Cav2.1 labelings per AZ was correlated with the size of the AZ area at 2 wk and 4 wk as previously reported in hippocampal glutamatergic synapses (Fig 5 M and N) (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the slope of the linear fit, we obtained density values of Cav2.1 labeling of 359 ± 23 and 513 ± 49 gold particles/m2 (mean ± 95% CI; t test on slopes: P less_than 0.001; estimated VGCC density of 579 and 827 /m2) in AZs of 2 wk and 4 wk, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the density of Cav2.1 channels increases during development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we looked into the distribution of Cav2.1 channels in each AZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accord with previous reports (30, 31, 33), we found that Cav2.1 channel labels were not distributed uniformly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of distances between any pair of particles within an AZ displayed a peak in the range between 0 nm and 50 nm (particularly evident in 4-wk data), indicating particle association within clusters, whereas beyond this range particle distances were distributed broadly (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed Monte Carlo simulations assuming random distributions of the observed number of 5-nm particles in individual AZ areas determined from the 2/5-nm particles, as well as an exclusion zone of 5 nm around each particle to account for steric hindrance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As may be seen in Fig 6 A and B (red curves), these random distribution models do not display the biphasic distributions observed experimentally and markedly differ from data in the 10- to 150-nm range (KolmogorovSmirnov test on cumulated distributions: P less_than 0.001 at 2 wk and P less_than 0.001 at 4 wk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the distributions of nearest neighbor distances between particles were significantly different from the nearest neighbor distributions derived for random particle distributions (Fig 6 D and E; black: 2-wk data; blue: 4-wk data; red: Monte Carlo simulations for random distributions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the prediction for a random distribution, observed distributions were narrower, displaying a sharp peak at nearest neighbor distances of 19 nm (2 wk: Fig 6D) and of 14 nm (4 wk: Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that VGCC labels are not distributed randomly in AZs and that they form clusters both at 2 wk and at 4 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, distributions of all interparticle distances as well as of nearest neighbor distances revealed a shift to shorter values at 4 wk compared with 2 wk, indicating denser clusters at 4 wk than at 2 wk (Fig 6 C and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we quantitatively analyzed the VGCC clusters in individual AZs (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To define a cluster, we set a threshold value of 40 nm for the distance between particles belonging to the same cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value was calculated as equal to  + 3, where  and  are the mean (18.7 nm) and SD (7.1 nm) obtained for a single Gaussian fit of a 2-wk nearest neighbor distance distribution; it is very close to the value of 42 nm used previously by Althof et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 7 AC and DF, respectively, show examples of cluster analysis at 2 wk and 4 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained a histogram of cluster numbers (NC) ranging from 1 to 8 at 2 wk (Fig 7G) and from 1 to 5 at 4 wk (Fig 7H), showing significantly different distributions (Fig 7I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average NC values are 2.84 ± 1.48 for 2 wk and 2.37 ± 1.11 for 4 wk (mean ± SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of clusters correlated with the size of AZ area (Fig 7 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slope of the regression line was steeper at 4 wk (density: 85.5 clusters/m2) than at 2 wk (61.0 clusters/m2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance between the centers of the clusters calculated by averaging coordinates of all particles in individual clusters was significantly shorter at 4 wk (Fig 7L), indicating that clusters are more densely organized at 4 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the means of nearest neighbor distance between clusters are identical at 2 wk (97.4 nm ± 32.1 nm, mean ± SD) and 4 wk (96.7 nm ± 24.7 nm (Fig 7M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that the higher cluster density at 4 wk arises from a more compact arrangement of clusters within the AZ, and not from a shorter intercluster distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the dependence of NC values on the  + 3 criterion, we also performed analyses using a  + 2 criterion (giving a cutoff at 32.9 nm, probably too restrictive) as well as a  + 4 criterion (giving a cutoff at 47.1 nm, probably too permissive).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses (Fig S5) indicate that NC values remain within 15% of their reference obtained with the  + 3 criterion so that overall the results are little affected by the definition of the threshold distance for clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Returning to the 40-nm cutoff, the number of particles in clusters was 8.79 ± 7.10 at 2 wk and 9.10 ± 7.16 at 4 wk (means ± SD; these values are corrected for incomplete Cav2.1-labeling efficiency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate cluster areas, we drew circles with a radius of 20 nm (half of the threshold value for interparticle distance within a cluster) around gold particles and measured the total area of overlapping circles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cluster area size was correlated with the number of Cav2.1 particles in clusters with respective means of 4,820 nm2 ± 3,500 nm2 at 2 wk and 4,330 nm2 ± 2,820 nm2 at 4 wk (mean ± SD; particle density per cluster, 0.00123/nm2 at 2 wk and 0.00149/nm2 at 4 wk; Fig 7 N and O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Corresponding cluster diameters are 39 nm at 2 wk and 37 nm at 4 wk, assuming a circular cluster shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that one cluster has roughly the same size as a SV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results indicate that, with age, the structure of individual VGCC clusters changes toward a smaller and denser conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we classified the distributions of VGCC clusters in single AZs as single (Fig 8A), double (Fig 8B), linear (Fig 8C), peripheral (Fig 8D), or mixed (Fig 8 ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of 2-wk and 4-wk data reveals an increase of the proportion of double and peripheral types and a reduction of the mixed type at 4 wk without significant changes in the proportions of the other types (Fig 8 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Correlation_Between_Docking_Sites_and_Cav21_Channel_Clusters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the above data it is possible to compare numbers for docking sites (ND) and for Cav2.1 channel clusters (NC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After correction for recording bias, mean ND values are 3.15 and 2.03 at 2 wk and 4 wk, respectively, whereas mean NC values are 2.84 and 2.37 at 2 wk and 4 wk, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the ND/NC ratio is 1.11 at 2 wk and 0.86 at 4 wk with a mean between these two values of 0.98, which is very close to 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the ranges of values are similar for ND (110 at 2 wk and 14 at 4 wk) and for NC (18 at 2 wk and 15 at 4 wk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, ND and NC change in parallel directions with age, with respective 4-wk and 2-wk ratios of 0.64 and 0.83.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these results, we propose that VGCC clusters constitute an essential part of docking sites with a stoichiometry of one docking site per cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It may be asked to what extent this conclusion depends on correcting ND values for recording bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this correction were omitted, the mean ND/NC ratio would be 1.44, that is, still closer to 1 than to 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the conclusion concerning the docking site is that cluster stoichiometry does not depend on correcting ND.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated labeling efficiency of Cav2.1 channels as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using two-photon calcium concentration imaging, Brenowitz and Regehr (71) estimated that the number of calcium ions entering a PF bouton upon presynaptic AP firing is 11,000 on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the charge influx via calcium channels is twice this number times the charge of an electron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single PF bouton has 1.09 synapses on average in P17 rats (33), so we divided the charge influx by this number to obtain the charge influx per AZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cav2.1 channels mediate 50% of the calcium concentration increase in response to presynaptic APs at P9P14 (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the charge influx per AP through Cav2.1 channels is calculated as 1.62 fC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We calculate the charge carried by a single calcium channel in response to a presynaptic AP as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bischofberger et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (72) measured the total calcium influx in a mossy fiber bouton as 119 fC by direct presynaptic recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using nonstationary fluctuation analysis of the calcium current in the same preparation, Li et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (73) estimated that the total number of calcium channels is 2,007 on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate a 59.3-aC charge carried by a single calcium channel per AP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we divide the total Cav2.1 channel-mediated charge influx per AZ (1.62 fC) with the charge influx through single channels, we obtain 27.3 as the number of functional P/Q-type channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our SDS-FRL showed 17.0 Cav2.1 particles on average in a single AZ, giving an estimated labeling efficiency of 62.3%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study suggests that, at PFMLI synapses, VGCC clusters constitute morphological substrates for functionally defined SV docking sites and that docked SVs associate with VGCC clusters on a one-to-one basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In addition to numerical comparisons between ND and NC concerning mean values, ranges, and age-related changes, our results provide indications of possible cellular mechanisms underlying intersynaptic variations of VGCC clusters and SV docking sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important clue is that ND is correlated with quantal size at simple PFMLI synapses (Fig 1H), confirming and extending previous results at simple MLIMLI synapses (10, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation presumably results from a series of intermediate links.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that quantal size is linked to the number of postsynaptic receptors, which is itself determined by the PSD area (36, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At PFMLI synapses, the density of AMPA receptors in the PSD is remarkably high (37), so that, despite the small PSD size, the mean quantal size is very large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this density remains constant, whereas PSD sizes vary, so that differences in PSD areas translate into differences in receptor numbers (37) and therefore in quantal sizes (9) as shown in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is well established that PSD and AZ areas are tightly matched (e.g., 46), as confirmed in the present work (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our results indicate that AZ area and NC are correlated (Fig 7 J and K), so that docking-site density is roughly constant within the AZ at a given age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This last result is in line with previous electron microscopy data showing a correlation between AZ area and number of docked SVs (26, 28, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, this series of correlations accounts for the link between NC and quantal size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under our assumption that NC and ND are equal, they also account for the observed link between ND and quantal size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When examined as a function of age, all of the above parameters (ND, quantal size, PSD area, AZ area, and NC) tend to decrease together due to a general adjustment of the synapse to a smaller size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Changes_of_Synaptic_Properties_with_Age  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results reveal complex changes of synaptic properties between 2 wk and 4 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, our findings indicate a developmental sharpening of synaptic organization and function at the level of simple synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morphologically, the sizes of both the AZ and the PSD decrease with age, together with the number of VGCC clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar reduction during development of the AZ surface area has been previously reported at the calyx of Held (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionally, we find a decreased signaling of simple PFMLI synapses with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fact is due to the combination of three separate effects: a decrease of the quantal size; a decrease of ND; and a decrease in the probability of release at each docking site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding of a decrease in quantal size between 2 wk and 4 wk is consistent with a similar decrease at MLIMLI synapses (47) but contrasts with the reported increase at the calyx of Held between 1 wk and 2 wk (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding of a decrease of ND is consistent with our finding of a decrease in the quantal size, given the correspondence between the sizes of pre- and postsynaptic structures at simple synapses (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also in accord with an earlier report of a decrease with age in the number of docked SVs at calyx AZs (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the finding of a decrease in release probability is consistent with previous results at several types of central synapses (4750; but see 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the calyx of Held this decrease is associated with a shortening of the AP waveform (51) and a consequent decrease of Ca2+ entry (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, a similar sharpening occurs at the level of VGCCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although numbers of VGCCs per cluster are similar at 2 wk and 4 wk, the density of channels within each cluster, like the density of clusters within the AZ, is higher at 4 wk than at 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tighter VGCC arrangement presumably allows for more efficient coupling between Ca2+ entry and SV release at 4 wk compared with 2 wk and is consistent with the finding that the blocking efficiency of EGTA on transmitter release decreases with age at the calyx of Held (34, 52, 53; review: ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16), at PFPC synapses (32), and at amacrine cell synapses (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, recent morphological data show an age-dependent tightening of the VGCCSV arrangement in AZs of the fly neuromuscular junction (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, it appears that at PFMLI synapses several factors contribute to improving the efficiency of synaptic function during development, both at the level of simple synapses and at the level of single docking sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These adaptations may be seen as a way to spare metabolic costs in a maturing neuronal circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Site_of_SV_Fusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent models developed at the calyx of Held (exclusion zone model) (55) (perimeter release model) (34) do not incorporate any restriction in the number of SVs released per VGCC cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, functional data at PFMLI simple synapses imply that at most NC SVs are released per docking site and per AP (9, 29; this work) (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the present finding that ND and NC are equal, we propose that, at PFMLI synapses, either 0 or 1 fusion-competent SV is docked per VGCC cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is similar to the proposed association of precisely defined docking sites with a cluster of cacophony channels at the fly neuromuscular junction (23, 24) with the important difference that, in the fly, several docking sites are associated with one VGCC cluster, whereas we propose here a one-to-one stoichiometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results indicate an intercluster center-to-center distance of 97 nm at both 2 wk and 4 wk, representing twice the SV diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because each cluster itself has a diameter of 3739 nm, roughly the size of a SV, there is space for only one SV between two clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, each VGCC cluster is surrounded by sufficient free space to allow SV fusion in any direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only a fraction of this space is suitable for SV docking because we find that VGCC clusters are often located at the periphery of the AZ (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future investigations will be required to define the cellular mechanisms responsible for the one-to-one stoichiometry observed between VGCC clusters and docking sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another remaining source of uncertainty concerns SV supply.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Docking-site replenishment is a Ca2+-driven process (3) that depends on filament-like links between SVs and plasma membrane (20, 24, 56, 57), possibly involving actin and myosin II (5861).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PFMLI synapses, recent results indicate that an empty docking site is resupplied by a replacement SV that moves toward the docking site by a cytoskeleton-driven transition (two-step model) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this movement depends on Ca2+, the VGCC cluster associated with the docking site is actually used twice, once for loading the docking site and again for exocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains unclear how replacement SV and docked SV are positioned in relation with the VGCC cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
General_Recording_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sagittal slices (200 µm thick) were prepared from the cerebellar vermis of SpragueDawley rats (P12P29) following the animal care guidelines of Université Paris Descartes (approval no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A-750607).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Procedures to record from MLIs were as described (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 2/3 of the recordings were from basket cells, defined as MLIs located in the proximal third of the molecular layer, and the remaining 1/3 were stellate cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This percentage applies to all electrophysiology data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composition of the standard extracellular solution was (in mM): 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1.3 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 2 CaCl2, and 1 MgCl2; osmolarity: 300 mosm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This solution was equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standard internal recording solution contained (in mM): 144 K-glutamate, 6 KCl, 4.6 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 0.1 CaCl2, 10 Hepes-K, 4 ATP-Na, 0.4 GTPNa; pH 7.3; osmolarity: 300 mosm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were at 3034 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Simple_Synapse_Recording  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Extracellular stimulation and recording of simple PFMLI synapses were obtained under voltage clamp at 60 mV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For extracellular stimulation, a monopolar pipette was filled with internal solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To record from simple synapses, the extracellular solution was switched to a new solution containing 3 mM external calcium to enhance release probability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMDA receptors and GABAA receptors were blocked by inclusion of d()-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (50 µM) and gabazine (15 µM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find an appropriate location for electrical stimulation, we puff-applied the internal solution including 150 mM K+ from the monopolar pipette using small pressure steps while moving the pipette in the GC layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we found a burst-like EPSC response in the postsynaptic cell, we gradually reduced the pressure of puffing to better define the spot for stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having found postsynaptic responses with minimum puff applications of the high-K solution, we switched to electrical stimulation, keeping the same stimulation pipette, and we further optimized the pipette location to minimize the intensity needed to stimulate the connected GC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this stage, it was often possible to identify visually the presynaptic GC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in one variant procedure (paired recordings), the presynaptic GC was recorded in the cell-attached condition, and corresponding simple synapse EPSCs were obtained by applying large-amplitude voltage steps to the presynaptic GC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, extracellular stimulation was applied by using voltage steps of 1040 V (0.10.18 ms of duration).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During recording, amplitudes of late events were visually inspected, and if these amplitudes appeared heterogeneous, the corresponding stimulation site was abandoned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Definitive acceptance of the experiment as a usable simple synapse recording occurred after analysis and depended on three criteria (9): (i) a decrement of EPSC amplitudes of second events in a pair, reflecting activation of a common set of receptors belonging to one PSD; (ii) a Gaussian distribution of EPSC amplitudes with a coefficient of variation (CV) less than 0.5; and (iii) stability of the overall responsiveness over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trains of eight such stimulation pulses (interstimulus interval: 5 ms) were applied repetitively, with intervals of 10 s between trains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical data were derived from sequences of 1030 trains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SDS-FRL  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SDS-FRL was performed using some modifications (37, 6365) of the original technique developed by Fujimoto (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sagittal slices (thickness: 200 µm) were prepared from the cerebellar vermis of SpragueDawley rats (P14, P15, and P29) in the same way as for electrophysiological experiments, followed by immersion fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB; 0.1 M; pH 7.4) for 2 h at room temperature (2224 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sagittal sections (thickness: 70 µm) were cut from fixed slices using a vibrating microslicer (Linear-Pro7, Dosaka) in PB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sections were immersed in graded glycerol of 1530% in PB at 4 °C overnight and then rapidly frozen by use of a high-pressure freezing machine (HPM010, BAL-TEC, Balzers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen samples were then fractured at 140 °C by a double-replica method in a freeze-etching device (BAF060, BAL-TEC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fractured faces were replicated by sequential deposition of carbon (thickness: 5 nm from a 90 ° angle, rotating), platinum-carbon (thickness: 2 nm from a 60 ° angle, unidirectional), and carbon again (thickness: 15 nm from a 90 ° angle, rotating).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonreplicated tissue was solubilized in a solution containing 15 mM TrisHCl, 20% sucrose, and 2.5% SDS, pH 8.3, with gentle shaking at 77 °C for 9 h (P14, P15) or 18 h (P29), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The replicas were washed three times in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% BSA, and nonspecific binding sites were then blocked with 5% BSA in TBS for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In single-labeling experiments, the primary antibody (anti-rabbit Kv4.3; 3 g/mL; Alomone Laboratories) was applied in TBS containing 2% BSA for 3 d at 15 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rabbit anti-neurexin antibody was generated using nine amino acid residues common to neurexin 13 and belonging to the C-terminal region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specificity of this antibody was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig S6) using mouse brain homogenate and immunoprecipitate pulled down with GST-CASK-D [pGEXCASK325 (328909)] as described previously (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For multiple labeling experiments for AZ proteins with VGluT1 or VGAT, primary antibodies were applied simultaneously: ELKS, 2 g/mL (68); RIM1/2, 2 g/mL (Synaptic Systems); neurexins, 2 g/mL; VGluT1, 2 g/mL (Frontier Institute); VGAT, 5 g/mL (Synaptic Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The replicas were then washed in TBS containing 0.05% BSA three times for 10 min each at room temperature and incubated overnight at room temperature with anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to 2-nm gold particles (British Biocell International) for AZ proteins, anti-guinea pig secondary antibodies conjugated to 10-nm gold particles for VGluT1, or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to 15-nm gold particles for VGAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of multiple labeling experiments for Cav2.1 with AZ proteins (ELKS, RIM, and neurexin), replicas were first incubated with the Cav2.1 antibody (8 g/mL, Frontier Institute) (69) for 3 d at 15 °C and then with anti-guinea pig secondary antibodies conjugated to 5-nm gold particles overnight at 15 °C followed by incubation with the AZ protein antibodies (2 g/mL for ELKS, RIM, and neurexin) for 2 d at 15 °C, and finally with anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to 2-nm gold particles for AZ proteins overnight at 15 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After immunogold labeling, the replicas were rinsed three times with 0.05% BSA/TBS, washed with TBS and distilled water, and mounted on formvar-coated 100-line copper grids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For measurement of intramembrane particle cluster area and quantification of Cav2.1 immunolabeling density, labeled replicas were examined in a Tecnai-12 transmission electron microscope (FEI; AV 120 kV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image acquisition used magnifications of 97 kx and 135 kx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cav2.1 antibody used in this study revealed labeling only at the P-face of the plasma membrane, whereas no labeling was found at the E-face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunolabeling specificity of the Cav2.1 antibody was confirmed by applying it to cerebellar tissue samples from Cav2.1 KO mice (70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the measurement of immunogold particle densities, profiles of presynaptic AZs were tilted in the electron beam to attain a planar view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from two animals (two samples from each animal) were pooled together because neither the KruskalWalliss test nor the MannWhitney U test showed significant differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Criteria_for_AZ_Boundaries  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two steps were undertaken for restricting measurements of AZ areas to single AZs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid sampling of particles outside the synaptic area, we first eliminated images where the longest distance between 2/5 nm gold particles in the defined AZ region was  greater than 450 nm for 2 wk and  greater than 320 nm for 4 wk, corresponding to the respective maximum sizes observed for the PSD area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude segregated synapses (Fig S7), we eliminated cases where a single gold particle or the center of an individual particle cluster was  greater than 150 nm away from the nearest particle cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The threshold of 150 nm was derived from the shortest distance observed between IMP clusters on the E-face of MLI dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
