title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dynamically reinforced heterogeneous grain structure prolongs ductility in a medium-entropy alloy with gigapascal yield strength  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Back stress hardening is usually not obvious in single-phase homogeneous grains, but can be made unusually large and sustained to large tensile strains by creating an unusually heterogeneous grain structure in single-phase alloys with low stacking fault energy (SFE), as demonstrated here for the face-centered cubic CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low SFE facilitates the generation of twinned nanograins and stacking faults during tensile straining, dynamically reinforcing the heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large uniform tensile strain can be achieved after yielding even at gigapascal stress, in the absence of heterogeneities from any second phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ductility, i.e., uniform strain achievable in uniaxial tension, diminishes for materials with very high yield strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even for the CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy (MEA), which has a simple face-centered cubic (FCC) structure that would bode well for high ductility, the fine grains processed to achieve gigapascal strength exhaust the strain hardening ability such that, after yielding, the uniform tensile strain is as low as 2%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we purposely deploy, in this MEA, a three-level heterogeneous grain structure (HGS) with grain sizes spanning the nanometer to micrometer range, imparting a high yield strength well in excess of 1 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This heterogeneity results from this alloys low stacking fault energy, which facilitates corner twins in recrystallization and stores deformation twins and stacking faults during tensile straining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After yielding, the elastoplastic transition through load transfer and strain partitioning among grains of different sizes leads to an upturn of the strain hardening rate, and, upon further tensile straining at room temperature, corner twins evolve into nanograins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dynamically reinforced HGS leads to a sustainable strain hardening rate, a record-wide hysteresis loop in loadunloadreload stressstrain curve and hence high back stresses, and, consequently, a uniform tensile strain of 22%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, this HGS achieves, in a single-phase FCC alloy, a strengthductility combination that would normally require heterogeneous microstructures such as in dual-phase steels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Material_Fabrication_and_Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, an equimolar CrCoNi MEA was fabricated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purity of each raw elemental material was higher than 99.9 wt %.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A bulk ingot, weighting 3 kg, was produced by electromagnetic levitation melting in a high-purity argon atmosphere and cast to an ingot with a diameter of 120 mm and a height of 100 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ingot was then remelted five times to improve the homogeneity of both the chemical composition and microstructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actual chemical composition was measured to be 30.77Cr33.81Co35.34Ni (wt %), i.e., 33.48Cr32.46Co34.06Ni (atomic percent).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ingot was homogenized at 1,473 K for 12 h, hot-forged in between 1,323 K and 1,173 K into slabs of 10 mm in thickness, and finally cold rolled into sheets 0.5 mm thick.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No cracks were observed on the surfaces of the cold-rolled sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sheets were subsequently annealed at varying temperatures ranging from 473 K to 1,473 K for 1 h followed by water quenching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data presented in this paper are for annealing at 873 K for 1 h, which produced a partially recrystallized microstructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanical_Property_Testing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The flat dog-boneshaped tensile specimens, with a gauge length of 15 mm and width of 4 mm, were cut from the annealed sheets with their longitudinal axes parallel to the rolling direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All specimens were mechanically polished before tensile tests to remove surface irregularities and to ensure a more accurate determination of the cross-sectional area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quasi-static uniaxial tensile tests were carried out using an MTS Landmark testing machine operating at a strain rate of 5 × 104 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tensile tests were conducted at room temperature (298 K) and liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LUR tensile tests were conducted to characterize the back stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methods for calculating the back stresses from LUR tensile test curves can be found in a previous paper (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conditions for LUR tests were the same as those for monotonic tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All tensile tests were conducted using a 10-mm-gauge extensometer to monitor the engineering strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five samples were tested for each condition to verify the reproducibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Microstructural_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SEM (JEOL JSM-7001F) was used to characterize the cross-sectional microstructural evolution of the annealed CrCoNi MEA before and after tensile tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EBSD measurements were performed with a DigiView camera and the TSL OIM data collection software (www.edax.com/Products/EBSD/OIM-Data-Collection-EBSD-SEM.aspx), at an EBSD step size of 40 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grain boundary was defined by misorientation angle larger than 15°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanograins were colored based on the magnitude of the Schmid factor (60), in the undeformed and deformed microstructure, to partially reflect the orientation change, and, in turn, the deformation level, of nanograins during tensile deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local grain misorientation information is provided through the grain reference orientation distribution (61) in SI Appendix, Fig S7, to help track recrystallized grains in the HGS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A high-spatial-resolution analytical electron microscope (JEM 2010F) operating at 200 kV was used for examination of the microstructural features after tensile testing at designated strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thin foils for TEM observations were cut from the gauge sections of the tensile samples, ion-thinned to about 40 µm thick, and finally thinned by a twin-jet polishing facility using a solution of 5% perchloric acid and 95% ethanol at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
