Adaptive self-organization of Balis ancient rice terraces  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Bali, the cooperative management of rice terraces extends beyond villages to whole watersheds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand why, we created a model that explores how cooperation can propagate from pairs of individuals to extended groups, creating a resilient system of bottom-up management that both increases and equalizes harvests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial patterns of collective crop managementobservable in Google Earthclosely match the predictions of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial patterning that emerges is nonuniform and scale-free.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the model parameters here are tuned to Bali, similar mechanisms of emergent global control should be detectible in other anthropogenic landscapes using multispectral imagery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recognizing this signature of emergent system-wide cooperation may help planners to avoid unproductive changes to successful bottom-up systems of environmental management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spatial patterning often occurs in ecosystems as a result of a self-organizing process caused by feedback between organisms and the physical environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the spatial patterns observable in centuries-old Balinese rice terraces are also created by feedback between farmers decisions and the ecology of the paddies, which triggers a transition from local to global-scale control of water shortages and rice pests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose an evolutionary game, based on local farmers decisions that predicts specific power laws in spatial patterning that are also seen in a multispectral image analysis of Balinese rice terraces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model shows how feedbacks between human decisions and ecosystem processes can evolve toward an optimal state in which total harvests are maximized and the system approaches Pareto optimality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It helps explain how multiscale cooperation from the community to the watershed scale could persist for centuries, and why the disruption of this self-organizing system by the Green Revolution caused chaos in irrigation and devastating losses from pests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model shows that adaptation in a coupled humannatural system can trigger self-organized criticality (SOC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In previous exogenously driven SOC models, adaptation plays no role, and no optimization occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, adaptive SOC is a self-organizing process where local adaptations drive the system toward local and global optima.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

(A) Location of study sites: six randomly selected rice-growing regions of Bali.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photosynthetic activity was analyzed using multispectral and panchromatic satellite images to classify four stages of rice growth in the terraces, which appear as differently colored patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Image analysis of rice growth (indicating synchronized irrigation schedules in the region of Gianyar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four colors of the patches indicate the four stages: growing rice (yellow), harvest (green), flooded (red), drained (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Cumulative distribution of the patch sizes P(s) for Gianyar (red circles) and for our model results (blue squares).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Inset) All 13 observations at the six regions, indicating power-law behavior, with an exponent around 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Correlation functions C(d) of the image (planting regions only) as a function of distance for Gianyar (red) and the model (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slow decay (power law) indicates long-range correlations, or system-wide connectivity of patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Inset) All 13 observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Appendix for details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Update rule for farmer i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colors denote irrigation schedules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, green might signify planting in January, and blue might signify planting in March.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At time t+1, farmer i compares his harvest with those of his four closest neighbors at time t. Because the red schedule produced the best harvests, he adopts it for the next cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This update corresponds to step iii in the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(A) Evolution of the irrigation schedules from an initial random configuration at t=0 to t=10, whereupon patch sizes become power-law distributed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At t=400, the irrigation patterns have changed very little and approach a long-lived steady state distribution (see SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Effect of decision rules on harvests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the maximum rule (step iii, where farmers choose the best harvest in their neighborhood), average harvests rapidly increase as patch distributions shift to the power-law distribution (blue line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar rapid increase occurs for the majority update strategy, where farmers copy the schedule of the majority (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To copy a random neighbors irrigation schedule is the random strategy (pink) that leads to inferior harvests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extending this logic, when farmers update according to the minority of their neighbors, harvests do not improve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum possible harvest is H=H0=5 in the absence of pest or water stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the simulation shown, both pest and water stress are strongly present, a=0.5 and b=9.6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The model evolves through a process of trial-and-error adaptation by the farmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At first, in the initial random state (t=0), the correlation between farms is close to zero (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What happens next depends on the ecological parameters pests (a) and water stress (b), and on the decision rule followed by the farmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are three trivial attractors (phases) (SI Appendix, Fig S4): (i) If water stress is negligible (b1) eventually all farms adopt the same irrigation schedule to control pests, resulting in a single uniform patch that spans the entire lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) If b20a, water stress dominates, and many small patches appear; this increases the variance of irrigation schedules, reducing water stress, but allows pests to migrate between adjacent patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) For bless_than20a, after a very long transient phase (thousands of cycles), a quadrant state is reached that separates the lattice into four quadrants with the same irrigation schedules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fourth attractor, which is nontrivial, emerges at the phase transition, exactly at the boundary where the water and pest stress phases equalize.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation lengths increase as the cycles of planting and harvest progress, and farms coalesce into small, irregularly sized patches with identical irrigation schedules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patches form very quickly, as seen in Fig 3A, and soon become large enough to dramatically reduce pest damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uniformly short correlation distances indicate that the patches are functionally independent: Each patch discovers its own solution to the pestwater trade-off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rice harvests improve rapidly within the first time steps, and correlations between farms increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is still some variation in harvests, so farms on the borders of the patches continue to experiment with different irrigation schedules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adaptation ceases when no farm can improve its harvest by changing its irrigation schedule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geographic scale at which the pestwater trade-off is solved shifts from many small independent patches (small correlation length) to the entire lattice by (t=10), equivalent to 5 y of double cropping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently there is little change: At t=400, the situation is very similar to t=10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3B, we study the average harvest H=1/L2i=1L2Hi as a function of simulation time steps (blue line, maximum strategy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see that the maximum of H is reached very soon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, cooperation quickly spans the entire lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harvests tend to increase and equalize, approaching Pareto optimality at the phase transition where both the frequency distribution of synchronized irrigation patches and the correlations between them become power laws.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Pareto optimality is a state of resource allocation from which it is impossible to reallocate so as to make any individual better off without making at least one individual worse off.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the phase diagram for the lattice model, this balance occurs in a narrow region at the boundary between the regions dominated by pests and water (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting distribution of colored patches (synchronized irrigation schedules) on the lattice is readily comparable with the satellite imagery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_with_Satellite_Imagery  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyzed patch distributions in six rice-growing regions, randomly selected on the basis of absence of cloud cover (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1B shows one of these regions (Gianyar) on a particular observation day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four different phases of rice growth corresponding to the irrigation schedules are clearly visible in the multispectral and panchromatic satellite images: growing rice, harvest, flooded, and drained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image analysis is based on measuring photosynthetic activity; see Methods and SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1C shows the cumulative distribution function (red circles) of the patch sizes s, as they are found in Fig 1B (Gianyar region).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows a power-law distribution P(s)s with a tail exponent of =0.93(0.07); the SE is given in brackets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patch size distributions for all other regions at all observation times are shown in Fig 1C, Inset; corresponding exponents are fitted from the data with a standard maximum likelihood estimator (see SI Appendix) and are listed in SI Appendix, Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cumulative patch size distribution is visible in the power law (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model results (blue squares) for the phase transition (when b/a20 at t=400) closely matches the empirical data (red circles), and would be very similar at t=10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar agreement occurs in the correlation function C(d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the appropriately scaled model results (to match the length scales in the satellite images and the model dimension), we find very similar functional dependence of the correlation function in Fig 1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both data and model show an approximate power-law decay in the correlation function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Correlation functions C(d) provide a second measure of the scale of cooperation among farmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1D (red) for Gianyar, we see that correlation functions decay slowly with distance: The closer two patches are, the more likely they are to follow the same irrigation schedule, indicating that all patches are linked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation functions decline as a power law.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the state of each patch affects all of the others, and the Gianyar rice terraces form an integrated (globally coupled) system; Fig 1D, Inset shows that this is true for all regions and observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the typical correlation length, we define it as the variance of the correlation function; see Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Gianyar, the correlation length turns out to be =373 m, spanning all patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results for the other regions are found in SI Appendix, Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We performed a systematic study of the dependence of the average harvests H, the power-law exponents , and the correlation lengths  on the parameters a and b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are shown in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we observe the emergence of critical behavior at a region where water stress and pest stress balance as adaptation progresses in the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region is highlighted with white lines in Fig 4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison with the observed data for the power-law exponent  in SI Appendix, Table S2 suggests that model results from this parameter region are compatible with the empirical data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the critical region, the entire system of farms becomes correlated as global control emerges from simple local interactions between farmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We suggest that the dynamics captured in the lattice model described above show that self-organized criticality (SOC) can emerge from an adaptive process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence that this finding tells us something about the Balinese subak system is based on the remarkable similarity of the distributions of patch sizes and correlation distances in the satellite imagery and the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, power-law distributions can occur for many reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, they often occur in vegetation patches in dryland ecosystems under stress (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, vegetation patches in natural ecosystems are functionally similar, differing only in size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the vegetation patches that make up the mosaics of the rice terraces, size matters, but so does the age of the rice crop in each patch, which depends on the irrigation schedules selected by the farmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any explanation for the observed power-law distribution of patches in the rice terraces needs to account for this functional coupling of irrigation schedules and ecosystem dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our adaptive SOC model tests the hypothesis that the observed mosaic patterns might arise from the farmers efforts to optimize the pestwater trade-off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model shows that, if the adaptive dynamics are driven by the pestwater trade-off, there exist critical points where the power-law distribution is the attractor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because approximate Pareto optimality emerges at this point, where the pestwater trade-off is optimized at all scales, the model also suggests an explanation for the historical persistence of this attractor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these reasons, we suggest that the emergence of power-law mosaics is not a purely biological phenomenon but is the outcome of ongoing coupled humannatural dynamical interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two further assumptions of the model can be evaluated with historical data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, the model assumes that subaks actively cooperate to minimize losses due to pests and water shortages by synchronizing their irrigation schedules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption can be evaluated in light of historical evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the ninth to the 14th centuries AD, numerous royal inscriptions encouraged villagers to construct irrigation systems, and left water management in their hands (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of Balis steep volcanic topography, the spatial distribution of Balinese irrigation canals, which by their nature cross community boundaries, made it impossible for irrigation to be handled at a purely community level (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later on, both Balinese and European manuscripts describe cooperative management by the subaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soon after the final conquest of Bali by the Dutch in 1908, the colonial irrigation engineer tasked with surveying Balinese irrigation wrote if due to lack of water not all areas can get water, then they create a turn-taking which is decided upon during the monthly meetings (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Second, the model predicts that rice yields will be optimized by irrigation schedules that balance the pestwater trade-off for multisubak groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prediction was inadvertently tested by the introduction of Green Revolution agriculture to Bali in the 1970s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At that time, the subaks were required to give up the right to set their own irrigation schedules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, each farmer was instructed to cultivate Green Revolution rice as often as possible, resulting in unsynchronized planting schedules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 1977, 70% of southern Balinese rice terraces were planted with Green Revolution rice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At first, rice harvests increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within 2 y, however, Balinese agricultural and irrigation workers reported chaos in water scheduling and explosions of pest populations (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3, p. 114).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1985, the Department of Public Works in Tabanan (the largest rice-growing regency in Bali) reported that the following factors caused the explosion of pests and diseases: 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In areas with sufficient irrigation water, farmers are now planting continuously throughout the year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In areas with insufficient water, farmers are planting without a coordinated schedule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the farmers/subaks have ceased to follow the centuries-old cyclical cropping patterns (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was only when farmers spontaneously returned to synchronized planting schemes that harvests began to recover, a point subsequently acknowledged by the final evaluation team from the Asian Development Bank (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Why was the functional significance of multisubak cooperation not apparent to the Green Revolution planners?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model suggests a possible explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Power-law distributions of dryland vegetation are comparatively obvious because the patches differ only in size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, adaptive management by the subaks creates differentiated patches of varying size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinction is significant, not only because similar versus differentiated patches occur for different reasons but also because it is harder for observers to detect the connectivity of differentiated patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps partly for this reason, until now theoretical models of coupled humannatural systems like rice terraces have not anticipated or accounted for the emergence of global-scale connectivity, focusing instead on local interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model also suggests an explanation for the widespread occurrence of fragile kilometers-long irrigation systems linking multiple subaks in the mountains of Bali.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If management by the subaks were purely local, leaving downstream subaks at the mercy of their upstream neighbors, these irrigation works would be pointless, and the total area of terraced fields on the island could never have reached its historic extent (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In retrospect, it is not surprising that the concept of SOC is relevant to the emergence of cooperation in human interactions with ecosystem processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models of SOC were developed to understand how small-scale local interactions can transit to integrated global connectivity, popularized by the compelling sandpile example (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These models often behave as if operating exactly at a phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There, the systems become critical, which means that correlations become long-range, and effectively span the entire system, even though interactions only happen at the local nearest-neighbor level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the subak lattice model, realistic configurations of patches appear after just a few simulation steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, harvests approach Pareto optimality (if any farmer changes his irrigation pattern, his rice harvests or those of other farmers will decline).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total harvest of all farms is also maximized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subak model does not evolve to full alignment of behavior (except when b=0), which would minimize pest losses but maximize water stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, at the critical point, the adaptive update process of farmers continues to a point where correlations span the entire system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this reason, we call the model dynamics adaptive SOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conclude with the question of whether these results are likely to be unusual, perhaps even unique to Bali.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scope of the model is limited by the physical geography of Bali.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four crater lakes store rainfall that feeds the groundwater system, but they have no river outlets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the steep porous volcanic slopes, rivers recharge very quickly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Irrigation systems consist of one to six closely spaced weirs and springs that provide water for one or more subaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These local irrigation systems are functionally independent: Although they remove most or all of the flow, a kilometer or two downstream, it will be replenished from groundwater flows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model captures the adaptive process at this scale, where local groups of farmers meet face to face to solve the pestwater trade-off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept of emergent global-scale connectivity in our model, which we borrow from physics, does not refer to all of the subaks on a river but to these smaller functionally independent groups of subaks, such as those shown in Fig 1B and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S6S17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This configuration of water distribution contrasts with a typical desert river, where the effects of upstream irrigation may be felt far downstream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If several subaks share water resources, their elected leaders meet to negotiate irrigation schedules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this higher-level coordination between subaks is not explicitly included in the model, the decision-making process is the same: a trial-and-error adaptation to reduce pest and water stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These meetings take place in regional water temples and make use of a sophisticated permutational calendar to plan and implement staggered irrigation schedules (14, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cultural innovations undoubtedly facilitate adaptation to changing pestwater dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the model does not require calendars or water temples; instead, it helps to clarify the functional significance of these social constructs for sustaining approximate Pareto optimality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model shows that the simple pestwater trade-off triggers continuous transitions that turn adaptive agents on a two-dimensional lattice into a coevolving system capable of solving the pestwater trade-off by means of local decision-making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike Gunderson and Hollings well-known model of adaptive cycles (17), here increasing connectivity does not cause collapse but stabilizes at a scale-free distribution of functionally varied patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is quite a general result that may be common in coupled humannatural systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any anthropogenic landscape, correlations between patches will provide some information about the scale of human management (see SI Appendix for code).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If Balis subaks are not unique, and adaptive SOC occurs in the management of the commons elsewhere, it should be readily detectible from correlated patch distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Correlation_Functions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use a definition of correlation function C(d) that is based on the mutual information between the cropping pattern X at site i and the cropping pattern Y at site j, where the distance from site i to j is d. The mutual information measures how much the knowledge of the cropping pattern at one site reduces the uncertainty on the knowledge of the cropping pattern at the other site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is defined asC(d)=1NX=14Y=14Pd(X,Y)log2Pd(X,Y)Pd(X)Pd(Y),[1]where Pd(X,Y) is the probability of cropping patterns X and Y occurring at sites that are a distance d apart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that X and Y take values from 1 to 4 with 1=green, 2=red, 3=blue and 4=yellow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Operationally, the joint probability Pd(X,Y) is determined by taking the relative frequency of the cropping patterns X and Y against all possible combinations of cropping patterns between sites at a relative distance d. Note that the site here refers either to a pixel in the satellite image or to a lattice site for the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marginal probability of cropping pattern X (or Y) is Pd(X) [or Pd(Y)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N is the normalization constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is equal to the Shannon entropy of the cropping pattern X, i.e., N=X=14P0(X)log2P0(X).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It ensures that the correlation is normalized, so that C(d=0)=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use this definition for the correlation function because it is applicable to random variables in symbolic form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standard correlation function in two dimensions is inappropriate, as it needs random variables in numeric form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these two definitions for the correlation functions are closely related if the joint probability distribution is Gaussian (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Correlation_Length  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The correlation length  is defined as the variance (second moment) of the correlation function from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1,=(dd2C(d)dC(d))12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#
