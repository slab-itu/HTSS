Crystallography captures catalytic steps in human methionine adenosyltransferase enzymes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
X-ray crystallography provides a structural basis for enzyme mechanisms by elucidating information about the chemical reaction occurring within the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallographic structures can also aid in rational drug design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A highly conserved family of methionine adenosyltranferases (MATs) produces S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) via an ATP-driven process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dysregulation of MAT enzymes has been tightly linked to liver and colon cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present crystal structures of human MAT2 proteins containing different ligands within the active site, allowing for a step change in our understanding of how this enzyme uses its substrates, methionine and adenosine, to produce the product SAMe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The principal methyl donor of the cell, S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), is produced by the highly conserved family of methionine adenosyltranferases (MATs) via an ATP-driven process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These enzymes play an important role in the preservation of life, and their dysregulation has been tightly linked to liver and colon cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present crystal structures of human MAT2 containing various bound ligands, providing a structural movie of the catalytic steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High- to atomic-resolution structures reveal the structural elements of the enzyme involved in utilization of the substrates methionine and adenosine and in formation of the product SAMe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAT enzymes are also able to produce S-adenosylethionine (SAE) from substrate ethionine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ethionine, an S-ethyl analog of the amino acid methionine, is known to induce steatosis and pancreatitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that SAE occupies the active site in a manner similar to SAMe, confirming that ethionine also uses the same catalytic site to form the product SAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From_Substrate_Binding_to_SAMe_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We obtained the atomic resolution structure (SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP) at 1.1 Å (Table 1) by incubation with AMP-PNP and methionine (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atomic resolution allows us to resolve multiple ligands with partial occupancies, including substrates and products within the active site; methionine (occupancy, 0.3), adenosine (occupancy, 0.5), SAMe (occupancy, 0.5), and PPNP (occupancy, 0.7) can be seen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An omit map clearly shows the substrate methionine in a position not previously observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It sits within the active site, so that its functional group is directed away from its final location as part of the product SAMe (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To clearly illustrate the components of the mixed active site, we present three snapshots representing different states in Fig 1 BD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first step, the orientation of methionine before SAMe formation (Fig 1B) and the hydrolysis of the AMP-PNP into adenosine (ADO) and PPNP (Fig 1C) are observed, whereas in the second step, the formation of SAMe and the placement of PPNP before its hydrolysis into pyrophosphate (PPi) and orthophosphate (Pi) (Fig 1D) is seen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrate methionine is hydrogen-bonded only via its nitrogen with OE1 atoms of Glu70 (2.8 Å) and OD1 atoms of Asp258 (2.7 Å) and via its two terminal oxygens with NE2 atoms of Gln113 (3.0 Å) and water ligands (Fig 1B), which allows its side chain extra flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of ADO is maintained through - stacking between the purine base adenine and Phe250, as well as several hydrogen bonds with the side chain O of Ser247 (2.8 Å), main chain oxygen of Arg249 (2.9 Å), and water (Fig 1 AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One water molecule forms a hydrogen bond with another water molecule and the O4 of adenosine, and occupies the position in which eventually the sulfur of SAMe lies (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The triple phosphate can be modeled precisely owing to the high quality of the omit map at atomic resolution (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 A, C, and D and 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PPNP is secured in place through multiple interactions with residues His29, Lys181, Lys265, Ap291, and Ala281; water; two hexacoordinated magnesium ions; and a pentacoordinated potassium ion (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The product SAMe lies within the active site, interacting with the same residues that secure the methionine main chain and the ADO molecule, identical to those in the first step, whereas the S atom of SAMe occupies the position previously occupied by a water molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mode_of_PPNP_Binding_Is_Persevered_in_the_Absence_of_the_Regulatory_Subunit  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reexamination of the PPNP conformation in the MAT(2)4(V2)2 complex structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 4NDN] using this group from the 1.1-Å SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP structural model suggests that the PPNP was not correctly positioned, given that lower-resolution MAT2 structures did not allow identification of Mg ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positioning of these phosphates and three metal ions from the current atomic resolution structure of MAT2 into the lower-resolution electron density map of the MAT2 complexes gives a much improved fit to the electron density (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformation of the triple phosphate is preserved in both the MAT2V2 and SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position is also the same in AMP-PNP from Escherichia coli MAT (PDB ID code 1P7L), despite cleavage from the adenosine moiety (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PPNP_Does_Not_Provide_the_Energy_to_Open_the_Gating_Loop  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure of (PPNP-bound) MAT2 has a disordered gating loop, providing direct evidence against the idea that it provides the energy for the opening of the gate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex MAT(2)4(V2)2 (PDB ID code 4NDN) contains four active sites, two that reveal ordered gating loops and two that do not show a gating loop, presumably owing to a highly flexible, disordered nature (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two ordered sites contain SAMe, PPNP, Mg2+, and K+, whereas the disordered sites contain only an ethylene glycol molecule as a result of the cryoprotection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of (PPNP-bound) MAT2 has a disordered gating loop, and a comparison of the PPNP-bound, MAT(2)4(V2)2, and SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP structures shows that the gate is open when active site is occupied by PPNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the gate is shut like a lid when the active site is occupied by SAMe or adenosine (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A comparison of SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP structure with holo rerefined MAT2 from the MAT(2)4(V2)2 complex (Fig 3 A and B) shows that the residues in the active site do not differ in position, and that the nature of the active site in the catalytic subunit is preserved in the absence of the regulatory subunit MAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gln113 is the sole residue of the gating loop that interacts with SAMe directly through its NE2 atom, forming a hydrogen bond with the O of SAMe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ser114 interacts with a water molecule that also interacts with SAMe (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gating loop in the PPNP-bound (Fig 3C) and apo subunit of the MAT(2)4(V2)2 complex (Fig 3D) are invisible, demonstrating that the opening of the gate to release product is not driven by hydrolysis of the triple phosphate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What drives the opening of the gate and release of product remains an open question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP structure, OE1 atoms of Glu70 interact with the nitrogen atoms of Lys61 (NZ) and Ala259 (N), whereas its OE2 oxygen forms a hydrogen bond to the substrate methionine or SAMe (2.8 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glu70 maintains the same position in all holo active sites (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the apo MAT2 subunit of the MAT(2)4(V2)2 complex (Fig 3D) significant movement of the residues occurs; for example, Lys61 adopts a different conformation than the residues in all other MATs, allowing Glu70 to hydrogen-bond to an ethylene glycol molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The change in lysine conformation also enables movement of other residues in the active site; for example, Gly257 and Asp258 both move away from the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen atom, OD1, of Asp258 can no longer participate in the interaction with the potassium ion, but the movement of Asp258 enables it to interact with N of Ala259.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxygen atom, OE1, of Glu70 is unable to interact with Lys61 or Ala259, but can interact with the N of Asp258, which alters its conformation as a result of the movement of Lys61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the MAT2 structure SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP (Fig 3A), the potassium ion is present and interacts with Asp258 and PPNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the PPNP-bound MAT2 (Fig 3C), the PPNP adopts a different position in which the central phosphate PB rotates onto the side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of the residues around the PPNP remains the same as in the SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP structure, and interaction with a magnesium ion occurs, but interaction with the second magnesium ion and the potassium ion is lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the coordination through the magnesium ion, the PPNP is able to occupy the active site while the gating loop is disordered, i.e., no longer in its closed position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, there are movements in residues that interact with the potassium ion, Glu57 and Ala259, and the PPNP moiety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three further residues, namely His29, Lys181, and Asp291, that interact with the PPNP show movement in the absence of PPNP in the empty active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Catalytic_Steps_Captured_for_Human_MAT  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the structures SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP, PPNP-bound, MAT2V2 complex, and MAT from E. coli (eMAT; PDB ID code 1P7L), a detailed picture of SAMe synthesis can be provided from structural snapshots starting from substrate methionine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the initial position, the functional group of methionine is too close to the phosphate group  of ATP (here AMP-PNP; PDB ID code 1P7L), suggesting that methionine will bind first, followed by ATP binding, which will change the conformation of the methionine side chain without changing its main chain position, because the nitrogen on the methionine is at a suitable distance to form two strong hydrogen bonds with OD1 of Asp258 (2.7 Å) and OE1 of Glu70 (2.8 Å) (Fig 4A and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The conformation of AMP-PNP is stabilized by two magnesium ions, one interacting with O1A and O2B of PPNP and the other interacting with O2A, O2G, and O3G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the sulfur atom of methionine to bind with the C5 atom of AMP-PNP, the methionine has to move its side chain from its initial position toward the C5 of AMP-PNP (Fig 4B) while the nitrogen of methionine is still interacting with the OD1 of Asp258 (2.7 Å) and OE1 of Glu70 (2.8 Å) to aid its stabilization and rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the methionine is oriented in position, its electron-rich sulfur reacts with the positively polarized C5 of AMP-PNP in a nucleophilic substitution to produce adenosine and PPNP (Fig 4C) before the final SAMe and PPNP (Fig 4D) are synthesized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAT2 (PPNP-bound) exhibits a pre-apo state in which, after the product SAMe has been formed, it is able to exit the active site, leaving the triple phosphate moiety within the active site that still possesses Mg2+ and K+ ions (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of one of the magnesium ions causes reorientation of the PPNP moiety, which shifts the O2B atom, leaving it too far away to coordinate with the potassium ion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the active site to cycle and be ready to receive the substrates again, the triple phosphate must be broken down before exiting the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphatase activity of MAT2 causes breakdown of the triple phosphate, resulting in the loss of all ion coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Movement of Glu57, Glu70, Asp258, and Ala259 occurs after all products have exited the active site (Fig 4F) (PDB ID code 4NDN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Incorporation_of_Nonnative_Methionine_Analogs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To our knowledge, the SAE structure is the first nonarchaeal MAT enzyme structure identified to contain a nonnative reaction product, SAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, there is no structural rearrangement in the main chain, and the secondary structure is maintained (rmsd 0.185 Å; Fig 5A) compared with SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAE occupies the active site in a similar way as SAMe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is little movement of the residues involved in the stabilization of both SAMe and SAE, including residues Ser247, Arg249, and Asp258 (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extra CH3 group can be accommodated within the active site without causing clashes with residues near the methyl/ethyl group, specifically Ile117, Ile322, Gly133, and Asp134.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The omit map shows clear positions for all atoms of the SAE molecule (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the plethora of MAT structures that have been published (10, 11, 2123) or deposited in the PDB, to date only one structure of human MAT2 (12) (1.2 Å resolution) and of the MAT(2)4(V2)2 complex (4) (2.353.3 Å resolution) have been published.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism of MAT enzyme function has been described for eMAT (11), and this has become the accepted mechanism for MAT enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present several high-resolution crystallographic structures that support the overall eMAT reaction mechanism but add to it significantly by defining the movements of methionine within the active site during catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see that methionine initially occupies the active site (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1B and 4A) in a different manner from that in eMAT (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A direct attack by the sulfur of methionine on the C5 atom of the ATP molecule was proposed to form SAMe (13), which was confirmed by kinetic isotope studies (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP, the initial position (Fig 1B) of methionine can be seen, which is stabilized through hydrogen bonds between the main chain nitrogen of methionine with Asp258 and Glu70, conserved in mammals and in E. coli (Fig S4), and through the terminal oxygen and Gln113.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of ATP causes the side chain of MET to come too close to PPNP, causing it to rotate into a position to attack the C5 atom of ATP without introducing a steric hindrance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PPNP is a nonhydrolyzable triple phosphate moiety that is particularly useful when studying MAT enzymes, because it cannot be cleaved to pyrophosphate or orthophosphate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-resolution structure SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP shows the position not only of the PPNP, but also of Mg2+ and K+ ions within the active site (Fig 2 and Fig S2), which were previously difficult to model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the positions of the three ions within the active site are highly similar to those in E. coli (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution (1.1 Å) data clearly show that all three active site ions are highly coordinated, either hexacoordinated or pentacoordinated (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orientation of the PPNP is the same as that of the AMP-PNP in the E. coli structure, demonstrating that as the AMP-PNP is cleaved, the newly formed PPNP does not cause any change in orientation or in the residues that were initially anchoring the AMP-PNP in the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refining the MAT(2)4(V2)2 complex (PDB ID code 4NDN) using the position of the PPNP from the high-resolution structure satisfies electron density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PPNP is stabilized through interactions with Mg2+ and K+ ions, as well as with a number of residues (Fig 2A and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions would become destabilized on the cleavage of the triple phosphate to pyrophosphate and orthophosphate, allowing them to exit the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a small structural movement within the region close to the active site is needed to aid the initial anchoring of ATP and stabilization of the cleaved triple phosphate moiety to allow breakdown of the triple phosphate into pyrophosphate and orthophosphate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The observation that the MAT2 active site can be occupied but still have the gating loop disordered is new in human MAT enzymes and provides evidence of the exiting order of products from the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAMe exits the active site on the gating loop, becoming disordered, followed by the cleaved triple phosphate products, causing residues such as Lys61, Glu70, and Lys181 to return to their unbound (apo) positions (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonhydrolyzable PPNP remains in the active site, the position of the highlighted residues remains the same as if the active site were occupied, and the gating loop remains ordered and shut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An interesting observation is that the position of the PPNP differs between the PPNP-bound MAT2 and the SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may represent a pre-apo structure in which the movement of the central phosphate causes a change in ion coordination and allows for the phosphatase activity of MAT2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the position may be due simply to a time-lapse effect of binding a nonhydrolyzable PPNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism for the hydrolysis of the PPPi in MAT is believed to be similar to that for other metal ion-dependent ATPases and other phosphatases (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that ATP (PPNP) binding will change the conformation of Glu70 from open (Fig 3D) to substrate-bound (Fig 3 AC), aiding the stabilization of methionine binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP MAT2 and MAT(2)4(V2)2 complexes clearly shows that the presence of MAT does not directly affect the catalytic site (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it was previously demonstrated that recombinant MAT complexes have greater activity than MAT2 alone (4), how MAT2 activity is regulated by MAT remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the ability of human MAT2 to use ethionine as a substrate (17), and the effect of this within the cell (16), are well known, no human MAT2 structure has been published with this substrate or its product, SAE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Wang et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (15) published the structure of sMAT from Sulfolobus solfataricus containing SAE within the active site, and suggested the occurrence of moderate clashes between the ethyl group and Ile117 and Ile322 of human MAT2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the human MAT2 SAE structure containing SAE, this is not the case, and the ethyl group is 3 Å away from the surrounding residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAE has the same orientation as SAMe (Fig 5B), with very little noticeable movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results show that SAMe can leave the active site without the breakdown of the PPNP, which has been presumed to provide the energy for the opening of the gating loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear that the nature of active site in the catalytic subunit MAT2 is retained in the absence of the regulatory subunit MAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these unexpected findings have wider implications for the formation and release of SAMe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The utilization of the same catalytic site for substrate ethionine for the production of SAE opens up therapeutic possibilities for diseases connected to SAMe and SAE utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mutant_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Purification of MAT2 and MAT variants was done as described previously (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generation of the C-terminal MATV2 mutant, MATV2H323stop, was accomplished through site-directed mutagenesis with a PET28-MATV2 vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene), with the following primers: forward, 5-GGAGACAAACGGTCTTTTAATAGCTCGAGCACCACC-3; reverse, 5-GGTGGTGCTCGAGCTATTAAAAGACCGTTTGTCTCC-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing of plasmids was performed by the external service of the Spanish National Cancer Research Center, Madrid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Complex_Formation__Crystallization__and_Data_Collection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MAT2 and MATV2H323stop were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 100 µM AMP-PNP (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 mM DTT with either 10 mM methionine (Sigma-Aldrich) or 10 mM ethionine (Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these complexes was then loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using 25 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCl, and 1 mM TCEP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before crystallization, MAT(2)4(V2H323stop)2 was incubated before gel filtration with AMP-PNP, and methionine was incubated with extra AMP-PNP (250 µM) or selenium-methionine (250 µM), resulting in SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP and PPNP-bound crystals, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SAE-bound structure was obtained from MAT(2)4(V2H323stop)2 that was incubated before gel filtration with AMP-PNP and extra ethionine (250 µM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For all crystallizations, the protein concentration was 5.8 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP and PPNP-bound crystals appeared at 25 °C within 23 d in drops containing 1 µL of 0.1 M Hepes pH 7.5 and 30% (wt/vol) PEG 600 with 1 µL of MAT2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SAE, crystals appeared at 18 °C within 34 d in drops containing 800 nL of 0.1 M imidazole pH 7.0 and 50% (wt/vol) MPD with 800 nL of MAT2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals were cryoprotected in the reservoir solution and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the SAE-bound crystals, up to 20% (wt/vol) ethylene glycol was added to the reservoir solution for cryoprotection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different datasets were collected at the XALOC beamline at the ALBA synchrotron center (Barcelona) and the I04-1 beamline at the Diamond synchrotron center (Oxford) (0.92 Å wavelength).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data reduction was carried out using HKL-2000 (25) and XDS (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phases were calculated with Phaser (27), using MAT2 (PDB ID code 2P02) (12) as a search model for molecular replacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure solution revealed that all crystals contained only MAT2 protein, irrespective of the starting material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Refinement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model building and refinement were performed using REFMAC (28), COOT (29), and PHENIX (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants at different stages of the enzymatic reaction were modeled in the 1.1-Å resolution SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP structure within the active site, and their occupancies were modified to fit the electron density, taking into account the following observations: the ADO part of the molecule is always in the active site as part of ADO or SAMe; PPNP has an occupancy of 0.7, so it can be present with both SAMe (0.5) and ADO (0.5); PPNP molecules cannot be present together with the conformation observed for MET (0.3) because of steric hindrance; ADO and SAMe occupy the same space in the active site, so they cannot be present together; and SAMe and MET occupy the same space in the active site, so they cannot be present together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural figures were generated using PYMOL (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
