Breakdown of the WiedemannFranz law in a unitary Fermi gas  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Heat and matter currents are required to relax an out-of-equilibrium system with temperature and chemical potential gradients to thermodynamical equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of heat to particle conductance characterizes this response and takes a universal value for typical electronic materials, known as the WiedemannFranz law, originating in the quasi-particle nature of the excitations contributing to transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigating the transport dynamics between two reservoirs of ultracold and strongly interacting Fermi gases, connected by a quantum point contact, we observe a nonequilibrium steady state, strongly violating the WiedemannFranz law.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cold atom version of the fountain effect, previously observed in superfluid helium superleaks, is characterized by a weak coupling between heat and particle currents that results in a nonvanishing Seebeck coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report on coupled heat and particle transport measurements through a quantum point contact (QPC) connecting two reservoirs of resonantly interacting, finite temperature Fermi gases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After heating one of them, we observe a particle current flowing from cold to hot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We monitor the temperature evolution of the reservoirs and find that the system evolves after an initial response into a nonequilibrium steady state with finite temperature and chemical potential differences across the QPC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this state any relaxation in the form of heat and particle currents vanishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our measurements we extract the transport coefficients of the QPC and deduce a Lorenz number violating the WiedemannFranz law by one order of magnitude, a characteristic persisting even for a wide contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Seebeck coefficient takes a value close to that expected for a noninteracting Fermi gas and shows a smooth decrease as the atom density close to the QPC is increased beyond the superfluid transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work represents a fermionic analog of the fountain effect observed with superfluid helium and poses challenges for microscopic modeling of the finite temperature dynamics of the unitary Fermi gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our experiment consists of a QPC imprinted onto a cold, unitary Fermi gas of 6Li atoms, as in our previous work (12, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We form the QPC using two far-detuned repulsive laser beams with a line of zero intensity in the center, resulting in a region of tight harmonic confinement with typical frequencies of x=20.2(6) kHz and z=12.9(5) kHz (Fig 1A) setting an energy spacing between transverse modes of hx(z).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mesoscopic structure connects two initially decoupled reservoirs, labeled as left (L) and right (R), and enables the transport of particles and heat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reservoirs contain a mixture of the lowest and third lowest hyperfine state, with typically N=NL+NR=97(4)103 atoms in each spin state, temperatures of T¯=(TL+TR)/2=184(8) nK, and chemical potentials of ¯=(L+R)/2=272(24)nKkB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here Ni, Ti, and i with i=L,R indicate the atom number, temperature, and chemical potential of the individual reservoirs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We control the density inside and close to the QPC by varying the power of an additional laser beam which creates an attractive gate potential VG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this temperature and chemical potential, up to a few transverse modes in the x and z direction are populated (SI Appendix, Transport Modes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We bring the system out of equilibrium by heating either of the reservoirs using an intensity-modulated laser beam focused on the reservoir, while maintaining the QPC closed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in a temperature difference up to T=TLTR=±83 nK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each of the reservoirs, seen as half-harmonic traps, atom number N and internal energy E are obtained from density profiles (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These quantities can be converted to any other thermodynamic variable such as temperature T or chemical potential , using the unitary equation of state (EoS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the reduced chemical potential q=¯/kBT¯1.5 in the reservoirs is below the superfluid transition point at qc=2.5 (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By tuning the gate potential VG the degeneracy can be increased in the vicinity of the QPC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gate beam thus acts as a local dimple creating superfluid regions close to the QPC (SI Appendix, Density Distribution in the Center).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We perform a transport experiment by opening the QPC for a variable time t between 0 s and 4 s and subsequently measuring N(t) and T(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For convenience, we omit to write explicitly the time dependence of these quantities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particle and heat exchange between the reservoirs is enabled during this time, leading to relaxation dynamics depicted in Fig 1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dynamics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2 presents a typical time evolution of N, TR,L, and  during transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gate potential and transverse frequencies were set to VG=1.00(3) KkB and x=20.2(6) kHz, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-density regions close to the QPC are superfluid in this configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial state was prepared with T0=T(t=0)=49(8) nK and N0=0, with the equilibrium thermodynamics of the reservoirs yielding 0=LR130(31)nKkB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the first 1.5 s, a relative particle imbalance N/N0.16(1) rapidly builds up, leading to a decrease of || while T is constant within experimental resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This evolution is driven by the finite value of , resulting in a large current from the cold to the hot reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It dominates over the much weaker thermoelectric current from the hot to the cold reservoir, originating from the energy dependence of the transmission through the QPC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with previous observations with weakly interacting atoms (26, 28) where the thermoelectric current was the dominating contribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After a typical timescale +, T and N reach a steady state, strongly departing from thermodynamical equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the decline in  stops at a nonzero value s55(8)nKkB, which is estimated by taking the average over the data points for times t1.6 s. To account for the very weak decrease of N in the second half of the observation time, we introduce a much longer timescale  describing the decay of N and T back to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This timescale corresponds to the thermal equilibration process shown in Fig 1C, and our observation shows that +.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To provide a quantitative understanding of the time evolution of the system, we use a phenomenological model based on linear response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While such an approach is known to fail in the lowest temperature regimes, where nonlinear currentbias relations have been observed (12), we find that it describes our observations well (SI Appendix, Linear Model) and allows for comparison between different QPC parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this framework, the particle current IN=1/2dN/dt and entropy current IS=1/2dS/dt are expressed as a function of the differences in chemical potential  and temperature T between the reservoirs (28, 29):INIS=G1ccL+c2T.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]The transport properties of the channel are captured by its particle and thermal conductances G and GT, which can be combined into the Lorenz number L=GT/(T¯G), and its Seebeck coefficient c describing the coupling between particle and entropy currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The absence of the relaxation of temperature and particle imbalance shown in Fig 2 implies a very low heat conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the first law of thermodynamics the energy flow IE can be expressed asIE=T¯IS+¯IN=(¯+cT¯)IN+GTT,[2]where the first term on the right represents work flow and the second term heat flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Work is associated with the reversible transfer of an average energy per particle ¯+cT¯, while irreversible, diffusive heat transfer is proportional to T, obeying Fouriers law.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From Fig 2A, we find IN=0 and T0 for longer times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A direct measurement of IE yields a low value for the heat conductance of GT=0.2GT,NIF, where GT,NIF is the conductance expected for a noninteracting Fermi gas with the same chemical potential, temperature, and gate potential (SI Appendix, Transport Coefficients in a Noninteracting System).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transport_Coefficients  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transport parameters in mesoscopic systems strongly depend on the geometry of the channel (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigate this dependency by measuring the dynamics of atom number difference and temperature difference as the channel confinement is reduced, departing from the single-mode regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A presents the results for four different transverse confinements x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For weaker confinements, N and T equilibrate to zero for long times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is expected as the geometric contact between the two reservoirs increases in size, leading to higher particle and diffusive heat currents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We fitted the time traces with the solutions from the linear response model in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, which are biexponential functions where we fixed N(t=0)=0 and T(t=0)=T0 according to our preparation:N(t)=A[exp(t/+)exp(t/)][3]T(t)=Bexp(t/+)+(T0B)exp(t/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]The fit parameters +, , A, and B are functions of the transport coefficients of the channel c, G, L and the thermodynamics of the reservoirs through their compressibility, heat capacity, and dilatation coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fit is performed simultaneously on both N and T, normalized with the statistical uncertainty of the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find two timescales + and  that differ by one order of magnitude, a feature that remains even for fast equilibration at weak confinement (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, each timescale can be mapped to the relaxation dynamics of heat () and particles (+) (SI Appendix, Linear Model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this linear response solution, the direction and magnitude of the currents result from a competition between the transport properties of the channel and the thermodynamic response of the reservoirs (SI Appendix, Linear Model), a feature that was encountered already for the weakly interacting Fermi gas in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lorenz_Number  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The relative weight of particle and heat conductance is captured by the Lorenz number L. Direct conversion of the fit parameters in Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4 to L is, however, not possible because the biexponential model is ill-conditioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead we express L by estimating G and GT from particle and energy currents IN and IE obtained from the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal conductance and Seebeck coefficient are given by GT=IE/T and c=/T at the point of vanishing particle current (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conductance G is calculated for short transport times where we obtain G=IN/(+cT) (see SI Appendix, Evaluation of Transport Parameters for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The estimates of the Lorenz number are presented in Fig 3C, together with the expected value for a noninteracting QPC obtained through Landauer theory with equivalent chemical potential, temperature, and channel properties (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all values of x, L is much smaller than in the noninteracting case, which approaches the WiedemannFranz law LWF=2/3kB2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations thus violate the WiedemannFranz law by an order of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This law roots in having the same carriers for charge and heat and is robust to moderate interactions, where the system can be described by a Fermi liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deviations from this law may appear when Fermi liquid theory breaks down, as encountered for example in strongly correlated 1D systems, where the Lorenz number can either increase (5) or decrease (3133).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with our previous work, which showed that the conductance of the strongly interacting Fermi gas close to the critical point strongly differs from the predictions of the Landauer formula (12, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Seebeck_Coefficient  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The NESS observed in Fig 2 allows us to relate chemical potential and temperature differences to the Seebeck coefficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we express the vanishing particle current as a competition between a current driven by  and a current driven by T. In the NESS, the two contributions compensate each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the NESS realized in Fig 2, we find c=/T=1.1(2)kB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we rely on a linear relation between the stationary value of T and  (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) at the times where particle current IN=0 vanishes (gray area in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured (N,T) for different values of the heating (see Fig 4A for time traces) and convert them to (,T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the specific case of VG=1.00(3)KkB and x=20.2(6) kHz, we characterize the quasi-steady state for a transport time of t=2 s and find a linear relation between  and T (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirms that the linear model Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 constitutes an adequate description of our system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear relation yields a Seebeck coefficient c=1.2(2)kB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check that the measurement of c does not depend on the precise value of the transport time, we repeat the measurement at t=4 s and find consistent values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is very close to the case of a 1D quantum wire in the noninteracting regime, where one expects NIF=1kB (SI Appendix, Transport Coefficients in a Noninteracting System).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further investigate the Seebeck coefficient by increasing the attractive gate potential VG centered on the QPC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method has two consequences on the two-terminal system: (i) It probes the single-particle energy dependence of the transport parameters by increasing the number of available modes in the QPC and (ii) the density in the vicinity of the QPC is modified by tuning the chemical potential, locally increasing the superfluid gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure  and T for various heating strengths when IN=0 as in Fig 4B and deduce c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 4C shows c as a function of the chemical potential modified by the attractive gate =¯+VG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Seebeck coefficient decreases from a value slightly below 2kB at =0.91(3)KkB to a value close to zero for 2.06(6)KkB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar decrease of c is theoretically expected for a noninteracting QPC (black curve in Fig 4C) and is explained there by an increase of the number of 1D channels available for the transport of single particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This similarity is surprising as transport coefficients in this regime close to the superfluid transition have shown order of magnitude deviations from the Landauer model (12, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual deviation from the noninteracting curvemanifested in the faster decrease with is compatible with the expectations for a BCS superfluid close to the transition point, where a smooth decrease of c from the noninteracting value to zero is expected (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The coexistence of a vanishing Lorenz number and a finite Seebeck coefficient leading to a NESS at finite  distinguishes our observations from the fountain effect seen in superfluid helium II (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There, two vessels are connected by a macroscopic duct, called a superleak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heating one of them induces a current from cold to hot until a steady state with different temperatures and pressures is reached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a two-fluid description of the superleak, viscosity prevents the normal, entropy-carrying fraction of the fluid from crossing while allowing the entropy-less, superfluid fraction to flow and equilibrate the chemical potentials, =0 (15, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, our system is characterized by a nonzero Seebeck coefficient c=IS/IN in the limit L=0, indicating a mean entropy transported by each particle of about 1kB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our QPC is ballistic and not diffusive, and both its high resistance for a normal Fermi gas (27) and its low resistance for a superfluid (12) are predominantly determined by quantum effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydrodynamic models describing the fountain effect are therefore expected to break down.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although thermoelectric transport across a Josephson junction is well understood within BCS theory (35, 38), no model has so far been proposed to describe the unitary Fermi gas at a QPC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nonvanishing c associated with a low Lorenz number suggests that our QPC considered as a thermoelectric device has a high efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this framework, the time evolution of the reservoirs describes an open thermodynamic cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There, the system acts first as a thermoelectric cooler, where a chemical potential difference drives convection heat from the cold to the hot reservoir, followed by a thermoelectric engine part, where the temperature difference drives particles from a lower to a higher chemical potential and hence produces work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the transverse confinement frequency x is increased, both processes slow down and evolution gets closer to reversibility, resulting in a decrease of the output power P=IN and in a better conversion efficiency between work and heat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This efficiency is determined by a dimensionless figure of merit ZT=c2/L (29) which is on the order of 14(8) for the largest confinement x=20.2(6) kHz, where the large errors stem from uncertainty in T and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently the best thermoelectric materials have figures of merit on the order of 35 (4, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further considerations on the efficiency are given by the comparison with the Carnot efficiency (SI Appendix, Efficiency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our fountain effect setting with fermions provides a conceptual link between the thermoelectric transport witnessed in electronic devices and the bosonic fountain effect observed with helium II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its anomalous featuresexceptionally small Lorenz number and finite Seebeck coefficientshed light on the out-of-equilibrium properties of the unitary Fermi gas and portend potential applications to ultracold atoms, such as the realization of novel cooling schemes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also underline the necessity of a better understanding of strongly correlated systems at finite temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, measuring the spin degree of freedom could yield additional information (20, 21), but the inhomogeneous nature of the system makes the interpretation even more challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complementation to our present study would be the probing the full BoseEinstein condensate (BEC)-BCS crossover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, however, requires knowledge of the full finite temperature EoS, which has not been measured yet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preparing_the_Cloud_and_QPC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We prepare an elongated cloud of fermionic 6Li atoms in a balanced mixture of the lowest and third lowest hyperfine state in a hybrid configuration of a far-detuned 1,064-nm dipole trap and a harmonic magnetic trap, confining the atoms along the transverse (x,z) and longitudinal (y) direction, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaporatively cool down the cloud by reducing the trap depth from 6 K to 3 K on a broad Feshbach resonance at 689 G. After a final tilt evaporation step (40) along the z direction, the cloud reaches final temperatures of around 184(8) nK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trap frequencies during transport are rx=318.5Hz, ry=28.4Hz, and rz=255.9Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A repulsive light-sheet beam at 532 nm created by a -phase plate confines the cloud in the center in the z direction with a longitudinal 1/e2 waist of wLS,y= 30(1) m. An orthogonal 532-nm beam of waist wx= 5.49(1) m in a split-gate shape with an intensity node in the center, realized with a transmission mask imaged onto the atom plane, confines the atoms in the x direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two transverse confinements effectively lead to a quasi-1D constriction with trapping frequencies x=20.2(6) kHz and z=12.9(5) kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Transport  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An amplitude-modulated beam at a wavelength of 767 nm is directed on one of the reservoirs, parametrically heating it up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modulation frequency is optimized experimentally to mod=125 Hz, which is on the order of the transverse trapping frequencies rx and rz of the dipole trap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The position of this beam is controlled by a piezo-steered mirror and can be shifted to either reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same beam is centered on the QPC during transport and acts there as an attractive gate potential VG, locally tuning the density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When preparing the reservoirs, transport between the reservoirs is blocked by a repulsive wall beam focused onto the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam is removed for a variable transport time t during which exchange between the reservoirs through the channel is enabled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After time t we separate the reservoirs with the wall beam and take absorption images after a short time of flight of 1 ms in the transverse directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduces the densities and allows us to image in the low saturation regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thermodynamic_Properties_of_the_Reservoirs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the density profiles we deduce the atom number in each reservoir as well as their internal energy E=3m(2ry)2y2 via the virial theorem for a harmonic trap at unitarity (41) and the second momenty2=dyn1D(y)y2dyn1D(y)[5]of the fitted density distribution n1D along the longitudinal direction (42) shown in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Along with the known equation of state of the unitary Fermi gas, these two quantities define all of the thermodynamic parameters of the individual reservoirs, including their temperatures TL,R used in Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equation of state is based on measurements in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8 and continued toward the normal and degenerate regimes in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14 for a homogeneous gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply local density approximation to obtain the trap-averaged quantities assuming a harmonic potential (SI Appendix, Thermodynamic Properties of the Reservoirs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
