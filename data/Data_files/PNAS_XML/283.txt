Saharan dust nutrients promote Vibrio bloom formation in marine surface waters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atmospherically transported dust from the Saharan desert provides pulses of biologically important nutrients, including iron, to ocean surface waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological response to these ephemeral events is not fully known, especially among the heterotrophic microbial community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use the well-characterized Vibrio genus as a model for heterotrophic bacterial response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that Saharan dust nutrients, deposited in tropical marine waters, can promote Vibrio bloom formation and suggest that dust-associated iron is an important driver of Vibrio population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work shows not only the role of fast-acting heterotrophs in the biogeochemical cycles of environmental pulses of iron, but it also highlights an important factor in the growth of bacteria that can cause disease in humans and marine organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vibrio is a ubiquitous genus of marine bacteria, typically comprising a small fraction of the total microbial community in surface waters, but capable of becoming a dominant taxon in response to poorly characterized factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iron (Fe), often restricted by limited bioavailability and low external supply, is an essential micronutrient that can limit Vibrio growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrio species have robust metabolic capabilities and an array of Fe-acquisition mechanisms, and are able to respond rapidly to nutrient influx, yet Vibrio response to environmental pulses of Fe remains uncharacterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we examined the population growth of Vibrio after natural and simulated pulses of atmospherically transported Saharan dust, an important and episodic source of Fe to tropical marine waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a model for opportunistic bacterial heterotrophs, we demonstrated that Vibrio proliferate in response to a broad range of dust-Fe additions at rapid timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within 24 h of exposure, strains of Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio alginolyticus were able to directly use Saharan dustFe to support rapid growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings were also confirmed with in situ field studies; arrival of Saharan dust in the Caribbean and subtropical Atlantic coincided with high levels of dissolved Fe, followed by up to a 30-fold increase of culturable Vibrio over background levels within 24 h. The relative abundance of Vibrio increased from 1 to 20% of the total microbial community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study, to our knowledge, is the first to describe Vibrio response to Saharan dust nutrients, having implications at the intersection of marine ecology, Fe biogeochemistry, and both human and environmental health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Vibrio_Response_to_Simulated_Saharan_Dust_Deposition_in_Marine_Surface_Water  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the effect of Saharan dust nutrients on Vibrio growth, source material from the Saharan desert (Morocco) was added to microcosms containing natural unfiltered seawater collected in the Florida Keys (US).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Source material (characterization shown in Tables S1 and S2) was manipulated to simulate effects from long-range atmospheric transport and wet deposition and is referred to as DustSIM (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microcosms included surface water collected over multiple dates from three sites for each experiment, representing a cross-shelf gradient (onshore, near shore, and offshore (at Looe Key Reef in the lower Florida Keys)] (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A broad range of dust deposition scenarios (20 gL1 to 30 mgL1) were simulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lowest DustSIM addition (20 gL1) increased dFe in seawater to 1.19 nM (±0.08 SEM) above the background levels of 0.90 nM (±0.04 SEM) found in nonamended surface water (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This addition provided a small but significant increase (P less_than 0.05), consistent with in situ observations of dFe during dust events (Table S3; also see Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
After the DustSIM amendments to seawater, the growth of total culturable Vibrio on a selective medium was normalized across experiments by calculating the ratio of colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter at 24 h to those at 0 h. All DustSIM additions, except the 40 gL1 addition (due to high variability among replicates), had significantly higher growth compared with nondust controls, and the response was largely dose-dependent (Fig 1; Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the lowest DustSIM addition (20 gL1), mean growth was six times as great as that for nondust controls (49.0 ± 19.6 SEM and 8.5 ± 3.6 SEM, respectively, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither the location (inshore, near shore, or offshore) nor the date of sampling had a statistically significant effect (P  greater than  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Vibrio_Utilization_of_Dust-Associated_Fe  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the specific effects of Fe in Saharan dust on Vibrio growth, cultures of individual strains were grown in a novel, Fe-limited seawater (Vib-FeL), which was replete in key macronutrients (N and P) and carbon substrate and supplemented with all essential trace elements needed for growth, except for Fe (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative growth of individual strains of V. alginolyticus and V. cholerae (identified as dust-responsive in initial experiments) were tested in three separate culture conditions: (i) Vib-FeL alone, (ii) Vib-FeL with DustSIM (providing 0.89 M Fe), and (iii) Vib-FeL with FeCl3 (providing 4.37 M Fe), as a positive control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After overnight incubation (1824 h), the proportional growth was compared for all treatments (Fig 2; Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vib-FeL alone restricted growth of both test strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of DustSIM led to significant growth of both V. cholerae and V. alginolyticus compared with nondust controls (13 and 18 times as great, respectively; P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportional growth for the DustSIM amendments was not significantly different from that noted for the FeCl3 controls, which had 20 and 23 times as much growth for V. cholerae and V. alginolyticus, respectively, as did nondust controls (Fig 2; Table S5) and confirmed that DustSIM could alleviate Fe limitation in this medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fe concentrations across dust deposition events are highly variable (27, 35); therefore, we evaluated growth of V. alginolyticus in Vib-FeL across a range of scenarios, providing additional dFe at concentrations from 5 to 836 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All DustSIM additions increased the proportional growth of V. alginolyticus (Fig 3; Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower additions of 5, 10, and 21 nM dFe resulted in approximately four times the growth of no-addition controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher dFe amendments, 201 and 836 nM, resulted in growth that was 8 to 11 times that of controls (P less_than 0.001), respectively (Fig 3; Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Vibrio_Growth_in_Response_to_Natural_Saharan_Dust_Events  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Offshore sampling sites at Looe Key Reef, in the lower Florida Keys (US), and Ragged Point, Barbados, were chosen based on a 30-y dataset of atmospheric dust sampling, demonstrating strong seasonal pulses of African dust arriving at these locations almost entirely in the summer months (June through September) (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite and aerosol-modeling products were used to monitor evolution of individual dust events from the coast of Africa (typically every 510 d, July through August) and their transit across the Atlantic (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Field collections were conducted in the Florida Keys (summer 2013 and 2014) and Barbados (summer 2014) during three separate Saharan dust events (SDEs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In July 2014, 1 wk before the arrival of dust, dFe in surface waters in the lower Florida Keys was 0.90 nM (±0.08 SEM), increasing to 3.24 nM (±0.04 SEM) with the arrival of a SDE (P less_than 0.001) (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the highest dFe during the August 2014 study period in Barbados (2.22 nM ± 0.20 SEM) was measured during the arrival of a SDE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dFe levels were not measured in 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within 1424 h of the arrival of SDE (and concomitant dFe increase), surface water concentrations of culturable Vibrio increased significantly over background levels in all three sampling campaigns at levels ranging from 5 to 30 times the nondust levels (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the peak of the Vibrio blooms in 2014, a 1.6- and 3.6-fold decrease of dFe was measured in Barbados and Florida, respectively (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrio bloom conditions were transient, and levels returned to baseline within 2448 h of the measured peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the Vibrio bloom expired, an increase of dFe was measured, followed by a tapering decline in dFe over the following 14 d to 1.6-fold decline in dFe compared to dust arrival values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Bacterial_Community_Composition_Changes_in_Response_to_SDE  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As part of a co-occurring study at Looe Key Reef, microbial community data were obtained for an additional four surface water samples between August 2011 and July 2013 using Illumina-based sequencing of the community 16S rDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of the samples were collected outside of a dust event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final sample coincided with the dust event captured in July 2013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of operational taxonomic units in the Vibrio genus was significantly greater during this event than during all other sampling dates (P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative abundance of Vibrio increased from less_than1.4% during nondust conditions to 19.8% of the total bacterial community during the 2013 SDE (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase was also confirmed by Vibrio culture counts and cell equivalent counts [quantitative PCR (qPCR)] (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative abundance of other genera including Pseudoalteromonas and Acinetobacter, belonging to the same class of bacteria as Vibrio (-proteobacteria), also increased significantly, whereas Pelagibacter declined (P less_than 0.05) (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There has been considerable interest in the biological response of marine surface water communities to dust deposition, but results to date on the role of heterotrophic microorganisms have been equivocal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These recent investigations of heterotrophic response to dust-associated nutrients as well as the direct effect of Fe addition to marine waters generally measured bulk parameters (such as total bacterial abundance, bacterial respiration, or bacterial production), which could potentially fail to recognize community shifts and mask the emergence of functionally important taxa that can rapidly respond to nutrients (19, 31, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, studies that did assess community structure in response to dust typically focused on 48 h after dust addition, which could miss taxa that mount a more rapid response (31, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, much of the recent work in this area has examined response in experimental microcosms and mesocosms (15, 31, 36), with few studies able to capture in situ response to natural dust events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, evidence from both experimental manipulations and in situ time course observations demonstrated that opportunistic heterotrophic genera like Vibrio mount a robust and rapid growth response to dust addition and potentially play an important, but currently largely unexplored, role in the cycling of Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fe acquisition is essential for Vibrio fitness and survival, both in the environment and in a host during infection (9, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V. cholerae, which is arguably the most studied of the Vibrio species and has a very well characterized genome, has  greater than 50 Fe acquisition genes spread across its two chromosomes for ferrous, ferric, and biologically complexed Fe uptake (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This genetic repertoire suggests that Vibrio are effective competitors for Fe in many different environmental niches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The availability of Fe can also control the metabolism of other nutrients such as N and P, and can limit C utilization, effectively setting limits on growth for both open ocean and coastal heterotrophic bacteria (16, 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potential colimitation is especially important in light of the fundamental contribution of heterotrophic bacteria to the cycling of C in marine ecosystems (33, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrio and other rapidly responding heterotrophs likely play a pivotal, but as yet largely unexplored, role, in coupling Fe flux with C cycling in marine food webs, ultimately influencing global climate processes (18, 19, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we demonstrated that Vibrio rapidly exploit Fe and potentially other nutrients provided by Saharan dust, driving a significant, but temporary, population bloom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These blooms, which were observed within 24 h of dust arrival, also likely preceded stimulation of autotrophic picoplankton and other phytoplankton, which have previously been shown to take 48 h to respond to dust or Fe inputs (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that Vibrio blooms were not due to increased organic matter production from autotrophs, but were responding directly to the dust inputs, which is also supported by the microcosm studies using monocultures of Vibrio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the data suggest that dustFe can support blooms across a wide range of dust and Fe deposition scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrio growth in natural seawater continued even at the highest DustSIMFe additions (836 nM), suggesting increasing Fe limitation, which was unexpected (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the bioavailable fraction of Fe added to the microcosms was likely reduced because of rapid oxidation and precipitation due physiochemical factors in natural seawater (17), Vibrio physiology suggests a high Fe demand with up to 5 M needed for replete growth (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growth rates in Vibrio are among the fastest known of any bacteria, with doublings every 89 min recorded in some species (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, several Vibrio species are able to fix N, a process that has a very high Fe demand (38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dust additions also likely added other limiting nutrients in addition to Fe, especially phosphate, which may help to explain the continued response even at very high levels (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, although the focus of this work was on Vibrio as a model for dust response, the relative abundance of other taxa (e.g., Pseudoalteromonas and Acinetobacter) also increased significantly with dust events and likely competed with Vibrio for uptake of additional Fe and nutrients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During in situ time course observations, Vibrio showed a robust bloom within 24 h of the arrival of SDE and concomitant high dFe concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the peak of the bloom, Vibrio species increased their proportion in the community by more than an order of magnitude, relative to nondust conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that this is not an exogenous import of bacteria, but rather an autochthonous response to the addition of biologically necessary nutrients like dFe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it has been reported that some bacteria can travel associated with dust aerosols, genus-level profiling of Saharan dust has not revealed the presence of Vibrio (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the 2014 field studies, the drawdown of dFe to the predust level of 0.9 nM (Fig 4 and Table S3) at the peak of the bloom also indicated utilization of the majority of introduced dFe by blooming Vibrio and other responsive -proteobacteria (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a genus, Vibrio is one of the most highly investigated groups of environmental microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aided in part by its ease of culturability (3), Vibrio is an excellent candidate model to examine opportunistic responses and roles in larger ecosystem functioning (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrio, which typically comprise less_than1% of the ocean surface bacterioplankton community (2), could be considered conditionally rare taxa (CRT) (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRT are subject to dramatic blooms, potentially playing an outsized role in the ecology of a system (1, 41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrio have shown explosive growth in response to nutrient enrichment (6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This adaptive feast-or-famine life strategy allows exploitation of spatially and temporally variable resources, leading to bloom conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy also subjects Vibrio to kill-the-winner top-down controls, such as grazing and viral lysis, both of which tightly control -proteobacteria and Vibrio populations (7, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The population declines observed in the field 2448 h after SDE-induced Vibrio blooms could be attributed to these top-down control pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bloom decline corresponded with a spike in dFe concentrations, supporting the notion of lysis and bacterivory in the release of dFe, warranting further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ecosystem consequences of such a large turnover of dFe on biogeochemical cycles also remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial grazing experiments have demonstrated that 90% of Fe remains in the dissolved fraction after 24 h (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, Fe released by viral lysis of heterotrophic bacteria (as demonstrated in V. alginolyticus) is highly bioavailable to the plankton community, including autotrophic diatoms, with the bioavailability of this released Fe exceeding that of siderophore-bound Fe (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dFe is capable of supporting up to 90% of primary production in some systems (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the bloom-bust cycle of Vibrio population growth in response to Saharan dust could have an important role in trophic transfer of labile Fe to primary producers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Vibrio can overcome predation pressure by forming close associations with marine organisms and plankton (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, the population bloom of Vibrio appeared transient, but further investigation is needed to determine whether planktonic-associated hot spots exist after bloom termination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential for particle attachment is particularly salient in the case of disease-causing species like V. cholerae or V. alginolyticus, which have both been shown to be highly responsive to dustFe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These species are known to associate with zooplankton and marine organisms, directly influencing their survival in the environment and routes of transmission to potential hosts (3, 9, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study, to our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate that Vibrio species, as a model of a rapidly responding opportunistic heterotroph, are highly responsive to Saharan dustFe and associated nutrients and indicate a role for these bacteria in processing dustFe in marine ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, these results suggest that otherwise rare heterotrophic bacterial taxa are among the first responders to introduced Fe and other nutrients from dust and likely precede responses by autotrophs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Sahara and Sahel are particularly vulnerable to further drying due to changes in climate and land-use patterns (47), potentially increasing dust export from this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coupled with the fact that dustFe fertilization of marine systems has been suggested as a driver of past paleoclimatic change (48), a mechanistic understanding in the modern ocean is critical to making predictions about future oceanic production and climate scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery of dustFe as a factor in Vibrio population dynamics is an important first step that warrants further investigation to inform future predictions about Vibrio-related disease and Vibrio impacts on global biogeochemical cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DustSIM_Experimental_Additions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The US Geological Survey (USGS) provided mineralogical and elementally characterized Saharan source material (SI Methods) collected from a highly weathered dune in Morocco (exact location was not specified).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saharan source material was manipulated in the laboratory to simulate atmospheric processing and wet deposition and is referred to as DustSIM (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural surface water from the Florida Keys and artificial Vib-FeL microcosm experiments were seeded with a broad range of DustSIM additions because of the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of dust deposition in any single event, as well as the high variability in dust concentrations resulting from rain washout, which is the dominant mode of deposition in Florida (80%) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify DustSIM loadings for experimental additions, DustSIM was added [1:150 (vol/vol)] to 5 mL of ultrapure Milli-Q water by using trace metal clean chemistry techniques (49), followed by further 1:2 serial dilutions in Milli-Q water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dFE (less_than0.2 m) was measured by using inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS) elemental analysis (SI Methods) for triplicate samples of each dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fe content of trans-Atlantic transported dust has been measured to be close to the upper crustal value of 3.5% (29, 30); we therefore quantified DustSIM amendments by Fe content to allow for an approximate calculation of dust loading (mgL1) for each addition, considering a fractional solubility of the Moroccan source material to be 4.39% (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DustSIM additions for seeding experiments were calculated to be: 0.02, 0.04, 0.18, 0.37, 0.78, 7.3, and 30 mgL1 of dust (Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher values include representative amounts of deposition in regions closer to African source areas (e.g., Mediterranean), and the lowest values were environmentally relevant for the Caribbean and Florida Keys (e.g., during a wet deposition event) (29, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In microcosm experiments using natural seawater communities, surface water from the upper 1 m of the water column was collected in sterile trace-metal clean polypropylene bottles at sites in the lower Florida Keys (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DustSIM solutions for seeding experiments were prepared as described above and added to replicate natural seawater microcosms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microcosms were mixed and held at 30 °C for 24 h. Vibrio counts at the time of seeding (0 h) and after 24 h were determined by culture (cfu) on selective thiosulfate-citrate-bile salt-sucrose agar (TCBS; Oxoid), in triplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details are provided in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fe-Limited_Seawater_(Vib-FeL)_Experiments  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the specific effect of Fe from Saharan dust on Vibrio growth dynamics, experimentation was done in a Fe-limited medium, referred to as Vib-FeL (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frozen cell stocks of V. alginolyticus [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strain 33839] and V. cholerae (ATCC 39315) were recovered in sterilized artificial seawater amended with 1% peptone and 0.5% yeast extract (ASW+PYE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recovered cells, incubated for 12 h at 30 °C, were subcultured in 5 mL of fresh ASW+PYE (1:100 dilution) and allowed to grow to log phase as monitored by optical density at 600 nm (OD600) on a spectrophotometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed twice and resuspended in Vib-FeL to eliminate Fe carryover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment was initiated at time 0 by inoculating washed cells (1:100) into 5 mL of the appropriate culture conditions: Vib-FeL alone; Vib-FeL with FeCl3; DustSIM added to Vib-FeL (1:150 vol/vol); and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C on a shaking platform to maintain aeration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrio abundance was determined by spread plating aliquots from each culture onto ASW+PYE agar plates at times 0, 18, and 24 h. Spread plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h, and cfu were enumerated and compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because dust deposition is highly variable (35), we also evaluated growth of V. alginolyticus (following the same cell preparation methodology) across a broad range of Fe-deposition scenarios by diluting DustSIM as described above into Vib-FeL, providing dFe at concentrations from 5 to 836 nM dFe (Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_Response_to_Natural_SDEs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SDEs were monitored by using satellite and modeling products from NASA (https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/) and the Naval Research Laboratory (www.nrlmry.navy.mil/aerosol/), allowing for virtual real-time monitoring of SDE arrival and passage at two study sites: Ragged Point, Barbados (easternmost point of the island) (13.1667° N, 59.4333° W) and Looe Key Reef, FL (24.5475° N, 81.4067° W).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were collected within 24 h of the arrival of dust (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All surface water samples were collected in triplicate and kept at ambient temperature until processing (within 1 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sampling collection continued at 24-h intervals for 35 d after the modeled arrival of dust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrio abundance was determined by spread plating each replicate surface water sample on Vibrio-selective TCBS medium, in triplicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spread plates were incubated at ambient temperature (30 °C) for 24 h, and cfu were enumerated and compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Background nondust associated summer (May-August) Vibrio levels at Looe Key were determined by routine sampling between 2012 and 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Background levels at Barbados were determined in April 2013 (predust season).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was extracted from surface water samples collected from Looe Key Reef during nondust conditions and during the July 2013 SDE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Community DNA was sequenced by using Illumina MiSeq PE 250 sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene (Tables S9S11) (50) (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, qPCR was conducted for total Vibrio counts from the extracted DNA (SI Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Field collections for SDE occurred in the summer rainy season, and isolated local showers were common; however, no precipitation data were available for the specific collection sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rain (very light) was only noted during or immediately before sampling at Barbados (11 and 12 August 2014).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No rain was observed during sampling at Looe Key Reef.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All statistical analyses are described in SI Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As part of a small subset of samples for in situ dust events and nondust events in the Florida Keys, Vibrio quantification methods (cfu vs. qPCR) were compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Culture counts were primarily used in this study because of the specificity of TCBS medium, the ability to document changes in the community within 24 h in the field laboratory, and to allow isolates to be saved for additional work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given limitations in culture-based counts, a small experiment was conducted to compare results with cell equivalents as determined by Vibrio-specific qPCR (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contemporaneously collected samples from 6 separate days were analyzed (n = 46 per date); 2 d coincided with the 16S rDNA-based community analysis [Feb 2013 (nondust) and July 2013 (dust)], and the remaining 4 were collected during nondust periods (20132014).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were all collected at 2-m depth (midwater column) and were concentrated and extracted as described in Methods (for in situ community analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no significant differences between the Vibrio abundance estimated by culturing on selective TCBS agar and Vibrio-specific qPCR (Table S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, there was no interaction between the fixed factors quantification method and sampling date (two-way ANOVA, P = 0.84), and differences between quantification method were not significant (P = 0.52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrio abundance was significantly greater during the dust event (July 2013) compared with all other sampling dates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Saharan_Source_Material_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The USGS provided Saharan source material collected from a highly weathered dune in Morocco (exact location was not specified).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elemental composition analysis was coordinated by the USGS and followed USGS Geochemical Landscape Project protocols (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compositional analysis of 37 elements was determined by ICP-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using USGS methodology (53) (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Perkin-Elmer 2400 Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen Analyzer (CHN) was used to determine the total carbon and N content in 91.21 mg of Moroccan source material (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particle size was determined by using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laser analyzer, followed by textual classification according to USGS protocols (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Atmospheric processing and wet deposition of Saharan dust were simulated in the laboratory by using Saharan source material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The material was manually dry-sieved through trace metal clean 335-µm mesh nylon followed by 150-µm mesh (Aquatic Eco-Systems Inc.) to remove coarse sand grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To simulate high-altitude UV exposure and oxidize organic contaminants (including microbial contaminants), sieved material was exposed to UV irradiation (300 W Hg-lamp 254 nm) in a class 100 laminar flow hood in six 1-h increments with hand mixing of the material between exposures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atmospheric acidification processes from anthropogenic aerosols (containing organic, nitric, and sulfuric acid species) are reported to render dustFe more soluble during atmospheric transport (17, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dust passage and entrainment in the low pH environments of clouds and rain, as well as deposition by precipitation washout, were simulated by mixing 1 g of sieved UV-irradiated dust into 100 mL of 0.025 M HCl Optima (Fisher).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HCl was used because seawater is already high in chloride, and results in minimal elemental alteration of the sample matrix during experimentation as well as provides maximal Fe dissolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate large particulates that might promote adhesion and particle-supported bacterial growth, coarse material was allowed to settle out of the suspension, and the top 90 mL of the mixture was removed and filtered through an acid-washed, Milli-Q-rinsed, 0.2-µm pore-sized polycarbonate membrane (Whatman).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting stock material used in experimental manipulations was termed DustSIM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dFe fraction of DustSIM that passed through the 0.2-µm membrane, considered the most bioavailable fraction (19), was 7.42 ppm (±0.12 SEM) as determined by ICP-MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fractional solubility of Moroccan source material Fe (16,900 ppm; Table S1) was calculated to be 4.39%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DustSIM stock was confirmed to be free of culturable bacteria by direct spread plating of 0.1 mL of DustSIM stock on experimental culture medium: ASW+PYE and the Vibrio selective media, TCBS (Oxoid).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No growth was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASW+PYE was prepared by dissolving Instant Ocean (Spectrum Brands) in Milli-Q water to a specific gravity of 1.023 and adding 1% Peptone (Fluka Analytical), 0.5% Yeast Extract (Oxoid), and 1.5% Bacto agar (Difco).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ICP-MS_Fe_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All sample collection and trace-metal analyses were performed by using trace metal clean chemistry techniques (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were filtered through 0.2-m track-etched polycarbonate filters and acidified to pH 1.8 (0.024 M HCl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentrations of dFe were determined by isotope dilution ICP-MS described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Natural SDE surface water samples were collected in acid-washed, 125-mL collection bottles just below the surface over Looe Key Reef, FL, and at Ragged Point, Barbados.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were frozen (within 30 min) for 1.5 mo before filtration to prevent Fe sorption to the bottle walls until sample analysis could be completed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DustSIM_Seeding_Experiments_in_Surface_Water_Microcosms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Surface water, without filtration, was collected at sites in the lower Florida Keys (Fig S1) and was used in seeded microcosm experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The offshore site was 10 km from shore, over the spur and groove reef at Looe Key Reef Sanctuary Preservation Area in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The near shore (1 km from shore) and inshore (500 m from shore) sites were located near the Mote Tropical Research Laboratory on Summerland Key and were sampled by kayak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grab samples of surface water were collected in the first meter at each sampling site in replicate experiments (March 2011, May 2012, and May 2013).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were collected in the late spring to avoid the influence of naturally occurring Saharan dust deposition, which is typically heaviest in the summer months (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were collected in sterile 1-L polyethylene bottles prepared by using trace-metal clean protocols (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each bottle was further rinsed three times with surface water at the collection site immediately before collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were transported to the laboratory in an ambient temperature cooler with a min-max thermometer, and experimental testing was initiated within 3 h of collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant deviation from ambient temperature was observed in any experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DustSIM dilutions were created in the same manner as described above in 5 mL of sample seawater from each site, followed by further 1:2 serial dilutions, providing calculated dust additions between 0.02 and 30 mgL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A natural seawater (nondust) control was included for each site and experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures were incubated for 24 h at 30 °C (a typical temperature for these sites during dust season) on a nutating mixer at 24 rpm (Fisher Scientific) to maintain aeration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Culturable Vibrio species were detected after spread-plating aliquots from each microcosm onto a Vibrio-selective medium, TCBS (Oxoid), in triplicate, at experimental times 0 and 24 h. Spread plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h, and cfu were enumerated per milliliter and compared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fe_Limited_Seawater_(Vib-FeL)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the specific effect of Fe from Saharan dust on Vibrio growth dynamics, experimentation was performed in an Fe-limited medium, referred to as Vib-FeL, which was a modified version of the artificial saltwater medium, Aquil (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Components of Vib-FeL were chosen with the lowest Fe content available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A solution of salts and nutrients was dissolved in Milli-Q water (18.2 M × cm) containing NaCl (420 mM), MgSO4 (2.5 mM), K2HPO4 (0.1 mM), CaCl2 (0.1 mM), NH4Cl (18 mM), and Na2PO4 (42 mM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To remove potential contaminating Fe and other trace metals, the medium was passed through a column of Chelex 100 (Sigma) ion-exchange resin, according to the procedure of Price et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (55), followed by microwave sterilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After cooling (24 h), trace metals (50 µM EDTA-buffered solution of 2.5 × 108 M Co, 9.8 × 109 M Cu, 2.3 × 107 M Mn, 1.1 × 107 M Mo, and 3.9 × 108 M Zn) and a carbon source of sucrose (Sigma) [0.4% (wt/vol)] were added from 0.2-µm sterile-filtered stocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All manipulations were performed in a laminar flow hood to minimize contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_Community_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples were obtained for community sequence analysis during three nondust periods [August 2011 (n = 7); February 2012 (n = 2); February 2013 (n = 3)] and during the 2013 SDE event at Looe Key Reef in the Florida Keys [July 2013 (n = 5)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water samples were collected with a sterile syringe (up to 60 mL) 1 m above the reef (2 m below the surface) and held on ice (less_than3 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aliquots (2 mL) were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The supernatant fluid was discarded, and the bacteria-containing pellet was stored at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protocol of Boström et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (56) was used to extract environmental DNA from frozen pellets, with slight modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysis buffer [175 L of 400 mM NaCl, 750mM sucrose, 20 mM EDTA, 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 9.0)] and lysozyme (1 L of 10 mgmL1) were added to the pelleted sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, proteinase K (100 gmL1 final concentration) and SDS [1% (wt/vol) final concentration] were added, and tubes were incubated at 55 °C for 1618 h. To aid in the precipitation of DNA, tRNA (50 g) was used as a carrier molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precipitation of DNA was initiated by adding 20 L of 3 M NaAc and 120 L of isopropyl alcohol and incubating for an hour at 20 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were centrifuged (13,000 × g for 20 min), and the supernatant fluid was decanted, retaining the pelleted DNA in the original tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were then washed with 500 L of EtOH (70%) and centrifuged (13,000 × g for 20 min), and supernatant fluid was discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A SpeedVac (Eppendorf Concentrator 5301) was used to dry the DNA pellet, which was then resuspended in 50 L of TE (10 mM TrisHCl and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Estimates of growth were normalized among experiments by comparing the ratio of cfumL1 at Tn to that at T0, where T0 represents time 0 and Tn represents time n (e.g., 24 h) for individual microcosms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were presented as mean ± SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proportional growth (T24/T0) measurements from Florida Keys surface water amended with DustSIM were first log transformed to meet normality assumptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical comparisons were performed with PROC MIXED by using a split-plot design with the factors of dust amendment, date, and location (SAS Version 9.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type III tests of fixed effects determined that neither location nor date, nor the interactions among effects were significant (P  greater than  0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dust amendments were compared by using post hoc pairwise comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TukeyKramer adjustment for multiple comparisons was used to control experiment-wise error rates, with P less_than 0.05 chosen to denote significant differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All other statistical comparisons were made by using ANOVA and Tukeys multiple comparison post hoc test (GraphPad Version 5.0.F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all tests, significance was declared when P less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
