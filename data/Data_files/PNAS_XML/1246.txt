Empirical evidence for stability of the 405-kiloyear JupiterVenus eccentricity cycle over hundreds of millions of years  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rhythmic climate cycles of various assumed frequencies recorded in sedimentary archives are increasingly used to construct a continuous geologic timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the age range of valid theoretical orbital solutions is limited to only the past 50 million years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New UPb zircon dates from the Chinle Formation tied using magnetostratigraphy to the NewarkHartford astrochronostratigraphic polarity timescale provide empirical confirmation that the unimodal 405-kiloyear orbital eccentricity cycle reliably paces Earths climate back to at least 215 million years ago, well back in the Late Triassic Period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The NewarkHartford astrochronostratigraphic polarity timescale (APTS) was developed using a theoretically constant 405-kiloyear eccentricity cycle linked to gravitational interactions with JupiterVenus as a tuning target and provides a major timing calibration for about 30 million years of Late Triassic and earliest Jurassic time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the 405-ky cycle is both unimodal and the most metronomic of the major orbital cycles thought to pace Earths climate in numerical solutions, there has been little empirical confirmation of that behavior, especially back before the limits of orbital solutions at about 50 million years before present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the APTS is anchored only at its younger end by UPb zircon dates at 201.6 million years before present and could even be missing a number of 405-ky cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the validity of the dangling APTS and orbital periodicities, we recovered a diagnostic magnetic polarity sequence in the volcaniclastic-bearing Chinle Formation in a scientific drill core from Petrified Forest National Park (Arizona) that provides an unambiguous correlation to the APTS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New high precision UPb detrital zircon dates from the core are indistinguishable from ages predicted by the APTS back to 215 million years before present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement shows that the APTS is continuous and supports a stable 405-kiloyear cycle well beyond theoretical solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The validated NewarkHartford APTS can be used as a robust framework to help differentiate provinciality from global temporal patterns in the ecological rise of early dinosaurs in the Late Triassic, amongst other problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following the procedures described in Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) directions were successfully isolated in 132 of the 174 oriented subsamples extracted from 24278 meters core depth (mcd) [21248 meters stratigraphic depth (msd)] encompassing the lower Owl Rock Mb., the entire Petrified Forest Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  including the BFB, and down into the middle part of the Sonsela Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ChRM direction for each sample was converted to a virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) whose latitude with respect to the 210-Ma reference (north) paleopole (17), referred to as rVGP latitude, is used to designate polarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A plot of rVGP latitudes with depth in core PFNP-1A shows a series of magnetic polarity zones that are designated from the top down as PF1r (partim), PF2n, PF2r, PF3n, PF3r (with a thin normal polarity interval, PF3r.1n), PF4n, PF4r, and PF5n (partim) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paleomagnetic signature of sediments of the Owl Rock Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from immediately below the erosional unconformity with the late Cenozoic Bidahochi Fm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (not sampled) at 20.6 msd to around 35 msd is erratic, which we attribute to complications during coring and recovery of this shallow and poorly indurated material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coherence of the polarity data improves sufficiently down core to establish that the lowermost Owl Rock Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is in a reverse polarity magnetozone (PF1r) that extends down to a normal magnetozone PF2n (41.148.0 msd) straddling the contact with the Petrified Forest Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at 41.7 msd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying reverse polarity magnetozone PF2r (48.064.5 msd) is sparsely documented because the pale-colored cross-bedded sands and silts of the BFB (55.566.9 msd) that dominate this interval are poor paleomagnetic recorders, with only 3 out of 17 samples providing acceptable results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finer-grained red lithologies are more common in the underlying part of the Petrified Forest Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and record substantial evidence of a thick (64.5125.4 msd) normal polarity magnetozone (PF3n), a modestly thick (125.4153.9 msd) reverse magnetozone (PF3r) that includes a thin (144.5149.5 msd) normal polarity interval in its lower part, and a normal magnetozone (PF4n; 153.9187.3 msd) that extends below the contact with the Sonsela Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (160.3 msd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generally coarser and less red lithologies of the Sonsela Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  proved more difficult for obtaining a coherent paleomagnetic signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The available data delineate reverse polarity magnetozone PF4r from 187.3 to 215.7 msd and normal polarity magnetozone PF5n from 215.7 msd to the lowest sample with acceptable data in this suite at 240.8 msd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also three putative (one-sample) polarity magnetozones of uncertain origin (e.g., inverted samples?)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  that are not interpreted further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the overall lithostratigraphic, biostratigraphic, and geochronologic framework of the upper Chinle Fm (12, 18), the most plausible correlation of the local magnetozones (PF1r to PF5n, youngest to oldest) equates them to chrons E17r to E14n (younger to older) of the APTS, spanning 209.5215.5 Ma (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The BFB is a distinctive white tuffaceous crevasse-splay sandstone (13, 19) that can be more than 10 m thick.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It occurs within the upper part of the mostly red Petrified Forest Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and can be readily traced in outcrops throughout the northern part of the PFNP, including Chinde Point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 50-m-thick normal polarity interval equivalent to magnetozone PF3n was also found just below the BFB in outcrop (14) but was miscorrelated to Chron E15n, although the thin normal within the underlying reverse polarity interval (PF3r) that secures its correlation to Chron E15r is well represented in the outcrop section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paleomagnetic results were not obtained higher in the outcrop section that might have allowed identification of the critical PF2r magnetozone that straddles the BFB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detrital zircons in an early study yielded UPb dates that indicated a likely, yet poorly defined, depositional age of 209 ± 5 Ma for the BFB (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a subsequent study, 16 prismatic zircons from a sample about 1.5 m above the base of the BFB at Chinde Point were analyzed by chemical abrasionthermal ionization mass spectrometry (CA-TIMS); five distinguishably younger zircons gave a weighted mean UPb date of 209.93 ± 0.07 Ma (2) (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we report a UPb CA-TIMS detrital zircon age of 210.08 ± 0.22 Ma for a coherent cluster of 6 out of 14 zircons analyzed from the BFB in core PFNP-1A (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two UPb CA-TIMS zircon dates for the BFB differ by an insignificant 0.15 My.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample 52Q2 (210.08 ± 0.22 Ma) in the BFB is from within magnetozone PF2r, which is correlated to Chron E16r whose APTS age range of 209.95210.25 Ma was based on counting 20.6221.35 long eccentricity (405 ky) cycles back from the high-precision UPb zircon date at 201.6 Ma in the Newark section (1, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UPb CA-TIMS zircon date for the BFB agrees precisely with the predicted APTS age for Chron E16r.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This agreement immediately discounts assertions that even a small fraction of a 405-ky cycle let alone millions of years are missing below the CAMP lavas in the Newark section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The overall stratigraphic coherence of the magnetic correlations with the BFB and other UPb zircon dates can be gauged in a plot of depth versus age (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetic correlations to the APTS (coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.9845) suggest a relatively uniform net sediment accumulation rate of about 34.8 msd/My from the upper Sonsela, through the Petrified Forest, and up into the lower Owl Rock members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A tight linear regression of composite heights of lithostratigraphic members from outcrop (12, 20) versus their stratigraphic depths in PFNP-1A (SI Appendix, Fig S5 and Table S1) allows the UPb-dated levels in outcrop to be compared with those reported here from core PFNP-1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dates for the BFB from outcrop (sample BFBo) and core (sample 52Q2) are indistinguishable, as described above, supporting the use of the base of the distinctive BFB as a regional time horizon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample 158Q2 along with samples GPU and P57-C confirm that the included magnetozone PF4n indeed correlates to Chron E15n, whereas sample 182Q1 along with sample GPU confirm that included magnetozone PF4r most probably correlates to Chron E14r.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, sample GPL has a reported UPb CA-TIMS zircon date of 218.02 ± 0.28 Ma (12) that is much too old for its projected level at 207.8 msd in PFNP-1A, which would place it within magnetozone PF4r whose correlative Chron E14r ranges back to only 214.92 Ma (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further discussion of GPL and other dated samples from outcrop lower in the Chinle Fm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are deferred pending acquisition of additional UPb CA-TIMS zircon dates directly from the core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The UPb CA-TIMS zircon dates for samples 52Q2, 158Q2, and 182Q1 from the core are highly consistent with the depthage relationship for samples BFBo, GPU, KWI, and P57-C from outcrop projected to PFNP-1A as described above (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the added stratigraphic uncertainties of projecting the dates from surface exposures to PFNP-1A, we prefer to use the dates obtained from the core (samples 52Q2, 158Q2, and 182Q1) for a more detailed analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This set of sample data provides a regression for Y (meters stratigraphic depth in PFNP-1A) with respect to X (age in Ma) (Y = 34.34 * X  7,158; R2 = 0.9994) that is in remarkably close agreement with a regression of predicted depth versus ages from the APTS via magnetostratigraphy (Y = 34.84 * X  7,258 m; R2 = 0.9845) and yield highly consistent estimates for sediment accumulation rate of 34.334.8 m/My (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The very close agreement between the ages predicted by the magnetic polarity correlations and the UPb zircon geochronology directly confirms the timing of the APTS back to about 215 Ma, at around the Chron E14r/14n boundary; this immediately refutes suggestions that significant time is missing in the NewarkHartford sequence used to build the APTS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The congruence between the Colorado Plateauzircon-calibrated polarity timescale and the NewarkHartford APTS can be directly attributed to the reliability of the 405-ky eccentricity variation recorded in the NewarkHartford sequence, in terms of its correct identification and counting of its expression as the long eccentricity climate cycle (21) as well as the periodicity being close to 405 ky as calculated from modern celestial mechanics (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the age difference (8.50 My) estimated from slightly less than 21 long eccentricity cycles between the UPb-dated tie points at 210.08 Ma for the BFB within Chron E16r (Ecc405:518.87519.60, centered at 519.24), and 201.6 Ma just below first CAMP basalt (Ecc405:498.25) is indistinguishable from the difference in the UPb dates (8.48 My, with an estimated uncertainty of ±0.3 My from propagation of the individual 2 errors), which would imply a cycle duration of close to 404 ky, or within an insignificant 1 ky or 0.25% of the hypothesized 405-ky period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The periodicity of the JupiterVenus-long eccentricity cycle indeed must be very close to 405 ky even at this remote age range and we see no justification given the present observational uncertainties to assume a different value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 405-ky oscillation is the largest and most stable term in the periodic approximation of Earths eccentricity, but theoretical solutions formally constrain orbital motions to only about the past 50 million years, with different solutions yielding deviations of up to about ±405 ky over 250 My (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, this apparent stability, however plausible, is entirely theoretical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Independent UPb CA-TIMS zircon dating is just beginning to confirm the accuracy of these solutions in the Cenozoic (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work shows that the 405-ky eccentricity cycle can be used with confidence as a framework of geologic timescales back to at least 215 Ma in the Late Triassic, which also places an empirical constraint on the dynamics of the Solar System (6) over a time span more than four times longer than orbital solutions allow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, a number of global events in the Late Triassic can now be integrated more confidently into the framework of the APTS (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the vexing problem of Late Triassic biotic provinciality and the delay in rise to ecological dominance of tropical dinosaurs until after the end-Triassic mass extinction (23) can be explored without relying on biostratigraphy for time control, which has in the past resulted in circular reasoning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dinosaurs had evolved by the early Late Triassic (Carnian), and by the Norian, relatively large, herbivorous, sauropodomorph dinosaurs were abundant at mid-to-high latitudes, but apparently absent from low latitudes (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on correlation of paleomagnetic polarity sequences to the confirmed APTS, we can now more securely place the diverse La Esquina assemblage, with its abundant large herbivorous sauropodomorph dinosaurs from the upper third of the Los Colorados Formation of Argentina (paleolatitude 40° S; Fig 3, Inset) in Chron E15n at about 213 Ma (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assemblage is thus contemporaneous with the diverse assemblages of the early part of the Revueltian biozone (18) of the western United States (paleolatitude, 10°N), in which dinosaurs are rare and small-bodied, and sauropodomorphs (and all herbivorous dinosaurs) are absent (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like in the western United States, strata in chrons E15n-E16n in the Newark and Fundy basins (27) with paleolatitudes of 15°N produce diverse tetrapod track assemblages but lack putative sauropodomorph footprints, and dinosaur track-makers are rare and small-bodied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fleming Fjord Fm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bone and track assemblages from Greenland (paleolatitude, 43°N) have both abundant large-bodied sauropodomorph skeletons and footprints (28) and correlate to chrons possibly only as old as E14n (216 Ma) (29), similar in age to the La Esquina assemblage in the Los Colorados Fm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as well to the Revueltian assemblages in the Chinle and contemporaneous assemblages in the Newark and Fundy basins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of large-bodied herbivorous dinosaurs in the tropics of Pangea, the strong biotic provinciality (30, 31), and the 30-My delay in the rise of dinosaurian ecological dominance in the tropics (23), is thus not an artifact of biostratigraphic miscorrelation as construed by some (32) but a real feature of that world in which it can now be quantified both in time and space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A total of 174 oriented subsamples were extracted from 24278 mcd (21248 msd) from the finest-grained most red-colored sediment facies of the lower Owl Rock Mb., the entire Petrified Forest Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  including the BFB, and down into the middle part of the Sonsela Mb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Progressive thermal demagnetization was used to isolate the characteristic component of the natural remanent magnetization of each specimen that tended to be carried predominantly by hematite (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A least-squares linear fit using principal-component analysis over the three to seven (typically five) demagnetization steps in the range of 300600 °C and anchored to the origin (SI Appendix, Fig S2) was used to assess the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) in each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were deemed acceptable if the maximum angular deviation (MAD) (33) was 16° or less; 132 of the 174 samples (76%) satisfied this criterion (average MAD of 8°) and fell into two populations (SI Appendix, Fig S3), shallow northerly and shallow southerly groupings that are interpreted to represent normal and reverse polarities of the Late Triassic geomagnetic field that provide a magnetostratigraphy (SI Appendix, Tables S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples for UPb zircon dating were also taken at the Rutgers Core Repository.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each sample was a 10- to 20-cm-thick quarter-round cut using a bandsaw with a carborundum-tipped blade, targeting sandstones that were poorly sorted and contain abundant accessory minerals indicative of volcanic detritus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were crushed, and mineral concentrates were then purified using standard mineral separation techniques, including sieves, magnetic separation, and density separation at the LaserChron Center at the University of Arizona, mounted on epoxy disks and polished to about one-half of the crystal width followed by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) analyses, providing a survey of the range of zircon ages present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the Berkeley Geochronology Center, 2030 crystals displaying the youngest LA-ICPMS age from each sample were extracted from the mount and prepared for zircon UPb chemical abrasion, thermal ionization mass spectroscopy (CA-TIMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before TIMS analysis, all zircons were pretreated using thermal annealing at 850 °C for 48 h, followed by chemical abrasion with concentrated HF in pressurized dissolution capsules at 220 °C for 812 h. The analytical data of four samples from the Chinle Fm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  subjected to UPb zircon CA-TIMS analyses are presented in SI Appendix, Fig S4 and Tables S4 and S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
