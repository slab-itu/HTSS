Dynamic process connectivity explains ecohydrologic responses to rainfall pulses and drought  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the face of changing climate, weather variability, and land cover, it is important to understand how ecosystem components vary jointly to determine how the system responds as a whole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While previous works have identified thresholds along climate gradients regarding precipitation, soils, and vegetation, we relate these thresholds to shifts in connectivity between variables, captured through joint variability, to better understand whole-system attributes of resilience, sensitivity, and vulnerability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use data from flux tower transects along elevation gradients to address the relationship between joint connectivity and energy, water, and carbon flux responses to changes in moisture availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis reveals differences in joint variability between locations that can help explain responses to disturbances such as rain events or drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ecohydrologic fluxes within atmosphere, vegetation, and soil systems exhibit a joint variability that arises from forcing and feedback interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions cause fluctuations to propagate between variables at many time scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an ecosystem, this connectivity dictates responses to climate change, land-cover change, and weather events and must be characterized to understand resilience and sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use an information theory-based approach to quantify connectivity in the form of information flow associated with the propagation of fluctuations between variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply this approach to study ecosystems that experience changes in dry-season moisture availability due to rainfall and drought conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use data from two transects with flux towers located along elevation gradients and quantify redundant, synergistic, and unique flow of information between lagged sources and targets to characterize joint asynchronous time dependencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory in Idaho, a dry-season rainfall pulse leads to increased connectivity from soil and atmospheric variables to heat and carbon fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory in California, separate sets of dominant drivers characterize two sites at which fluxes exhibit different drought responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both cases, our information flow-based connectivity characterizes dominant drivers and joint variability before, during, and after disturbances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach to gauge the responsiveness of ecosystem fluxes under multiple sources of variability furthers our understanding of complex ecohydrologic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In TIPNets, time-series variables are considered as nodes, and information theory measures identify time-dependent links from sources Xs1, Xs2, Xs3, and so on, to target Xtar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Time-series datasets are segmented into multiple windows, for example T1 and T2, to capture dynamics before or after some disturbance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Illustration of information transfer from three source nodes to a target node, where components shift in strength between two time windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single source may provide information uniquely (U), and pairs of sources may provide redundant (R) or synergistic information (S).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C and D) We compare changes in S, U, and R information transfer to a target to changes in the state of a target variable (e.g., a measured eddy covariance flux) between time windows to map the stability of a variable to a shift in connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A target variable and its TIPNet characteristics may be inversely related (+, +), directly related (++, ), disconnected (0+,0, 0,+0), or stable (00).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

2_Flux_Tower_Study_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In southwestern Idaho, the RC-CZO maintains a transect of four flux towers, WB (Ameriflux site US-Rws), LS (Ameriflux site US-Rls), PS, and MS (Ameriflux site US-Rms), along an elevation and climate gradient from north to south (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Northern sites are at lower elevation and receive lower annual rainfall relative to the southern sites (Table 1 and SI Appendix, section 2 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along this transect, we analyze changes in process connectivity between net carbon flux (Fc), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), and ground heat flux (G), and atmospheric and soil conditions before and after a rainfall pulse in July 2015 (SI Appendix, Fig S3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In California, the SS-CZO also maintains a transect of four flux towers along an elevation gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focus on the middle two, Soaproot Saddle (SR, Ameriflux site US-CZ2) and Providence Creek (PC, Ameriflux site US-CZ3), due to longer-term data availability over the 6-y period before and during the recent California drought (Table 1 and SI Appendix, section 2 and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we analyze process connectivity between measured fluxes and atmospheric and soil variables before and during the drought.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on the SS-CZO and RC-CZO sites can be found in SI Appendix, section 2, Table S1, and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A_Information_Partitioning_Measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a network of interacting variables, a given variable may be considered as a target of information at a current time step (Xtar=X(t)) or a source at a lagged time step (Xs=X(t)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use Shannon information theory (19) measures to characterize joint variability through the information transfer between source and target variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shared information between two time-lagged source variables Xs1 and Xs2 and one target variable Xtar is the mutual information:I(Xs1,Xs2;Xtar)=p(xs1,xs2,xtar)log2p(xs1,xs2,xtar)p(xs1,xs2)p(xtar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]We use measures based on information partitioning, or information decomposition (28, 30), to classify the nature of multivariate shared information in terms of synergistic (S) or joint, unique (U1, U2) or individual from one of the two sources, and redundant (R) or overlapping, components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this framework, information provided from any two lagged sources to a target can be defined as the sum of S, U1, U2, and R. For two sources Xs1 and Xs2 and one target Xtar, the mutual information I(Xs1,Xs2;Xtar), I(Xs1;Xtar), and I(Xs2;Xtar) can be partitioned as follows (28):I(Xs1,Xs2;Xtar)=U1(Xs1;Xtar)+U2(Xs2;Xtar)+R(Xs1,Xs2;Xtar)+S(Xs1,Xs2;Xtar)[2]I(Xs1;Xtar)=U1(Xs1;Xtar)+R(Xs1,Xs2;Xtar)[3]I(Xs2;Xtar)=U2(Xs2;Xtar)+R(Xs1,Xs2;Xtar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [4]If one source provides a larger amount of information than another (e.g., I(Xs1;Xtar) greater than I(Xs2;Xtar)), as reflected through a higher reduction in uncertainty of the target, it will have a higher uniqueness (U), indicating its dominant influence as an individual source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high synergy (S) indicates that two sources provide information jointly, since both sources must be known together to reduce target uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, redundancy (R) indicates an overlap in information due to lagged synchronization or correlation between sources, and the extent to which either source reduces the same target uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since mutual information quantities in Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 are directly computable, one of the four components S, U1, U2, and R must be obtained independently to solve this underdetermined system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, we perform information partitioning using a recently developed approach (11) where redundancy, R, is obtained based on scaling by source dependency I(Xs1;Xs2), such that independent sources are minimally redundant (maximally unique) and highly dependent sources are assumed to be maximally redundant (minimally unique).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A TIPNet for a given time window is composed of all S, U, and R relations between all source pairs and a specified target or set of targets (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that in the TIPNet framework a target variable that serves as a source for other variables could itself be considered as a target, enabling us to capture feedback dependencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this application, however, we specify nonoverlapping sets of source and target variables, such that only feedbacks between sources may be captured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a given target variable, we denote Q as the sum of all information components, that is, S+U1+U2+R from all pairs of sources, such that Q indicates total information flow to the target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details on the TIPNet approach, probability density function estimation (9, 3133), and statistical significance testing (9, 33) are provided in SI Appendix, section 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

B_Data_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We consider half-hourly time-series variables measured at the flux towers as nodes in a network, where measured fluxes of LE, H, G, and Fc are targets of information transfer from multiple source variables related to atmospheric and soil conditions (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We construct process networks for different sites and time windows according to seasons and the timing of the drought in the case of SS-CZO and a dry-season rain pulse at RC-CZO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These selected time windows enable us to explore how network measures change with moisture availability under disturbances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compute information theory measures using only daytime data, defined based on sunrise and sunset times, to omit differences between nighttime and daytime processes and to avoid eddy covariance errors common to nighttime measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider time lags from 30 min to 4 h (one to eight time steps of half-hourly data) to capture high-frequency joint variability as opposed to longer-term interactions that would span multiple days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we take the 5-d anomaly of variables that exhibit a diurnal cycle (SI Appendix, Table S1) to focus on fluctuations that occur on these short time scales, rather than magnitudes of variables or longer-term relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details on data preparation are provided in SI Appendix, section 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

C_Process_Network_Examples  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The key premise underlying our study is that fluctuations between two sources x1 and x2 can interact to produce an outcome in a target variable xtar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general xtar can be a complex function f(x1,x2) where the functional form f() may be unknown or cannot be represented explicitly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, information partitioning provides novel insights about these interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illustrate this with a simple prototypical example, let us consider the example of two signals x1(t) and x2(t), which are sinusoidal waveforms with varying phases, frequencies, and amplitudes, and xtar(t)=x1(t)+x2(t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on differences in phase, amplitude, and frequency between x1 and x2, xtar exhibits dynamics of varying complexities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When x1 and x2 have identical phases and frequencies, all of the information they provide to xtar is redundant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Otherwise, x1 and x2 provide increasingly more synergistic information to xtar as their frequencies and phases diverge, regardless of wave amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, unique information is a function of the amplitudes of the source waves, since a higher-amplitude, or stronger, source provides more unique information than a lower-amplitude, or weaker, source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This example is described in greater detail in SI Appendix, section 1C and Fig S1 and demonstrates how fluctuations in source variables may combine to cause more complex dynamics in a target variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the magnitudes of sources influence the partitioning of unique information, other properties of source fluctuations can be interpreted through synergistic and redundant information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To illustrate the TIPNet method, we next discuss an example of joint dependencies between source and target meteorological time-series variables measured at the flux towers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the SS-CZO sites, SR and PC, we quantify TIPNet measures based on lagged sources of incoming shortwave radiation (SW), wind speed (WS), and air temperature (Ta) and define the target variable to be relative humidity (RH) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variations in Ta, WS, and SW may drive fluctuations in RH through changes in water vapor capacity, mixing, and cloud cover, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the variability of each source and dependencies between them, we expect our information measures to capture different types of information concerning RH that can be attributed to individual sources and combinations of sources (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyze information measures over four time windows, consisting of daytime data at both sites during JuneAugust for years 2011 and 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In 2012 at site SR we find that the lagged source pair {Ta, SW} provides the highest total information to RH, and that most of this information is in the form of unique information from Ta (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2011, the pair {WS, SW} provides the highest total information, and this mainly consists of synergistic information that the sources provide jointly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the higher-elevation site PC, the pair {WS, Ta} is the dominant source pair in both years, but proportions of information types vary (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, WS is the stronger unique source in 2011, and Ta is the stronger unique source in 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We interpret these measures in terms of varying types and strengths of interactions under different environmental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ta is always detected as a source of information to RH for all sites and years, indicating a consistent dependency between fluctuations in air temperature and relative humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, WS and SW are more intermittently detected as statistically significant sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, during a calm and clear day, SW and WS may influence RH weakly relative to Ta, since their variabilities are very low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of joint sources, the prevalence of synergy, S, over redundancy, R, for all cases indicates the importance of considering multiple drivers of variability when analyzing ecohydrologic time-series data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the example of propagating waveforms, we find that the knowledge of combinations of source variables reduces more target uncertainty than would the knowledge of any single variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we do not discuss specific time lags of dominant information transfer for each case, but note that any information measure is associated with a time lag of 4 h, the maximum time lag considered in this application, or fewer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated here, a TIPNet composed of individual S, U, and R information components between sets of sources and targets and the total information quantity Q characterizes aspects of complex dependencies that are not captured with traditional measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


4_Results__Response_to_Rainfall_Pulse_at_RC  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A_Whole-Network_Shifts_over_Monthly_Time_Windows  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the RC-CZO transect, we first study the relationship between target fluxes and process network connectivity on a monthly time scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of the four sites, we define time windows for TIPNet analysis as follows: T1=DOY 152180 (June) and T2= DOY 181210 (July) for both 2015 and 2016 (SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare changes in fluxes to changes in process connectivity in the form of total information (illustrated in Fig 1 C and D) between time windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This total information quantity, Q, for a given time window is the sum of S, U1, U2, and R information components that all pairs of lagged source variables (SI Appendix, Table S1) provide to carbon and heat fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this, we can identify shifts in ecosystem interactions associated with event dynamics, disturbance, or phenological transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both years, monthly average LE decreases (Fig 3A) and Fc increases (Fig 3D) from June to July, regardless of the rainfall conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the two lower sites, H (Fig 3B) and G (Fig 3C) trends reverse in 2015 compared with 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Across the sites, the increase in monthly average Fc from June to July is slightly stronger in 2015 relative to 2016 (larger positive Fc), as outward carbon fluxes increased during and after the rainfall pulse (SI Appendix, Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Process connectivity, in the form of total information Q to Fc, increases from June to July in 2015 and decreases in 2016 for all sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this we infer that, given a monthly time window, altered connectivity due to the July 2015 rainfall event was sufficient to slightly magnify the seasonal increase in carbon flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the relationship between connectivity and Fc changes from direct in 2015 to inverse in 2016, the mitigated increase in monthly average Fc in 2016 confirms that lower process connectivity leads to lower net upward carbon fluxes, in the form of a mitigated seasonal increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Fc, the change in monthly average ground heat flux, G, differs slightly between 2015 and 2016 (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, total information transfer Q to G increases at all sites in 2015 and decreases at all sites in 2016.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this we infer that process connectivity to G varies due to the moisture availability, but these changes have a relatively weak influence on monthly average G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Latent heat flux, LE, decreases from June to July for all sites and years to varying extents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the July 2015 rainfall pulse is associated with a pulse in LE and increased process connectivity to LE at lower-elevation sites, and a lesser effect at the higher elevations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 2015, the trend between LE and Q (Fig 3A) is nearly linear with elevation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower-elevation sites, WS and LS, show a small decrease in LE and an increase in Q, while the higher-elevation sites, PS and MS, show larger decreases in LE and a decrease in Q.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of the rainfall event in 2015, the added moisture caused a pulse in LE at the lower-elevation sites that was large enough to weaken the seasonal trend of decreasing LE relative to the drier summer of the following year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is similar to the magnifying effect of the rainfall on the monthly average Fc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the higher-elevation sites, particularly site MS, the rainfall event did not have this influence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be related to the higher antecedent precipitation at MS in 2016 (SI Appendix, Fig S2C) and a less intense July rainfall event relative to the other sites (SI Appendix, Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At MS, LE was already occurring at a high rate such that the rainfall did not significantly influence evapotranspiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In 2016, increased monthly average sensible heat flux, H, is always associated with decreased information transfer to H (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that as conditions become drier and the magnitude of H increases, joint variability between atmospheric and soil states and H decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inverse relationship between connectivity and H magnitude could be interpreted as H becoming decreasingly constrained by variability in other sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, as conditions become drier, H increases regardless of the variability of sources which, during wetter periods, may constrain H in favor of LE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2015, H exhibits very diverse June-to-July behaviors for each site (Fig 3B), indicating that the rainfall pulse in 2015 has a different effect on connectivity and H at each site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on this monthly analysis, the RC-CZO flux tower sites can be grouped in two ways (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the two lower-elevation sites can be separated from the higher-elevation sites in terms of flux responses, LE, H, G, and Fc, for a given June-to-July period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be attributed to differences between vegetation and microbial activity at the higher- and lower-elevation sites (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the lower-elevation sites, WB and LS, vegetation is dormant or nearly dormant by the time of the rainfall event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature and water availability drive microbial respiration, which in turn drive Fc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At PS and MS, vegetation is not dormant and both photosynthesis and respiration drive fluxes of water and carbon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second grouping of sites can be observed in terms of process connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the middle-elevation sites tend to exhibit more moderate changes in process connectivity under the disturbance, the sites on the extreme ends of the elevation gradient behave similarly to each other in that they exhibit large changes in total information transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For most target fluxes, changes in total information transfer, Q, are larger at sites WB and MS than those at the mid-elevation sites LS and PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two groupings of locations along the elevation gradient place each site in a unique position in terms of how flux magnitudes can relate to shifts in joint variability (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

B_Driving_Influences_Change_on_Short_Time_Scales  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The monthly time windows captured several changes in heat and carbon flux behaviors and process connectivity in relation to the rainfall event but also captured similarities between years that indicate seasonal trends during the dry season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternate definition of time windows enables us to focus more specifically on the effects of the July 2015 rainfall pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we define 10-d time windows of before rainfall (DOY 176185), during rainfall (DOY 186195), and after rainfall (DOY 196205) periods (SI Appendix, Fig S2 BH) for 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in contrast to the previous analysis of total information transfer, Q, from many sources, we now focus on individual sources and source pairs that provide unique, synergistic, and redundant information within each time window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider information transfer from source combinations of water vapor density (v), soil water content (VWC), air temperature (Ta), and surface temperature (Tsurf) to fluctuations in latent heat flux, LE, at the lower-elevation sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar analysis for all sites and target fluxes is provided in SI Appendix, section 3 and Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the time windows before and after the rainfall, sources and strengths of information transfer to LE are very similar, except that v is a stronger source before the rainfall and Tsurf is a stronger source after the rainfall (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could indicate an increased sensitivity of LE to soil conditions, although soil moisture does not vary enough during this window for a dependency to be detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At both WB and LS sites, we find that information transfer to LE increases during the rainfall pulse (Fig 4A), corresponding to a large peak in average LE during the period DOY 186195.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the fluctuations triggered by the rainfall event lead to both increased magnitudes of LE and increased connectivity between fluctuations in LE and atmospheric and soil variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At site WB, the increase in process connectivity is attributed to information transfer from source pairs that include VWC (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At site LS, the increased information transfer during the rainy time window is also due to increased information transfer from VWC, but a relatively higher proportion of this information is redundant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the sources VWC, v, Tsurf, and Ta are more tightly synchronized to each other at site LS compared with site WB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At WB, sources share similar quantities of information with LE but tend to provide information uniquely or synergistically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the rainfall event at LS, the only two detected sources are v and Tsurf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates an enhanced joint variability between temperature, moisture, and LE that persists in the days after the rainfall event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In most cases, the network connectivity trends between the 10-d windows differ from those detected for the monthly time windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this we infer that the rainfall event had some shorter-term influences that are better captured within an event-scale time window, while seasonal or more persistent influences can be assessed with longer time windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As evident from similarities in total information transfer, Q, between 2015 and 2016, the 30-d windows also capture typical seasonal patterns of fluxes and process connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Along the RC-CZO transect, added moisture due to a dry-season rainfall pulse mitigates the seasonal decrease in LE and increase in Fc that are observed in a drier year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results above indicate that this is overall associated with increased information transfer to heat and carbon fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At lower-elevation sites, the response to the 2015 rainfall event is immediate in terms of increased information transfer to LE from temperature and moisture variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While flux responses to the moisture perturbations are distinguished based on the known threshold between higher- and lower-elevation sites, we also detect a separation between middle-elevation sites and sites on the extreme ends of the elevation gradient in terms of shifts in process connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


5_Results__Sensitivity_to_Drought_Conditions_at_SS  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A_Trajectories_of_Fluxes_and_Process_Connectivity_over_Time  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the SS-CZO, we explore the relationship between process connectivity, or total information transfer Q (i.e., S+U1+U2+R from all pairs) from flux tower variables (listed in SI Appendix, Table S1) and average summertime fluxes of LE, H, and Fc as the drought progresses over several years (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While at RC-CZO we analyzed the difference between June and July information transfer and average flux magnitudes, here we consider Xyear=XyearXavg, in which Xavg is the average summer time flux (e.g., LE or Fc) or information measure (Q) over all 6 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, high or low values are relative to the average for each site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the two sites, we compare the trajectories of these anomalies from 2010 to 2015, a time range which encompasses the two wetter years before the drought and the following four dry years (SI Appendix, Fig S3 and Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At both sites, the predrought years of 2010 and 2011 exhibit high LE and low information transfer, Q, to LE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early drought years, 2012 and 2013, exhibit higher Q and a transition from high to low LE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last 2 y, 2014 and 2015, exhibit low information transfer similar to 20102011, but LE remains low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This peak in information transfer to LE early in the drought may indicate a heightened sensitivity of LE to environmental conditions as water becomes scarce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later in the drought, information transfer decreases as LE becomes more constrained and fluctuations in source variables no longer influence its variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to the behavior at the RC-CZO sites, sensible heat flux, H, and its information transfer characteristics vary more widely between sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the lower-elevation site SR, H is low for the first 3 y and high for the last 3 y, corresponding to the opposite trend in LE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to process connectivity to LE, information transfer to H is at a minimum during the transitional period of 20122013.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At both sites, and particularly for the lower-elevation site, SR, information transfer versus LE and H anomalies are approximately flipped images of each other (Fig 5 A and B and insets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At SR, drought conditions are most clearly characterized by high to low information transfer to LE, and low to high information transfer to H. At the higher-elevation site PC, information transfer to H varies little over the study years, and 2010 and 2015 exhibit similar average summertime H. As with LE and H, 20122013 marks a transition from lower to higher Fc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall trends in Fc and information transfer to Fc in the form of Q are similar between sites and involve increasing information transfer and Fc (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these aspects are mitigated at the higher-elevation site compared with the lower-elevation site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the similar rainfall conditions at the two sites, we infer that LE is less responsive to altered connectivity between variables at PC compared with SR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could indicate that (i) LE at PC is stable and less responsive to atmospheric and soil influences in general or (ii) LE at PC is responding to a different set of drivers not included in this flux tower dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of moisture availability, it has been found that soil moisture recharge was higher at site PC during the drought, and that roots were able to access this water to maintain evapotranspiration (1), indicating that at PC LE was less tightly constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

B_Differing_Sources_of_Variability_Through_the_Drought  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While the changes in total information transfer, Q, represent breakdowns or strengthening of time dependencies, different source pairs may be acting as the increasing or decreasing influence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was previously illustrated from the 10-d windows at RC-CZO, for which different pairs of sources provided information to LE for different time windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we assess information transfer from many combinations of sources (Fig 6 C and D and SI Appendix, Table S1) to latent heat flux LE at SS-CZO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At both sites, we find that synergistic information, S, and unique information, U, are much greater than redundant information, R (Fig 6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of redundant information indicates that there is little overlap, or lagged synchronization, between variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, we focus on S and U as the dominant components of information transfer in further analysis of specific links.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The years 20102013 are fairly similar between sites in terms of both overall information transfer to LE and specific sets of sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the years before the drought, process connectivity is higher at site PC than site SR due to a larger number of detected sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While v and Ta are dominant sources at SR, WS, Tsoil, and RH are additionally detected as sources at PC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the beginning of the drought in 20122013, process connectivity to LE increases for both sites, and many sources of information are detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, a larger proportion of this information is synergistic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased synergy or redundancy is to be expected under an increased number of sources, since there are more possible pairs of sources that could either provide overlapping or joint information to a target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in synergistic information transfer early in the drought, particularly at site SR, indicates an increased responsiveness of variability in LE to environmental fluctuations as conditions first become dry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The last two years in this study, 2014 and 2015, are characterized by very low information transfer at both sites, and few statistically significant sources to LE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates a disconnect between LE and atmospheric and soil processes as conditions become increasingly dry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both sites exhibit this decrease in process connectivity to LE, dominant sources of information differ between sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, soil moisture, VWC, and soil temperature, Tsoil, are the only sources to LE at the lower-elevation site SR, while air temperature, Ta, and relative humidity, RH, are the only sources at site PC (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that in the late years of the drought fluctuations in soil variables and atmospheric variables drive variability in LE at the lower- and higher-elevation sites, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with the predrought years of 2010 and 2011, during which both atmospheric and soil variables provided information to LE at both sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This separation of drivers between sites can be placed into the context of the different drought responses at each site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher-elevation site, PC, had a mitigated drought response due to higher soil moisture recharge and deep rooting depths, while the lower-elevation site maintained ET through 2012 but soil water was not recharged as the drought progressed in later years (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At site PC, we infer that since soil water was more available, fluctuations in LE retained their connectivity to atmospheric processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, LE was tightly constrained by soil moisture at the lower-elevation site, such that soil states were detected as the sole drivers of variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon flux, Fc, exhibits more joint variability with source variables at site SR compared with site PC (SI Appendix, section 4 and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since changes in summertime average Fc are more mitigated at PC, we infer that Fc at this site is less responsive to altered variability in soil and atmospheric drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From the above analysis, we can say that the combination of strengthening and weakening influences as moisture conditions change indicates a complex response of LE to moisture availability between one summer and the next.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At SS-CZO sites, the multiyear drought is characterized by first increasing and then decreasing process connectivity of flux tower variables to LE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the higher-elevation site is less responsive in terms of magnitudes of LE between years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At both sites, different sets of drivers were detected before the drought and during early and later drought periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


6_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When ecohydrologic fluxes along climate gradients diverge in their responses to disturbances, an analysis of process connectivity can reveal drivers and influences behind these differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along both RC-CZO and SS-CZO transects, the varying relations between information transfer and ecohydrologic behaviors at neighboring sites indicate the significant influence of heterogeneity in soil characteristics, topography, vegetation, and soil microbial activity (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analysis of process connectivity, in the form of total information transfer or specific sourcetarget dependencies, identifies nonlinear and asynchronous connectivity that could not be detected with traditional linear measures (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information partitioning further characterizes the nature of a given multivariate dependency as joint, overlapping, or individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional consideration of ecohydrologic states, such as average heat or carbon fluxes during a time period of interest, relates process connectivity and observed ecosystem sensitivity to disturbances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At RC-CZO, a process connectivity analysis reveals the relation between joint variability and changes in ecohydrologic fluxes before and after a rainfall pulse, relative to a drier period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences between nearby sites likely indicate heterogeneity in vegetation characteristics, antecedent moisture, and soils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At SS-CZO, differences in sources of information are associated with different drought responses at two study sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the onset of drought conditions, both sites exhibit increases in process connectivity in the form of total information transfer to LE, indicating some heightened responsiveness of fluxes to environmental variability as conditions initially become dry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later in the drought, information transfer does exhibit a breakdown, and soil moisture and atmospheric variability influence LE at the lower- and higher-elevation sites, respectively, corresponding to more extreme and mitigated drought responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, process connectivity, when considered along with ecohydrologic indicators, identifies how mechanisms driving variability change during drought conditions for different sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study of process connectivity during drought conditions can be compared with a previous study that detected a breakdown in connectivity between eddy covariance variables during a Midwestern drought (9) compared with a wetter growing season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference between regions could relate to the timing of drought onset and the different climatic regimes studied, in that the California drought occurred over several years and was more dependent on winter precipitation rather than precipitation during the crop growth period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the two case studies span different ecosystems, time ranges, and types of moisture-related disturbances, important inferences can be made regarding how connectivity between variables impacts the sensitivity of fluxes to change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ground heat flux G and carbon flux Fc are similar in that their sources and strengths of joint variability alter with conditions, but their average magnitudes are relatively stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As these variables likely respond to fluctuations in soil states rather than more quickly varying atmospheric states, the results suggest that fluctuations propagate to influence short-term variability, but this does not always translate into changes in longer-term average magnitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At SS-CZO, however, we do see generally increasing Fc and increasing information flow to variability in Fc as the drought progresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Latent heat flux, LE, and sensible heat flux, H, show relatively more joint relationships between process connectivity measures and flux magnitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For SS-CZO and some RC-CZO cases at the monthly time scale, information flow to LE increases as average LE decreases, but for very dry conditions information flow and LE decrease together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, for short time windows at RC-CZO, a single rainfall pulse led to short-term increases in both LE and information flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that information flow increases when LE is moderately constrained or when there is a sudden pulse of moisture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for very dry conditions LE is constrained such that it is not responsive to the variability of sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H shows more variable relationships between process connectivity and average magnitudes, but we find that large changes in one aspect generally relate to large changes in the other, such as at SS-CZO where changes in information flow were mitigated at the less drought-sensitive site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that while H is not constrained by moisture availability in the same way as LE, the joint variability of environmental source variables does influence longer-term average fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The characterization of multivariate forcing and feedback relations in ecohydrologic systems is integral to better understanding and predicting whole-system attributes of resilience, sensitivity, and vulnerability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most systems, it is generally not possible to perform manipulative experiments to identify causal drivers and feedback (25), and observed datasets, modeling, and multivariate statistical methods are necessary instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the multiple intensifying and mitigating mechanisms that can influence a given ecosystem property (1), it is important to consider joint interactions to understand the overall response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Process connectivity in terms of synergistic, unique, and redundant information transfers could benefit studies of controls on ecosystem dynamics and elasticity to climate change (26), assessing types of information present and absent in models (34), or studies of spatial connectivity (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
