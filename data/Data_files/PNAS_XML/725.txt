High-speed acoustic communication by multiplexing orbital angular momentum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Acoustic communication is critical for underwater application such as deep-ocean scientific explorations and off-shore industrial controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because other techniques using electromagnetic waves are difficult for underwater applications due to the strong absorption of water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical communication, on the other hand, suffers from the light scattering, making long-range underwater optical communication very challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, using acoustic waves to transmit information is currently the dominant technique for underwater applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the low-frequency bandwidth available limits the data transmission rate and information capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose and experimentally demonstrate an approach using the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of acoustic vortex beams, which provides an independent channel that enhances the data transmission rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This OAM multiplexing method will significantly impact future underwater communications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Long-range acoustic communication is crucial to underwater applications such as collection of scientific data from benthic stations, ocean geology, and remote control of off-shore industrial activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the transmission rate of acoustic communication is always limited by the narrow-frequency bandwidth of the acoustic waves because of the large attenuation for high-frequency sound in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate a high-throughput communication approach using the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of acoustic vortex beams with one order enhancement of the data transmission rate at a single frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The topological charges of OAM provide intrinsically orthogonal channels, offering a unique ability to multiplex data transmission within a single acoustic beam generated by a transducer array, drastically increasing the information channels and capacity of acoustic communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high spectral efficiency of 8.0 ± 0.4 (bit/s)/Hz in acoustic communication has been achieved using topological charges between 4 and +4 without applying other communication modulation techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such OAM is a completely independent degree of freedom which can be readily integrated with other state-of-the-art communication modulation techniques like quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase-shift keying (PSK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information multiplexing through OAM opens a dimension for acoustic communication, providing a data transmission rate that is critical for underwater applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Acoustic communication using vortex beams with OAM charges 4 to +4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Experimental setup of acoustic communication with vortex beams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A computer-controlled digital-to-analog circuit generates signal to control 4 rings of transducers (with 16 transducers equally spaced on each ring) and emit information encoded into multiplexed acoustic vortex beams into free space at 16 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radii of these 4 rings are 3, 6, 9, and 12 wavelengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Measured orthogonality relations between the bases formed by acoustic vortex beams with OAM charges 4 to +4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of the bars is calculated by forming the inner products between the measured pressure fields of the two corresponding bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The norm of each basis is normalized to unity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-talk between the bases is less than 8.54 dB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Measured pressure-field amplitudes and phases of acoustic vortex beam bases with OAM charges 4 to +4 at 100 wavelengths (2.14 m) away from the emitting plane in air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scanning area covers 22.4 wavelengths by 22.4 wavelengths (48 cm × 48 cm) with 26 by 26 resolutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal and rainbow-scale color bars are used for the measured amplitude and phase fields, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Experimental demonstration of acoustic communication using multiplexed acoustic vortex beams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Binary (ASCII) representations of the letters in the word Berkly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each letter contains 8 bits (1 byte) of information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each byte contains the same amount of total amplitude, i.e., the signal bars in each letter sum up to unity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This amplitude amount is equally distributed into the vortex beams forming the multiplexed signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A multiplexed beam formed by the eight orthogonal vortex beams with OAM charges 4 to +4 is capable to convey the information of each letter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Measured signals of the letters in the word Berkly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bars are calculated by forming the inner product between the measured pressure fields of the multiplexed signal and the bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The norms of the bases are normalized to unity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in A, each letter contains the same amount of total amplitude, which is equally distributed in the on-channels when sending.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Calculated pressure-field amplitudes and phases of the multiplexed signal of the letters in the word Berkly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The field patterns of the letters are superimposed so that one cannot judge the information without demultiplexing through the inner product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Measured pressure-field amplitudes and phases of the multiplexed signal of the letters in the word Berkly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental results match with the calculated fields in C. Colored scale bars are used for the amplitude and phase fields, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measured BER versus SNR of acoustic OAM communication with 26 × 26 sensor array used in the receiver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The squares are measured data with all bytes having the same total amplitude, which is equally distributed in the on-channels of the byte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BER decreases with increasing SNR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 20-dB SNR level, the BER is 106.5, which is smaller than the FEC limit and can still be corrected by standard FEC approaches (34), confirming that our communication system with acoustic OAM is reliable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blue curve is a regression curve of the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured results fit with this regression curve, BER=1/2erfc(SNR/8.0±0.4), indicating the spectral efficiency to be 8.0 ± 0.4 (bit/s)/Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The theoretical limit of the spectral efficiency is given by the number of orthogonal channels used for data transmission, which in this case is 8 bit/s/Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our acoustic communication device with 8 OAM charges used for information encoding is already working at the theoretical limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Method used for BER calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two curves are Gaussian with average 1 and 0 and SD 1 and 0 for on- (blue) and off- (red) channels, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C is the crossing of the two curves and is set as the criterion to judge if the signal is on or off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error bits are on-channels below C and off-channels above C. The BER is given by the ratio of the green area and the area below the two curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Full wave simulation of acoustic communication with OAM multiplexing with three-cycle pulse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Pulse profile of the three-cycle pulse used for simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Obtained amplitude and phase patterns for the word Berkly using the two-cycle pulse for communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
BER, which characterizes the communication performance of the system, with varying number of receivers for the two integration time intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that the BER performances for these two cases are the same.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measured BER dependence of number of sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circles are measured data with all bytes having the same total amplitude, which is equally distributed in the on-channels of the byte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BER decreases with increasing number of sensors in the receiver array from 8 to 68 microphones with the pattern of the array shown in the Fig S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed line marks the FEC limit which determines the maximum error rate that can still be corrected by standard FEC approaches, which is BER=2×103 (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This BER limit corresponds to a minimal required receiver array with 34 sensors in our experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further increasing the number of receivers will not improve the BER significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Examples of receiver arrays used to measure the BER versus SNR response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each circle represents a microphone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The array contains (A) 61, (B) 62, (C) 63, and (D) 64 microphones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These microphones form 4 rings with radii 5.4, 6.7, 8, and 9.3 wavelengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an array with n = 4n + r (where n and r are integers and r less_than 4) sensors, the inner r rings have n + 1 equally spaced sensors and the outer 4  r rings have n equally spaced sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Generation_of_Acoustic_Vortex_and_Multiplexed_Beams  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The acoustic emitting plane in our experiment contains four rings of emitters (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each ring consists of 16 equally spaced speakers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radii of the rings are 3, 6 9, and 12 wavelengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative phases of the speakers used to emit acoustic vortex beam with OAM topological charge l are =l, where  is the azimuthal angle between the speaker and reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All speakers emit with identical amplitude for each OAM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the emitting plane is not significantly large compared with the wavelength, the emitted vortex beams expand along the propagation direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compensate this beam expansion, a phase increment =/2 is applied along the radial direction to generate a conical focusing pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The multiplexing of vortex beams with different OAM charges is accomplished by summing the signals required to generate these topological charges in the digital processor, which is then sent to the speakers to emit the multiplexed beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This summation procedure is equivalent to the creation of an interference pattern between the multiplexed vortex beams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a multiplexing procedure requires the modulation of amplitude and phase of each speaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we take the signal that the speaker at  emits for a multiplexed beam containing two OAM charges as an example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multiplexed signal isS=Acos(t+l1)+Acos(t+l2)=2Acos[(l1l2)]cos(t+l1+l22),[S1]where  is the angular frequency of the acoustic wave, A is the wave amplitude, and l1 and l2 are the topological charges of the two vortex beams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the amplitude and phase of this speaker are tuned to 2Acos[(l1l2)] and (l1+l2)/2 to emit the multiplexed wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude and phase of each speaker required for multiplexed signal containing more than two OAM charges are calculated similarly in the digital processor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Demultiplexing_with_Inner_Product_Algorithm  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The orthogonality relation between the eight bases in Fig 1 and the demultiplexed information in Fig 2 is obtained by forming inner productIjl=pjpldaplplda,[S2]where pl=Alexp(il) is the pressure field (including amplitude Al and phase l) of vortex beam with OAM charge l, and pj=Ajexp(ij) is the pressure field of other vortex beams or multiplexed waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symbol * denotes the complex conjugate of the corresponding variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This integration is over the scanning area of the receiver array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The information signals are normalized such that Ill=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Measurement_of_BER_and_SNR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain the BER and characterize the performance of our communication system with acoustic OAM, we measured the pressure fields of the 28 = 256 possible combinations of the 8 bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal of the pressure field is measured within 300 ms, corresponding to a 3-Hz bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inner products are calculated for all of the on- and off-channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the statistical parameters (average 1 and 0 and SD 1 and 0 for on- and off-channels, respectively), two Gaussian curves are plotted in Fig S2 for the on- and off-channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error bits are the points of on-channels below and off-channels above the crossing of the two curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the statistical BER is the ratio between the shaded (green) area and the whole area under the two curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of down-sampling on the BER is measured by varying the number of sensors in the receiver array between 8 and 68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sensors form 4 rings with radii 5.4, 6.7, 8, and 9.3 wavelengths (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an array with n = 4n + r (where n and r are integers and r less_than 4) sensors, the inner r rings have n + 1 equally spaced sensors and the outer 4  r rings have n equally spaced sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Setup  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our experimental setup contains 64 PUI AST-1532MR-R speakers forming the four rings of the emitter array in Fig S1 on an acrylic frame fabricated by waterjet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 64 speakers are modulated by a custom-designed digital processor with 65 analog output channels from CNDLAB Inc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MATLAB program is used to drive this digital processor to control the emitter array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A CUI CME-1538100LB microphone is fixed on a VELMEX motor-controlled translational stage to mimic the receiver arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The received signal is amplified by a Reson VP2000 EC6081 voltage preamplifier and read by a Stanford Research Systems SR830 lock-in amplifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both amplitude and phase are recorded from the lock-in amplifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Time_Interval_Between_Two_Sequential_Letters  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study the effect of using short pulse (i.e., short time interval between two sequential letters), we perform simulations with a three-cycle pulse, corresponding to 187.5-µs interval between two sequential letters (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The received patterns for the word Berkly at 100 wavelengths away from the source array are shown in Fig S4B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be seen that the patterns obtained from this three-cycle pulse are the same as those shown in Fig 2 of the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To account for a realistic broadband detection, we provide here experimental results obtained with the shortest integration time available to our lock-in amplifier (SR-830).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S5 shows that a shorter integration time (300 µs, 4.8 cycles at 16 kHz) provides the same performance as the 300-ms case reported in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
