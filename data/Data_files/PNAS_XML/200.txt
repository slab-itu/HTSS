Reporter nanoparticle that monitors its anticancer efficacy in real time  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability to identify responders and nonresponders very early during chemotherapy by direct visualization of the activity of the anticancer treatment and to switch, if necessary, to a regimen that is effective can have a significant effect on the outcome as well as quality of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current approaches to quantify response rely on imaging techniques that fail to detect very early responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of immunotherapy, the early anatomical readout is often discordant with the biological response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study describes a self-reporting nanomedicine that not only delivers chemotherapy or immunotherapy to the tumor but also reports back on its efficacy in real time, thereby identifying responders and nonresponders early on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ability to monitor the efficacy of an anticancer treatment in real time can have a critical effect on the outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, clinical readouts of efficacy rely on indirect or anatomic measurements, which occur over prolonged time scales postchemotherapy or postimmunotherapy and may not be concordant with the actual effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the biology-inspired engineering of a simple 2-in-1 reporter nanoparticle that not only delivers a cytotoxic or an immunotherapy payload to the tumor but also reports back on the efficacy in real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter nanoparticles are engineered from a novel two-staged stimuli-responsive polymeric material with an optimal ratio of an enzyme-cleavable drug or immunotherapy (effector elements) and a drug function-activatable reporter element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatiotemporally constrained delivery of the effector and the reporter elements in a single nanoparticle produces maximum signal enhancement due to the availability of the reporter element in the same cell as the drug, thereby effectively capturing the temporal apoptosis process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant tumors in vivo, we show that the reporter nanoparticles can provide a real-time noninvasive readout of tumor response to chemotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter nanoparticle can also monitor the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition in melanoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The self-reporting capability, for the first time to our knowledge, captures an anticancer nanoparticle in action in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Schematic showing construct of a reporter nanoparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter nanoparticle comprises three components: a polymeric backbone, an esterase-cleavable prodrug synthesized from an anticancer drug [effector element (EE)], and an activatable reporter element (RE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the optimal ratio of EE:RE, this stimuli-responsive polymer self-assembles into a nanoparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter element is a caspase-3cleavable sequence consisting of l-amino acids GKDEVDAPC-CONH2 to which we conjugated a FRET pair such that cleavage of the DEVD sequence results in removal of the quenching of the fluorescent signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effector element is conjugated to the polymeric backbone via an esterase-cleavable bond, whereas the reporter element is conjugated via an amide bond with the Gly residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In normal condition, the fluorescent signal from the reporter element is in the off state because the drug is intact inside the nanoparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanoparticles home in to the tumor via the EPR effect, where the nanoparticle is internalized by cancer cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a drug-sensitive cell (lower right of schematic), the released drug initiates apoptosis via the activation of caspase-3 enzyme, which then cleaves the DEVD peptide, unquenching the fluorescent signal (on state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in a nonresponder cell (lower left), the failure of the released drug to induce apoptosis means the reporter element remains in the off state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distinction between off and on states allows the visualization of a nanoparticle in action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

It is well established that downstream apoptotic responses determine therapeutic outcomes (30, 31), and apoptosis defects can contribute to drug resistance (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the ligation of PD-L1 on cancer cells by immune checkpoint inhibitors was shown to induce apoptosis (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways converge into caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, which are known to cleave precise substrates (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the activation of caspases has been extensively used to monitor cell death (3537).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We rationalized that the pathophysiological caspase activation in a drug-responsive tumor following the release of the cytotoxic effector could be used to trigger the cleavage of a quenched dye in the design of the reporter nanoparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent increase in the signal readout could serve as a direct real-time quantification of chemotherapy or immunotherapy efficacy (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a proof of concept, we used paclitaxel, a well-established cytotoxic chemotherapy agent that activates caspase (38), as the effector element, whereas the reporter element was designed using a short peptide containing a caspase-3cleavable Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD) sequence inserted between either the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair of 5-FAM (visible-range fluorophore) and QSY-7 (quencher) or the pair of DyLight 755 (near-infrared fluorophore) and DyLight 766Q (quencher), where the latter pair enabled in vivo imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, previous studies have shown that caspase-based cleavage of the peptide bond can be used to activate fluorescence in self-quenched systems (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used poly(isobutylene-alt-maleic anhydride) (PIMA), a low-molecular weight (6 kDa) polymer, as the template to engineer the stimuli-responsive material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIMA contains reactive anhydride functional groups that can be easily conjugated to a wide range of drugs and other reactive moieties under mild reaction conditions and can be used for conjugating more than one agent for multiplexing studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we reported that the coordination complex between platinum (II) and PIMA could enable the self-assembly into nanostructures that exhibited greater antitumor efficacy with reduced systemic toxicity compared with cisplatin (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first synthesized the FRET pair-based reporter element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The near-infrared (NIR) FRET pair of fluorophore, DyLight 755, and quencher, DyLight 766Q, was chosen for fabricating the reporter element for several reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, Dylight 755 NIR fluorescent dye belongs to the polymethine carbocyanine family of dyes, and Dylight 766Q belongs to benzopyrillium-based quencher dyes, which have been widely used for their excellent spectral properties and biocompatibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, for efficient in vivo imaging using an activatable probe for monitoring enzymatic activity, it is highly desirable to maximize signal-to-noise ratio by having no background fluorescence before and maximal fluorescence signal after activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we used a nonfluorescent quencher, which will not have any interference post-enzymatic activation of the reporter element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, excellent spectral overlap of donor fluorescence (emission maxima 776 nm) and quencher absorbance (max 766 nm) ensured maximum quenching efficiency at 1:1 donor:acceptor ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the dyes have reactive functional groups that can be used for easy conjugation to amino acids using different bioconjugation techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, an optimum peptide length was used to conjugate the FRET pair for maximum FRET efficiency (90%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorophore and the quencher were conjugated to the caspase substrate using maleimide and amide conjugation, respectively, on either side of DEVD peptide (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we synthesized a reporter element using another FRET pair consisting of a green fluorescent dye (5-FAM) and quencher QSY-7, where the quenching efficiency was 94.7% (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzymatic susceptibility of the reporter element was examined by incubating the reporter element with recombinant active caspase-3 enzyme at 37 °C and monitoring the time-dependent fluorescence activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2A, a sustained increase in the fluorescence intensity was observed with time, indicating cleavage of the peptide by the enzyme, resulting in a 31-fold increase in fluorescence intensity achieved after 4 h of incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caspases are typically classified as initiators (caspase-8 and caspase-10 belonging to the extrinsic pathway and caspase-9 belonging to the intrinsic pathway) and effectors (caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7), with the initiators converging into the effectors for an apoptotic outcome (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, the effectors have been shown to recognize the DEVD motif (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the selectivity of different caspases for the reporter element, we incubated the reporter element with recombinant caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7, and caspase-9 and measured the NIR fluorescence intensity at different time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2B, caspase-3 induced the highest activation rate and preferential cleavage over caspase-7, whereas caspase-6 and caspase-9 exhibited very low activation rates, consistent with the earlier observations (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained in the case of the 5-FAM-QSY-7based FRET pair-conjugated reporter element when incubated with caspase-3 enzyme, supporting the applicability of the reporter element platform for a series of FRET pairs with a broad emission range from green to NIR (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next synthesized the effector element by selectively conjugating a linker, 4-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]-4-oxobutanoic acid at the more reactive C-2 OH group on the isoserine moiety of the C-13 side chain of paclitaxel (Fig S3 AE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although modification of the C2 alcohol of paclitaxel is known to result in considerable loss of activity (45, 46), the use of an appropriate cleavable linker meant that the construct could be activated in the tumor cells as a result of esterase enzymatic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the flexible linker of moderate length (1 nm) was chosen so that maximum number of effector elements could be conjugated to the polymer backbone by minimizing steric hindrance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then optimized the number of effector element molecules complexed to PIMA by studying the effect of varying polymer to effector element molar ratios on the size and stability of the self-assembled nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S3F, dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed that increasing the number of effector elements per polymer resulted in larger-size nanoparticles with a broad size distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At an effector element to polymer ratio of 15:1, we obtained uniform nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 170 ± 18 nm (Fig S3 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well established that nanoparticles in this size range preferentially accumulate into tumors through the leaky vasculature via an enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, thereby enhancing anticancer effect and reducing off-target toxicities (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fabricating_a_Reporter_Nanoparticle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next studied the effect of varying the ratio of effector and reporter elements in the polymer construct on the nanoparticle self-assembly, while keeping the previously optimized polymer to responsive elements ratio of 1:15 constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2C, a higher effector element to reporter element ratio resulted in nanoparticles of smaller average size but with high polydispersity index, which were stable for less than 24 h at 4 °C (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanoparticles of uniform size 186.8 ± 7.3 nm (hydrodynamic diameter) and desired stability were obtained at an optimal effector element and reporter element ratio of 14.5:0.5 per polymer (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution transmission electron microscopy showed nanostructures of average particle size 100 nm (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The zeta potential of nanoparticles at pH 7.4 was measured to be 41.5 mV (Fig 2E), corresponding to high colloidal stability of the reporter nanoparticles over time (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The zeta potential of the nanoparticle was found to switch toward a more positive charge with decreasing pH (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next studied the release of paclitaxel from the nanoparticle as a function of pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2H, drug release was accelerated under acidic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reporter nanoparticles engineered from a 5-FAM-QSY-7based reporter element with optimized polymer to reporter element ratio of 1:13.5 exhibited similar characteristics (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vitro_Characterization_of_Reporter_Nanoparticle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluated the in vitro efficacy of reporter nanoparticles using multiple cancer cell lines, including breast (4T1 and MDA-MB-231), ovarian (4306), and lung (LLC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3A, the nanoparticles induced tumor cell kill across all of the cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 217.6 ± 5.8 to 517.0 ± 4.2 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the potency of reporter nanoparticles at 48 h postincubation was lower compared with paclitaxel, we observed an increase in potency, i.e., shift of concentrationresponse curve to the left, with time (Fig 3B), consistent with the temporal release of paclitaxel in the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the possibility of using the reporter nanoparticles for temporal imaging of drug efficacy, we incubated cancer cells with different concentrations of reporter nanoparticles and monitored the change in fluorescence intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3C, a concentration- and time-dependent increase in the fluorescence signal was observed, which correlated with the reduction in cell viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monitoring the internalization of FAM-tagged nanoparticles into the cancer cells revealed a temporal uptake of the nanoparticles via the endolysosomal pathway (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a robust overlap between the signal from the reporter (FAM-QSY7) nanoparticle and cytoplasmic active caspase-3 was noted, suggesting that the nanoparticles can escape the lysosomal compartment and the released taxane could activate the apoptotic machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with previous reports where nanoparticles that switch their zeta potential from negative to positive, as observed in the current study, were shown to escape the endolysosomal compartment (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, minimal caspase-3 and FAM signal was evident in the case of control nanoparticles that lacked an effector element, which validated that the signal observed in the case of reporter nanoparticles originates as a function of drug-induced activation of caspase-3 leading to apoptosis (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Efficiency_of_Reporter_Nanoparticles_in_a_3D_in_Vitro_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies have shown that in vitro 3D culture systems better mimic in vivo tumor microenvironment compared with 2D monolayer cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such systems model drug penetration and also conserve distinct signaling mechanisms that can influence the response to drug treatment (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore treated paclitaxel-sensitive DU-145 and paclitaxel-resistant DU-145TR prostate cancer cell-derived 3D spheroids with reporter nanoparticles (at 20 M paclitaxel equivalent) for 24 h. Z-stack reconstruction and images for DU145 spheroids showed activation of fluorescence signal even at a depth of 70 m, indicating that the nanoparticles can penetrate into the core and induce cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, minimal signal was observed from DU-145TR spheroids, indicating that the reporter nanoparticle could distinguish between sensitive and resistant tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of any signal from the resistant spheroids further validated the absence of nonspecific activation of the reporter element (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reporter_Nanoparticles_Enable_an_Early_Efficacy_Readout_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate if reporter nanoparticles enable the monitoring of drug response in real time in vivo, we injected multiple doses of reporter nanoparticles engineered with the NIR (Dylight)-based reporter element into 4T1 breast cancer-bearing mice and imaged the animals at different time points between the treatments (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4 BD, control nanoparticles, which carried the same dose of the reporter element but no paclitaxel, exhibited baseline fluorescence inside the tumor, demonstrating that nonspecific activation of the reporter element in the tumor microenvironment was minimal and that the construct did not exhibit any toxicity to cancer cells in the absence of the cytotoxic drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of reporter nanoparticles, a significant increase in the fluorescent signal was observed as early as 8 h, but not at 4 h, after the first dose compared with control nanoparticles (Fig 4C and Fig S6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a reduction in the signal was evident at 24 h postadministration, subsequent injections of the reporter nanoparticles enhanced the signal, indicating a direct correlation with the presence of the drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detectable signal was observed even after 4 d of the last treatment, which supported the hypothesis that sustained drug release from nanoparticles can induce a prolonged apoptotic effect (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, it was only by day 6 that a statistically significant separation of the tumor growth curves (anatomical quantification) between the reporter nanoparticles-treated and control nanoparticles-treated group was evident (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In earlier studies, quenched fluorescent caspase substrate-based tracers have been used to detect apoptosis in vivo (37, 51, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As controls, we therefore included a separate group, where the animals were treated with a combination of free paclitaxel and the reporter element at a similar dose level to that in the reporter nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another group, the animals were treated with a combination of an effector nanoparticle (nanoparticle with only paclitaxel) and the reporter element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both these control groups, fluorescence signal amplification was not detected in tumors in vivo or ex vivo (Fig 4F and Fig S6 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further investigated if [18F]FDG-PET/CT imaging could similarly detect the early treatment response as achieved using the reporter nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well established that a decrease in FDG uptake on PET correlates with a progression-free survival (7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We treated animals with control nanoparticles (no effector element) or with reporter nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as shown in Fig 4 G and H and Fig S6 C and D, we did not observe any reduction in the standard uptake value (SUV) or [18F]FDG uptake in tumor at 12 h or 48 h posttreatment between control nanoparticles- and reporter nanoparticles-treated groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar results were observed when 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were treated with FAM-QSY7based reporter nanoparticles, where ex vivo immunofluorescence imaging of tumor sections validated that the increase in antitumor efficacy correlated with an increase in caspase-3 activation and apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were consistent in a Lewis lung carcinoma model, although in this model, the tumor growth curves in the reporter nanoparticles- and control nanoparticles-treated groups started showing significant differences as early as after the second dose, consistent with the greater susceptibility of LLCs to the effector compared with 4T1s seen in vitro (Fig S6 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reporter_Nanoparticles_Enable_Distinction_Between_Resistant_and_Sensitive_Tumors_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, to test if reporter nanoparticles could be used to distinguish between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumors in mice early on during chemotherapy, we used a dual human tumor xenograft model, where paclitaxel-sensitive (DU-145) and paclitaxel-resistant (DU-145TR) prostate cancer cells were implanted in the opposite flanks of the same mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animals were injected with two doses of reporter NPs (dose equivalent to 15 mg/kg of paclitaxel) via the tail vein and imaged as previously described (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5 BD, the sensitive tumor showed 400% increase in fluorescence activation compared with resistant tumor, which was detected as early as 12 h after the first treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, immunolabeling the tumor sections for cleaved caspase-3 confirmed that the mechanism of action of the reporter nanoparticle efficacy and fluorescent signal in sensitive tumor is due to drug-mediated caspase activation (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a separate experiment, we studied the biodistribution of the reporter nanoparticles in tumor-bearing mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5F, we observed a preferential accumulation of the nanoparticles in the tumor, consistent with the notion that nanoparticles can home in to tumors through an EPR effect (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed significant concentrations in the liver and the kidney, which could indicate clearance routes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the cutoff for glomerular clearance of nanoparticles is 5 nm (54), indicating that the reporter nanoparticles likely break down into smaller fractions in circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed minimal accumulation in the major reticuloendothelial organs (RES), including lungs or spleen, consistent with the large hydrodynamic radii as opposed to the actual electron microscopy measurements, which means that the nanoparticles are masked from the RES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reporter_Nanoparticles_Can_Be_Extended_to_Monitoring_Immunotherapy_Efficacy_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next studied whether the reporter nanoparticle can be adapted to immunotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To engineer a reporter nanoparticle that acts as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, we first derivatized PIMA with different ratio of carboxy-PEG8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S7 A and B, at an optimal ratio of 1:10, i.e., 10 PEG8s per molecule of PIMA, we obtained defined nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 231 ± 22 nm, whereas higher or lower ratios resulted in particles of larger size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the 10:1 PEG to polymer ratio, we next conjugated the reporter element to PIMA, such that the ratio of PIMA:PEG8:reporter element was 1:9:1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibody against PD-L1 was then conjugated to the PEG, resulting in nanoparticles that had a hydrodynamic diameter of 242 ± 37 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A control IgG-conjugated reporter nanoparticle was similarly engineered and was found to be similar in dimension as the anti-PD-L1-reporter nanoparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the bioconjugation conserves the binding of the antibody to PD-L1, we first treated the B16/F10 melanoma cells with IFN for 48 h, which resulted in an overexpression of PD-L1 compared with controls, as quantified using flow cytometry (Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells were then incubated with FAM-labeled reporter nanoparticles conjugated with either antiPD-L1 antibody or control IgG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig S7D, the antiPD-L1-reporter nanoparticle was found to bind to the cells to a greater degree compared with the controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having established the binding in vitro, we next tested whether the antiPD-L1 reporter nanoparticles enabled the monitoring of drug response in real time in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 6 A and B, compared with the IgG-control reporter nanoparticles, a significant increase in the fluorescent signal was observed by day 5 in the antiPD-L1 reporter nanoparticles-treated group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the indirect mechanisms of induction of cell death following treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Western blotting revealed an increased caspase activation in the cells isolated from the antiPD-L1 reporter nanoparticles-treated tumor as opposed to the control group (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, quantifying CD44Hi CD62LLo CD8+ve cells in the tumor revealed that the treatment with antiPD-L1 reporter nanoparticles indeed enhanced activated T cell infiltration by 200% compared with IgG-reporter nanoparticles (Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further investigated if [18F] FDG-PET or CT imaging could similarly detect the early treatment response as achieved using the reporter nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as shown in Fig 6 E and F, we did not observe any reduction in the SUV or [18F]FDG uptake in tumor even at 7 d posttreatment between control nanoparticles and reporter nanoparticles-treated groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The quest for precision medicine is being driven by the development of new technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the development of a reporter nanoparticle technology platform, which can preferentially deliver an anticancer treatment to the tumor and then monitor its antitumor activity in real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a technology can potentially advance precision medicine by helping identify the responders and nonresponders early on while minimizing adverse effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the current study builds on the recent developments in theranostics, i.e., nanomaterials comprising of a cytotoxic payload and additionally tagged with a tracer allowed the spatial visualization of nanoparticles in vivo (56, 57), such first-generation theranostic nanoparticles did not report on the efficacy of the nanoparticle-based treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The always on signal meant that these theranostic nanoparticles could not discriminate between a drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the response-activatable aspect of the reporter nanoparticle is designed to monitor the efficacy of the nanoparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our results show that the reporter nanoparticles can distinguish between a drug-sensitive and a resistant tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we observed a greater tumor growth inhibition in vivo with the reporter nanoparticle as opposed to free paclitaxel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a greater immunotherapy biomarker response in terms of TILs was observed with the PDL1-reporter nanoparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that cancer nanomedicines preferentially home in to tumors and as a result exert enhanced antitumor efficacy (53, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the findings from our biodistribution studies are consistent with these previous reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results demonstrated that an anatomical readout of chemotherapy efficacy, i.e., changes in tumor volume, temporally lagged the quantification of apoptosis as a measure of efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reliance on the anatomical readout alone would have meant that several doses of the therapy would have been administered before we could detect the nonresponder status of a tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we observed that the current clinically used techniques for monitoring efficacy, such as FDG-PET or CT, are of limited use in the acute temporal setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some of the animals we actually noted a transient increase in FDG uptake, consistent with the flare response seen at the onset of chemotherapy as a result of increased glucose uptake by inflammatory cells and/or energy demand of the apoptosis process (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, recent studies have indicated that the oncogene activation status can regulate the internalization of [18F]FDG (60), which can further confound the results with such imaging techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The development of noninvasive molecular imaging techniques to detect apoptosis as a direct readout of chemotherapy activity is thus increasingly gaining momentum, stemming from the limitations of the current technologies in monitoring of early tumor response (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, annexin V-conjugated tracers have been used to detect the exposed phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane during apoptosis (62, 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, probes have been developed that can monitor caspase activity (35, 6466).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a caspase-3binding radiotracer, [18F]ICMT-11, was recently used to study the induction of apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, a cell-penetrating TcapQ was recently developed to improve the pharmacokinetic properties and improve delivery of FRET-based caspase probes (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, nanoparticles have been used to detect caspase activity (69, 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Separately, nanoparticles have been used previously to deliver paclitaxel or other cytotoxic agents (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, results from the current study indicate that a simple combination of two nanoparticles, one that delivers the drug and the other to detect caspase activity, is not sufficient to monitor anticancer efficacy in real time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could potentially arise from the fact that the dynamics of apoptosis varies between the type and mechanism of action of anticancer agents and regimens and between patients, and thus, dosing the chemotherapy and the probes in the wrong temporal windows could result in erroneous conclusions about drug efficacy (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it is possible that such an asynchrony existed when the reporter element was coadministered separately with paclitaxel or a paclitaxel nanoparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, in a tumor treated with such a combination, the possibility of any cell being loaded with both elements administered separately remains a stochastic process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although drug-induced caspase activation is a time-sensitive process, theoretically, constraining the effector and the reporter elements in a single nanostructure ensures that the reporter element is in the same cell to capture the apoptotic process initiated by the effector and thereby achieve maximal detection efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A significant finding was the possibility of using a reporter nanoparticle to deliver and monitor the efficacy of an immune checkpoint inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major concern in immunotherapy is the systemic toxicity as a result of global activation of the immune system (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility of harnessing a nanoparticle to deliver an immunotherapeutic agent can potentially address this concern given the ability of the nanoparticle to preferentially home to the tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although future studies are necessary to better elucidate this therapeutic opportunity, we did observe that the reporter nanoparticle comprising a PD-L1 inhibitor-based effector element did mount an immunogenic response in the tumor and also bound to a greater degree on the cancer cells overexpressing PD-L1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we focused on monitoring the efficacy of the delivered immune checkpoint inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the current challenges of imaging the efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer, we observed no differences in the baseline PET/CT signal and the signal from the treated groups even at day 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the reporter nanoparticle was able to detect the efficacy signal, although it should be noted that the detection was delayed compared with the chemotherapy-induced response, which highlights the temporal differences between the two treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate that a reporter nanoparticle might emerge as a powerful technology in cancer immunotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Much of the recent advances in nanomedicines are being enabled by the development of novel stimuli-responsive materials (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our results indicate that the stimuli-responsive polymer-based reporter nanoparticles can efficiently deliver a chemotherapeutic agent or an immune checkpoint inhibitor to a cancer cell and capture the resulting spatiotemporal apoptotic event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of the reporter nanoparticles to directly monitor kinetics of the drug-induced apoptosis process in real time, with detectable response at acute time points where current gold standards such as [18F]FDG PET/CT imaging are of limited use, indicates that the reporter nanoparticles not only can enable an early readout of chemotherapy efficacy but also will be useful in monitoring emerging treatment modalities such as immunotherapy, which are associated with stromal alterations resulting in discordant metabolic flux and anatomical changes (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A limitation of the current approach is the use of fluorescence-based detection; for clinical translation it will be necessary to design caged radiocontrast dyes that are activated by the response of the cancer cell to the effector element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the emerging scenario of intrinsic and adaptive resistance, the ability of the reporter nanoparticles to monitor the efficacy of therapy in real time can have a major effect in the management of cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
