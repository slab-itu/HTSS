In situ characterization of cofacial Co(IV) centers in Co4O4 cubane: Modeling the high-valent active site in oxygen-evolving catalysts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Co-OEC (oxygen-evolving catalyst) is an exemplary OEC that has provided a wealth of kinetics information on the proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism of OO bond formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas electrochemical kinetics studies establish a high-valent Co(IV)2 oxidation state as a prerequisite for catalysis, this species cannot be spectroscopically examined in thin-film Co-OECs owing to its short lifetime and dilution against a largely Co(III) background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A molecular model of this high-valent active species is provisioned in the form of a doubly oxidized Co(III)2(IV)2 cubane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic examination of this high-valent state of the cubane provides direct insights into the electronic structure of a Co(IV)2 site and into its role in the mechanism of OO bond formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Co4O4 cubane is a representative structural model of oxidic cobalt oxygen-evolving catalysts (Co-OECs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Co-OECs are active when residing at two oxidation levels above an all-Co(III) resting state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This doubly oxidized Co(IV)2 state may be captured in a Co(III)2(IV)2 cubane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the Co(III)2(IV)2 cubane may be electrochemically generated and the electronic properties of this unique high-valent state may be probed by in situ spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intervalence charge-transfer (IVCT) bands in the near-IR are observed for the Co(III)2(IV)2 cubane, and spectroscopic analysis together with electrochemical kinetics measurements reveal a larger reorganization energy and a smaller electron transfer rate constant for the doubly versus singly oxidized cubane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectroelectrochemical X-ray absorption data further reveal systematic spectral changes with successive oxidations from the cubane resting state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electronic structure calculations correlated to experimental data suggest that this state is best represented as a localized, antiferromagnetically coupled Co(IV)2 dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exchange coupling in the cofacial Co(IV)2 site allows for parallels to be drawn between the electronic structure of the Co4O4 cubane model system and the high-valent active site of the Co-OEC, with specific emphasis on the manifestation of a doubly oxidized Co(IV)2 center on OO bond formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cofacial Co(IV)2 sites in Co-OEC are modeled by a Co4O4 cubane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electrochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 2A shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) of cubane 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two reversible waves at E0(1) = 0.30 and E0(2) = 1.45 V vs. Fc+/0 (all potentials are referenced to ferrocene unless otherwise noted) are observed, corresponding to the Co(III)3(IV)(1b)/Co(III)4(1a) and Co(III)2(IV)2(1c)/Co(III)3(IV)(1b) reduction processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these potentials, a comproportionation constant of KC = 3.05 Ã— 1019 is calculated (details in SI Appendix) for the equilibrium Co(III)4 + Co(III)2(IV)2  2Co(III)3(IV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This large KC is consistent with the ability to chemically isolate 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scan rate dependence of the CV of Fig 2A allows for the determination of the electron transfer (ET) kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 B and C are trumpet plots of the experimental CV peak splitting with scan rate (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterogeneous ET rate constant ks = 0.110 and 0.050 cm/s for the first and second oxidations, respectively, may be extracted from simulations of the CVs using DigiElch (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fits of the trumpet plots using these kss are shown by the solid lines in Fig 2 B and C. The difference in rate constants for the two oxidation processes originates from the reorganization energy, , comprising inner- (i) and outer-sphere (o) components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total , ascertained from ks (SI Appendix) (36), is  = 1.00 and 1.08 eV for the oxidation of 1a and 1b, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Spectroelectrochemistry was used to probe the in situ stability of the electrochemically generated doubly oxidized 1c, as the high standard reduction potential of 1c precludes its chemical isolation (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3A shows the spectral changes accompanying the oxidation of 1a to 1b by a constant potential electrolysis (CPE) performed at 0.80 V. The prominent absorption feature of 1a at 364 nm decreases and a broad increase in absorbance from 400 to 800 nm is observed over the course of oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectrum of 1b was stable under applied potential and isosbestic points are maintained for the conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPE at 1.8 V resulted in the further oxidation of 1b to 1c, indicated by a broad growth in absorbance across the entire visible region (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of applied potential, the spectrum of the 1c reverts to 1a over 30 min (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Isolated samples of 1b exhibit an intervalence charge-transfer (IVCT) band at 4,580 cm1 (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This near-infrared (NIR) absorption is reproduced in the spectroelectrochemical oxidation of 1a to 1b, as shown in Fig 3C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An IVCT transition is maintained upon the oxidation of 1b to 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IVCT of the in situ, electrochemically generated 1b is slightly shifted from that of the chemically oxidized species previously reported (30), which may be due to ion pairing effects from electrolyte ions, the presence of trace water in the in situ experiment, incomplete conversion of species within the spectral window, or electric field effects from the Pt flag working electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference does not preclude a direct comparison between 1b and 1c generated under the same conditions in situ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 1 lists the max and full width at half maximum, 1/2, for 1b and 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IVCT of 1c is blue-shifted and has a higher extinction coefficient than that of 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IVCT transitions were modeled with Gaussian profiles (SI Appendix, Fig S2), and Hush analysis (3840) permits calculation (SI Appendix) of the intramolecular charge-transfer parameters listed in Table 1: Hab, the electronic coupling matrix element between metal centers; , the reorganization energy associated with intramolecular ET; G*, the thermal barrier to intramolecular ET; and kET, the rate constant of intramolecular ET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the  determined by IVCT analysis is for a self-exchange ET reaction between CoIII and CoIV centers in 1b and 1c ( = 0.7 eV), whereas the  determined by CV analysis is for the heterogeneous ET reaction describing the one-electron oxidation of CoIII to CoIV in 1a and 1b ( = 1.0 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in max for 1c compared with 1b is evidence for an increased  accompanying double oxidation of the cubane as supported by DFT calculations (vide infra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kETs are on the order of 1012 s1, consistent with Co(IV) in 1b appearing delocalized by electron paramagnetic resonance (timescale of 109 s) (21) and localized by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (timescale of 1015 s) (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this result, the spectroscopy of the oxidized cubanes is consistent with RobinDay class II mixed valency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values of the parameter  (= 1  (1/2/1/20)), where 1/20 is the theoretical bandwidth determined from max (SI Appendix, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8) between 0 and 0.5, are class II mixed valent, as observed for 1b and 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the Gaussian fits are partially complicated by the solvent background; however, the fits reported here represent upper bounds on  and thus fully support class II behavior and unambiguously rule out class II/III or III behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

X-Ray_Absorption_Spectroscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stability of 1b and 1c in spectroelectrochemical experiments allowed their electronic structure to be probed by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 3D-printable X-ray spectroelectrochemical cell was designed and constructed, the details of which will be provided elsewhere (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously reported the Co K-edge XAS data for powdered samples of 1a and 1b, obtained by chemical oxidation of 1a with cerium ammonium nitrate (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Co K-edge XAS data for solutions of 1a and in situ electrogenerated 1b are comparable to those of the powdered samples (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ Co K-edge spectra for 1a1c are reproduced in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All spectra show clear edge and preedge features that shift with each subsequent oxidation of the cubane core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preedge intensity systematically decreases with oxidation (black arrow in the inset), whereas the edge shifts to higher energy upon oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the position of the blue arrow in Fig 4, the edge shifts by 0.3 eV from 1a to 1b and by 0.4 eV from 1b to 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure on the rising edge and at the white line, which can include multiple scattering effects, can partially obscure edge shifts in this region of the spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure is highlighted by first derivative plots of the XAS data given in SI Appendix, Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon formation of 1c, an additional feature is observed at 7716.5 eV, roughly 7 eV above the preedge (red arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

DFT_Calculations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Broken symmetry (BS) DFT calculations were performed to probe the ground-state electronic structure of 1c (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Co4O4(py)4(OAc)4 doubly oxidized cubane was examined with the generalized-gradient approximation functional composed of the Becke 1988 exchange functional and the Perdew 86 correlation functional (BP86) with 15% HartreeFock (HF) exchange [B(15HF)P86], which we have previously shown is required to reproduce a localized ground state by partially eliminating the self-interaction error present in pure functionals (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Co(III)2(IV)2 cubane was observed to converge; double oxidation of a single site to produce a Co(III)3(V) did not converge within the symmetric cubane ligand set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two possible configurations of 1c are labeled cis-py (2.85 Ã… CoCo) and cis-OAc (2.72 Ã… CoCo), where the Co(IV)2 dimer can have either two pyridine or two acetate axial ligands, respectively (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-point calculations give the lowest energy state as a cis-py, localized, antiferromagnetically coupled BS singlet state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energies of the singlet and triplet states are summarized in Fig 5B for the two configurations, and Mulliken spin densities and population analyses for the /-LUMOs (lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals) of the singlet states are given in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases this analysis supports metal-based oxidation, with largely metal-based hole character and covalent interaction with the oxo ligands and small contributions from pyridine nitrogens and acetate oxygens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The /-LUMOs of this Co(IV)2 site are given in Fig 5A (Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cis-py Co(IV)2 triplet is 0.9 kcal/mol higher in energy than the BS singlet state (J  340 cm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BS singlet state can also be formed in the cis-OAc Co(IV)2 dimer, and is 0.4 kcal/mol higher in energy than the cis-py BS state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The /-LUMOs of the cis-OAc Co(IV)2 site are given in Fig 5A (Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cis-OAc Co(IV)2, the BS singlet state (J  19 cm1) is nearly isoenergetic with the triplet (E 0.05 kcal/mol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of an experimental measure of J, these results are qualitative; nonetheless, the lowest-energy states of cis-OAc and cis-py are both predicted to be localized, antiferromagnetically coupled Co(IV)2 sites, with the cis-py singlet being slightly lower in energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of J varies between the two Co(IV)2 sites ( 340 vs. 19 cm1 for cis-py or cis-OAc, respectively) and thus computation predicts that they are thermally accessible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given their STot = 0 energies are calculated to be only 0.4 kcal/mol different in energy, the singlet states of the two configurations are in thermal equilibrium as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental and computational studies of Co-OEC (19, 23, 24, 42, 43) point to a cofacial oxo-bridged Co(IV)2 site (Fig 1) as a highly active species poised for turnover-limiting OO bond formation (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electronic properties of this highly active binuclear Co(IV)2 site are undefined, as its low concentration in the active catalyst precludes its characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, a doubly oxidized Co4O4 cubane (1c) serves as a competent structural and electronic model of this active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrochemical studies establish the successive oxidation of Co(III)4 to Co(III)2(IV)2 (Fig 2), which is supported by XAS data (Fig 4) showing the presence of a cubane species at a higher Co valency than the known Co(III)3(IV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A feature 7 eV above the preedge is unique to the Co(IV)2 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Important electronic structure characteristics of interest pertaining to the Co(IV)2 site include (i) whether the Co(IV)s are localized or delocalized, (ii) the nature of the electronic and exchange coupling between the two Co(IV) centers, and the interplay of these two factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The presence of Co(IV) and Co(III) centers within the cubane core is indicated by IVCT transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With  = 0.07, the IVCT band of 1c indicates that, like 1b, it is a class II MV species with localized Co(IV) centers, and the rate constants determined from Hush analysis (Table 1) of the IVCT transitions for 1b and 1c establish fast intramolecular Co(IV/III) self-exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An analysis of the difference in  between 1b and 1c reveals information about the nature of localization of electron holes in 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of ks and the IVCT bands indicate (1c)  (1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is further supported by DFT analysis of the inner-sphere reorganization (i) energy of the cubanes upon ET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the single-electron oxidation of 1a to 1b, i(1b) = a + b, (a = E(1b)(1a)  E(1b)(1b) and b = E(1a)(1b)  E(1a)(1a)), where E(1)(2) (1 designates position 1 and 2 designates position 2) refers to the calculated energy of a molecule in the geometry of (2) and oxidation state of (1) (44, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, i(1c) may be determined for the single-electron oxidation of 1b to 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the B(15HF)P86 functional, i(1b) 0.26 eV is obtained using the asymmetrically distorted, localized DFT structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, using the symmetrically distorted, delocalized DFT structure, i(1b) 0.14 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This decrease in i for valence delocalization is observed in class II vs. III binuclear sites (46) and can be understood fromi=kdisn(r)2,[2]where kdis is the force constant of the distortion coordinate, n is the number of distorting bonds, and r is the magnitude of bond distortion upon oxidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing a valence-localized dimer with a valence-delocalized dimer, n is expected to be halved whereas r is expected to be doubled (nmon/ndim  0.5 and rmon/rdim  2), so i should be roughly twice as large for a localized oxidation process, assuming similar force constants (4648).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DFT calculated values of i(1b) are in agreement with this prediction, with a reorganization energy for a charge-localized cubane twice that of a charge-delocalized cubane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, delocalization of charge would not be expected to show a difference in i for Co(IV)s residing on different faces of 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, localized i(1c-py) for the cis-py Co(IV)2 site is 0.28 eV akin to i(1b) (0.26 eV), whereas localized i(1c-OAc) for the cis-OAc site is 0.39 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase of i(1c-OAc) by 0.13 eV over i(1b) is consistent with the experimentally measured increase of  = 0.07 eV for 1c compared with 1b deduced from IVCT (Table 1) and  = 0.08 eV deduced from CV kinetics measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding of localization by DFT is consistent with the outcome of class II IVCT behavior of 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Localization in 1c may result from direct Co(IV)Co(IV) interactions in the form of antiferromagnetic exchange coupling, which can oppose electronhole delocalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exchange coupling of Co(IV) centers in a tetragonal field arises from electrons residing in the t2g derived orbitals, and it may be described by the HeisenbergDiracvan Vleck Hamiltonian,H^=2JSASB,[3]ESTot=J[STot(STot+1)SA(SA+1)SB(SB+1)],[4]where J is the exchange coupling constant, and the total energy, ESTot, depends on the total spin state, STot = 0 for the singlet ground state and STot = 1 for the triplet, which is at an energy 2J above the ground state (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BS DFT calculations favor antiferromagnetic exchange in 1c, with J  340 cm1 for the cis-py Co(IV)2 isomer of 1c and J  19 cm1 for cis-OAc Co(IV)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The order of magnitude difference in the exchange coupling for cis-py Co(IV)2 and cis-OAc Co(IV)2 is consistent with structurally unique binuclear Co(IV)2 sites on the faces of the cubane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the CoCo distances of 2.85 and 2.72 Ã… for cis-py and cis-OAc isomers, respectively, might suggest a larger J for the latter, the stereoelectronic disposition of the t2g orbitals must be considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cis-py, the two Co(IV) MOs point directly into the center of the diamond core (Fig 5, Left), maximizing metalmetal overlap and thus promoting strong antiferromagnetic exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the different ligand field environment for cis-OAc, the two Co(IV) MOs are rotated out of the Co(IV)2 diamond core and are directed toward the Co-oxo bonds (Fig 5, Right), which minimizes metalmetal overlap, mitigating antiferromagnetic exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in exchange coupling for cis-py and cis-OAc suggests that the ligand field in Co-OEC may result in different exchange interactions than present in Co4O4; however, the oxo-bridged environment in Co-OEC will likely still favor antiferromagnetic coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  J is directly related to the electronic coupling matrix element for ET (Hab) (50, 51):2J=Hab2U,[5]where U is the MottHubbard value reflecting intraatomic Coulomb and exchange energies for ET [i.e., Co(IV)Co(IV)  Co(III)Co(V)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note Hab in this expression is divided by 2 to account for the reduction of symmetry upon one electron reduction of a binuclear site (50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expression should be treated qualitatively here, as it is typically used for an authentic dimer, and not a dimer within a tetramer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the calculated Js and a U of 5.5 eV, gives Habs of 2,950 and 700 cm1 for the cis-py and cis-OAc isomers, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Antiferromagnetic coupling of cofacial Co(IV)2 sites will facilitate OO bond formation at neighboring metal centers of oxidic cobalt OER catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such exchange coupling provides a mechanism for charge localization within cubanes, as shown here, and by analogy within the metalate clusters of Co-OEC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotope labeling studies of oxidic cobalt OER catalysts (23, 24) and computational mechanistic studies of Co-OECs (42, 43), together with model studies of dicobalt complexes (23), indicate that OO bond formation requires an adjacent Co(IV)2 active edge site; it is necessary that two Co(IV) centers localize to the edge site of a cobaltate cluster preceding turnover, as opposed to hole equivalents delocalized over the cluster active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we show here, antiferromagnetic coupling provides a mechanism to drive hole localization within the cluster core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, exchange coupling offers an adiabatic reaction pathway for OO bond coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given an edge site CoCo distance in Co-OEC of 2.82 Ã… from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (20), the through-space coupling separation is likely similar (i.e., 2.82.85 Ã…).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 6, the exchange-coupled singlet at the metal center may be conveyed to the terminal oxos to form oxyl radicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reaction pathway is important within the context of the oxo wall (52), which states that a Co(IV)oxo (Co(IV)O) will possess significant Co(III)O resonance character.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antiferromagnetic coupling may drive OO bond formation by conveying singlet character to the oxygen radicals to promote direct coupling and bond formation with no spin barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This singlet-promoted direct bond formation is analogous to the reverse reaction of O2 binding to coupled binuclear Cu proteins, where the very strong antiferromagnetic coupling (2J  1,200 cm1) in the side-on (-2-2) peroxo-Cu(II)2 drives the simultaneous two-electron transfer from 2Cu(I) to dioxygen, necessary to overcome the spin-forbidden reaction (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to generate oxyl radical character dovetails with increasing evidence for the role of oxygen radicals in OO bond formation by proton-coupled ET (27, 43, 54, 55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we note that single-site reactivity has been proposed (31, 56) by further localizing double-oxidizing equivalents on a single Co center to generate a Co(V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In effect, a Co(III)(V) species is a disproportionated Co(IV)2 center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectroscopic studies reported here do not support a Co(V) formulation, as the IVCT transition of the doubly oxidized cubane is akin to that of the singly oxidized cubane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, fast intramolecular ET, in conjunction with the observed electrochemical potentials, suggest that a Co(V) would not be stable in the presence of Co(III) centers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding, a terminal oxo is posited to be a critical determinant for stabilizing a Co(V) center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such stabilization cannot be achieved in the ligand-saturated cubane examined herein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the spectroscopy of new model cubanes will need to be explored to assess the viability of a fully localized Co(V) active site for OER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Co(III)2(IV)2 state of a Co4O4 cubane, Co4O4(py)4(OAc)4, is a faithful structural and electronic model of a Co(IV)2 active site of oxidic cobalt OER catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Co(III)2(IV)2 core is furnished electrochemically by oxidation of the Co(III)3(IV) species; in situ XAS data reflect a cubane core of high Co valency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stability of an electrochemically generated Co(III)2(IV)2 cubane engenders more detailed spectroscopic analysis offered by advanced techniques, including in situ X-ray emission where K X-ray emission spectroscopy is sensitive to spin-state (57) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the heterogeneous ET rate constant yields a higher reorganization energy for the second oxidation of the cubane core compared with the first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IVCT bands of both the Co(III)3(IV) and Co(III)2(IV)2 species are characteristic of RobinDay class II MV species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFT calculations indicate greater charge localization within the Co(III)2(IV)2 core, arising as a direct consequence of antiferromagnetically exchange-coupled Co(IV) sites on a cubane edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This antiferromagnetic exchange coupling pertains to cobalt oxide catalyzed OER, as exchange coupling localizes charge on the dicobalt site and the metal-centered singlet character may convey singlet character to the generated oxyl radicals, thus providing an adiabatic reaction path for direct OO coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
