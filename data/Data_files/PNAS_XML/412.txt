title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Urban point sources of nutrients were the leading cause for the historical spread of hypoxia across European lakes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using a compilation of data arising from over 1,500 European watersheds, we have identified the relative role of different drivers in initiating hypolimnetic hypoxia, a critical indicator of lake health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, our regional synthesis of laminated lake sediments indicated a significant acceleration in the spread of lacustrine hypoxia in the 1900s, which occurred well before the general use of commercial fertilizers in the mid-20th century and the onset of supraregional climate warming in the 1970s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spread of hypoxia was best explained by urban expansion and the associated intensification of anthropogenic point sources of phosphorus, whereby changes in lifestyle increased the discharge of nutrients from treated and raw sewage, and ultimately led to enhanced lacustrine biological productivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Enhanced phosphorus (P) export from land into streams and lakes is a primary factor driving the expansion of deep-water hypoxia in lakes during the Anthropocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the interplay of regional scale environmental stressors and the lack of long-term instrumental data often impede analyses attempting to associate changes in land cover with downstream aquatic responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we performed a synthesis of data that link paleolimnological reconstructions of lake bottom-water oxygenation to changes in land cover/use and climate over the past 300 years to evaluate whether the spread of hypoxia in European lakes was primarily associated with enhanced P exports from growing urbanization, intensified agriculture, or climatic change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that hypoxia started spreading in European lakes around CE 1850 and was greatly accelerated after CE 1900.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Socioeconomic changes in Europe beginning in CE 1850 resulted in widespread urbanization, as well as a larger and more intensively cultivated surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our analysis of temporal trends demonstrated that the onset and intensification of lacustrine hypoxia were more strongly related to the growth of urban areas than to changes in agricultural areas and the application of fertilizers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that anthropogenically triggered hypoxia in European lakes was primarily caused by enhanced P discharges from urban point sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, there have been no signs of sustained recovery of bottom-water oxygenation in lakes following the enactment of European water legislation in the 1970s to 1980s, and the subsequent decrease in domestic P consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our sampling captured the wide ranges of lake morphometric properties, catchment sizes, modern human activities, and climatic conditions that are spread across Europe (Fig 1A, Fig S1, and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  General trends in land cover change in Europe during the past 300 years corresponded to increases in the percentages of urban and cultivated areas, albeit some regions were more affected than others (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on our analyses (Materials and Methods), we found that the fraction of lakes recording hypoxia in Europe increased over the past 300 years, from an initial annual rate of 0.06 ± 0.004% per year (a1) (Pearsons test, p less_than 0.0001) between CE 1850 and 1900 to rates of 0.20 ± 0.01% a1 between CE 1900 and 2000 (p less_than 0.0001) (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we found that 51 lakes shifted to hypoxia during the past 300 years (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catchments of these 51 lakes with recent hypoxia onset had higher percentages of both cultivated and urban areas in CE 2000 than the benchmark watersheds (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, most of the lakes with recent hypoxia onset were low-elevation sites (48 of 51 were situated between sea level and 1,000 m above sea level).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the patterns of historical change in land cover and land use for these 51 lakes were best described by nonlinear (i.e., additive mixed-effect) models; urbanized areas increased sharply at the end of the 19th century (from 0.02% in CE 1700 to 4.1% in CE 2000), whereas the proportion of cultivated lands has expanded more gradually since the early 18th century (from 7.8% in CE 1700 to 23.4% in CE 2000) and occurred well before the first spread of hypoxia (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than half of the 51 lakes shifted to hypoxia before the introduction of fertilizers in Europe in the middle of the 20th century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate warming, as well as changes in precipitation, is also an unlikely primary driver for the onset of hypoxia because the main warming signal in the air-temperature record postdates the initial spread of hypoxia (Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our statistical analyses support the conclusion that urban point sources were the leading driver for the onset of hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a general additive mixed model (GAMM), we found that the probability of hypoxia onset in our 51-lake subset increased as the proportion of urban area increased over the past 300 years (p less_than 0.0001), but was unrelated to the changes in cultivated and pastured land area (p  0.1) (Fig 3 and Table 1) (R2 = 0.23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A common observation across the lakes with hypoxia developing only recently is the acceleration of urbanization around CE 1900 that coincided with the onset of hypoxia (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the timing of hypoxia onset was quite variable across lakes (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our records showed no evidence of a sustained return to improved oxygenated conditions, despite many efforts at remediation (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Centennial trends in land cover for the 51 watersheds differed notably from trends in the 97 study watersheds recording natural hypoxia (i.e., sites with sustained laminae for 300 years) (Materials and Methods) and the 1,459 benchmark watersheds (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of expansion of urban areas was significantly higher in watersheds associated with recent hypolimnetic hypoxia than in other European watersheds (Fig 4 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the contrary, the rates of changes in cultivated and pastured areas are similar in watersheds with recent hypoxic lakes and other European watersheds, although the absolute magnitude of cultivated land was generally higher around the sites with recent hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MannKendall (M-K) tests indicated that hypoxia onsets were preceded by centennial increases in urban (45% of the sites), cultivated (95% of the sites), and pastured (80% of the sites) areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, during the transition toward hypoxia (±20 years centered on the time of the onset), urban areas expanded in 71% of the sites, whereas cultivated and pastured areas were decreasing in 61% and 74% of the sites, respectively (Tables S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings suggest that urban point sources of nutrients were the leading factor explaining the spread of lacustrine hypoxia in Europe over the past few centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevailing importance of urban point sources of nutrients as the preeminent trigger toward the spread of hypoxia was also validated by M-K and AMM analyses of decadal-scale landscape and climatic reconstructions spanning the period between CE 1900 and 2010 (24) (Fig 4 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, basin-scale analyses of modern characteristics confirmed the prevailing importance of local human activities on the presence of hypoxia (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This regional-scale analysis of paleolimnological records adds to the growing evidence that modern human activities are a widespread force in shaping the structure and function of inland waters (13, 3942).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous paper (17) demonstrated that the spread of lacustrine hypoxia at the global scale was predominantly the result of nondescript human impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the current study specifically pinpoints urban point sources of nutrients as the main forcing mechanism within Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on earlier water quality studies and paleoecological data, it is known that algal blooms decreased water transparency for most lakes in Europe starting in the middle to late 19th century (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eutrophication phase was often more pronounced, beginning in CE 1950 (37, 43), but the development of widespread hypolimnetic hypoxia has largely predated the more visible effects of eutrophication in the epilimnion (this study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the spread of hypolimnetic hypoxia can be considered an early warning of eutrophication, caused by enhanced sediment and organic matter fluxes toward bottom waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypolimnion acts as an integrator of processes taking place over the entire water column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is generally well accepted that contemporary freshwater eutrophication is predominantly caused by diffuse P sources, principally from agriculture (2), in developed nations (i.e., nations having very high human development in 2014 according to the United Nations Human Development Index).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the situation in developing nations is mixed and includes diffuse sources of P and domestic point sources (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our analysis of longer term trends in Europe (Fig 2) provides an important historical perspective, whereby intensive fertilization of agricultural soils and associated diffuse sources of P and nitrogen increased through the middle of the 20th century, largely postdating the initial spread of lake hypoxia (2, 18) (Fig 2 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, diffuse sources of P appear to have had a subordinate role compared with point sources for most of the past 300 years, and were not decisive for the onset of lacustrine hypoxia in most of the studied lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, nutrients arising from agricultural areas likely had some effect, because the long-term M-K tests demonstrated that hypoxia onsets were preceded by increases in cultivated and pastured areas, as well as urban areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we suggest that lakes have suffered a slow loss of resilience as a result of both point and diffuse P inputs over time until a disproportionate increase from urban point sources tipped the balance toward hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In present-day Europe and North America, domestic sewage and industrial waste water mostly receive an efficient treatment, including P removal, before discharging effluents into lakes (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the situation around the end of the 19th century was quite different, when urban waste waters with increasing P content were directly discharged into waterways (44) and began affecting downstream aquatic ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The problem was fueled by urban expansion, a growing population, an accelerating economy during the industrial revolution, the rising standard of living, and novel domestic and industrial uses of P (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first P-containing detergents were introduced around the end of the 19th century and soon enjoyed wide acceptance (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these developments were synchronous with the rapid spread of lake hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Importantly, our study shows that lakes with recent hypoxia shifted abruptly and irreversibly to an alternate stable state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, among the lakes considered in this study, three perialpine lakes (Lakes Geneva, Bourget, and Annecy) (Fig S6) that were previously oxygenated over the past millennia shifted to hypolimnic hypoxia between CE 1930 and CE 1950 following a slight P increase (i.e., with enrichments of only 810 g TP L1; refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35, 46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding illustrates that even a small increase in P availability can stimulate enough primary productivity to trigger hypoxia without generating algal blooms (because blooms were only observed after CE 1950).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the temporal trend of oxygenation in European lakes (Fig 2A) shows a slowing down of the rate of increase, but no turning off of hypoxia after the 1980s, despite the implementation of restoration programs and successful controls on nutrient influx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crossing of critical thresholds of nutrient loading appeared to have abruptly and irreversibly shifted lacustrine ecosystems from one state to another (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imported P, both from watersheds (external load) and remobilized from lake sediments (internal load), can explain the stability of hypoxia over the past ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3040 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P loads from watersheds to downstream lakes initially accumulate in lake sediments, but may later be remobilized from sediments into overlying waters under hypoxic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-rich sediments have been identified as the key factor in sustaining hypoxia (49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the accumulation of organic matter during eutrophic conditions, and the subsequent diagenetic release of P from near-surface sediments, is known to cause lakes to remain in the eutrophic state even if the external input of P has diminished (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a reduced ability of ecosystems to remove nitrogen via denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation may be related to hypoxia and could lead to accelerated eutrophication (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, an increase in water temperature could also decrease the threshold of P concentrations sustaining hypoxia, with more intense stratification, reduced solubility of oxygen at higher water temperatures, and enhanced metabolic rates in warmer bottom waters (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unfortunately, the lack of past land cover data at a sufficiently high spatial resolution in other regions prevents us from expanding this work globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the observed regime shifts to new stable hypoxic conditions highlights the challenges for developing countries facing persistent diffuse P emissions and growing P demands, together with changes in lifestyle (e.g., diet shifts) and expanding urban areas (including the development of megacities and periurbanization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, wastewater from sewage and industry is often untreated and may be the primary contributor toward eutrophication (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, only 35% of wastewater in Asia and less_than1% in Africa were treated in CE 2005 (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without implementation of wastewater treatment of P in point and mixed sources, the future conditions of lakes in these regions will likely result in prevalent hypoxic hypolimnetic conditions, degraded water quality, and the necessity for decade-long restoration efforts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, our analyses of laminated sediment records indicate that nutrient point sources from growing urban areas were the leading driver for the onset of hypoxia in the hypolimnion of downstream lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Point and diffuse sources have always both contributed to the total supply of nutrient inputs to lakes, but with varying intensities over time and space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that urban point sources of P were the dominant driver of lake eutrophication in European lowland systems during the Anthropocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the past few decades, the relative contribution of diffuse P sources has progressively become a major cause of modern freshwater eutrophication in developed countries, as point sources have been reduced and fertilizer use has increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of reoxygenation of the hypolimnion evident from our analyses highlights the importance of the history and legacy of past land uses, and the need for long-term strategies to maintain and restore water quality in modern lake ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Reconstructing_the_Dynamics_of_Hypoxia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sediment textures of many lakes offer a simple proxy for the oxygenation history of bottom waters (5355).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the appearance of laminated sediment on top of homogeneous sediment indicates that annual oxygenation conditions fell below a critical threshold in both duration and concentration (35, 56, 57), hence recording the die-out of macrobenthos and the end of its related bioturbation (54, 58, 59) (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If laminations are proven to reflect annual cycles of sedimentation, they offer the additional advantage that the shift from well-oxygenated to at least seasonal hypoxic hypolimnic conditions can often be precisely dated by counting varves from the sediment/water interface down-core (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Varves Working Group (VWG) of Past Global Changes has intensively investigated varved lakes over the past decade (54, 60, 61), enabling the assembly of a large dataset of lake hypoxia (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Europe, 148 varved sediment records were referenced in the global compilation of the VWG (17) and indicated that the European dynamics of lacustrine hypoxia encompassed: (i) a period of relatively undisturbed conditions before CE 1850 serving as a preindustrialized baseline reference, (ii) a period of major changes during the early industrialization of Western countries and the following Great Acceleration phase of the so-called Anthropocene (42), and (iii) the initiation of European lake restoration programs since the 1970s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Land use changes in watersheds of recently varved lakes have been compared with a set of 97 naturally varved lakes to dismiss any sampling bias related to morphometric properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preservation of laminated sediments usually indicates that lakes have strong hypoxia; however, strong seasonal hypoxia may not systematically develop laminations, notably due to the absence of contrasting seasonal sedimentation or as a consequence of wind causing sediment resuspension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data matrix does not attempt to include all lakes with hypoxia but, instead, includes a conservative and large selection of well-characterized lakes with laminated sediments to provide a statistically sound and relevant basis for constraining the dynamics of hypoxia in Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Numerical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An AMM framework generated using the mgcv library in R (62) was used to describe the general nonlinear trends in land use over the past three centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was anticipated from the study by Jenny et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (17) that watersheds with recently hypoxic lakes would contain an environmental signal reflecting a more urbanized and agriculturally cultivated landscape compared with watersheds serving as benchmarks, as well as naturally hypoxic lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the relationships between urban, cultivated, pastured, and forested areas were evaluated for the four watershed categories of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confidence intervals were derived using the SEs produced by the predict.gam function in R (63), with type = response specified in the model [mgcv library (64)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple regression analyses and nonparametric M-K tests for monotonic trends were conducted to identify the main drivers of hypoxia onsets (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Paleolimnological_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A literature search was conducted in April 2014 (17) and updated in June 2015 using the Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science database and Google Scholar with different combinations of the following keywords: varve and lake, and lamin and lake sediment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The search yielded 148 relevant European lakes that contain laminated or varved sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Descriptions and data on varved sites, sediments, and dating methods are available in a study by Jenny et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17 and the references therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original chronologies were expressed in CE calendar years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laminated lacustrine sites had to satisfy several conditions to be included in this synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accepted sites contained a varved or well-preserved laminated sedimentary sequence and/or featured a published age-model relying on varve counting and/or radiometric dating, and the lakes sediment texture had to be explicitly described or illustrated by pictures outlining the laminated intervals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The timing of the first onset of hypoxia was obtained for each lake by examining all relevant published varve data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Where time intervals could not be dated precisely with the help of published data, corresponding authors were contacted and asked for advice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water depth for each lake was collected and used to verify that lake level fluctuations were not the cause of changes in preservation conditions of the varves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Descriptions and data for lake sites were compiled in this study (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Land_Use_and_Climate_Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modern data and temporal changes in land use and climate during the past 300 years were analyzed for 1,607 watersheds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrological basins of each site were calculated using the flow accumulation and flow direction rasters made available from hydrological data and maps based on Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at Multiple Scales (HydroSHEDS), together with lake perimeters and areas using the GLWD from the World Wildlife Foundation (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following variables were extracted from modeled areas using the Arc geographic information system (ArcGIS): (i) modern site characteristics, (ii) past land use from CE 19002010 at decadal steps and with a 1-km2 spatial resolution, and (iii) past land use from CE 17002000 with centennial resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean local temperatures; precipitations; population densities (65); changes in urban cultivated, pastured, and forest areas (24); and past human population densities (66) were extracted from modeled areas for each watershed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multiple regression analyses were conducted to identify the main drivers of hypoxia onsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each recently hypoxic lake (n = 51), we created a binomial time series indicating whether the first hypoxic event had occurred or not at each date of the land cover data (i.e., CE 1700, 1800, 1900, 1910, , 2010).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the relative importance of the different land cover types, we then ran a logistic GAMM using the binomial time series as the response variable; the percentage of urban, cultivated, and pastured areas as fixed effect explanatory variables; and lake identification as the random effect (testing a random slope and intercept for each lake).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test further whether the smooth term varied among lakes, we tested a random smooth logistic GAMM, which allowed not only the slope to vary among lakes but also the shape of the nonlinear relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All GAMMs were fit using the bam function of the itsadug package in R (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nonparametric M-K tests for monotonic trends were used to quantify trends of land use for each of the 1,607 watershed time series within the past 300 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis was based on the Kendall rank correlation coefficient and was conducted using the Kendall library (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A positive score shows a monotonically increasing trend, whereas a negative value shows a monotonically decreasing trend (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each site, M-K tests were run for two time windows to identify the potential effects of slow and fast land cover changes on the hypoxia onset: We anticipated that fast changes in the land cover would show an effect within a short period (±20 years) centered on the time of the onset to be consistent with the uncertainties of reconstructions, and that slow changes in the land cover would show an effect over a longer period (200 years) preceding the onset of hypoxia to be consistent with the long-term history and potential legacy effects of past land changes in Europe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Text  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Specific details on selected sites are described in Fig S6 and Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lakes Geneva (Léman), Bourget, and Annecy are located in the French and Swiss perialpine region and were intensively studied in the course of the program: Perturbation Impacts on Lake Food Webs, a Palaeo-Ecological Approach (IPERRETRO) of the French National Research Agency (ANR) (20092013) (12, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this program, volumes of hypoxic waters were reconstructed and analyzed during the Anthropocene using limnological and paleolimnological data (35, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three lakes were selected because they share the same P enrichment history: although they were oligotrophic at the end of the 19th century, all three lakes underwent P enrichment as early as the 1920s, concomitant to the population increase in urban areas (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this time, these lakes received untreated wastewaters from the growing cities of Geneva, Chambéry, Aix-Les-Bains, and Annecy (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A shift to hypoxic conditions occurred in CE 1933 ± 1, CE 1950 ± 1, and CE 1952 ± 1 [in Bourget, Geneva (Léman) and Annecy, respectively] in response to the unprecedented rise in total P concentrations above 10 ± 5 g of P L1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this shift, hypoxia never disappeared, despite the fact that the environmental policies implemented succeeded in drastically reducing lake P concentrations: Observational data demonstrate that mean total phosphorus (TP) values measured during winter mixing have been successfully reduced to 6 g of P L1 in Annecy, 19 g of P L1 in Geneva, and 17 g of P L1 in Bourget (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lake Alserio, a dimictic hard-water eutrophic lake, is located in the Brianza district near Lake Como in northern Italy (surface area of 1.23 km2 and maximum depth of 5.3 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beginning in the 1970s, Lake Alserio was affected by elevated external P loads, which resulted in high P concentrations in the water column (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major P sources that affected the water quality and the trophic status of the lake were domestic sewage (fluxes of P to the sediments = 1.96 gm2a1) and runoff (fluxes of P to the sediments = 0.75 gm2a1) (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite both the reduction of P in detergents and the construction of a pipe conveying urban wastewater and runoff to a treatment plant, the present external P load to the lake is still high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change from homogeneous sediment to a laminated sequence appears to be linked to the eutrophication process of Lake Alserio occurring since the 1960s (73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Baldeggersee is located on the central Swiss Plateau, and is characterized by a maximum depth of 66 m, a surface area of 5.2 km2, and a water renewal time of 5.6 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to strong anthropogenically driven nutrient enrichment of this site, Baldeggersee has become hypertrophic, and complete oxygen depletion was observed at water depths of 60 m at the beginning of this century (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term changes in the watershed showed that growing urbanization was concomitant with the onset of hypoxia in 1880s (as inferred from the lake sediment record).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The introduction of treatment plants since 1967 and 1975 has successfully reduced point sources of nutrients (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since 1982, bioturbation has prevented varve formation above 55 m of water depth due to the better oxygen regimes at the water/sediment interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, below 55 m in water depth, the mineralization of organic carbon is still causing oxygen depletion that allows the formation and preservation of varves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lake Jyväsjärvi is located in central Finland (64°14N, 25°47E) and has a surface area of 3.4 km2 and a maximum depth of 27 m. The town of Jyväskylä was established on the lakeshore in 1837 on the northern bank of Lake Jyväsjärvi, and the lake received untreated municipal wastewater from the town up until 1977 (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the biological and chemical properties of the sediment strata, Meriläinen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (74) distinguished a phase of early changes in the lake ecosystem from the 1870s to ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the 1940s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phase of early changes corresponds well to the timing when varves first appeared (at the end of the 1800s) and when the lake received untreated municipal wastewater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the first plans for building a wastewater treatment plant were prepared in the early 1930s, municipal wastewater continued to be discharged into the lake in the untreated form until 1977.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, this effluent loading has been reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With a surface of 61.8 km2 and a volume of 7.5 km3, Lake Iseo (also known as Sebino) is the fourth largest Italian lake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The watershed includes 83 municipalities, 21 of which are on the shoreline, with a total population of about 180,000 inhabitants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sources of P in Lake Iseo are derived mainly from point sources (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the 1960s, intensifying eutrophication processes and the corresponding deterioration of water quality in northern Italy were becoming apparent, initially in lakes with low maximum depths (Lake Varese and Lake Endine) and subsequently in the deep subalpine lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the same period, Lake Iseo became hypoxic, as evidenced by the appearance of varved sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nylandssjön is located in northern Sweden (62°57N, 18°17E) and is a dimictic, mesotrophic, circumneutral lake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lake is characterized by a surface area of 0.28 km2 and a maximum depth of 17.5 m. The catchment (0.86 km2) is covered mainly by spruce forest and, to a lesser extent, by arable land.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Varves are evident in deeper sediment layers of Nylandssjön, but their permanent formation and preservation started at the beginning of the 20th century because of cultural eutrophication (76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major population increase associated with wastewater release occurred at the end of the 19th century in the region of Lake Nylandssjön [there was a doubling in the number of inhabitants in the major town between CE 1850 and 1910 (Swedish population censuses, Statistikdatabasen), which has since stabilized].  #@NEW_LINE#@#
