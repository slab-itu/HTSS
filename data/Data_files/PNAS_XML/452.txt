Fibrous nonlinear elasticity enables positive mechanical feedback between cells and ECMs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mechanical interactions between cells and the ECM critically regulate cell function, including growth and migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By measuring forces exerted by breast tumor cells embedded within collagen matrices, we reveal a positive mechanical cross-talk between the cell and ECM: cells pulling onto collagen fibers align and stiffen the matrices, and stiffer collagen matrices promote greater cell force generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work highlights the importance of strain-induced fiber alignment in mediating cellECM interaction within a 3D architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basic force regulation principle uncovered here can be extended to understand the tissue-stiffening processes occurring in many diseases, such as tumor progression and fibrosis, and better design biomaterial scaffolds to control cell behavior in tissue engineering applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In native states, animal cells of many types are supported by a fibrous network that forms the main structural component of the ECM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanical interactions between cells and the 3D ECM critically regulate cell function, including growth and migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the physical mechanism that governs the cell interaction with fibrous 3D ECM is still not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this article, we present single-cell traction force measurements using breast tumor cells embedded within 3D collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recreate the breast tumor mechanical environment by controlling the microstructure and density of type I collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal a positive mechanical feedback loop: cells pulling on collagen locally align and stiffen the matrix, and stiffer matrices, in return, promote greater cell force generation and a stiffer cell body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, cell force transmission distance increases with the degree of strain-induced fiber alignment and stiffening of the collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings highlight the importance of the nonlinear elasticity of fibrous matrices in regulating cellECM interactions within a 3D context, and the cell force regulation principle that we uncover may contribute to the rapid mechanical tissue stiffening occurring in many diseases, including cancer and fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Controlling_Collagen_Nonlinear_Elasticity_by_Varying_Collagen_Concentration__Cross-Linking__and_Polymerizing_Temperature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We engineer an array of natively derived type 1 collagen matrices with different microstructure, initial stiffness, and strain-stiffening properties by varying collagen concentration, polymerization temperature, and preglycation with ribose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first characterize the collagen network pore size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type I collagen matrices have a larger pore diameter when preglycated with ribose compared with those with no preglycation at the same collagen concentration (Fig 1A and Fig S1) (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like glucose, ribose cross-links collagen through the Maillard Reaction associated with diabetes and aging but with much faster kinetics amenable to use in experiments (2831).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in pore diameter also occurs when polymerizing at lower temperature (Fig 1B) (32), and matrices with greater collagen concentration have smaller pores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nine collagen matrices that we created have pore diameters that ranges from 1.8 to 5.1 m (Fig 1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this range compares to the 1- to 20-m pore diameter observed in highly heterogeneous human connective tissue (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, we measure collagen matrix mechanical material properties using a dynamic shear rheometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, a differential shear modulus, K, is used to describe the collagen matrix stiffness as a function of strain (definition is in Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial differential modulus, Ko, is defined as the differential shear modulus K at zero strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ko of nine gels ranges from 6 to 900 Pa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that normal breast tissue has a shear modulus of 60 Pa and that malignant breast tumor is 1,300 Pa (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have converted the compressive Youngs moduli measured in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 to shear moduli assuming Poisson ratio of 0.5 (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A summary of the material properties of all nine gels is provided in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A fiber network model is used to study the relation between gel microstructure and its macroscale strain-stiffening properties (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model includes cross-linked microstructural beams representing collagen fibers compliant in the bending, axial, torsional, and shear modes of deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The network model reproduces the experimentally observed initial linear behavior and the subsequent strain-stiffening response of the collagen gels at different gel densities (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, this model elucidates that strain stiffening is initiated by the reorientation of fibers and their alignment in the direction of maximum principal stretch accompanied by fiber buckling in the direction of minimum principal stretch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One important parameter that we use to characterize strain stiffening is the stiffening onset strain, c, which is defined as the strain at which the shear modulus increases from its initial modulus by 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that larger pore diameter correlates with lower c in both experiments and numerical calculation (Fig 1F), and this finding is consistent with previous observation (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1F shows that c decreases with increasing network pore size for three sets of gels at concentrations of 1, 2, and 3.5 mg/mL in both experiments and the network model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measuring_Cell_Force_by_Tracking_Matrix_Deformation_and_Applying_a_Fibrous_Network-Based_Constitutive_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell-generated force is measured by integrating a previously developed 3D particle tracking microscopy from the laboratory of M.W.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and coworkers (36, 37) and a fiber network-based constitutive material model from the laboratory of V.B.S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and coworkers (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first measure collagen matrix deformation using a 3D particle tracking microscopy (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Breast cancer cells are embedded within a collagen matrix covalently bonded to fluorescent marker beads (Fig S2A), with an average bead to bead spacing of 7 µm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D displacements of 10,000 beads are tracked in the vicinity of an actively pulling cell (37) when it is relaxed by cytochalasin D, a compound that disrupts actin filaments (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All bead displacements along the long axis of the cell within a 15-m-radius cylinder are then selected from the 3D displacements for additional data analysis (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compute cell-generated force from the bead displacements near the cell (Fig 2B) using a theoretical ellipsoid cell contraction model along with a discrete fiber network-inspired constitutive model (fibrous continuum model) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ellipsoid void is used to represent a cell embedded within the collagen matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ellipsoid is chosen to have the same aspect ratio as the experimentally measured cell and free to contract until the displacements that it generates within the collagen matrix match those from experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The constitutive model for fibrous matrices considers the energetic contribution from isotropic and aligned fibers separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A neo-Hookean hyperelastic model is used for the isotropic fibers, and a discrete fiber network-based model is used for the aligned fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The input to the computational model is the tracked bead displacements along the long axis of the cell as shown in Fig 2B, Upper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The output of the model includes the cell-generated force and the fitted displacements (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the model are described in Materials and Methods and refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 and 34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fibrous continuum model reproduces the long-range displacements that we measure in collagen in the vicinity of pulling cells (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, alternative material models that only take into account isotropic nonlinear elasticity (but no fiber alignment) or linear elasticity do not (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fiber-driven, strain-induced stiffening is, therefore, critical for understanding the displacements exerted by cells within collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

From_Cell_to_ECM__Cells_Exert_Sufficient_Strain_to_Locally_Align_and_Stiffen_Collagen_Matrices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigate how cells perceive the ECM mechanically by measuring the cell-generated strains in all nine collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that nearly all of the cells, across nine collagen matrices studied, exert compressive cell body strains (Fig 3A) that are sufficient to cause collagen tensile strains to exceed c, the stiffening onset strain (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, c has been converted from shear to tensile strain by equating principal stretches (Materials and Methods) and is plotted with a magenta dashes in Fig 3B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cells exert greater strains in lower initial stiffness matrices (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reflective confocal imaging of the collagen network around an actively pulling cell in a 1.0 mg/mL 37 °C collagen matrix shows that extensive fiber alignment accompanies the large strains recorded along the cells polarization axis (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our results reveal a quantitative relation between the strains exerted by cells and the collagen gel stiffness and show that cells exert sufficient strains to locally align and stiffen collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the strain stiffening depends on the cell type and behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231 cell line) that we study exhibit two distinct modes of migration: amoeboid, where cells migrate in a path-seeking manner with diffuse, short-lived, integrin-independent adhesions (39), and mesenchymal, where cells migrate in a protease-dependent manner with long-lived punctate adhesions linked to the actomyosin cytoskeletal network (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We select only those cells exhibiting mesenchymal motility (defined as aspect ratio  greater than 2.0) for measurement, because they are integrin-dependent and exert large and long-lived forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that MDA-MB-231 cells exhibiting mesenchymal motility displace their surrounding collagen matrix much more extensively than previously reported for a mixed population of amoeboid and mesenchymal cells (Fig S2B) (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that fibroblasts exhibit even stronger strain-stiffening behavior than cancer cells of epithelial origin as reported in refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17 and 18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

From_ECM_to_Cell__Stiffer_Collagen_Matrices_Promote_Cells_to_Generate_More_Force_and_Stiffen_Their_Body  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We measure cell-generated forces in all nine collagen gels using the method illustrated in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that cell-generated force (Fig 4A) and cell body stiffness (Fig 4B) increase with initial collagen matrix stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-generated force and cell body stiffness also increase with the current strain-stiffened collagen stiffness at the cell tips (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average cell body stiffness along the cells major axis is calculated knowing the cell-generated force, the surface area of the ellipsoid representing the cell, and the average cell body strain along the cells major axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further investigate the spatial organization of the actin filaments within the cell by staining for f-actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe actin filaments aligned in the direction of the cells major axis more frequently in the two stiffer matrices (2 mg/mL 30 °C and 3.5 mg/mL 22 °C) than in the softer matrix (1 mg/mL 37 °C) (Fig 4 CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, our results show that cells respond to their mechanical environment actively; they stiffen their body via bundling of f-actin into aligned filaments internally and generate more forces when surrounded by stiffer collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our finding that MDA-MB-231 cells stiffen their body and increase the amount of force that they exert within stiffer collagen matrices shows that cells are actively adapting to their mechanical environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been reported that cells, including MDA-MB-231, exert more force as the stiffness of 2D linear elastic substrate increases (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be explored whether such adaptability endows cells an advantage in their function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spatial_Range_of_CellECM_Interaction__Nonlinear_Elasticity_of_Fibrous_Matrices_Promotes_Long-Range_Force_Transmission  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By examining the displacement fields and local collagen microstructure around cells, we find that local fiber alignment (or strain stiffening) around the cell increases spatial mechanical signal transmission range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is also supported by the numerical simulations with a fibrous material model as shown in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matrices that have larger pores and less initial stiffness are shown to have the greatest collagen fiber alignment (Fig 5 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fiber alignment is accompanied by an increased range of displacement (and force) propagation from the cell (Fig 5 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of strain stiffening or fiber alignment in spatial force transmission is also reflected in the fitting of displacement data to fibrous, neo-Hookean, and linear elastic models (Fig 5 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As pore diameter increases, the fibrous model reproduces the increasingly long range of displacement propagation, whereas simpler nonlinear and linear elastic models do not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantification of the relationship between the displacement transmission range and the pore size (Fig 5J) shows that mechanical signal transmission range increases with the pore size of the collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that cells strain stiffen the collagen matrix more within larger pore matrices (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanical transmission range decreases with initial gel stiffness, likely because cells are less able to exert strains large enough to align collagen fibers within stiffer matrices (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3A and 5K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we are able to reproduce the displacement fields measured around many cells with a fully elastic fibrous material model, some cells have displacement fields that are highly asymmetric and cannot be accounted for with our model (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those cells have not been analyzed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of 116 cells that we measure across nine conditions, 42 cells have highly asymmetric displacement fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize two mechanisms that contribute to the asymmetric displacement fields that we observe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one case, cells may be within a phase of their migration cycle where force is not applied symmetrically on either side of the cell (for example, the asymmetry is caused by compression/tension at the front and back of the cell).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the other case, cells degrade collagens in the back of the cell as they migrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Degradation is especially important for cells that are of fibroblast origin (16, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
When we apply broad spectrum matrix metalloprotease (MMP) inhibition to cells within unglycated collagen matrices, cells generate less strain (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the cells still exert sufficient strain to stiffen the collagen matrix, showing that proteolysis is not confounding our result of significant local matrix stiffening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observe that MMP inhibition imposes no change in cell-generated strain within glycated collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that, in both matrices, cells adopt less circular and more asymmetric shapes under broad spectrum MMP inhibition, likely because of increased confinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
ECMs are known to have complex material properties, in particular under large strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two important properties that are not yet in our material models are the history-dependent nature of ECMs (or plasticity) (Fig S6) and stress relaxation (45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our rheology measurements, significant plasticity is evident by 16% shear strain (Fig S6 AC), and we have observed permanent collagen deformation in the vicinity of the cell (Fig S6 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work has shown that collagen matrix stress relaxation is enhanced by large strains and has a timescale relevant to cell proliferation and migration (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These complex material properties can be incorporated into future material models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By measuring the key mediator of cellECM interaction, single cell-generated traction force, we provide a physical mechanism that cells use to interact with their surrounding ECM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the cross-talk between the cell and ECM is mediated by the strain-induced fiber alignment of fibrous matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As cells progressively apply greater strains, they align and stiffen the collagen matrix in their vicinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In return, stiffer collagen matrices lead to greater cell force generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process involves a virtuous cycle of reinforcing cell force generation and collagen strain stiffening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide here a quantitative description of the relation between the cell force and mechanical properties of collagen matrices, elucidating the importance of strain-induced fiber alignment in cellECM interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This basic principle has broad relevance for understanding cellcell interactions within 3D biomatrices, with applications in both tissue engineering and cancer biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained as a gift from the Cornell University Center on the Microenvironment and Metastasis and maintained in high-glucose DMEM (Gibco; Life Technologies Corporation) with 10% (vol/vol) FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin (Gibco).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were passaged every 34 d and harvested for experiments when 7090% confluent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were detached with 0.05% Trypsin/0.53 mM EDTA (Corning) for 35 min and then, resuspended in fresh DMEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suspended cells in DMEM were mixed with type I collagen in 0.1% acetic acid derived from rat tails (Pel-Freez) (48) that was brought to a neutral pH by addition of sodium hydroxide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carboxylated 1.0-µm-diameter yellow-green fluorescent beads (Invitrogen; Life Science Technologies) were mixed into the collagen to achieve 7-µm bead to bead spacing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collagen of various microstructures was prepared by modulating concentration, ribose preglycation (29), and temperature during the first 20 min of polymerization (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A custom imaging device was used to create thin, uniform 500- to 800-µm-thick collagen gels for greater control of polymerization temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed protocol for collagen preparation is provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collagen fibers were visualized using the 40× water immersion objective of a confocal point scanning microscope in reflectance mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average pore diameter of each matrix was measured by the 3D bubble (49) and nearest obstacle distance (50) methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A TA Instruments DHR3 Shear Rheometer was used for mechanical characterization of collagen gels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More details are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

3D_Imaging__Bead_Displacement_Tracking__and_Cell_Body_Strain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlabeled cells and matrix-embedded fluorescent beads were imaged 1 d (1828 h) after collagen polymerization with the 20× N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 0.45 dry lens of an Olympus IX81 Fluorescence Microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were recorded using bright field, and beads were subsequently recorded in green fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3D images were 433 × 330 × 100 µm in size, with a voxel size of 0.32 × 0.32 × 1.0 µm (x, y, and z, respectively); 1020 cells were captured in parallel, and then, cytochalasin D was introduced into the device to a concentration of 10 µM to disrupt actin filaments and given at least 45 min to relax the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same 1020 cells and their surrounding collagen matrix were then imaged again to obtain a reference image (no cell force present).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only cells with a mesenchymal-like appearance were imaged, and 143/146 cells imaged and subsequently analyzed had an aspect ratio  greater than  2.0 (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bead positions were determined using a weighted centroid method, and then, bead displacements were tracked using a particle tracking algorithm described in our laboratories previously (37), resulting in bead displacement accuracy of 50 × 50 × 150 nm (x, y, and z, respectively) (SI Materials and Methods and Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compute the average cell body strain along the cells major axis as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sample all beads within a 15-µm-radius cylinder passing through the two tips of the cell and plot axial displacement as a function of the axial position of the beads (as shown in Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we exclude all beads that are beyond the displacement maxima of the cell, leaving only those beads in the immediate vicinity of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linear regression is then applied to calculate the average deformation gradient along the cells major axis and subsequently, the average strain (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Actin_Staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
f-Actin was visualized by fixing and staining with phalloidin-tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC) and capturing 3D confocal images of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More details are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparison_of_Stiffening_Onset_Strain_in_Shear_with_Tensile_Strain_at_Cell_Tip  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use the stiffening onset strain, c, from shear rheology experiments to approximate the stiffening onset strain in uniaxial tension, c, in the collagen at the cell tip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principal stretch of stiffening onset in shear can be written c=0.5C+0.54+C2, and the stretch in uniaxial tension is c=1+c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, assuming equal principal stretches, C=0.5C+0.54+C21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, in this assumption, we neglect the contribution of the volumetric change in uniaxial tension to stiffening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stiffening in uniaxial tension may occur at a lower strain as a result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_Cell_Force__Cell_Body_Stiffness__and_Collagen_Strain_at_Cell_Tip  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cell force was computed using the fibrous continuum model and finite element method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 116-cell dataset, 42 cells were not analyzed because of highly asymmetric displacement fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the remaining 74 cells, 50 were selected for additional analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All simulations were performed in a finite deformation setting using eight-node quadratic axisymmetric elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details are described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 and SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, an ellipsoid void is placed in the center of the collagen matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The input of the fitting is the axial bead displacements measured near the cell as shown in Fig 2B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The output of the fitting is the fitted displacements and cell-generated force along the ellipsoid surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell-generated force along the axial direction is computed by integrating all of the forces along one-half of the ellipsoid void.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the adjustable parameters in the fitting are the material properties, the fitted parameters are mostly close to those from shear rheology test, except for those matrices with large pore size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In those cases, the stiffening is larger in the fitting than the experimentally measured data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger strain stiffening in matrices with large pore size (compared with shear rheology tests) can be partially attributed to the difference in the behavior of collagen matrices under (cell-generated) tensile stress and shear stress in rheology test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because collagen matrices align sooner under cell-generated tensile stress, strain stiffening is expected to remarkably increase with increasing fiber alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average stiffness of the cell body in the direction of the cells major axis was computed using the cell-generated force from the fitting, the measured cell body strain, and the measured cell geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, averagecellbodystiffness=cell-generatedforce/0.5×(cellsurfacearea)×(averagecellbodystrain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell surface area is the surface area of the prolate spheroid with length and aspect ratio equal to that of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tensile strain in the collagen at the cell tip was obtained from finite element simulation of an ellipsoid cell using the fibrous continuum model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analyze the sensitivity of our model to idealizing the cell as an ellipsoid by alternatively modeling the cell tip as conical in shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conical cell tip does not significantly alter displacement propagation from the cell or the total cell force (SI Materials and Methods and Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A_Discrete_Fiber_Network_Model_for_Material_Characterization_of_Collagen_Gel  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Random fiber networks were used to model the mechanical behavior of collagen gels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Networks were created by randomly placing beams between the first and second nearest neighbor nodes in a body-centered cubic lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lattice constant of 5 m was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The networks were diluted to reproduce the volumetric densities of the tested collagen gels considering a volumetric mass density of 1.34 g/mL for collagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibers were modeled using Timoshenko beams 40- to 100-nm thick with Youngs moduli of 6 MPa (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonaffine network deformation was determined by minimizing the total strain energy of fibers accounting for the stretching, bending, and shear deformation of individual fibers (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simple shear tests were performed using finite elements by applying displacement-controlled boundary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The instantaneous shear stiffness of the networks was evaluated as G=/, where  and  denote the shear stress and strain of the network, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The random fiber network model captures the initial linear behavior and the subsequent stiffening observed in testing collagen gels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The network model shows that, as strain increases, fibers reorient and align in the maximum principal stretch direction, causing strain stiffening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed reorientation is accompanied by fiber buckling in the smallest principal stretch direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the presence of fibers with larger length to diameter ratios (slenderness) facilitates nonaffine deformation and reorientation at smaller strains, decreasing the critical strain for stiffening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result agrees with the observation of smaller critical strains in networks with larger pore sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the fiber network model reproduces the density-dependent nonlinear stiffening of the tested collagen gels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Imaging_Device  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A 3 × 3 array of 4-mm-diameter, 500-m-thick polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) wells was fabricated and then, oxygen plasma bonded to a 48 × 50 no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.5 cover glass (VWR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 40 × 60 × 10-mm slab of polycarbonate with a 30-mm-diameter hole was sealed to the coverslip with high-vacuum grease (Corning).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assembled device was autoclaved, and then, a sterile 35-mm petri dish was placed on top and slotted into grooves in the polycarbonate to maintain sterility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PDMS wells on the glass surface of the imaging device were activated to bind to collagen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wells were filled with sterile 1% polyethyleneimine, incubated for 10 min, and then, washed with sterile distilled water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the wells were filled with sterile 0.1% glutaraldehyde and incubated for 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wells were washed and incubated for 5 min with sterile distilled water three times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wells were then incubated overnight with sterile distilled water before a final wash and used in cell experiments the next day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cellularized_Collagen_Polymerization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Type I collagen was extracted from rat tails and polymerized as described previously (48, 52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collagen was dissolved in 0.1% acetic acid at 5 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carboxylated 1.0-µm-diameter yellow-green fluorescent beads (Invitrogen; Life Science Technologies) were sonicated for 2 h before use to reduce bead clumping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microcentrifuge tubes A, B, and C were placed on ice; 10× M199 media and 1 N sodium hydroxide to neutralize the solution were placed in tube A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume of sodium hydroxide was 0.022 times the volume of collagen solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collagen in acetic acid was placed in tube B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells, DMEM, and fluorescent beads were placed in tube C. Tubes A and B were first mixed to neutralize the pH before exposure to fluorescent beads and cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tube C was then mixed in by pipetting 10 times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mixing was performed on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total mixing volume was 200 L for cell experiments and 350 L for rheology experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Final concentration for cells was 20,000 cells per 1 mL, and fluorescent beads had an average bead to bead spacing of 7 µm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For cell experiments, collagen was pipetted into the room temperature imaging device to a thickness of 500800 µm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve rapid warming, the device was placed inverted in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator, and a steel plate preheated to 37 °C was placed on top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The device was flipped every 2 min for 10 min to distribute cells away from surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The device was then left to complete a total of 60 min of incubation at 37 °C before overlaying with prewarmed media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycated gels were given 80 min total for polymerization incubation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For temperature-controlled experiments, a two-temperature polymerization process was used as has been described previously (32), with 20 min spent at the lower temperature followed by 60 min at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent cell settling because of gravity, the device was flipped every 2 min for 20 min at low temperature and an additional 10 min at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immediately after polymerization, gels were overlain with media, and the media were changed after 1 h. For MMP-inhibited trials, cells were overlain with media containing 25 µM GM6001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

3D_Imaging__Bead_Position_Localization__and_Tracking  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
3D images of the fluorescent beads embedded in the collagen matrix around cells measured 433 × 330 × 100 µm in size, with a voxel size of 0.32 × 0.32 × 1.0 µm (x, y, and z, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were thresholded at 58% of maximum intensity, with all images from the same imaging session receiving the same threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bwconncomp() function in MATLAB was used to identify all voxels in each fluorescent bead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the 3D position of each bead was calculated by an intensity-weighted centroid method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the intensity of each voxel in the bead is analogous to density in a center of mass calculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location xcm of the centroid of each bead is calculated in each direction asxcm=i=1nmixii=1nmi,where mi is the intensity of each voxel, xi is the location of each voxel in the current direction, and n is the number of voxels in the bead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positions of beads are then paired across time using a previously developed adaptive feature vector-based relaxation tracking algorithm (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the algorithm evaluates the likelihood of a bead-pairing event by applying a quasirigidity condition between the feature vectors of a bead and its candidate positions in the next timeframe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The algorithm has a high recovery ratio and low mismatch ratio, even when bead displacements exceed the average bead to bead spacing in the sample, such as occurs near the cell tip in our softer collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tracked displacements were then postprocessed to remove z drift that occurred during the image acquisition of each stack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A spline was fit to all z displacements as a function of z position, and they were smoothed by a robust second-order weighted linear least squares regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spline was then subtracted from the dataset to eliminate the z drift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Errant tracks were removed from the dataset by comparing each displacement track with the average of its five nearest neighbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those tracks that were more than 25% different magnitude than the average of their neighbors or deviated by more than 40° were removed from the dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the translational drift in the dataset was obtained by first identifying all beads that were within 20 µm of the center of the cell along the cells polarization direction and at least 120 µm from the cell in the direction perpendicular to the cells polarization axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The translational drift was taken as the average displacement of these beads and subtracted from the dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimate the error in our 3D displacement measurements by performing 3D imaging of stationary beads in a region of collagen far from any cells at t = 0 and again, t = 2 h. Identical imaging settings to those used for cell measurements were used, and a 3.5 mg/mL 30 °C collagen gel was chosen for analysis to minimize displacement transmission from distant cells to the imaging site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply our bead position-finding method at both time points and match beads over time with our tracking algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subtract translational drift from the dataset and then, plot a probability density function of the x, y, and z components of displacement for 6,371 beads in the imaging volume (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the displacements of our stationary beads, as measured from their positions at the two time points, have SDs of 49 nm in the x direction, 56 nm in the y direction, and 151 nm in the z direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greater error in the z direction is expected given our 330 × 330 × 1,000-nm (x, y, and z, respectively) voxel size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell_Size_and_Shape_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A 2D outline of each cell was manually drawn onto a z projection of the bright-field image stack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D outline was then projected into 3D space knowing the z locations of each of two cell tips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area moment of inertia tensor was calculated and used to determine the orientation of the cells major and minor axes, and aspect ratio was calculated from the area moment of inertia tensor (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Collagen_Rheology  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A TA Instruments DHR3 Shear Rheometer was used for mechanical characterization of collagen gels with the 25-mm parallel-plate geometry and a 500-µm gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent slip between the gel and the plate, no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 25-mm cover glasses (VWR) were surface activated with glutaraldehyde (as described for the collagen imaging device) and attached to each plate of the rheometer with double-sided tape (3M 666).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rheometer was then zeroed and calibrated; 270 L collagen was pipetted onto the rheometer, the gap was set to 500 m, and the sample was sealed with mineral oil to prevent evaporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polymerization progress was monitored by imposing three cycles of 0.5% strain every 5 min, measuring the shear storage modulus G as a function of polymerization time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unglycated matrices were polymerized for at least 60 min and glycated for at least 80 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Peltier plate attached to the bottom plate of the rheometer was used for temperature control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the strain-stiffening tests, collagen matrices were subjected to 10 oscillations at 0.1 Hz at increasing shear strain amplitudes from 2 to 12% strain in 2% increments and from 12 to 40% strain in 4% increments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Collagen_Fiber_Visualization_in_the_Vicinity_of_Live_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To visualize the collagen fibers in the vicinity of live cells, cells were first labeled with 2 mM 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (Invitrogen) for 30 min on a tissue culture plate and then, washed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in growth media for 1 h before harvesting for collagen polymerization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were incubated for 1 d (1828 h) and then, imaged with the 40× N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 1.1 water immersion lens of a Zeiss 880 Confocal Point Scanning Microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An onstage incubator was used to maintain temperature at 37 °C and atmosphere at 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A confocal fluorescent z stack was first captured of the live cell followed by a confocal reflectance stack of the collagen fibers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Collagen_Pore_and_Fiber_Diameter_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To measure pore diameter of each collagen matrix, 3D confocal reflectance images were acquired using the 40× N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 1.1 water immersion lens of a Zeiss 710 Confocal Point Scanning Microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3D confocal reflectance images measuring 306 × 306 × 50 µm were captured in the collagen bulk, with a voxel size of 0.20 × 0.20 × 0.50 µm (x, y, and z, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were subsequently subtracted with background images (10-pixel radius).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 3D Gaussian filter with sigma of one voxel was applied, and the images were autothresholded using the methods by Huang and Wang (54) in ImageJ (NIH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D images were further skeletonized using the 3D thinning algorithm of the Skeletonize3D ImageJ plugin (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that confocal reflectance microscopy has a blind spot, failing to capture fibers that are oriented too far out of the imaging plane (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We take these invisible fibers into account when calculating pore diameter according to the methodology presented in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collagen pore diameter was measured using a simplified 3D bubble method (49, 57, 58) and the nearest obstacle distance method (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from the nearest obstacle distance method have already been scaled by 1.82, which was suggested by the authors for comparison with the converging radius transform (59) or equivalently, the 3D bubble method (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results from both methods have been corrected for the blind spot in confocal microscopy assuming a 50° cutoff angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fiber diameter measurements, the entire length of the skeletonized matrix in the image volume was measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average fiber diameter was then calculated knowing the concentration of collagen and the cutoff angle for the blind spot in confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

f-Actin_Staining__Visualization__and_Classification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cell-embedded collagen matrices were polymerized as described previously, with the exceptions that seeding density was 80,000 cells per 1 mL and that the cover glass was no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell-embedded collagen matrices were then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 1 d. Cells were fixed in 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde (fresh EM grade) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Permeabalization was performed with 5 mL 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blocking was performed with 5 mL 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were stained with phalloidin-TRITC at 1:200 (0.3 g/mL working concentration) in 1% BSA and PBS for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Washes were performed with room temperature PBS between each step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PBS was removed, and each device was immersed in a 4/5 solution of Slowfade Antifade Agent (Thermofisher Scientific) to achieve a refractive index of 1.40 after dilution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging was performed beginning 1 h later using the 40× N.A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 1.1 water immersion objective of a Zeiss 880 Inverted Point Scanning Confocal Microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lens collar was adjusted to 190 µm to yield optimal spherical aberration correction at 120-µm depth into the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3D image stacks of first fluorescent phallodin and then, reflectance images of collagen fibers were recorded for each cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate distance from the cover glass as a variable in image quality and cell behavior, cells were imaged at as equal depths as possible for each condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distances of the nearest point of the cell from the cover glass were 128 ± 30 µm for 1.0 mg/mL 37 °C, 126 ± 29 µm for 2.0 mg/mL 30 °C, and 122 ± 27 µm for 3.5 mg/mL 22 °C (mean ± SD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were manually classified for the presence of actin filaments aligned in the direction of the cells major axis by viewing 3D image stacks for each cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images displayed in Fig 4C are maximum intensity z projections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Influence_of_the_Radius_of_Curvature_at_the_Cell_Tips_on_the_Range_of_Displacement_Propagation_and_Cell_Force_Generation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As discussed in Materials and Methods, polarized cells in our simulations are idealized as ellipsoids within the collagen matrices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The input to the computational model is the tracked displacement field near the cell, which is imposed as a boundary condition on the edge of the ellipsoid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aspect ratio of each ellipsoid in our simulations is the aspect ratio measured from bright-field images of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that real cells may have thin protrusions at their tips that have a radius of curvature much less than that of the ellipsoid that we use to represent the cell in our simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the effect of the radius of curvature at the cell tips on cell force production and the range of displacement propagation, we replace the ellipsoidal voids shown in Fig 5 with sharp conical voids for comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S8 illustrates that approximating the cell with an ellipsoid has only a slight effect on the range of displacement propagation along the long axis of the cell compared with approximating the cells shape as conical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig S8 represents a direct comparison between the ellipsoidal and conical voids, because they have the same experimentally determined aspect ratio and boundary conditions (determined from images of the cell and the tracked bead displacement fields).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is noted that stress singularities occur in our simulations at the cell tips when the cell is modeled as a perfect sharp conical void.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In finite element models, stress singularities frequently occur at sharp reentrant corners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured stress in the vicinity of the sharp corner (singular point) is nonconvergent with respect to mesh refinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid the stress singularity at the cell tips, the sharp conical tips are slightly rounded with a radius of curvature 0.01L µm, where L is the length of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conical tip approximates the shape of a thin protrusion from a real cell, which has a finite radius of curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, although the corner stress singularity disappears with rounding the tips, stress concentrations are still observed in the vicinity of the cell tips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike the case of the sharp cone stress singularity, the measured local stress converges to a finite value, with mesh refinement allowing for quantification of force with our simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our simulations show that stress concentration at the tips will not significantly affect the cell-generated traction forces (along its major axis) as depicted in Fig S8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results show that, for a given displacement field (boundary condition), the total force exerted by the cell and the range of displacement propagation in the collagen matrices will not significantly change when the cell is modeled as an ellipsoid vs. conical void.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Finite_Element_Implementation_of_the_Fiber_Network-Inspired_Continuum_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An improved fiber network-inspired material model was used for this study, in which we used one order higher equation (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7) to better capture the continuity of the shear modulus in experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original network-based constitutive law can be found in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned in the text, the discrete fiber network simulations clearly show that there are two distinct families of fibers when an initially isotropic fibrous matrix undergoes large tensile strain (24, 34): (i) the set of fibers that is aligned in the maximum principal stretch direction under tension and (ii) the set of fibers that does not orient along the maximum principal stretch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first set of fibers (aligned fibers) causes the strain stiffening observed in our experiments at large strains (shear strains larger than c), whereas the second set of fibers (isotropic fibers) represents the isotropic behavior of matrices at small strains (shear strains below c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To account for the presence of these two fiber families in our fiber network-inspired continuum model, the total energy density of the collagen network, W, is assumed to be composed of two parts (24):W=WI+WF,[S1]where WI and WF are the energy density contributions from the isotropic and aligned fibers, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isotropic contribution of the total energy density, WI, is here described as a neo-Hookean hyperelastic material:WI=2(I¯13)+2(J1)2,[S2]in which =E/(3(12v)), =E/(2(1+v)), and E are the initial bulk, shear, and Young moduli of the matrix, respectively (moduli at 0); v is the Poissons ratio; and J=det(F) is the Jacobian of the deformation gradient tensor Fij=xi/Xj, where X and x denote the reference and current configurations, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deformation gradient tensor F can be multiplicatively split as F=FisoFv=FvFiso, where Fiso=J1/3F and Fv=J1/3I are the isochoric (volume preserving) and volumetric components of F, respectively (I is the second-order identity tensor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the isochoric/volumetric split of the deformation gradient, I¯1=tr(Biso)=tr(Ciso) in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 is defined as the first strain invariant of Biso and Ciso tensors, where Biso=FisoFisoT=J2/3B is the isochoric left CauchyGreen strain tensor, and Ciso=FisoTFiso=J2/3C is the isochoric right CauchyGreen strain tensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The left and right CauchyGreen strain tensors B=FFT and C=FTF can be written as functions of the principal stretches 1, 2, and 3 via the spectral representationB=a=13a2nana,C=a=13a2NaNa,[S3]where the orthogonal vectors Na and na=RNa (with a=1,2,3) are the unit vectors in the principal stretch directions for the reference and current configurations, respectively; R is the orthogonal rotation tensor; and  denotes here the dyadic product of two arbitrary vectors u and v as (uv)ij=uivj.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The energy density contribution from the aligned fibers, WF, is defined as followsWF=a=13f(a),[S4]where the energy function f(a) is chosen, such that (i) the energy density contribution from the aligned fibers, WF, vanishes below a critical value of tensile stretch, and (ii) the matrix stiffens only in the direction of (tensile) principal stretches when a is larger than the (tensile) stretch critical value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similar to the total energy density W in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1, the Cauchy stress tensor =I+F is decomposed into isotropic, I, and fibrous, F, parts (24):I=J(Biso13tr(Biso)I)+(J1)I[S5]andF=a=13anana=1Ja=13f(a)aanana,[S6]where the derivative of the energy function f(a) is defined as f(a)a={0aless_than1Ef(a121)n(a1)2(n+1)(n+2)1aless_than2Ef[(1+a2)m+21(m+1)(m+2)+2am+1+(a2)(21)n+1+(21)2(n+1)(n+2)]a2[S7]to ensure that the first and second derivatives of the stress-strain curve are continuous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is seen in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 that f(a)/a and subsequently, the principal stress a defined in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S6 vanish for a below 1=c0.5t, where c and t=0.25c are the critical (tensile) principal stretch and transition width, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A smooth interpolation function (transition function) is used for 1aless_than2 to ensure the continuity of the stress-strain curve derivative at the transition point 2=c+0.5t, where Ef and n are the stiffened elastic modulus and transition constant, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a2, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 shows the stiffened response of the matrix characterized by Ef and m (strain-hardening constant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For finite element implementation of the constitutive law, the elasticity tensor in the material description (referential tensor of elasticities) Ref, is first defined as (60)Ref,=SE=2SC=42WCC,[S8]in which S and E=(CI)/2 are the second PiolaKirchhoff and GreenLagrange strain tensors, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth-order tensor Ref, (superscript  denotes the Kirchhoff stress tensor , which is related to the Cauchy stress tensor  as =J) in the referential configuration is related to the elasticity tensor in the spatial description (spatial tensor of elasticities) for the convected rate of the Kirchhoff stress, Spat,, as follows:ijklSpat,=FimFjnFkpFlqmnpqRef,,[S9]where ijklSpat, is, in turn, related to the tangent modulus tensor for the Jaumann rate of the Kirchhoff stress, , by (61)ijkl=ijklSpat,+ikjl+ikjl,[S10]which finally yields the material Jacobian tensor  as=1J.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S11]The material Jacobian tensor  in our constitutive law is decomposed into isotropic, ,I, and fibrous, ,F, parts:=,I+,F,[S12]withijkl,I=J(12(ikB¯jl+B¯ikjl+ilB¯jk+B¯iljk)23(ijB¯kl+B¯ijkl)+29ijklB¯mm)+(2J1)ijkl[S13]and,F=1Ja=13a(1af(a)a)Saa3nananana+a,b=1ab3ba2ab2b2a2(nanbnanb+nanbnbna)+I¯F+F¯I,[S14]where B¯=Biso, Sa is the principal value of the second PiolaKirchhoff stress tensor S,  denotes the products of (i) two arbitrary vectors u and v as (uv)ij=uivj and (ii) two arbitrary second-order tensors A and B as (AB)ijkl=AijBkl, and ¯ represents the product of two arbitrary second-order tensors A and B as (A¯B)ijkl=AikBjl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that ab when ab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the expression (ba2ab2)/(b2a2) in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S14 gives us 0/0 and must be, therefore, determined as (60)limbaba2ab2b2a2=12dadaaa,[S15]where the principal stress a is obtained froma=1Jf(a)aa.[S16]Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S14 also requires the second derivative of the energy function f(a), which can be directly derived from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 as follows:2f(a)a2={0aless_than1Ef(a121)n(a1)n+11aless_than2Ef[(1+a2)m+11m+1+21n+1]a2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S17]  #@NEW_LINE#@#
