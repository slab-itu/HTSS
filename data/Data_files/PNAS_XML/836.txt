title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Romes urban history inferred from Pb-contaminated waters trapped in its ancient harbor basins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Isotopic evidence showing that Romes lead water pipes were the primary source of lead pollution in the citys runoff reveals the sedimentary profile of lead pollution in the harbor at Ostia to be a sensitive record of the growth of Romes water distribution system and hence, of the city itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The introduction of this lead pipe network can now be dated to around the second century BC, testifying to a delay of about a century and a half between the introduction of Romes aqueduct system and the installation of a piped grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diachronic evolution of anthropogenic lead contamination is able to capture the main stages of ancient Rome's urbanization until its peak during the early high empire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Heavy metals from urban runoff preserved in sedimentary deposits record long-term economic and industrial development via the expansion and contraction of a citys infrastructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lead concentrations and isotopic compositions measured in the sediments of the harbor of OstiaRomes first harborshow that lead pipes used in the water supply networks of Rome and Ostia were the only source of radiogenic Pb, which, in geologically young central Italy, is the hallmark of urban pollution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution geochemical, isotopic, and 14C analyses of a sedimentary core from Ostia harbor have allowed us to date the commissioning of Romes lead pipe water distribution system to around the second century BC, considerably later than Romes first aqueduct built in the late fourth century BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even more significantly, the isotopic record of Pb pollution proves to be an unparalleled proxy for tracking the urban development of ancient Rome over more than a millennium, providing a semiquantitative record of the water systems initial expansion, its later neglect, probably during the civil wars of the first century BC, and its peaking in extent during the relative stability of the early high Imperial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This core record fills the gap in the systems history before the appearance of more detailed literary and inscriptional evidence from the late first century BC onward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also preserves evidence of the changes in the dynamics of the Tiber River that accompanied the construction of Romes artificial port, Portus, during the first and second centuries AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Stratigraphy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stratigraphy of the PO2 core can be subdivided into three main sedimentary units: preharbor (unit A), harbor (unit B), and postharbor (unit C) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) Unit A is represented by bedded and shelly gray sands with Posidonia, attesting to a depositional environment of deltaic progradation up to the middle of the fourth century BC (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Unit B is further subdivided into two subunits, B1 and B2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subunit B1 forms the lower harbor sequence characterized by compact dark gray silt suggestive of a quiet environment and lasting until the beginning of the second century BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Subunit B2 forms the upper harbor sequence and contains levels of yellow sands brought in by repetitive floods of the Tiber, which occurred from the second century BC to the third century AD according to the 14C age-depth model (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) Unit Cs yellow bedded silts from the third century AD onward represent floodplain deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Elemental_Concentrations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The lowest Pb values are consistent with the natural Pb background level of 22 ppm of the Tiber delta sediments (13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pb enrichment factor (EFPb) records the relative enrichment of Pb relative to the natural environment (EFPb = 1 signifies no Pb excess).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution of EFPb in the harbor deposits (Fig 1) goes from (i) values slightly above the natural Pb background level at the base of the stratigraphic section in the preharbor unit A located between 12- and 9-m core depth, with a mean EFPb of 2.2, to (ii) values highly above the natural Pb background in the harbor subunit B2 (between 6- and 3-m core depth; mean EFPb  3.8), with three peaks reaching EFPb values up to 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The stratigraphic record of Pb concentrations varies in concert with the presence of detrital material, magnetic susceptibility, and to a lesser extent, the median grain size (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EFPb peaks in subunit B2 attest to a high-energy regime of fluvial activity (gray shadings in Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factor analysis of major and trace element abundances clearly identifies the siliciclastic component with terrigenous elements, such as the rare earth elements, K, Mn, and Ba, as the first factor (F1) (Fig 1, Fig S2, and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lead concentrations of the bulk sediment are tightly associated with F1 (Fig 1) (r = 0.66 between EFPb and F1), which emphasizes that the terrigenous fraction is the main carrier of this element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factor 4 (F4) inferred from the factor analysis opposes Na to heavy metals, such as Pb, Sn, and Cd (Fig 1, Fig S2, and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong influence of Na within the stratigraphy reflects either the salinity of the harbor itself or the invasion of the sediments by the salt wedge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are negatively correlated with the proportion of anthropogenic material carried by the Tiber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both the Trajanic and Ostia harbors, the association of the ostracodal marine group with high sediment Na contents is clear evidence of a marine-dominated environment (11, 14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lead_Isotope_Compositions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The labile Pb can be broken down into three well-defined components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2, the 204Pb/206Pb vs. 208Pb/206Pb vs. 207Pb/206Pb 3D plot shows an apparently ternary mixture between geologically recent Pb (components  and ) and old Pb (component ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent natural Pb is a mixture of volcanic Pb from the Alban Hills (component ) and sedimentary Pb from the Mediterranean outflow water (component  present in local carbonate sediments) well-separated by different 208Pb/206Pb values (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact isotope compositions of the natural components  and  (Table S3) are somewhat arbitrary, but their specific assignment does not affect the conclusions reached about the order of magnitude and relative variations of the anthropogenic component  (Table S3 lists the Pb isotope composition of ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The anthropogenic origin of the old Pb that dominates subunit B2 (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 and 4) can be shown by converting the Pb isotope compositions into Pb model ages Tmod, 238U/204Pb (µ), and 232Th/238U () ratios (Table S3) using the equations given by Albarède et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advantages of this representation over that based on raw Pb isotope ratios have been shown in a number of geological and (geo)archeological contexts (24, 1619).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present case, Peninsular Italy is a geologically young mountain range (Tmod less_than 30 Ma); the presence of Hercynian Pb (Tmod  200 Ma) in Ostia sediments, therefore, unambiguously signals contamination of local waters by foreign Pb, likely lead artifacts (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative breakdown of Pb isotopes into natural and anthropogenic components as proposed by Delile et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) essentially reproduces the contamination patterns visible in the Tmod record of Ostia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the evolution of the anthropogenic Pb signal, we use another pollution index f, which is based on the proportion of the anthropogenic  component in the Ostia sediments (equation details are in Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond some minor trends, the EFPb, Tmod, f (Fig 4), and raw Pb isotope ratio records (Fig S3A) largely correlate, showing that the anthropogenic component does not fluctuate randomly but displays robust peaks and troughs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Natural_and_Anthropogenic_Pb_Sources  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3, the preharbor and early harbor samples from Ostia (core PO2) and Portus (cores TR14, CN1, and PTXI-3) plot along the mixing line between the two local subcomponents  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sandy preharbor sediments (unit A of core PO2 and most of core PTXI-3) show consistently higher values of 208Pb/206Pb (Fig S3B) and  (Fig 3) than the harbor sediments highly dominated by clays and silts (harbor subunit B1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be explained by changes in mineral sorting processes resulting from varying hydrodynamic levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Garçon et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (20), some heavy minerals concentrated in coarse sediments are extremely radiogenic, allowing sandy sediments to reach higher 208Pb/206Pb values (20) and thus, higher values of  (r of 208Pb/206Pb vs.   0.7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The intersection of two additional mixing linesbetween  and  and the third anthropogenic component reveals that  is Hercynian in age (Tmod  325 Ma) (Fig 3) and characterized by high 204Pb/206Pb (0.0546) (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sediments located on the mixing line - correspond to Pb-contaminated particles that were transported in turbulent conditions, explaining their presence exclusively in the sandy subunit B2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, sediments falling along the - trend were deposited under quieter hydrodynamic conditions, typically the silty floodplain deposits of unit C. Nevertheless, the whole of the Portus (cores TR14, CN1, and PTXI-3) and Ostia (core PO2) sediments (n = 177) affected by lead pollution converges toward the same distinct source, or mix of sources, of imported lead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Roman times, a substantial number of ships hulls were sheathed with large millimeter-thick lead plates to protect their submerged portions against fouling and corrosion (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lead plates, anchors, and sounding lead weights are, however, unlikely to have been significant contributors to the anthropogenic Pb signal of Ostia sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reasons for this are several.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in seawater, lead passivation by the deposition of a film of chlorides and carbonates is fast and efficient (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, because the earliest wreck with a hull sheathed in lead discovered so far dates to the midfourth century BC (23) and the practice had reached a peak by the end of the fourth century BC (21), if the sheathing of ships hulls was a significant lead pollution source, we would expect an excess of lead to be recorded in the functional harbor unit B1, which covers the fourth and third centuries BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such lead pollution does not occur, however, until the harbor unit B2, which was deposited at the end of the use of the harbor (11, 15), from around the second century BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the same way, the practice of lead sheathing of ships hulls was no longer significant from the middle of the first century AD (21), while Pb pollution of Romes harbor water column lasts until the ninth century AD (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, and most importantly, the anthropogenic component  is clearly homogenous (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3) (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is inconsistent with local contamination by vessels covered in lead plates of a variety of origins but consistent with distant sources well-mixed during the journey from Rome down the Tiber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the isotope abundances of component  match those of fistulae from the Roman urban water supply system (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The persistence of contamination for well over a millennium (200 BC to AD 800) and the uniqueness of its isotopic composition argue against random pollution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They rather suggest that a mechanism existed upstream from Ostia that efficiently mixed the isotopic compositions of all sources of anthropogenic Pb contributing to the anthropogenic signal so visible in the harbor sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Judging from the 20th century mean flow (230 m3/s) (24), around 3% (7 m3/s) of the Tibers water was running through Romes aqueducts at the peak of the Roman Empire (8, 25), a significant fraction of which passed through fistulae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lead from Rome fistulae, therefore, seems the only acceptable source of contamination in Ostia sediments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is not clear whether the Pb ores derive from one or more mining districts, but recycling and salvaging practices of lead implemented by Romans (6, 10, 26) favor a mixture from several Hercynian sources (Germany, Spain, England, France).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such recycling would have contributed significantly to the stability of the isotopic signature of the imported Pb component over the long period observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the conspicuous isotopic stability, in turn, argues for long-term stability in the lead trade networks between Rome and the western half of its empire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Control_Factors_of_Pb_Content  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Changes in two main processes control the variation in the Pb contents of the PO2 core: (i) the input of Pb in the hydrological system upstream of the core and (ii) the transport of that Pb to the PO2 site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major change in Pb inputs is the construction of the piped water distribution system in Rome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imported Pb of Romes pipes (with older Hercynian Tmod values) is progressively dissolved and transported down the Tiber to be deposited in the B2 and C units, except during disruptions to flow in the piped system occasioned by damage or neglect during political unrest, epidemics, natural disasters, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F1 and F4 correlate with two different transport processes: flooding by contaminated river water and dilution by uncontaminated seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The correlation of EFPb with particle size as well as with the magnetic susceptibility and F1 shows that Pb excesses in the bulk sediment trapped in the harbor basin of Ostia were associated with Tiber flooding episodes that acted as a transport vector of Pb pollution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, a period of increased river discharge (e.g., flooding) resulted in deposition of larger amounts of larger particles and hence, deposition of more Pb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In subunit B2, imported Pb is present in the labile rather than the bulk fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is correlated with F4 (r = 0.6) but not with F1 (r = 0.09).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F4 is dominated by heavy metals, such as Sn and Cd, which, like Tmod, signal anthropogenic influence and which are opposed to Na (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 250 and 500 cm, several striking drops in Pb contamination levels occur (206Pb/207Pb in Fig S3A), which consistently are accompanied by steep marine (F4) peaks (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It, therefore, seems that sudden, uncontaminated seawater inputs into the harbor basin invariably resulted in a decrease in Pb pollution, probably because of a dilution effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dilution by an uncontaminated source of water is commonly observed in both ancient harbors [for example, Sidon (27)] and fluvial environments [such as the Ruhr River, a tributary to the Rhine (28), the Caima River (Portugal) (29), and the Belle Fourche River (United States) (30)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Chronology_of_Lead_Pollution_and_Roman_Urbanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S4 reports errors on calendar ages from 200 BC to AD 300 using the values by Reimer et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (31) and shows that 14C chronology is particularly imprecise for the time interval covering the Roman Republic and Empire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a given value of 14C age, the range and, occasionally, the multiplicity of possible calendar ages in this interval are large, and uncertainties cannot be unambiguously represented by a single-error interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only those Pb isotope fluctuations that lasted in excess of age uncertainties are discussed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this caveat in mind, four main periods can nevertheless be distinguished from Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Major and trace element concentrations were determined by complete digestion of the bulk sediment, whereas Pb isotope compositions were measured only on the most labile fraction to emphasize the anthropogenic contribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large selection of major and trace element concentrations was measured for the 12-m-long Ostia core PO2 every 14 cm (86 samples) (Dataset S1), while only Pb concentrations were analyzed for 12 samples from core PTXI-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples from both cores were additionally measured for their Pb isotope compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Text has analytical details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The proportion f of the  component in the leachate is calculated by least squares using three sets of equations: for example,(Pb204Pb206)f+(Pb204Pb206)f+(Pb204Pb206)f=(Pb204Pb206)leach,  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
with similar equations for the 207Pb/206Pb and 208Pb/206Pb ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these equations, f is the proportion of 206Pb assigned to each component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A closure equation ensuring that all of the f values sum to one must be added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

After sieving at 63 µm, aliquots of 100 mg sediment were weighed into screw-top Savillex beakers and dissolved in a clean laboratory in laminar flow hoods using a 3:1:0.5 mixture of concentrated double-distilled HF, HNO3, and HClO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were left to attack at 120 °C to 130 °C for 48 h and then evaporated to dryness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perchlorates were converted to chlorides by drying down with 6 M distilled HCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were redissolved in 2 mL concentrated distilled HNO3, from which 10% aliquots were further diluted to 2% HNO3 and internal standards [10 ppm Sc for inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and 2 ppb In for quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Q-ICP-MS)] were added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major elements were analyzed by ICP-AES (ICAP 6000) and trace elements were analyzed by Q-ICP-MS (Agilent 7500 CX) at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper limit of blank contribution is negligible for major elements and less_than2% of the sample content for trace elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data are listed in Dataset S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lead_Isotope_Compositions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The same method as described in Delile (13) and Delile et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After sieving at 63 µm, representative aliquots of 500 mg sediment were weighed out into screw-top Savillex beakers and leached with hot Suprapur chloroform to separate the labile, or anthropogenic, component of the Pb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second leaching step was done with hot dilute double-distilled HBr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two leachates were combined and evaporated to dryness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lead from the leachates was then separated on anion exchange columns using distilled 1 M HBr to elute the sample matrix and distilled 6 M HCl to elute the Pb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample residues after leaching were not analyzed in this work because the isotopic composition of the natural Pb background had already been determined previously (2, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lead isotope compositions were measured by multicollector ICP-MS (Nu Plasma 500 HR) at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon using thallium doping, sample standard bracketing (53, 54), and the values for National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard 981 of Eisele et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total procedural Pb blank was less_than20 pg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The external reproducibility of the reported Pb isotope ratios as estimated from the repeated (every two samples) runs of NIST 981 is 100200 ppm (or 0.010.02%) for ratios based on 204 (206Pb/204Pb, 207Pb/204Pb, 208Pb/204Pb) and 50 ppm (or 0.005%) for 207Pb/206Pb, 208Pb/206Pb, and 207Pb/208Pb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pb isotope data are listed in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
