Insect haptoelectrical stimulation of Venus flytrap triggers exocytosis in gland cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Venus flytrap has been in the focus of scientists since Darwins time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carnivorous plants, with their specialized lifestyle, including insect capture, as well as digestion and absorption of prey, developed unique tools to gain scarce nutrients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we describe mechanistic insights into the cascade of events following the capture of insect prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Action potentials evoked by the struggling prey are translated into touch-inducible hormone signals that promote the formation of secretory vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different varieties of digestive compounds are released sequentially into the flytraps green stomach and break down the captured animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amperometry provides insight into the kinetics and chemistry of the stimulus-coupled glandular secretion process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Venus flytrap Dionaea muscipula captures insects and consumes their flesh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prey contacting touch-sensitive hairs trigger traveling electrical waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These action potentials (APs) cause rapid closure of the trap and activate secretory functions of glands, which cover its inner surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such prey-induced haptoelectric stimulation activates the touch hormone jasmonate (JA) signaling pathway, which initiates secretion of an acidic hydrolase mixture to decompose the victim and acquire the animal nutrients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although postulated since Darwins pioneering studies, these secretory events have not been recorded so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using advanced analytical and imaging techniques, such as vibrating ion-selective electrodes, carbon fiber amperometry, and magnetic resonance imaging, we monitored stimulus-coupled glandular secretion into the flytrap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trigger-hair bending or direct application of JA caused a quantal release of oxidizable material from gland cells monitored as distinct amperometric spikes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spikes reminiscent of exocytotic events in secretory animal cells progressively increased in frequency, reaching steady state 1 d after stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that trigger-hair mechanical stimulation evokes APs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gland cells translate APs into touch-inducible JA signaling that promotes the formation of secretory vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early vesicles loaded with H+ and Cl fuse with the plasma membrane, hyperacidifying the green stomach-like digestive organ, whereas subsequent ones carry hydrolases and nutrient transporters, together with a glutathione redox moiety, which is likely to act as the major detected compound in amperometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, when glands perceive the haptoelectrical stimulation, secretory vesicles are tailored to be released in a sequence that optimizes digestion of the captured animal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon haptoelectric trap activation, the surface area of the multicellular gland cell complex increases by 30% and an acidic protein moiety is released into the green stomach formed by the hermetically sealed lobes of the trap (3, 57, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In search of the membrane reservoir responsible for the surface increase of stimulated glands, we exposed traps to the JA-Ile mimic COR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty-eight hours after stimulus onset, membrane pits observed in electron micrographs (EMs) of glands suggested that secretory vesicle fusion had taken place predominantly at the apical end of head cells (outermost cell layer or L1) (Fig 1 and Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Head cells of nonstimulated glands only occasionally showed exocytotic vesicles (1.5 ± 0.4 per cell; Fig 1 A and C), but in the outermost layer of JA-stimulated glands cells, we detected a pronounced increase of pits associated with the more apical plasma membrane sections (16.5 ± 1.5 per cell, 0.18 m in diameter; Fig 1 B, D, and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the secretory stimulation causes granule docking and membrane fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Microelectrode_Ion_Flux_Measuring_Resolves_Early_Secretion_of_Acidic_Vesicles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a previous study, we compared the transcriptomic profile of nonstimulated glands with the transcriptomic profile of glands stimulated by either insects or COR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before stimulation, the transcription profile of resting glands is already dominated by secretory processes (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dionaea secretion is directly coupled to acidification; H+ and chloride, Cl, are released into the digestive fluid of the tightly sealed trap (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether touch stimulation of the flytraps trigger hairs is translated into ion fluxes across the gland plasma membrane, we used Ca2+-, Cl-, and H+-sensitive microelectrode ion flux measuring (MIFE) microelectrodes (3, 16), which measure fluxes by recording local concentration gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After five to 10 consecutive trigger-hair stimulations and a lag time of about 10 min, a rapid shift in the net ion fluxes toward net Ca2+ uptake into the gland cells was observed (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean net Ca2+ flux after mechanical stimulation (five APs) of the Venus flytrap was about 9.9 ± 1.8 nmolm2s1 (Fig 2B; mean ± SE, n = 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the first hour following stimulation, the ion fluxes were dominated by Ca2+ fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon Ca2+ entry, the intracellular Ca2+ level rises (6) and JA signaling is activated (3, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either consecutive trigger-hair stimulation alone or a direct application of JAs or COR induces secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With JAs, secretion in traps is initiated before they close (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following application of JAs, however, Ca2+-sensitive MIFE electrodes did not record net Ca2+ flux into glands (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hormone stimulation triggered proton release, however, which appeared within 510 min following stimulation onset (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Net H+ efflux reached its peak between 1 and 2.5 h after stimulus application and then gradually recovered (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When comparing the time that glands required to reach peak proton extrusion in response to mechanical or chemical stimulation, JAs were the fastest (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, JA-induced proton release was significantly faster than proton release elicited by mechanical stimulation (Fig 2C, Inset), which reached peak currents of 54 ± 7 nmolm2s1 (mean ± SE, n = 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also the lag time of H+ efflux resulting from the different stimulations was longest in response to mechanical stimulation (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This time dependence fits the notion that the rise in gland JA is downstream of haptoelectrics and gland calcium entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regardless of whether it was stimulated or not, the resting membrane potential of glands remained in the range of 120 to 140 mV (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding might indicate that trap acidification results from electroneutral exocytotic H+ release rather than the massive activation of plasma membrane proton pumps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion is supported by the COR-induced increase in vacuolar AHA10-type proton pump transcripts (17), together with the proton pump transcripts of a ClC-type proton-chloride antiporter (18), two components required for hyperacidification of secretory vesicles (SI Text and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether H+ fluxes are accompanied by Cl fluxes, we used chloride-sensitive MIFE electrodes side-by-side with the pH microelectrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirming our working model, we monitored pronounced Cl net efflux from glands in COR-stimulated traps (Fig 2E; blue), but not in resting (Fig 2E; gray) traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COR-induced chloride currents appeared with a similar time dependence and amplitude as the proton fluxes (Fig 2 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both fluxes were correlated with each other (R2 = 0.61, P less_than 0.01), exhibiting a stoichiometry between H+ and Cl close to 1:1 (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrochemistry-based MIFE experiments illustrated above can only be conducted in an aqueous environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such a wet scenario, we monitored initial secretion-associated proton extrusion in response to COR about 9 min after stimulation (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To resolve the onset of gross gland fluid secretion in the initially dry Dionaea trap, we followed the fluid production after COR stimulation by infrared gas analysis (IRGA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, fluid phase secretion-associated trap water vapor emission was detected in IRGA recordings 151 ± 13 min (n = 3, mean ± SD) following trap stimulation with COR (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After reaching peak humidity, trap water emission slowly decreased and suddenly dropped after 445 ± 84 min (n = 3, mean ± SD) to the basal level of evaporation before COR application and in nonstimulated controls (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rapid drop in water emission reflects hermetical sealing of the trap lobes (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Filling of the closed trap with digestive fluid was visualized by MRI (Fig S3B and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detection_of_Digestive_Vesicles_via_Amperometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With animal cells, exocytotic events can be monitored noninvasively via amperometry, detecting redox currents when electrodes are placed near the membrane surface of secretory cells (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that amperometry detects oxidizable substances, such as neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and hormones released from secretory vesicles, we adopted this electrochemical approach to probe for exocytotic events in active flytrap glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aiming to detect spikes associated with secretory cargo release from the inner trap surface, we placed carbon fiber microelectrodes in contact with the apical face of the glands upper head cells (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these experimental conditions, no amperometric signals were detectable in nonstimulated glands (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with glands stimulated by five to 20 trigger-hair displacements, signals similar to the signals measured with secretory animal cells could be monitored (21, 22) (Fig 3A), albeit with a much slower time course due to cell wall geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When placing two electrodes next to each other, both electrodes recorded characteristic increases in amperometric current in a close temporal relationship, as shown in Fig 3 A and B, excluding the possibility that such discrete events were artifacts generated in one or the other electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, we had to use strong pH buffering to preserve the sensitivity of the amperometric electrodes (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The amperometrically detected chemical species is released to the apoplast at the point of exocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From that point source, the released substance diffuses to the electroactive tip of the carbon fiber, where it is oxidized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that placing electrodes more than several microns away from the cell surface results in a significant decrease in signal and spatiotemporal resolution (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the best scenario for detecting exocytotic events without diffusional dilution is to touch the cell surface with the electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This limitation by diffusion can be described by Ficks law.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we fitted the amperometrically detected spikes with a 3D diffusion equation according to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this calculation, we gained a parameter, tc, which is a characteristic diffusion time, depending on the distance between the point source of secretion and the carbon fiber tip, given a certain diffusion coefficient, D. Fitting sharp secretory events observed when electrodes were placed directly on the Dionaea gland surface with a high spatiotemporal resolution resulted in tc values of about 45 s. Plotting the relative signal abundance against the calculated tc values of detected secretory events, a broadly homogeneous distribution was obtained (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the amperometric approach we used detects secretory events originating from various distances to the tip of the carbon fiber or else implies a range of diffusion coefficients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we did not obtain any tc values 3.15 s in 63 analyzed spikes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a constant D value in the performed experiments and tc  3.15 s, we can calculate a lower bound for the geometrical distance between the point of secretion and the carbon fiber (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) and the diffusion constant, D, of the secreted substance in the medium (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to animal cells, the plasma membrane of plant cells is covered with an extra layer of cellulose-based cell wall and a lipid-based cuticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the minimal tc value obtained for Dionaea glands very likely results from the cell wall-cuticle shell that keeps the fiber electrode at some distance (r) from exocytotic vesicles fusing with the gland cell plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From EMs similar to the EMs shown in Fig 1, we calculated a minimal distance between the electrode and secreted vesicle fusing with the head gland cell plasma membrane of 0.5 m (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introducing this value in the Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, we are able to calculate the diffusion constant of the fluid secreted from Dionaea in its diffusion medium (containing the cell wall and cuticle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated value of D = 1.92 × 1010 cm2s1 indicates a high diffusional resistance of the gland cell wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, the diffusion coefficient of dopamine in water was reported at 6.0 × 106 cm2s1 (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in the animal system, diffusion in tissue or in solutions containing biological macromolecules is known to be hindered by the cellular matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hafez et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (26) have reported that the diffusion coefficient of dopamine at the surface of an adrenal cell is one-tenth compared with its diffusion in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small diffusion constant reported here for Dionaea also illustrates the slow time characteristics of the detected amperometric spikes with a half-life (t1/2) time constant of 87.82 ± 12.14 s (mean ± SE, n = 92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the free aqueous diffusion of catecholamine release in neuronal cells, the t1/2 of Dionaea plant secretory events is enlarged by a factor of 10,000 (24, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine emergence and manifestation of gland cell exocytosis, we monitored the frequency of secretory events for up to 145 h. Traps were stimulated either mechanically by a series of 20 consecutive trigger-hair bendings or by spraying COR onto the traps inner surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the first 45 h after stimulation onset, no significant signals could be monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first exocytosis-type spiking was observed after about 6 h (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, exocytotic events occurred more frequently, reaching about half-maximum spiking after 1213 h. Maximal spiking rates were detected after 24 h and remained high for another 2 d before slowly declining at days 4 and 6 (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, COR stimulation and trigger-hair bendings resulted in a similar time dependence of spiking frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that JA induction of secretory vesicle formation, loading, and membrane fusion, rather than touch induction of JA biosynthesis, represents the rate-limiting step during Dionaea gland cell exocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also found that the Ca2+ channel blocker gadolinium strongly reduced the volume of secreted fluid (Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the inhibitory effect of Gd3+ on trap secretory fluid production further, traps were sprayed with 10 mM Gd3+ (2.5 mol) 24 h before mechanical stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Gd3+ challenge did not affect the traps naturally fast closure in response to two trigger-hair strikes, however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When traps were mechanically stimulated for secretion by five to 20 trigger-hair displacements, gadolinium-sprayed traps were found to be strongly reduced in extruded fluid volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with control traps, which secreted 2.12 ± 0.67 L per 1,000 glands within 48 h, Gd3+-pretreated traps released only 0.35 ± 0.25 L per 1,000 glands (Fig 3C, black bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, exocytotic events amperometrically determined with single gland cells dropped from 14.3 ± 4.17 events per hour in controls to 2.1 ± 2.45 events per hour in the Gd3+-exposed traps (Fig 3C, red bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pronounced Gd3+ block of secretion seen by amperometry and MRI suggests that JA and calcium signaling is required for haptoelectric and JA stimulation of Dionaea gland cell secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
What kind of redox moiety does Dionaeas secretory gland cells release?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain and maintain functional integrity of cysteine-rich hydrolytic enzymes exuded into the digestive fluid (13, 27, 28), a defined redox status in the extracellular bioreactor is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glutathione (GSH) represents an important redox regulator of enzyme functions in plant cells (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSH can be derived from activated sulfate [adenosine 5-phosphosulfate (APS)] via a well-known enzymatic pathway (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression analysis based on RNA-sequencing data (available at tbro.carnivorom.com; cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7) indicated that COR might induce genes involved in GSH production and transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses were further confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these genes, the APS reductase (DmAPR3) is strongly up-regulated 12 h after COR stimulation (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  APS reductase represents the most important regulatory enzyme of the pathway that determines the flux of sulfate into organic sulfur compounds in plants (31, reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the availability of C-N skeletons for cysteine synthesis is promoted in response to the JA mimic through enhanced serine O-acetyltransferase (DmSERAT2) expression and through cysteine synthesis by itself via elevated O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (DmOASTL) expression (33) (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the putative GSH transporter, oligopeptide transporter 6 (DmOPT6), is transcriptionally induced after COR treatment as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, all four transcripts are induced by both COR or prey capture in a similar fashion (Fig 4 BD and tbro.carnivorom.com).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, enhanced sulfate reduction and assimilation seems to be required for both the synthesis of cysteine-rich hydrolytic enzymes and additional synthesis of GSH, which can be detected in the secreted fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether GSH is released into the extracellular compartment, we sampled digestive fluids from stimulated flytraps and analyzed the samples for the presence of antioxidants (3436).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we could detect GSH in Dionaeas extracellular fluid (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to GSH, however, ascorbate was not detectable by state-of-the-art methods (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the GSH concentration in whole Dionaea traps was not significantly altered by COR treatment, the stomach GSH concentration was on the order of 10 M 48 h after stimulation onset (Fig 4A, red bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the sensitivity of the carbon fibers used in our amperometric analysis toward this reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, we performed experiments with defined GSH concentrations (Fig S1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, the reduced GSH was oxidized at the positively charged carbon fiber, resulting in a positive current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the amperometric current, detected with a constant potential of +900 mV in solutions of defined GSH concentrations, saturated with a half-maximal concentration of 10 M (Fig S1E), which corresponds well with the actual GSH concentration in the secreted fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is likely that under our conditions, secreted GSH is detected in the amperometric analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we expect the amperometry to detect additional electroactive substances besides GSH released in the secreted fluid of stimulated Venus flytraps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Text  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
JA signaling stimulates the expression of vesicle acidification-associated transcripts in Dionaea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accumulate high vacuolar H+ concentrations, lemon fruits engage unique P-type ATPase (48) at the tonoplast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orthologous ATPase in Dionaea DmAHA10 is expressed in resting Dionaea glands and is up-regulated upon insect, mechanical, and COR stimulation (7) (Fig S2 and tbro.carnivorom.com).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas protons are accompanied by the citrate anion in the lemon system, chloride is the counter anion in Dionaea (15) (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In bacteria and plants, ClC-type anion channels operate as H+/anion antiporters (4951).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dionaea glands express a ClC-type anion channel already in the resting state, which is transcriptionally further induced upon trap stimulation (7) (DmCLCc; Fig S2 and tbro.carnivorom.com).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the JA-signaling inhibitor coronatine-methyloxime (COR-MO) suppressed mechanostimulation-induced transcription (Fig S2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that gland DmCLC expression and chloride release (Fig 2E and Fig S2) are triggered by touch and that the touch hormone mimics COR complements early findings that stimulated head cells of the gland accumulate chloride and disperse it after vacuolar fragmentation (2, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these studies, the appearance of Cl in the outer walls of stimulated Dionaea glands was correlated to vacuolar fragmentation into vesicles and their fusion with the plasma membrane (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption is supported by our ion-selective MIFE studies monitoring the release of Cl and H+ about 1 h after gland stimulation (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The molecular machinery underlying secretory vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane in animal cells is known in great detail (3840).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon chemical or electrical stimulation of secretory animal cells, exocytotic events can be detected within milliseconds (4144).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these fast-responding cells, certain pools of preformed cargo-loaded vesicles are released immediately after stimulus onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following haptoelectric calcium entry in Dionaea glands, JA signaling triggers vesicle acidification and de novo synthesis of secretory proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that carbon fiber electrodes detect amperometric signals no earlier than about 6 h after mechanical and JA stimulation (Fig 3D) may indicate that the oxidizable compound, most likely the tripeptide GSH, is contained only in those vesicles equipped with hydrolases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the acidic extracellular digestive fluid, GSH is very stable, providing for a proper redox state for sustained hydrolase activity (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dionaeas secretion events occur on a slow time scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent diffusion constant of released substances, as calculated from the waveform of the amperometric signal, was D = 1.92 × 1010 cm2s1, which indicates a high diffusional resistance of the gland cell wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, the diffusion constant of catecholamines in aqueous solution is 1 × 106 to 8 × 107 cm2s1 (19, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, diffusion in the cell wall of Dionaea glands is about four orders of magnitude slower than diffusion of small molecules in aqueous solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to fast synaptic signaling in the nervous system of animals, this slow diffusion, as well as the slow time course of release, reflects the biology of the insect-processing flytrap: Once Dionaea captures prey via its fast haptoelectric sensing system, exocytotic release and slow diffusion of a tailored hydrolase mixture into the digestive fluid perfectly serves the long-term nutrient needs of the plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To access the inner trap surface for amperometric recordings (even in stimulated plants), unstimulated traps in the open position were fixed in a chamber and mechanically locked to prevent trap closure upon stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For inhibitor pretreatments, plants were sprayed with 10 mM GdCl3, or H2O as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-four hours after pretreatments, traps were stimulated for secretion either mechanically (touch of trigger hairs five to 10 times within 1 min) or by hormone spraying (100 M COR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the given time points after stimulation, amperometric measurements were performed with open-fixed traps still attached to the plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chamber was filled with standard bath solution [1 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7)] and placed on a microscope stage (Zeiss Axioscope 2 FS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A three-electrode configuration was used, where an Ag/AgCl electrode served as the reference electrode grounding the bath solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two sensory carbon fiber electrodes with a diameter of 5 m (ALA Scientific Instruments) were used for amperometric detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon fibers were gently placed on top of the gland head cells if not stated otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During amperometric recordings, electrodes were held at +900 mV with two VA-10X amperometry amplifiers (ALA Scientific Instruments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidative current was acquired via VA-10X amplifiers and digitized at 20 kHz through an ITC-18 digital-to-analog convertor (InstruTECH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were acquired using Patch master (HEKA Elektronik) and analyzed with a custom-written fit running under Igor 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detected events were described by following equations (47):f(x)=M/(t-t0)1.5*exp(-tc/(t-t0)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, t0 is the time of signal onset (a free-fitting parameter) and M depends on the amount of secreted substance as well as on the diffusion coefficient, D. The parameter tc depends on D and the distance, r, between the point source of secretion and the carbon fiber tip according to:tc=r2/4D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Dionaea plants were grown as described previously (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, Dionaea muscipula plants were purchased from CRESCO Carnivora and grown in plastic pots at 22 °C in a 16-h/8-h light/dark photoperiod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For COR treatments, traps were directly sprayed with a 100 M COR solution (SigmaAldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isolation of secretory gland complexes was achieved by gently abrading the inner trap surface using a sharp razor blade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mechanical induction of gene expression, trigger hairs were stimulated 60 times (frequency of one time per minute), and samples were collected 24 h after the first stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In inhibitor tests, 100 M COR-MO (3) was sprayed 4 h before mechanical stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Traps from intact Dionaea plants were either stimulated with COR solution (100 M) or remained unstimulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h, intact leaves were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (75 mM, pH 7.0) for 1 h, cut into small trap sections with a razor blade, and further incubated for 24 h in total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, samples were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide at 4 °C overnight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After being dehydrated through a series of graded acetone concentrations (30100%), samples were finally embedded in plastic according to the technique of Spurr et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrathin sections were obtained with an ultramicrotome (Ultracut E; Leica ReichertJung), transferred onto copper grids coated with Mowital, and stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were viewed with a LEO 906 E transmission electron microscope at 100 kV equipped with a MultiScan CCD Camera (model 794; Gatan) using Digital Micrograph 3.3 software (Gatan) to acquire, visualize, analyze, and process image data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

RNA was isolated separately from each flytrap sample using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-based protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, 0.1 g of Dionaea plant material powdered in liquid nitrogen was thoroughly mixed with 0.7 mL of hot (65 °C) RNA extraction buffer [2% CTAB, 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone K 25, 100 mM TrisHCl at pH 8.0, 25 mM Na-EDTA at pH 8.0, and 2 M NaCl, with 2.5% (vol/vol) 2-mercaptoethanol added immediately before use].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a 10-min incubation at 65 °C and extraction with 1 vol of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol [24:1 (vol/vol)], RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by adding 175 L of 8 M LiCl overnight (4 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was collected by centrifugation, resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated H2O, and precipitated in the presence of 0.1 vol of 3 M Na acetate (pH 5.2) and 2.5 vol of 96% ethanol (EtOH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a washing step with 70% EtOH, RNA was dissolved in 40 L of DEPC H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA contamination was removed by DNase I treatment on a microcolumn (Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA quantity and quality were determined by capillary electrophoresis (Experion automated electrophoresis system and Experion RNA high-sense analysis kit; Bio-Rad Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual transcript levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR was performed using a Realplex Mastercycler (Eppendorf), 1:20 diluted cDNA, and Absolute QPCR SYBR green capillary mix (Thermo Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression levels were quantified using a standard for each primer pair and normalized to 10,000 molecules of actin (DmACT) cDNA transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene-specific primers were designed using the software LightCycler Probe Design 2.0 (Roche Life Science) based on the transcriptomic information available at tbro.carnivorom.com (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual transcripts deposited there are given in parentheses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following primers were used: DmACT (comp226979_c1_seq1), DmACTLC forward (fw): 5-TCTTTGATTGGGATGGAAGC-3, DmACTLC reverse (rev): 5-GCAATGCCAGGGAACATAGT-3; DmAHA10 (comp234095_c1.1_seq9), DmAHA10LCfw: 5-GACTTTACATGGGCTG-3, DmAHA10LCrev: 5-GCCCGAAAACTATTTATC-3; DmCLCc (comp214625_c0.0_seq1), DmCLCcLCfw: 5-ATATACGGTTGTTGAGAC-3, DmCLCcLCrev: 5-AATCTTCAGATCCCAC-3; O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (DmOASTL; comp199845_c0.0_seq1), DmOASTLLCfw: 5-AAGTTATCACCGTGTC-3, DmOASTLLCrev: 5-AGAGTGCAAGGTAAATC-3; DmAPR3 (comp215379_c1.0_seq1), APS reductase (DmAPR) (DmAPR3LCfw: 5-GGAACTGGCTGACAAG-3, DmAPR3LCrev: 5-TGGATTACACTTAAAAG-3; oligopeptide transporter 6 (DmOPT6; comp225114_c0_seq7), DmOPT6LCfw: 5-GCCCGCTACAACTATA-3, DmOPT6LCrev: 5-CTTGCTTTGGAACTCTTAC-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ultra_High-Performance_Liquid_Chromatography_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GSH and its metabolic precursors, -glutamylcysteine and cysteine, were quantified as monobromobimane (mBBr) derivatives (34, 35) by a modification of the ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method previously described (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, digestive fluids of stimulated flytraps were collected, immediately frozen in liquid N2, and stored at 80 °C until analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For derivatization, digestive fluids were diluted with 0.1 HCl as required (1:51:20) and aliquots of 50 L were treated with mBBr (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimulated flytraps were cut off, washed in ddH2O, immediately frozen in liquid N2, ground with a mortar and pestle to a homogeneous powder, and stored at 80 °C until analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thiols were determined in aliquots of 50 mg of frozen powder after derivatization with mBBr (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thiol derivatives in samples from digestive fluids and trap tissues were separated by UPLC, detected by fluorescence at 380 nm/480 nm, and quantified by comparison with external standards (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ascorbic acid was determined in aliquots of 50 L of digestive fluids using the colorimetric method previously described (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Gas_Exchange_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluid phase secretion of COR-stimulated Venus flytraps was recorded in a setup of two whole-plant cuvettes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two customized IRGA (HCM-1000; Walz; www.walz.com) were used to measure the increase of water vapor concentration in the air stream passing the flytraps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid transpiration from the soil, the surface and the plant, except for one trap, were sprayed with a 100 M COR solution (SigmaAldrich) and covered with water-tight foil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composition of the gas stream of 1 Lmin1 through each cuvette was adjusted by mass flow meters (red-y smart series; Vögtlin; https://www.voegtlin.com/) and set to 24 °C, 47% relative humidity, and 350 ppm CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Illumination was provided by three LEDs, providing light at 655 nm at a photon fluence rate of 100 molm2s1 (WEPDR3-S1 Power LED Star tiefrot 3W; Winger), at 455 nm at 8 molm2s1 (Luxeon, Royal Blue; Philips) and at 395 nm (WEPUV3-S1 UV Power LED Star 395 nm; Winger).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three light beams were collected by dichroic mirrors (Q525 LPXR and DCLP 425; Chroma; https://www.chroma.com/) and guided through fiber optics to the cuvettes (Fiber Illuminator FL-460; Walz; www.walz.com).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MRI  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For sample preparation, plants, including roots, were prepared to carry a single flytrap only and were placed in a 15-mL Eppendorf tube filled with tap water or water with a concentration of 50 mM of GdCl3 and mounted in the MRI tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COR was applied to trigger the flytraps slow closure and secretion (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MRI experiments were performed on a vertical 11.7-T superconducting magnet (Bruker BioSpin GmbH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an actively shielded Micro 2.5 gradient system (40-mm i.d., maximum strength of 660 mT/m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A custom-built birdcage-coil (15-mm i.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  was used for the measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MRI measurements were conducted using an adjusted custom ultra-short echo time sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The repetition time was set to 50 ms, and for frequency encoding, 128 points were acquired at a bandwidth of 200 kHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The echo-delay between the excitation pulse and start of the acquisition was 10 s. A total of 59,157 (digestion) or 61,995 (GdCl3) spokes were acquired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were averaged (number of averages = 2) for signal-to-noise ratio optimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment was performed over a course of 12 d (digestion) or 3 d (GdCl3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reconstruction was based on the method proposed by Duyn et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (56) using in-house written programs in MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the GdCl3 experiment, the Dionaea was placed in the tube with GdCl3 applied to the root medium and COR to the trap surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trigger hairs were touched to cause fast trap closure before MRI measurement was started.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Dionaea plant absorbed the gadolinium ions, and closed traps started to seal slowly (phase 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the presence of gadolinium, the longitudinal relaxation parameter in the stem decreased significantly, showing the distribution of the contrast agent within the plant due to the increase of signal within the plant tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the Dionaea reached phase 4, no droplets of the digestive fluid could be detected on the traps surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
