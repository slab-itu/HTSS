Evolution of South Atlantic density and chemical stratification across the last deglaciation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cause of the rise in atmospheric pCO2 over the last deglaciation has been a puzzle since its discovery in the early 1980s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is widely believed to be related to changes in carbon storage in the deep ocean, but the exact mechanisms responsible for releasing CO2 from the deep-ocean reservoir, including the role of ocean density stratification, remains an open question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we reconstruct changes in the intermediate-deep density gradient in the South Atlantic across the last deglaciation and find evidence of an early deglacial chemical destratification and a late deglacial density destratification These results suggest that other mechanisms, besides deep-ocean density destratification, were responsible for the oceanatmosphere transfer of carbon over the deglacial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Explanations of the glacialinterglacial variations in atmospheric pCO2 invoke a significant role for the deep ocean in the storage of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deep-ocean density stratification has been proposed as a mechanism to promote the storage of CO2 in the deep ocean during glacial times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A wealth of proxy data supports the presence of a chemical divide between intermediate and deep water in the glacial Atlantic Ocean, which indirectly points to an increase in deep-ocean density stratification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, direct observational evidence of changes in the primary controls of ocean density stratification, i.e., temperature and salinity, remain scarce.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use Mg/Ca-derived seawater temperature and salinity estimates determined from temperature-corrected 18O measurements on the benthic foraminifer Uvigerina spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from deep and intermediate water-depth marine sediment cores to reconstruct the changes in density of sub-Antarctic South Atlantic water masses over the last deglaciation (i.e., 222 ka before present).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that a major breakdown in the physical density stratification significantly lags the breakdown of the deep-intermediate chemical divide, as indicated by the chemical tracers of benthic foraminifer 13C and foraminifer/coral 14C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that chemical destratification likely resulted in the first rise in atmospheric pCO2, whereas the density destratification of the deep South Atlantic lags the second rise in atmospheric pCO2 during the late deglacial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings emphasize that the physical and chemical destratification of the ocean are not as tightly coupled as generally assumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Deglacial_Changes_in_the_Physical_Properties_of_the_South_Atlantic  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the deglacial decrease in Uvigerina spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18O is similar in both sites (Fig 2C), our Mg/Ca-derived temperature reconstructions (Fig 2B) suggest that the intermediate waters (GC528) were in fact cooler than the deep water (MD07-3076Q) for the majority of the glacial termination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This temperature inversion between the intermediate and deep sub-Antarctic reverses during the Early Holocene, from 9 ka onward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is physically impossible for cold intermediate water to overlie warmer deep water (even accounting for the effect of adiabatic decompression) and remain dynamically stable unless these differences are compensated by salinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We use the Mg/Ca-derived benthic temperatures and global sea-level records (19) to deconvolve 18O of foraminiferal calcite (Fig 2C) into its principal components (20), i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  temperature and w (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extract the salinity component from w (21), we express w as an offset from the contemporaneous global mean w, hereafter referred to as w-ice (Fig 2D), by subtracting the isotopic effect of melting continental ice using global sea-level records (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isotopic effect of melting ice will have spatial and temporal variations which are masked in our subtraction of a global mean w; however, without transient tracer models to prescribe a regional ice volume effect, the offset from the contemporaneous global mean w remains the best approximation of ice sheet melt-derived 18O changes in the South Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Salinity is calculated from w-ice assuming that the modern relationship between salinity and w for the Southern Ocean (21) holds over the deglacial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent isotope-enabled fully coupled general circulation model (GCM) experiments have suggested that the salinityw relationship in the South Atlantic is more temporally constant than in other ocean basins (22), ruling out significant biases in our inferred salinity estimates due to potential variations in the salinityw relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, brine rejection during the formation of sea ice increases salinity without fractionating oxygen isotopes; therefore, we suggest that salinity values derived from w-ice are minimum estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The difference in intermediate water salinity between the LGM and the Holocene is small (Fig 2D) as most of the deglacial 18O Uvigerina spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  variation can be accounted for by warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the deep-water site (MD07-3076Q) was relatively saline (3637 psu) during the glacial period and salinity decreased by 34 psu during the late deglacial (129 ka).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the Mg/Ca-derived benthic temperatures and our estimates of minimum salinity, we calculate the in situ density of the intermediate and deep site according to the equation of state (23) (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find good agreement between our density estimates for the Holocene and modern South Atlantic density measurements (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deglacial density reconstructions indicate the presence of a strong density gradient between intermediate and deep water for the glacial and much of the deglacial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This density gradient decreases dramatically from 12 ka, and by 10 ka the deep ocean is 2 kg/m3 less dense than at the LGM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Mg/Ca-18Oderived deep-ocean LGM salinities are broadly consistent with previous pore-waterbased estimates (15) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although both reconstructions carry substantial uncertainty (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 and Propagation of Errors in the Calculation of Potential Density), the convergence of two independent methods strengthens our confidence in both approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before 12 ka the high salinity of the deep-water site implies a strong density gradient, despite the temperature inversion of cool intermediate waters overlying warmer deep water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 10 ka the salinity stratification has broken down, and a weaker density gradient is maintained by the temperature difference between intermediate and deep water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Provided the assumption of zonal seawater density continuity across the sub-Antarctic Atlantic holds true, our findings signal a significant mode switch in the primary physical parameters that govern ocean density stratification in the southern high latitudes through the last deglaciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Processes_Controlling_the_Physical_Properties_of_Water_Masses_over_the_Deglaciation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the factors affecting the variability in the physical properties of deep and intermediate water masses over the deglaciation, we compare glacial water mass temperature and w-ice properties with those of water masses present in the Southern Ocean today (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of intermediate LGM temperature-w-ice with modern measurements of seawater temperature and w suggests that LGM intermediate water was analogous to modern Antarctic Surface Water (AASW), which is characterized by near-freezing temperatures (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such low temperatures suggest that the source location of intermediate water was strongly influenced by sea ice (which forms from seawater with a temperature of 2 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glacial sea ice reconstructions using diatom transfer functions (25, 26) predict that winter sea ice could have extended as far north as 57°S at this longitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore suggest that glacial intermediate water masses at GC528 reflect the cold and fresh signature of surface waters close to the winter sea ice edge that is influenced by seasonal sea ice meltwater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in stark contrast to modern intermediate water at GC528, which is strongly influenced by a modified component of upwelled Circumpolar Deep Water (27) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The processes controlling the benthic temperature of the deep site are more complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deep water formed close to the sea ice margin can only gain heat in two ways: (i) through mixing with other, warmer water masses, and (ii) through the accumulation of geothermal heat in the deep sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most probable warm water masses that can mix with sinking southern-sourced waters during the LGM are Drake Passage through flow waters from the Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it has been shown that Pacific deep water was not significantly warmer than freezing (18, 28), it remains to be determined whether Pacific intermediate waters were significantly warmer and had an influence on southern-sourced deep water in the Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the source of warmth in the deep South Atlantic may be derived from the accumulation of geothermal heat, assuming that the deep ocean is stagnant and cannot lose heat to the surface (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown by a conceptual model that it would take ten thousand years (ky) to heat 2 km of seawater by 2 °C, based on a heat flux of 500 mW/m2 (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these processes may have potentially accounted for the observed warmth of the salty LGM deep water in the South Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an analysis of whether a completely stagnant and isolated deep-water pool is physically possible or whether it was significantly influenced by Pacific inflow waters goes beyond the scope of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The deglacial evolution of deep-water temperature and w-ice (Fig 3) can be understood by invoking a combination of (i) changes in the northern versus southern mixing ratio and (ii) changes in the end-member 18O of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the modern Atlantic Ocean, saline North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) overlies fresh AABW (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high 18O signature of NADW reflects high rates of evaporation at the surface, whereas the 18O of AABW is comparatively more negative (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The warming and increase in w-ice over much of the deglaciation (1612 ka) may indicate a greater proportion of northern-sourced water at MD07-3076Q.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by benthic foraminifer Nd data that suggest an increasing contribution of northern-sourced water in the South Atlantic throughout the deglaciation (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The late deglacial change in deep-water w-ice to isotopically lighter values after 12 ka is likely driven by a change in the mode of AABW formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two different modes of southern-sourced deep-water formation, i.e., brine rejection during sea ice formation and supercooling of Ice Shelf Water (ISW) beneath the Antarctic ice shelves (32), impart very different signals on w-ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brines have a 18O signature close to surface water values (0 in the Southern Ocean), whereas ISW has a negative 18O signature reflecting incorporation of overlying ice shelf meltwater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We would argue that the marked decrease in the w-ice of deep water at 12 ka is related to an increasing contribution of ISW constituting AABW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change may be associated with a retreat in the grounding line of Weddell Sea ice shelves and an intrusion of relatively warm modified northern-sourced water under the ice shelves, further melting the marine-terminating ice sheets around Antarctica (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the modes of intermediate and deep water formation have a profound impact on the density structure of the sub-Antarctic ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Link_Between_the_Physical_and_Chemical_Properties_of_the_South_Atlantic_and_Atmospheric_pCO2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To assess the hypothesis of a causal link between the physical and chemical properties of the ocean, we compare the timing of changes in the breakdown of the density gradient with changes in benthic foraminifer 13C and foraminifer/coral benthic-atmospheric 14C ages at both core locations (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Benthic foraminifer 13C at the intermediate water site (GC528) was more positive than the 13C of the deep site [MD07-3076Q (34)] at the LGM (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This large 13C gradient breaks down over the deglaciation (1510 ka) resulting in relatively homogeneous 13C values at both sites during the Holocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Foraminifer/coral benthic-atmospheric 14C age offsets between intermediate [Burdwood Bank (12), Chile Margin (35)] and deep water [MD07-3076Q (9)] are broadly consistent with the 13C record (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two records provide strong support for glacial chemical stratification, which subsequently breaks down relatively early in the deglaciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison of the deglacial density records (Fig 4D) and the chemical 13C and 14C records (Fig 4 B and C), shows a marked difference in the timing of the breakdown of density and chemical gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the deep site, both the 13C and 14C records begin to change early in the deglaciation (1715 ka), and in the case of the foraminiferal 14C record, these early decreases in the benthic-atmospheric 14C age have been linked to a synchronous rise in atmospheric CO2 (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is no concomitant change in the intermediate-deep density gradient at this time (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of the physical destratification occurs during the Early Holocene (10 ka), and appears to lag the late deglacial rise in atmospheric pCO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our proxy records suggest that (i) changes in ocean chemistry in the South Atlantic occur without large-scale reorganization of the oceans density structure, challenging the propositions of a close coupling between physical and chemical ocean stratification as suggested by intermediate complexity models (17), and (ii) the density destratification of the South Atlantic could only have impacted atmospheric pCO2 during the late deglaciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CO2 stored in the deep ocean can be impeded from being released back to the atmosphere by two physical processes: (i) via an increased residence time of deep-water masses in the ocean interior, through an increase in deep-ocean stratification acting as a lid to deep carbon (7), or (ii) reduced efficiency of airsea gas exchange in the regions of deep mixing and upwelling (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that during the LGM, both of these processes will have contributed to lower atmospheric pCO2, owing to increased density stratification in the Southern Ocean and because permanent sea ice (8) and/or shallow stratification (13, 36) acted as a barrier preventing CO2 from escaping the surface of the Southern Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it is plausible that the retreat of sea ice during the early deglaciation (26, 37) effectively removed a barrier to airsea exchange, and thus contributed to the increase in atmospheric pCO2 through enhanced ventilation of the deep overturning cell (9, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypothesis of an early retreat in the extent of Antarctic sea ice is also supported by the warming trend observed in GC528 at 1715ka (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the retreat of sea ice cover in the South Atlantic might not have had a significant effect on the density difference between the intermediate and deep overturning cells because the mode of deep-water formation did not change, which is controlled by the position of the grounded ice sheet relative to the continental shelf break.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the geological evidence for the position of the grounding line in the Weddell Sea is inconsistent (38), there is indication that, at least around the Antarctic Peninsula, the grounding line retreat occurred late in the deglaciation (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the glacial brine-dominated mode of southern-sourced deep-water formation may have persisted until as late as 10 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we argue that changes in the extent of permanent sea ice may occur earlier than changes in the maximum position of the grounded icesheets, thus it is possible to ventilate the deep ocean without decreasing its density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Over the deglacial period (1711 ka), increasing deep-ocean temperatures (Fig 2B) coupled with a 0.6 increase in benthic foraminifer 13C (34) (Fig 4B) is indicative of a greater proportion of northern-sourced water in the deep South Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impinging of warm modified northern-sourced water on the Antarctic continental shelf has been suggested as a possible mechanism (33) which could melt back the grounded ice sheets in the Weddell Sea, freeing shelf space for the formation of ISW, resulting in the observed decrease in deep-ocean density stratification at 10 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas a decrease in the density of deep water has been invoked to explain the deglacial rise in atmospheric pCO2, via associated changes in the rate of diapycnal mixing and the vertical position of the isopycnal separating the two overturning branches of circulation (16, 17, 41), we suggest that its impact is relatively minor compared with the impact of changes in the rate of airsea gas exchange in the Southern Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it should be noted that vertical shifts in the position of the main pycnocline (41) cannot be resolved in this study, thus it remains to be determined whether these changes play a more important role in regulating atmospheric CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although density destratification of the South Atlantic does not appear to play a leading role in regulating atmospheric pCO2, we propose that density destratification may have been instead important in locking in the incipient transition to an interglacial climate state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the destratification event, the ocean was able to return to its glacial regime following a transient perturbation, but not afterward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that the density destratification of the South Atlantic, initiated by a change in mode of formation of deep water, acted as a flip switch, eliminating the oceans ability to restock its CO2 inventory at the expense of the atmosphere, and thus forcing climate to switch to an interglacial state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer records of the density gradient within the Southern Ocean are required to test this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study provides, to our knowledge, the first deglacial record of density changes in the deep and intermediate South Atlantic spanning the last deglaciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the intermediate ocean was significantly colder than deep waters at the LGM, and this temperature inversion requires that ocean stability is maintained by salinity gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that the physical properties of the glacial South Atlantic were regulated by an increase in Antarctic sea ice extent, which resulted in colder surface waters in the sub-Antarctic, but also led to deep waters being primarily formed through the creation of brines as opposed to supercooling of ISW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the deglaciation, intermediate water warmed in response to a retreat in the Antarctic sea ice margin, and the deep South Atlantic started to reflect both a greater proportion of northern-sourced water but also isotopically lighter AABW from the incorporation of Antarctic ice sheet meltwater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A rapid change in the dominant mode of deep-water formation at the onset of the Holocene, from brines to supercooled ISW, likely resulted in the density destratification of the intermediate-deep ocean during the late deglacial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our density records also enable us to address the question of whether deglacial changes in ocean chemistry are driven by a breakdown in the deep-ocean density stratification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the greatest intermediate-deep change in benthic foraminifer 13C and foraminifer/coral 14C occurs before the density destratification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that this chemical destratification was driven by an increase in airsea gas exchange which ventilates the deep overturning cell without affecting its density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The late deglacial breakdown in the density gradient of the South Atlantic occurs at the onset of the Holocene, suggesting deep-ocean density destratification did not play a leading role in driving the deglacial rise in atmospheric pCO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the timing of the breakdown of the intermediate-deep chemical gradient compared with the breakdown of the intermediate-deep physical density gradient suggests that chemical and physical stratification is not as tightly coupled as previously inferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also raises the interesting possibility that the density destratification of the South Atlantic, induced by a change in the mode of deep-water formation, could act as the flip switch resulting in the transition to a full interglacial state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Core GC528 [53.01°S, 58.04°W, 598mbsl] was collected on the cruise JR244 of the RRS James Clark Ross.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Located on the Falkland Plateau, this core is situated close to the main inflow of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) into the Atlantic basin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Core MD07-3076Q [44° 09.2S 14° 13.7W, 3,770mbsl] was retrieved from the eastern flank of the midocean ridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The age model is based on reservoir-age corrected radiocarbon measurements on monospecific planktonic foraminifera and is described fully in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Age_model_(GC528)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The age model for GC528 (Supporting Information) was generated using 25 radiocarbon dates of monospecific samples of Uvigerina bifurcata ( greater than 125-m size fraction, 26 mg), which were graphitized in the Godwin Laboratory for Paleoclimate Research, University of Cambridge (hereafter, GLPR) using the hydrogen and iron catalyst method (42) and subsequently analyzed at the 14Chrono Centre at the University of Belfast by accelerator mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five of the 25 samples were graphitized and analyzed by BetaAnalytic; no interlab offset between samples was found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon-14 ages were calibrated using Bacon age-modeling software (43) with the Marine13 dataset (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reservoir age constraints were taken from paired U-Th/14C ages in corals (12) after 16 ka; before 16 ka a constant reservoir age of 1.36 ± 0.4 ky [the age of the oldest U-Th/14C dated coral analyzed by Burke and Robinson (12)] was applied downcore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sample_Preparation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In GC528, samples of Uvigerina spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21231-µm size fraction) were hand-picked, cleaned using the methodology of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45 and split, with 100 g used for oxygen and carbon isotope and 400 g for trace element geochemistry, and analyzed at the GLPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In MD07-3076Q, samples of Uvigerina spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (212315-µm size fraction) were hand-picked and 3 whole specimens were used for stable isotope analysis, and 1015 whole specimens were cleaned for Mg/Ca analysis using the methodology of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mg_Ca-Derived_Benthic_Temperatures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mg/Ca values were converted into benthic temperatures using the new calibration curve (Supporting Information):Mg/Ca=(0.0915±0.005)T+(0.843±0.035)R2=0.92.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, 1 uncertainty in the temperature estimate of each sample is ±0.7 °C (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Seawater_18O_Offset_from_the_Contemporaneous_Global_Mean_Seawater_18O_(w-ice)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Seawater 18O (w) is calculated from the Mg/Ca-derived benthic temperature and the 18O of foraminiferal calcite using the linear form of the paleotemperature equation of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20:T=16.94.0(cw).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This calibration produces good agreement between modern measurements of w and the calculated core top w.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To make a comparison with modern seawater values, the contemporaneous global mean seawater 18O, sometimes referred to as ice volume effect, was removed assuming a linear relationship (21) between sea level (19) and 18O of seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site-specific deviations from the global mean that would result in a synchronous breakdown of the physical and chemical gradients in the South Atlantic require changes in w in MD07-3076Q 5ky earlier than the global mean, which is not supported by regional 18O stacks (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1 uncertainty in w-ice of each sample is ±0.35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_Density_of_Seawater_()  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The modern linear relationship between salinity and w-ice for the Southern Ocean (21) is assumed to hold across the deglacial period (Supporting Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ density was calculated from salinity and benthic temperature, using the equation of state (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Assumption_of_Zonal_Continuity_Across_the_Sub-Antarctic_South_Atlantic  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Developing an understanding of changes in the physical properties of seawater with depth typically requires depth transect of sediment cores that are located within a confined region, where surface signals should be common to all sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to a lack of available cores from intermediate water depths in the Eastern Atlantic/Cape Basin combined with low sedimentation rates at those few sites (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11, 52, 53) and the dearth of deep sites in the Western sub-Antarctic Atlantic, it was necessary to study two rather distal sites (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the geographic separation of these cores, they underlie roughly equivalent surface circumpolar ocean regimes (Sub-Antarctic Zone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modern sub-Antarctic Atlantic is zonally continuous, in terms of potential density (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study we make the assumption that deglacial changes occurring at either site would occur everywhere synchronously in water at the same depth in the sub-Antarctic South Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge that for our findings from the South Atlantic to have global implications, further studies, particularly from the Pacific sector, are required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Age_Model_(GC528)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The age model for GC528 was generated using 25 radiocarbon dates of monospecific samples of U. bifurcata (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The age markers of GC528 are tabulated in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Carbon-14 ages were calibrated using Bacon age-modeling software (43) with the Marine13 dataset (44) (Table S1 and Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The age model suggests highly variable sedimentation rates in the core across the last deglaciation from 10 cm/ky in the Holocene to 40 cm/ky at the LGM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high mean sedimentation rates during the glacial period can be explained by a decrease in sea level which acts to bring the coastline, the source of terrigenous material, closer to the core site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Uvigerina_spp_Cleaning  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to the Mg/Ca data generated in this study, further Mg/Ca data from MD07-3076Q was used which had been cleaned using a different approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This additional Uvigerina spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mg/Ca data was cleaned using the clay removal and silicate removal steps (45), but without a full oxidative cleaning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of samples which had been both oxidatively cleaned and nonoxidatively cleaned show an average offset of 0.045 mmol/mol (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We corrected the nonoxidatively cleaned samples by 0.045 mmol/mol; however, this does not significantly change the overall temperature trend (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mn/Ca was measured to monitor cleaning efficiency and diagenetic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no relationship between Mn/Ca and Mg/Ca (Fig S4), implying that diagenetic coatings are not affecting the Mg/Ca ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonoxidatively cleaned samples typically have a higher Mn/Ca ratio than oxidatively cleaned samples; however, the concentration of Mn/Ca is so small (up to 0.3 mmol/mol) that the Mg contribution of a diagenetic coating would have minimal effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Mg/Mn ratio of 0.1 mol/mol within a diagenetic coating, consistent with Mg/Mn ratios found in manganese carbonate in marine sediments (54), would imply a maximum contribution of 102 mmol/mol to Mg/Ca in this record, well within the reproducibility found from duplicate analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mg_Ca-Temperature_Calibration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison of available Uvigerina spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mg/Ca-temperature calibrations in the literature shows there is a considerable range in the regression lines (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the best-fit calibration curve to the core top data from GC528 and MD07-3076Q is provided by the core-top calibration study of Elderfield et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we find that this calibration generates temperature estimates below the freezing point of seawater for GC528 at the LGM, the minimum temperature being 3.8 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be in part caused by the lack of Mg/Ca core-top constraints for bottom water below 0 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attempt to improve the calibration by adding the constraint that the LGM minimum Mg/Ca value in GC528 measured cannot record temperature below the freezing point of seawater (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new calibration curve is defined asMg/Ca=(0.0915±0.005)* T+(0.843±0.035)R2=0.92.The 1 uncertainty in the temperature estimate of each sample is ±0.7 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discussion of the propagation of error in benthic temperatures can be found below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, it is important to note that the choice of calibration line does not alter our main observation of a decrease in the density gradient over the deglacial period (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To calculate salinity, the isotopic effect of melting continental ice must be subtracted from the 18O of seawater (as calculated from the paleotemperature equation) to apply modern salinityw relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ice volume effect was calculated assuming a linear relationship (21) between sea level (19) and 18O of seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isotopic effect of melting ice will have spatial and temporal variations which are masked in our subtraction of a global mean w, but these remain poorly constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As transient 18O tracer models that provide information on local 18O variability and their governing mechanisms are not available, we adhere to the global mean isotopic 18O record as the best approximation for ice sheet melt derived changes in ocean w. The effect of subtracting the global ice volume effect from the calculated 18O of seawater is shown in Fig S7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Choice_of_Regression_Line_Between_Salinity_and_w-ice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study we use the modern Southern Ocean linear relationship between salinity and w-ice (21)and assume that it holds across the deglacial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We argue that processes such as brine rejection may have the effect of increasing salinity without increasing w-ice, thus the salinity estimates should be considered minimum salinity estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An alternative regression line may be based on the LGM salinity and seawater 18O estimates of Adkins et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (15) from the two Southern Ocean sites, 1123 and 1093.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming 1 of the LGM seawater 18O is related to the ice volume, the regression line between salinity and w-ice based on the pore-water studies iswice=0.191* S6.913.The difference between the salinity estimates produced by this LGM regression line and the modern Southern Ocean regression line used in the paper is small relative to the magnitude of the change in salinity over the deglaciation (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have chosen the modern Southern Ocean regression line over the LGM regression line based on the fact that it has more data making up the regression and the data included in the regression are located within the region of MD07-3076Q and GC528.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study we make the assumption that the relationship between salinity and w-ice does not significantly differ between the Holocene and the LGM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are a couple of lines of evidence which can be used to justify this assumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we have performed a simple thought experiment whereby we pose the question: What must the salinityw-ice relationship have to be at the LGM to eradicate the late deglacial decrease in salinity?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the required salinityw-ice relationship plots well outside the range of modern southern hemisphere water masses and well outside the predicted LGM salinityw-ice relationship from pore-water profiles (15) (Fig S9), provided the reported pore-waterderived LGM salinity and w estimates are robust (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore suggest that it is valid to invoke significant seawater salinity variations to explain the observed w-ice change in MD07-3076Q.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second line of evidence supporting the idea that a change in the salinityw-ice relationship did not occur over the last deglaciation comes from newly published isotope-enabled GCM studies (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study found that the South Atlantic exhibits a relatively constant salinityw-ice relationship across spatial and temporal scales supporting the validity of applying a temporally constant salinityw-ice relationship to our datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Propagation_of_Errors_in_the_Conversion_of_Mg_Ca_to_Benthic_Temperature  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Propagating the replicate error (Mg/Ca = 0.7 °C) and the error in the new calibration curve (calib = 1.1 °C) gives a 1 uncertainty in the temperature estimate of each sample of ±1.3 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously published calibrations typically give 1 uncertainties of 0.51.0 °C (e.g., ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference may be due to a less critical assessment of the errors involved in the calibration curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, the errors associated with the calibration curve (calib) are largely due to it being based on old data from different laboratories, with different cleaning procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that improvements in analytical technique have decreased the error associated with the calibration curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data used in this study were generated in the same laboratory, using the same method and have been checked for repeatability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infer that although the absolute values for temperature may be uncertain, the raw Mg/Ca values generated in each core should be directly comparable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we assume an error in benthic temperatures of 0.7 °C, equivalent to the replicate error in the Mg/Ca measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Propagation_of_Errors_in_the_Calculation_of_Potential_Density  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To calculate in situ density at each site, salinity had to be calculated, which was derived from the ice-volume corrected 18O of seawater (w-ice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using the paleotemperature equation (20), the 18O of seawater (w) is calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The error in the 18O of seawater (w) is a combination of the error in the measurement of 18O of Uvigerina spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c = 0.08) and the error in the Mg/Ca-derived benthic temperature (T = 0.18): w2=T2+c2, consequently w = 0.19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To compare paleoestimates of w with modern data, the so-called ice volume effect is removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a compilation of observed sea-level estimates (19), we calculate the isotopic effect from the melting of continental ice and estimate a variance of SL= 0.10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gives a total error in the ice-volumecorrected 18O of seawater of w-ice=w2+SL2= 0.22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assume a linear relationship between w-ice and salinity, based on the Southern Ocean gridded 18O seawater data set (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variance in salinity S is calculated using the slope and icept given in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21:S=w2(wS)2+icept2(iceptS)2+slope2(slopeS)2=2.24psu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S1]In situ density was calculated using the equation of state expressed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variance was calculated similarly to Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1, returning a variance in in situ density of  = 1.85 kg/m3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
