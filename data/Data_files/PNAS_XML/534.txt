An NAD+-dependent transcriptional program governs self-renewal and radiation resistance in glioblastoma  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Glioblastoma, the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, remains challenging despite multimodality therapy, necessitating the discovery of new therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) plays a pivotal role in cancer cell metabolism, but how NAD+ impacts functional signaling events in glioblastoma is not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide clinical evidence that high expression of NAMPT, the rate-limiting step in NAD+ biosynthesis, in glioblastoma tumors is associated with poor overall survival in patients, and demonstrate NAMPT and NAD+ are required for the maintenance of patient-derived glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we delineate a NAD+-dependent transcriptional program that governs GSC self-renewal and dictates the radiation resistance of these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings identify potential new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of glioblastoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Accumulating evidence suggests cancer cells exhibit a dependency on metabolic pathways regulated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, how the regulation of this metabolic cofactor interfaces with signal transduction networks remains poorly understood in glioblastoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting step in NAD+ synthesis, is highly expressed in glioblastoma tumors and patient-derived glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High NAMPT expression in tumors correlates with decreased patient survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of NAMPT decreased NAD+ levels and GSC self-renewal capacity, and NAMPT knockdown inhibited the in vivo tumorigenicity of GSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regulatory network analysis of RNA sequencing data using GSCs treated with NAMPT inhibitor identified transcription factor E2F2 as the center of a transcriptional hub in the NAD+-dependent network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we demonstrate E2F2 is required for GSC self-renewal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downstream, E2F2 drives the transcription of members of the inhibitor of differentiation (ID) helixloophelix gene family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we find NAMPT mediates GSC radiation resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of a NAMPT-E2F2-ID axis establishes a link between NAD+ metabolism and a self-renewal transcriptional program in glioblastoma, with therapeutic implications for this formidable cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first asked if the major regulator of the cellular NAD+ pool, NAMPT, has clinical relevance in glioblastoma by interrogating expression data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found NAMPT mRNA is up-regulated in glioblastoma tumors generally and in tumors of all four molecular subtypes compared with normal brain (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then divided TCGA glioblastoma patients into high and low NAMPT mRNA groups and found that patients with high NAMPT-expressing tumors exhibited a shorter overall survival (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An independent dataset, REMBRANDT, revealed a similar inverse correlation between tumor NAMPT expression and patient survival (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAMPT protein was observed in tumor cells by immunohistochemistry in both IDH1 WT and mutant glioblastoma tumor sections (Fig 1E and Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found NAMPT expression was also increased in grade 2 and 3 gliomas compared with normal brain (REMBRANDT; Fig S1B) and that IDH1 mutant and WT tumors of matched grade and histopathology did not significantly differ in NAMPT expression with the exception of grade 3 astrocytomas, which exhibited higher NAMPT expression in IDH1 WT tumors (TCGA; Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data suggest a potential cell-intrinsic role for NAMPT in glioblastoma and potentially more broadly in gliomas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have described a human model system for the functional analysis of glioblastoma cells using patient-derived specimens (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These primary glioblastoma cells, also referred to as GSCs, exhibit the ability to self-renew in vitro and form invasive brain tumors in immunocompromised mice in vivo, providing a robust human model system (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in bulk tumors, we observed high NAMPT expression in four GSC lines compared with human astrocytes by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) (Fig 2A and Fig S2 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a specific pharmacological inhibitor of NAMPT, FK866, we examined the biological role of NAMPT in GSC self-renewal, a defining characteristic of GSCs, which often parallels tumor-initiating potential (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of GSC lines B18 and B36 with FK866 in vitro decreased NAD+ levels in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the extreme-limiting dilution assay (ELDA), we found exposure to NAMPT inhibitor decreased GSC self-renewal capacity in a manner reversible by addition of NMN, the product of NAMPT (Fig 2C and Fig S2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative approach using lentiviral shRNAs targeting two distinct regions in the NAMPT gene decreased both NAMPT protein and NAD+ levels in GSCs (Fig 2D and Fig S2 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, NAMPT RNAi also decreased the frequency of sphere-forming GSCs, indicating NAMPT is essential for GSC self-renewal (Fig 2 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the phenomenon of self-renewal represents an integration of a number of distinct cellular events, we asked if NAMPT regulates GSC proliferation or survival (Fig 2 GL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EdU incorporation experiments demonstrated FK866 inhibits the proliferation of B18 GSCs at 3 nM and of both GSC lines at 10 nM (Fig 2 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 10 nM FK866 triggered 18% and 4.5% cell death in B18 and B36 GSCs, respectively, with little to no cell death at lower concentrations (Fig 2 JL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-lapse images of B36 GSCs following FK866 treatment showed a plateau in cell number at 85 h, followed by an increase in caspase-3/7 activity 10 h later, suggesting proliferation is more sensitive to declining NAD+ levels compared with survival (Fig S2 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate NAMPT controls GSC self-renewal by regulating both cell proliferation and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine if NAMPT is required to propagate tumors in vivo, we generated a B36 GSC line stably expressing GFP-T2A-luciferase, enabling GFP immunofluorescence as well as bioluminescence imaging (BLI) in live animals to assess tumor burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSCs infected with two distinct NAMPT RNAi were injected into the brains of NOD-SCID mice, and BLI was performed on these animals over time (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAMPT knockdown inhibited brain tumor formation by both BLI and GFP immunofluorescence in brain sections (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, mice bearing NAMPT knockdown GSCs exhibited increased survival compared with mice bearing control-infected GSCs, indicating NAMPT is critical for the in vivo tumorigenicity of GSCs (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if the eventual neurological deficit or death in animals injected with NAMPT RNAi GSCs might be the consequence of failure to completely silence NAMPT expression in tumor cells (as has been reported with other RNAi manipulations) (19), we performed coimmunolabeling for GFP and NAMPT in NAMPT RNAi and control tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we observed occasional NAMPT+ cells in tumor cells arising from NAMPT RNAi-infected GSCs at 12 mo (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next wanted to understand the mechanism of how NAMPT governs GSC maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because NAD+ is known to control transcription in other cellular contexts, we examined the global transcriptional consequences of NAD+ depletion in GSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSCs were exposed to FK866 with or without NMN and subjected to RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAMPT inhibition altered the levels of 581 protein-coding genes, with 307 down-regulated genes (52.8%; Fig 4A and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant changes in the transcriptome were observed between vehicle- and FK866 plus NMN-treated GSCs (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene ontogeny analysis of genes down-regulated by NAMPT inhibitor demonstrated enrichment in processes related to DNA repair and replication, nuclear division, and cell cycle phase transition, consistent with the role of NAMPT in GSC self-renewal and tumor growth (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify critical nodes within the NAD+-driven transcriptional network, we used two parallel bioinformatics approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used regulatory network analysisAlgorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks (ARACNe)with the 169 RNA-seq glioblastoma datasets in TCGA to first build a transcriptional network and then generated NAMPT-regulated subnetworks by extracting network connections containing significantly altered transcripts in FK866-treated glioblastoma cells (Fig 4C and Tables S1 and S2) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes predicted to be master regulators would be hypothesized to exhibit a change in transcript levels and also have a high number of connections with other genes in the network (Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these genes, transcription factor E2F2 was notable as having the highest number of connections in the FK866 treatment subnetwork, suggesting an important transcriptional hub.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, with the same NAMPT-dependent RNA-seq data, we used iRegulon to detect transcription factors and their targets, with the goal of identifying transcription factors with a high number of targets within the same dataset and therefore more likely to represent an upstream regulator of the NAMPT-dependent transcriptional program (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A DNA motif-based algorithm again identified E2F2 as the most significant, differentially expressed transcription factor with 383 putative targets in the NAMPT-dependent RNA dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore focused on E2F2 as a potential critical upstream transcription factor controlling the NAD+-dependent transcriptional network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified in GSCs that both FK866 and NAMPT knockdown dramatically decrease E2F2 levels in a manner reversible by NMN (Fig 4 DF and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the functional significance of E2F2 in glioblastoma, we transduced GSCs with two lentiviral shRNAs targeting E2F2 and subjected them to the extreme-limiting dilution assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E2F2 knockdown reduced GSC self-renewal capacity and proliferation, consistent with the effects of NAMPT inhibition (Fig 4G and Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if E2F2 lies functionally downstream of NAMPT, we performed epistasis experiments combining NAMPT inhibitor with E2F2 overexpression (Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FK866 inhibited the self-renewal capacity of GSCs, which was partially but significantly rescued by E2F2 overexpression, suggesting E2F2 acts downstream of NAMPT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this linear order, NMN could not rescue the self-renewal deficit triggered by E2F2 RNAi (Fig S4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the mechanism by which NAMPT regulates E2F2 expression, we examined the nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs), a family of catalytic enzymes that convert NMN to NAD+ with a particular focus on NMNAT1, which is localized to the nucleus and is responsible for generating the nuclear NAD+ pool (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of NMNAT1, but not of the related Golgi-resident family member NMNAT2, effectively decreased E2F2 mRNA levels, indicating NMNAT1 links NAMPT to E2F2 expression (Fig 4I and Fig S4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the downstream mechanism of E2F2 in GSCs, we performed a candidate-based miniscreen for possible E2F2 targets by examining a set of genes known to be associated with self-renewal following E2F2 RNAi in GSCs (Fig 5A) (18, 2325).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these genes, E2F2 RNAi consistently decreased the levels of helixloophelix gene inhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1) (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E2F2 knockdown also decreased ID1 protein levels in GSCs (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the ID proteins represent a family of four members, we asked if E2F2 more generally controlled expression of the ID gene family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E2F2 RNAi decreased mRNA levels of ID1, ID2, and ID3, but not ID4, suggesting E2F2 may transcriptionally activate ID13 (Fig S5 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if ID genes are direct targets of E2F2, we focused on ID1 as a representative family member and generated an ID1 promoter reporter encoding GFP-T2A-luciferase driven by a previously reported 2-kb sequence upstream of the ID1 transcription start site (TSS) (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transduction of the ID1 reporter in GSCs generated a robust GFP and luciferase signal compared with control (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E2F2 RNAi diminished ID1 reporter activity, indicating endogenous E2F2 regulates the ID1 promoter (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion analysis revealed a substantial decrease in ID1 promoter activity when removing the sequence spanning 1209 to 709 from the TSS (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E2F2 RNAi decreased the activity of the 1209/+96 ID1 reporter but had no effect on the 709/+96 reporter, suggesting an E2F2-binding site exists between 1209 and 709 (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of the genomic sequence in this region revealed two evolutionarily conserved E2F2 motifs (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, similar E2F2 binding sites were found in evolutionarily conserved regions of the promoters for both ID2 and ID3 but not ID4 (Fig S5 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if E2F2 directly binds the ID1 promoter at this locus, we performed ChIP using GSCs stably expressing HA epitope-tagged E2F2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-HA ChIP followed by qPCR using primers specific to the ID1 promoter region harboring the predicted E2F2 sites demonstrated E2F2 directly binds to the ID1 promoter in GSCs (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate E2F2 directly controls ID1 transcription in human GSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next tested if NAMPT also regulates ID1 expression in GSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of NAMPT decreased ID1 mRNA and protein levels (Fig 6 AE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, consistent with the E2F2 results, knockdown of NMNAT1, but not NMNAT2, decreased ID1 mRNA levels (Fig 6 F and G), together suggesting a NAMPT-NMNAT1-E2F2 pathway to ID1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if ID1 biologically acts downstream of NAMPT, we performed epistasis experiments in assays of GSC self-renewal (Fig 6 HJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FK866 substantially inhibited the self-renewal capacity of GSCs, which was partially but significantly restored by ID1 overexpression, suggesting ID1 operates downstream of NAMPT (Fig 6 HJ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate the NAMPTE2F2ID axis represents an important transcriptional signaling pathway that governs GSC self-renewal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next asked if this NAD+-driven transcriptional program might be clinically relevant in the response to radiation therapy in GSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial qRT-PCR experiments using B18 GSCs revealed that NAMPT, E2F2, and ID1 mRNA levels increase after treatment with ionizing radiation (IR), with ID1 levels increasing in a slightly delayed fashion, consistent with its role as an E2F2 target (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These gene expression changes could potentially represent a cellular defense to IR, a pathway contributing to IR toxicity, or an epiphenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore treated GSCs with sublethal concentrations of FK866, subjected them to different doses of IR, and assessed clonogenic survival 2 wk later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, NAMPT inhibition increased GSC responsiveness to IR (Fig 7 B and C), and in complementary experiments, NAMPT overexpression decreased GSC responsiveness to radiation, together indicating that NAMPT promotes radiation resistance (Fig 7 DG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of H2AX foci in GSCs following IR suggested that the initial burden of DNA double-strand breaks is not significantly different in cells treated with FK866 or overexpressing NAMPT, suggesting instead that downstream responses to IR are altered by NAMPT manipulation (Fig 4B and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we tested if the transcriptional consequences of NAMPT might also be important for GSC radiation responsiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial experiments to test the direct role of E2F2 in radiation responsiveness using E2F2 RNAi revealed that E2F2 is necessary for GSC survival at clonogenic density in the absence of IR, precluding additional manipulations using IR in the setting of E2F2 knockdown (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the complementary experiment of E2F2 overexpression modestly but significantly increased GSC radioresistance (Fig 7H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, ID1 overexpression also increased GSC radioresistance (Fig 7 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results implicate the NAMPT-E2F2-ID1 pathway in the biological response of GSCs to radiation therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have examined the NAD+-dependent transcriptional program in GSCs and defined a NAMPT-E2F2-ID signaling pathway, which regulates GSC self-renewal and radiation resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAMPT is expressed at high levels in several different cancers and, therefore, this enzyme has been considered a potential therapeutic cancer target (5, 9, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies in glioblastoma have indicated specific genetic subgroups may be exquisitely sensitive to NAMPT inhibition (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IDH1 mutation sensitizes GSCs to NAMPT inhibitors due to low ambient levels of NAD+, resulting from down-regulation of nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT1), which catalyzes an alternative NAD+ salvage pathway (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYC overexpression and MYC or N-MYC amplification in glioblastoma cells increase glycolytic flux and lower NAD+ levels, similarly leading to increased susceptibility to NAMPT inhibitors (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevance of the NAMPTE2F2ID pathway to these specific molecular contexts is an interesting question for future investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted, however, that inhibiting NAMPT carries therapeutic challenges, because systemic NAMPT inhibition is known to cause retinal toxicity and potential blindness (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, local NAMPT inhibitory strategies or disruption of the tumor-specific signals regulating NAMPT or its downstream consequences need to be carefully considered for potential clinical translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before this study, the precise role of E2F2 in glioblastoma has remained enigmatic because deregulated E2F2 levels in both directions have been shown to inhibit glioblastoma cell functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, overexpression of E2F2 in U343 cells induced apoptosis (31), whereas E2F2 knockdown inhibited the tumorigenicity of U87MG cells (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that NAMPT and NMNAT1 are required for E2F2 expression, which is essential for self-renewal in human GSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that tightly regulated levels of E2F2 are needed for appropriate control of S-phase entry, self-renewal, and cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important mechanistic question is how nuclear NAD+ levels regulate E2F2 mRNA in GSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its metabolic functions, NAD+ can influence transcriptional programs as a cofactor for NAD+-dependent enzymes, including the sirtuins, poly- and mono-ADP ribosyl transferases, and ADP ribosyl cyclases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Which specific nuclear NAD+-dependent events lead to E2F2-ID remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The biological roles and mechanisms of ID family proteins in glioblastoma have been the subject of intense recent investigation (23, 3336).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Benezra and colleagues (23) identified a self-renewing subpopulation expressing high levels of Id1 in a PDGFB-driven Arf/ mouse model of glioblastoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, combined genetic deletion of Id1, Id2, and Id3 in a HrasV12 and p53 knockdown-driven mouse model of high-grade glioma inhibited in vivo tumorigenicity and caused GSC exit from the perivascular niche, suggesting functional redundancy among Id family members (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, acute knockdown of ID1 alone in human GSCs was sufficient to reduce tumor formation in vivo, suggesting compensatory mechanisms for acute ID1 loss may be less robust (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We found the NAMPT-E2F2-ID1 pathway is up-regulated in GSCs following radiation and represents a protective response to radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our results, E2F2 was found to have a protective role in radiation-induced, p53-independent apoptosis in Drosophila third-instar larvae (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ID1 has recently been shown to be necessary for prostaglandin E2-mediated radiation resistance in mouse glioblastoma cells, and ID1+ human GSCs appear to be relatively radiation resistant (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that additional NAD+-dependent consequences independent of E2F2 and ID1 also play a role in GSC radioresistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Identification_of_Evolutionary_Conserved_Transcription_Factor_Binding_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ECR browser (https://ecrbrowser.dcode.org) was used to identify evolutionarily conserved regions in seven mammalian species (Homo sapiens, Didelphis virginiana, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Canis familiaris, Macaca mulatta, and Pan troglodytes) within the region spanning 1209 and 709 from the TSS for ID1 and within 3.5 kb upstream of the transcription start site for the ID24 genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The JASPAR database was used to identify E2F2 binding motifs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolutionarily conserved E2F2 binding sites based on these motifs were then identified in the promoter regions of the ID genes using rVista.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TCGA_and_REMBRANDT_Data_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TCGA data were downloaded from the University of California, Santa Cruz, cancer browser (version 2015-02-24): the Affymetrix hgu133 mRNA gene expression for 529 glioblastoma tumor samples and 10 normal brain tissue samples, clinical data on 629 samples, and subtype classification as defined by Verhaak et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (39): neural, proneural, mesenchymal and classical (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall survival of patients with NAMPT expression level greater than or equal to median and less than median was compared using KaplanMeier survival curves, and the log-rank test was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the REMBRANDT data, Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarray data for glioblastoma tumors were downloaded from ArrayExpress (E-MTAB-3073) and processed using ExpressionFileCreator (GenePattern).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expression dataset was integrated with the clinical data downloaded from G-DOC (https://gdoc.georgetown.edu/gdoc/?url-%2Fworkflows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall survival was calculated as with the TCGA data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the REMBRANDT grade 2 and 3 glioma data analysis, raw gene expression data [Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 (HG-U133_Plus_2)] and clinic data were downloaded from the housed data at Georgetown University (https://gdoc.georgetown.edu/gdoc/?url=%2FstudyDataSource%2Fshow%2F580).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw CEL files were preprocessed (for background correction and quantile between-array normalization) using the RMA method implemented in the Bioconductor affy package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For TCGA grade 2 and 3 glioma data analysis, NAMPT RNA seq v2 (from RSEM) data and clinic data on 530 samples was assessed using Bioconductor package cgdsr (Memorial Sloan Kettering).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RNA_Sequencing__Data_Acquisition__Quality_Control__and_Processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
GSCs were treated with 100 nM FK866 for 3 d, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ribosomal RNA was removed by a hybridization method using Ribo-ZERO kits (Illumina).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mRNA was then fragmented and reverse transcribed to yield double-stranded cDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNA was blunt ended, had an A base added to the 3 ends, and then had Illumina sequencing adapters ligated to the ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligated fragments were then amplified for 12 cycles using primers incorporating unique index tags.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fragments were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq-2500 using single reads extending 50 bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq reads were aligned to the Ensembl release 76 assembly with STAR version 2.0.4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene counts were derived from the number of uniquely aligned unambiguous reads by Subread:featureCount version 1.4.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcript counts were produced by Sailfish version 0.6.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing performance was assessed for total number of aligned reads, total number of uniquely aligned reads, genes and transcripts detected, ribosomal fraction known junction saturation, and read distribution over known gene models with RSeQC version 2.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All gene-level and transcript counts were then imported into the R/Bioconductor package EdgeR and TMM normalization size factors were calculated to adjust for samples for differences in library size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes or transcripts not expressed in any sample were excluded from further analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TMM size factors and the matrix of counts were then imported into R/Bioconductor package limma, and weighted likelihoods based on the observed meanvariance relationship of every gene/transcript were then calculated for all samples with the Voom function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Performance of the samples was assessed with a Spearman correlation matrix and multidimensional scaling plots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene/transcript performance was assessed with plots of residual SD of every gene to their average log-count with a robustly fitted trend line of the residuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generalized linear models with robust dispersion estimates were then created to test for gene/transcript level differential expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differentially expressed genes and transcripts were then filtered for FDR adjusted P  0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene Ontology analysis was performed by using the R/Bioconductor packages GAGE and Pathview.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heat map was generated by using Cluster software and visualized with Java TreeView.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ARACNe_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA sequencing gene expression profiles of 169 glioblastoma patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas were downloaded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene interactome network was created using the ARACNe algorithm as previously described (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subnetworks containing differentially expressed genes in the GSC RNA-seq data were extracted from the whole GBM interactome network by Cytoscape software (www.cytoscape.org).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

iRegulon_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For identification of enriched transcription factor motifs and their targets in the RNA-seq data, Cytoscape plugin iRegulon v1.3 was used (iregulon.aertslab.org) (21) with the following parameters: maximum false-discovery rate on motif similarity: 0.001, putative regulatory region: 10 kb centered on the TSS, and minimum normalized enrichment score of 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Statistical tests were performed using XLSTAT (Addinsoft) or Excel (Microsoft).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unpaired Students t test was used for comparisons between two conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For experiments with more than two groups, ANOVA was performed followed by Fishers least significant difference or the Bonferroni test for pairwise comparison among three or more than three groups, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GraphPad Prism was used to generate KaplanMeier survival curves and perform log-rank tests on survival data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All images are representative of results obtained from three independent experiments unless otherwise stated, and all data show results from three independent experiments unless otherwise mentioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
