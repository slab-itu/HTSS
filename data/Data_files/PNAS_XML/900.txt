Macroevolutionary shifts of WntA function potentiate butterfly wing-pattern diversity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our study assesses the long-held hypothesis that evolution of new gene functions underlies the diversification of animal forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, we systematically compared the patterning roles of a single gene across seven butterfly species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under a null hypothesis of gene stasis, each knockout experiment should yield directly comparable phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We instead observed a varied repertoire of lineage-specific effects in different wing regions, demonstrating that the repeated modification of a key instructive signal was instrumental in the complex evolution of wing color patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These comparative data confirm the heuristic potential of CRISPR mutagenesis in nontraditional model organisms and illustrate the principle that biodiversity can emerge from the tinkering of homologous genetic factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Butterfly wing patterns provide a rich comparative framework to study how morphological complexity develops and evolves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used CRISPR/Cas9 somatic mutagenesis to test a patterning role for WntA, a signaling ligand gene previously identified as a hotspot of shape-tuning alleles involved in wing mimicry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that WntA loss-of-function causes multiple modifications of pattern elements in seven nymphalid butterfly species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In three butterflies with a conserved wing-pattern arrangement, WntA is necessary for the induction of stripe-like patterns known as symmetry systems and acquired a novel eyespot activator role specific to Vanessa forewings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two Heliconius species, WntA specifies the boundaries between melanic fields and the light-color patterns that they contour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the passionvine butterfly Agraulis, WntA removal shows opposite effects on adjacent pattern elements, revealing a dual role across the wing field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, WntA acquired a divergent role in the patterning of interveinous patterns in the monarch, a basal nymphalid butterfly that lacks stripe-like symmetry systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results identify WntA as an instructive signal for the prepatterning of a biological system of exuberant diversity and illustrate how shifts in the deployment and effects of a single developmental gene underlie morphological change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We injected Cas9/sgRNA duplexes into 16 h butterfly embryos at a syncytial stage (n = 5,794 eggs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As only a fraction of the dividing nuclei are edited, the resulting mosaicism can bypass the deleterious effects of developmental mutations and yields G0 escapers that survive until the adult stage for phenotypic analysis (2123).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed CRISPR injections in seven nymphalid species to induce frameshift mutations in WntA-coding exons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 10% of hatchlings (240 of 2,293 survivors) yielded adult butterflies with mosaic knockout (mKO) pattern defects on their wings (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S9 and Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WntA_Induces_Central_Symmetry_Systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First we used CRISPR to test the effects of WntA loss-of-function on the wing patterns of the Common Buckeye Junonia coenia (tribe: Junoniini).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WntA mKOs resulted in a complete loss of the CSS, consistent with WntA expression that prefigures its shape and position in the wing imaginal disks (Fig 1 D and E and SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WntA-positive forewing B element was lost while the wg-positive D1-D2 elements (8, 24) were unaffected (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B-D1-D2 patterns have a similar color composition, indicating that WntA and wg play interchangeable roles in their induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the double loss of the distinct B and CSS patterns also illustrates the regional specificity of WntA-signaling color outputs across the wing surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the marginal section of the wing (Fig 1G), WntA mKOs resulted in a contraction of the MBS and in a shift of chevron patterns known as the distal parafocal elements (dPF) (17, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WntA may impact these distal elements by participating in complex patterning dynamics in the marginal section of the wing (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Variations_on_the_WntA_Groundplan_Theme  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next we asked if the instructive roles of WntA were phylogenetically conserved, using two other nymphalid butterflies with a groundplan organization, the Specked Wood Pararge aegeria (tribe: Satyrini) (15) and the Painted Lady Vanessa cardui (tribe: Nymphalini) (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WntA mKOs yielded consistent effects by eliminating the CSS and distalizing the parafocal elements in these two species (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 HK and 2 AH and SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in the V. cardui hindwing, the complex wave-like patterns of the CSS were lost upon severe WntA mKO and reduced in more intermediate forms (Fig 2 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two species also highlighted other aspects of WntA phenotypic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In P. aegeria hindwings, the mKO-mediated disruption of the marginal system resulted in an apparent expansion of the eyespot outer rings (SI Appendix, Fig S10D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V. cardui WntA mKOs resulted in the reduction of each dorsal forewing eyespot (P values less_than 104; Fig 2 KM) and generated color composition defects in the ventral forewing eyespots (Fig 2N and SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only V. cardui forewings are known to express WntA in their eyespots (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus infer that WntA was co-opted in the eyespot gene regulatory network of the V. cardui lineage to elaborate upon the patterning of this complex feature (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, comparisons in three species show that multifaceted modulations of WntA function have shaped variations on the basic nymphalid groundplan theme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

WntA_Induces_Pattern_Boundaries_in_Heliconius  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next focused on species that departed more markedly from the nymphalid groundplan configuration, starting with the hyperdiverse Heliconius clade (tribe: Heliconiini).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed CRISPR mKOs in Central American morphs of two species, Heliconius erato demophoon and Heliconius sara sara.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WntA removal resulted in an expansion of light-color patterns in both cases (Fig 3 A and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In H. erato demophoon, WntA expression marked melanic patches that contour forewing red and hindwing yellow stripes (Fig 3 B and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predictably, its loss-of-function resulted in the loss of the corresponding boundaries with black contours being replaced by expansions of red or yellow (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H. sara forewing disks showed a proximal and central WntA expression domains that each correspond to melanic fields that frame the signature yellow stripes of this butterfly (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both melanic intervals were lost following WntA mKOs (Fig 3H), yielding an almost uniformly yellow forewing surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hindwings showed a similar effect with WntA deficiency resulting in melanic-to-yellow switches in the antero-proximal half of the wing (Fig 3J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this treatment also revealed a cryptic stripe of red patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar phenotype is observed in subspecies of H. sara, as well as in its sister species Heliconius leucadia (SI Appendix, Fig S11), suggesting that modulations of Wnt signaling could underlie these cases of natural variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these data support previous predictions that groundplan elements such as the CSS can be homologized to what form the apparent contours of Heliconius patterns (2729).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WntA is best thought as a prepatterning factor that determines boundaries between color fields, a view that is compatible with the replacement effects of mKOs, where WntA-deficient cells acquire the color fate of the adjacent territory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This property may explain why cis-regulatory tinkering of WntA expression seems to underlie the repeated modification of color pattern shapes across this explosive radiation (912), as it allows the coordinated modulation of color fate on either side of a moving boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Antagonistic_Roles_of_WntA_in_Adjacent_Patterns  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compared with Heliconius, the closely related Gulf Fritillary butterfly (Agraulis vanillae) has modified the nymphalid groundplan differently to produce its distinctive wing pattern (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather than continuous stripes, A. vanillae shows dispersed silver spots of identical color composition, each consisting of a core of highly reflective mirror scales (30) and an outline of black scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of silver spots express WntA or wg (14), and accordingly, all of the WntA+ patterns contracted or disappeared in WntA mKOs (Fig 3 KN and SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the wg+ elements (forewing D1 and D2), only D1 coexpressed WntA and was specifically reduced in WntA mKOs (SI Appendix, Fig S12), suggesting that silver spots respond to overall Wnt dosage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WntA mKOs also resulted in a drastic expansion of WntA-free (WntA) patterns (Fig 3O).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, butterflies treated with exogenous heparin, a ligand-binding molecule with Wnt gain-of-function effects (9, 14, 31, 32), showed the opposite outcome: expanded WntA+ and reduced WntA patterns (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reverse effects of CRISPR loss-of-function vs. heparin gain-of-function suggest that WntA activates and represses two distinct sets of patterns, and the repressed domain in fact shows a secondary wave of WntA expression in late larval instar wing disks (Fig 3P).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation leads us to propose that the dual effect of WntA may be due to a biphasic deployment, with a first wave of WntA pattern-activating expression followed by an inhibitory event in the Wnt-repressed territory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testing this working model will require the identification and expression profiling of WntA-signaling targets in A. vanillae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Repurposing_of_WntA_in_a_Reduced_Groundplan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we used the lack of visible CSS in monarchs (Danaus plexippus; tribe: Danaini) as an example of extreme divergence from the nymphalid groundplan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WntA lacked a CSS median stripe expression as expected and was instead detected around the presumptive veins, indicative of a potential role in the induction of vein-dependent patterns (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WntA mKO adults showed drastic expansions of the white interveinous patterns (Fig 4), which are usually visible as thin outlines of the veins in WT ventral wings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, white dot elements that ornate the marginal region expanded and fused following WntA mKO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other WntA mKO monarchs showed a small dorsal patch of ectopic interveinous scales in the crossvein region, demonstrating maximal WntA expression in hindwings (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a Wnt loss-of-function, this mild phenotype was reproduced by injection of dextran sulfate, a drug treatment that emulates Wnt signal inhibition in other butterflies (14, 32) (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, expression and functional data suggest that WntA was again repurposed, in this case as a repressor of interveinous white scales in the monarch lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lessons_from_Somatic_CRISPR_Phenotypes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Somatic mutagenesis yielded loss-of-function data in the G0 adults of seven butterfly species, an achievement that would have been unrealistic in the pre-CRISPR era.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental replication using various single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targets ruled out a contribution of off-target lesions, and genotyping experiments revealed a predominance of frameshift, presumably null WntA alleles (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8 and S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variations in clone size, allelic dosage, and the possible occurrence of hypomorphic mutations could underlie complex cases of mosaicism, explaining the range of observed effects (Fig 2J and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inferring the allelic composition of wing mutant clones from their genotyping is complicated by the movement of insect wing epithelial cells following adult emergence (34), as well as by the presence of cell contaminants that are unlikely to underlie the pattern phenotype (e.g., tracheal cells, neurons, hemocytes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attempted the generation of germline mutations in V. cardui to bypass the experimental limitations of somatic heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the injection of a single sgRNA targeting the WntA stop codon, we obtained an adult female bearing a modification of the forewing CSS (SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six G1 offsprings displayed the same phenotype and were all heterozygous for a 16-bp indel mutation, resulting in a C-terminal Cys-Asn-Stop  Gly-Ser-Arg-Stop editing of the predicted WntA protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allele was passed to a second generation but was subsequently lost due to an episode of high mortality in our stock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, this preliminary result illustrates the potential of CRISPR to induce a variety of loss-of-function alleles, which could be propagated via the germline for tackling future developmental questions where mosaicism is a concern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Nymphalidae family comprises about 6,000 butterfly species, most of which can be identified by their wing patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used this system as a proxy of morphological evolution and found that a single signal articulates its underlying complexity, as shown by the variety of WntA mKO phenotypes obtained across different wing regions and species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data highlight three major results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, WntA is associated with multiple pattern elements within the same individual, including within the same wing surface, e.g., both the adjacent Basalis and CSS patterns require WntA in J. coenia forewings, despite distinct color compositions, whereas CSS stripes often differ between wing surfaces (dorsal vs. ventral, forewing vs. hindwing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt signaling may combine with selector genes that mark distinct wing domains to mediate these regional-specific outputs within a single individual (24, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, spatial shifts in WntA expression cause pattern-shape evolution, exemplified by the multitude of species-specific manifestations of the CSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cis-regulatory variants of WntA (912), or alternatively, modulations of the trans-regulatory landscape that controls WntA expression, may have fashioned these macroevolutionary shifts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, WntA evolves new patterning functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was co-opted into forewing eyespot formation in the V. cardui lineage, evolved a localized pattern-inhibiting role in A. vanillae, and was repurposed for the patterning of vein-contouring markings in monarchs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, WntA instructs the formation of multiple wing-pattern elements in the nymphalid radiation, demonstrating the importance of prepatterning processes in the unfolding of complex anatomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The versatility of this signaling factor illustrates how the repeated tinkering of a developmental gene can foster boisterous evolutionary change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Experimental_Procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Butterflies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Insect stock origins, rearing conditions, and oviposition host plants are described in SI Appendix, Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Situ_Hybridizations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
WntA cDNA sequences, cloned or amplified with T7 overhang primers, were used as a template to synthesize digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe as described previously (14, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primers for amplification of template DNA are shown in SI Appendix, Table S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ hybridization of imaginal discs from fifth instar larvae were performed as described (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Egg_Injections  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Butterfly eggs laid on host plant leaves were collected after 16 h (SI Appendix, Tables S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  J. coenia and V. cardui eggs were then washed for 20100 s in 5% benzalkonium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich), rinsed in water, and dried in a desiccation chamber or by air ventilation for softening the chorion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To soften and separate egg mass in H. sara, clumps were treated with a 1:20 dilution of Milton sterilizing fluid (Procter and Gamble) for 4 min, rinsed with water, and dried.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eggs were arranged on a double-sided adhesive tape or glued to a glass slide, usually with the micropyle facing up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRISPR mixtures containing preassembled sgRNAs and recombinant Cas9 protein (PNA Bio) were injected, using pulled quartz or borosilicate needles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of sgRNAs and Cas9 varied between butterfly species and experiments (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genotyping  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DNA was extracted from wing muscles or single legs using the Phire animal tissue direct PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and amplified using oligonucleotides flanking the sgRNAs target region (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR amplicons were gel-purified, subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega), and sequenced on an ABI 3730 sequencer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
