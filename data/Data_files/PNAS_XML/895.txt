Exposure to seismic air gun signals causes physiological harm and alters behavior in the scallop Pecten fumatus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Seismic surveys are used around the world as the primary means to explore for oil and gas deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Almost nothing is known regarding the impact of these sound signals on marine invertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, the physiological and behavioral effects of exposure on a commercially important bivalve, the scallop, were quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following a field-based air gun exposure regime, exposed scallops were found to have significantly increased mortality rates; disrupted behavioral patterns and reflex responses, both during and following exposure; and altered hemolymph biochemistry, physiology, and osmoregulation capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that air gun exposure has a harmful impact on scallops and raises concern over the impact on bivalves, due to their global ecological and economic importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Seismic surveys map the seabed using intense, low-frequency sound signals that penetrate kilometers into the Earths crust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known regarding how invertebrates, including economically and ecologically important bivalves, are affected by exposure to seismic signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a series of field-based experiments, we investigate the impact of exposure to seismic surveys on scallops, using measurements of physiological and behavioral parameters to determine whether exposure may cause mass mortality or result in other sublethal effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure to seismic signals was found to significantly increase mortality, particularly over a chronic (months postexposure) time scale, though not beyond naturally occurring rates of mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure did not elicit energetically expensive behaviors, but scallops showed significant changes in behavioral patterns during exposure, through a reduction in classic behaviors and demonstration of a nonclassic flinch response to air gun signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, scallops showed persistent alterations in recessing reflex behavior following exposure, with the rate of recessing increasing with repeated exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hemolymph (blood analog) physiology showed a compromised capacity for homeostasis and potential immunodeficiency, as a range of hemolymph biochemistry parameters were altered and the density of circulating hemocytes (blood cell analog) was significantly reduced, with effects observed over acute (hours to days) and chronic (months) scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of the air gun had no effect, but repeated exposure intensified responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulate that the observed impacts resulted from high seabed ground accelerations driven by the air gun signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the scope of physiological disruption, we conclude that seismic exposure can harm scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Estimated global undiscovered oil [million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) scale] and bivalve (mussels, oysters, scallops, clams) production (tonnes scale).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Undiscovered oil estimates were sourced from US Geological Survey (71).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bivalve capture and aquaculture fishery production data were sourced from Food and Agriculture Organization (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Seismic_Exposure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The calculated sound exposure levels (SEL) and measured ground roll acceleration for the different scallop experimental regimes are given in Table 1, with the best fit curves used to determine values shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the modeled levels of a hypothetical 3,065-in3 full-scale array (Table 2 and Fig S2), the scallops exposed to one pass in the present study experienced exposures equivalent to a large commercial array passing within a 114- to 875-m range, the scallops exposed to two passes experienced the equivalent of a full scale array at 114- to 500-m range, and the scallops exposed to four passes received the equivalent of a full scale array passing at 114- to 275-m range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These range bounds were derived from the spread of comparative ranges when comparing our experimental air gun to the hypothetical air gun array, for single-shot SEL, cumulative SEL, and maximum values of the maximum magnitude of the single-shot ground acceleration vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower range bounds were set by ground acceleration, and upper range bounds were set by cumulative SEL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mortality  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cumulative mortality at the conclusion of the 2013 experiment (i.e., day 120 postexposure) was 3.8% for control zero-pass scallops, 9.4% for one-pass scallops, 11.3% for two-pass scallops, and 14.8% for four-pass scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 2014 experiment, cumulative mortality rates at day 120 were similar (P = 0.48), with 3.6% in the control zero-pass treatment, 11.3% in one-pass treatment, 16.1% in two-pass treatment, and 17.5% in four-pass treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The number of passes scallops were subjected to significantly increased the cumulative number of mortalities (P = 0.009).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure also significantly increased the probability of mortality over time (P less_than 0.001), with daily odds of mortality 0.1%, 1.2%, and 1.3% higher in scallops exposed to one, two, and four passes, respectively, relative to that of controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the 2015 experiment, mortality rates were 5% in control scallops and 20% in exposed scallops at day 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 120, both treatments, the control zero-pass scallops and the four-pass scallops, were found to have suffered 100% mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This loss was not attributed to seismic exposure, as the control group also suffered complete mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Behavior_and_Reflexes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Qualitative analysis of video showed no evidence to support the hypothesis that seismic exposure promoted energetically expensive behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 2014 experiment, out of 51 observed individual scallops, only four instances of swimming were observed between two individuals, which were brief (less_than5 s) and appeared either as responses to movements of other scallops or to adjust positioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 2015 experiment, none of the 19 scallops were observed to swim.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was also no evidence of extended valve closure, as only two individuals, one each in 2014 and 2015, were observed to remain closed throughout observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation was further tested by comparing tentacle state (extended, partially retracted, retracted) during preexposure, intraexposure, and postexposure time periods (Table S1), with no significant relationship between exposure and tentacle state found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitative analysis of behavior during exposure showed a significant reduction (P less_than 0.001; Table S2) in the occurrence of classic behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction was specifically in response to exposure, as no differences were observed in the periods before (P = 0.38) or following (P = 0.14) exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, a novel, nonclassic behavior, best described as a velar flinch, was observed (see Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior was characterized by a rapid retraction of the velum and was distinct from the classic cough or close in that the upper valve, tentacles, and mantle were maintained in their normal resting state, unchanged relative to their position before the air gun signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, the velum was rapidly sucked in and then returned to position, with the whole behavior lasting less than 1 s. The behavior was observed exclusively in response to air gun signals at a maximum range of 350 m and continued to occur as the vessel approached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was commonly observed just before the audible air gun signal, likely in response to the ground roll detected by the geophones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Velar flinches were the only observed behavior categorized as nonclassic and were significantly more frequent (P = 0.002) in two-pass scallops and four-pass scallops, in which they were observed in 100% and 75% of individuals, respectively, than in one-pass scallops, in which they were observed in 50% of individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recessing time showed a significant response to exposure in all three experiments, with increasing levels of exposure resulting in increasingly rapid recessing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2013 experiment [2(3) = 18.06, n = 131, P less_than 0.001], four-pass scallops were found to recess significantly faster than both zero-pass and one-pass treatments (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2014 experiment, the recessing test was performed twice: immediately after exposure, as in the 2013 experiment, and again just before the day 120 sampling point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the first test (Fig 2B), there was a significant difference in time to recessing [2(3) = 16.33, n = 146, P less_than 0.001], with four-pass and two-pass scallops recessing significantly faster than zero-pass scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second recessing test for the 2014 experiment (Fig 2C), conducted before day 120, four-pass scallops recessed significantly faster than zero-pass scallops [2(3) = 8.66, n = 55, P = 0.034].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2015 experiment (Fig 2D), the recessing test was only performed immediately after air gun exposure, due to mortality of all scallops before the 120-d sample point, and, again, the recessing rate was significantly different [2(1) = 13.30, n = 65, P less_than 0.001], with four-pass scallops recessing more quickly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Hemolymph_Physiology_and_Biochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the winter 2013 experiment (Fig 3A) on dredge-collected scallops, both exposure and sample time had a significant effect on hemocyte counts [F(6,182) = 3.54, P = 0.002], with control scallops showing significantly higher counts than exposed scallops immediately following exposure, with the number of hemocytes of zero-pass control scallops 73% and 75% greater than that of two- and four-pass scallops, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 14, a slight decline in mean hemocyte numbers in zero-pass control scallops resulted in no significant differences found between control and exposed treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 120, the mean total hemocyte count of zero-pass control, one-pass, and two-pass scallops increased significantly from the levels recorded at days 0 and 14, whereas four-pass scallops remained at a similar level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of increase differed, however, as zero-pass control scallops had 60 to 90% more hemocytes at day 120 than the three exposed treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the winter 2014 experiment using hand-collected scallops, the interaction between exposure level and sample time was again significant [F(6,174) = 17.69, P less_than 0.001], although, in this experiment, no difference was found in the number of hemocytes between zero-pass controls and any of the exposure treatments at day 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 14, four-pass scallops had a 41% higher total hemocyte count than zero-pass controls, a difference that was significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar response was observed in the 2015 experiment, which was conducted in the summer using hand-collected scallops, with four-pass scallops showing 21% higher total hemocyte count [t(33.3) = 2.44, P = 0.03] at day 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 120 in the 2014 experiment, zero-pass control scallops maintained a similar hemocyte count to the previous sample points, whereas one-pass, two-pass, and four-pass scallops showed a significant decline to levels 40 to 50% of that of the control treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparison of hemolymph pH (Fig 3B) values for the winter 2013 experiment using scallops collected via dredge showed a significant interaction with air gun passes and sample time [F(6,189) = 2.307, P = 0.036], with pairwise comparison indicating that, at day 0, one-pass scallops had a significantly higher pH than the zero-, two-, and four-pass scallops, which was the only difference between treatments at the three sample points in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general trend observed across the three sample points was alkaline pH values at day 0 (8.00 for all scallops), to moderately alkaline values at day 14 (between 7.85 and 7.91 for all scallops), to normal levels by day 120 (between 7.46 and 7.63 for all scallops).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the hand-collected scallops in the winter 2014 experiment, pH showed a significant interaction between air gun passes and sample time [F(6,182) = 4.544, P less_than 0.001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with control scallops, one-pass, two-pass, and four-pass scallops had a significantly more alkaline pH at day 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 14, four-pass scallops had a significantly more alkaline pH than zero-pass control, one-pass, and two-pass scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No differences were found between control scallops and any of the exposed treatments at day 120.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the lone sample point from the summer 2015 hand-collected scallop experiment, day 14, hemolymph pH was significantly more alkaline in four-pass scallops than in zero-pass scallops [t(29.65) = 3.8253].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Assays of humoral electrolyte and mineral ion levels, which were conducted on samples collected in the winter 2014 experiment, showed a range of responses to air gun exposure (Table 3 for a summary of all responses, and see Table S3 for mean values and statistics for all assays).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hemolymph sodium (Na) concentration showed a significant response to both exposure [F(3,179) = 8.220, P less_than 0.001] and sample time [F(2,179) = 4.407, P = 0.014], but not the interaction of the terms [F(6,179) = 1.930, P = 0.078], with exposure resulting in increased Na concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample time showed significantly lower Na concentrations in day 0 samples compared with day 14 and day 120 samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure level significantly affected potassium (K) concentrations [F(3,179) = 8.303, P less_than 0.001], with four-pass scallops showing significantly higher K levels than zero-pass, one-pass, and two-pass scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there were differences in Na and K, there was no significant difference in Na:K ratio, in response to either exposure [F(3,179) = 2.373, P = 0.072] or sample time [F(2,179) = 0.126, P = 0.88].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There was a significant interaction between exposure and sample time for hemolymph concentration of magnesium [F(6,179) = 3.668, P = 0.0018], which tended to show a reduction in exposed scallops relative to controls; bicarbonate [F(6,174) = 2.274, P = 0.039], which was reduced in response to higher levels of exposure in the short and medium term; and calcium [F(6,180) = 2.891, P = 0.010], which was elevated in exposed scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chloride ions (Cl) differed significantly as a result of exposure [F(3,179) = 4.1, P = 0.007], with four-pass scallops showing elevated levels of Cl compared with zero-pass, one-pass, and two-pass scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phosphorus levels differed significantly as a result of exposure [F(3,179) = 4.791, P = 0.003], although, in this case, two-pass scallops had phosphorus levels significantly lower than zero-, one-, and four-pass scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Organic molecules (Table S4 for all mean values and statistics) showed a more limited response, with significant differences only in total protein and glucose levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For protein, exposure and sample time displayed a significant interaction [F(6,178) = 2.579, P = 0.020], although no significant differences were found among relevant treatments and sample times following post hoc analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For glucose, exposure had a significant effect [F(3,180) = 5.37, P = 0.01), with zero-pass scallops showing higher glucose levels than one-pass and four-pass scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A common criticism of animal exposure experiments with air gun sources is that they do not represent real seismic sources or that the exposure either exceeds or is lower than that of a real seismic source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, a single air gun was used in open-water, field conditions to expose scallops in a natural habitat setting to signals emulating a larger commercial seismic array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an exposure regime based on multiple passes, scallops received SELs and ground excitation comparable to that of a large commercial source passing within a few hundred meters, based on comparisons with commercial arrays and modeling of multiple passes of commercial sources (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here we found that seismic exposure, particularly repeated exposure, significantly increased mortality in the scallop P. fumatus compared with the 4 to 5% mortality rate in control scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed mortality rates in all three experiments, which ranged from 9 to 11% in one-pass scallops to 13 to 20% in four-pass scallops, were not representative of a mass mortality event (34) and were at the low end of the range of the naturally occurring mortality rate documented in the wild, which ranges from 11 to 51% with a 6-y mean of 38% and a well-established correlation to fishery stress (3537).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the arbitrary endpoint of 120 d postexposure, mortality could have potentially continued to increase in the exposed treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One way in which seismic air gun exposure could result in mass mortality is by driving scallops to energetically expensive behaviors such as extensive swimming or long periods of valve closure, although neither qualitative analysis of behavior during exposure nor quantitative analysis of tentacle state (38, 39) offered support for this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, exposed scallops showed two disruptions to behavioral patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, exposed scallops demonstrated a marked reduction in classic behaviors during exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, exposed scallops exhibited a novel velar flinch behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This novel flinching behavior was only observed in direct response to air gun signals, often slightly before the signal was audible, suggesting that the behavior is in response to the faster-traveling groundborne energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether these changes in behavior might have an ecological impact on scallops is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velar flinch cannot be interpreted as a sign of stress or negative impact on its own, although it is clearly an acute response to exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in classic behaviors, potentially an indication of a reduced capacity to respond to other stimuli, was apparent only during exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As there was no difference in behavior between control and exposed scallops in the postexposure observation period, any long-term manifestation of this behavioral response is unlikely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The scallops recessing reflex, in which a scallop uses jets of water to create a depression in the sediment while also covering itself with sediment, was also impacted by exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recessing appears to be the natural state for scallops in the Pecten genus (28, 29), assisting feeding, conferring protection from predators, preventing shell fouling, and reducing hydrodynamic profile (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, scallops demonstrate slowed recessing in response to stress, resulting from energy depletion during exposure (4042); however, seismic exposure elicited the opposite effect, with repeated exposure increasing the rate of recessing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in these previous studies, the recessing time in stress-affected scallops had returned to normal within 1 d to 3 d (4042), whereas, in the present study, the impacted response persisted to at least 120 d after exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that energy depletion caused the slowed recessing previously observed, it is not surprising that scallops exposed to air gun signals did not respond similarly, as swimming or valve closing behavior was not observed during air gun exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the more rapid recessing of exposed scallops cannot easily be explained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesize that exposure impacted elements of the scallop sensory system, with the statocyst and the abdominal sense organ as potential candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paired statocysts are the primary mechanosensory organ in scallops, as in many invertebrates, that provide a sense of balance through reception of gravity (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abdominal sense organ, a sickle-shaped pocket in the mantle fold densely populated with sensory hairs, has been indicated to play a role in mechanoreception and directional sensitivity (44), based on its high sensitivity to water- and ground-borne vibrations (45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the abnormal reflex results found in this study are indicative of damage to mechanosensory organs, exposed scallops may face considerable ecological ramifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of the statocyst nerve caused scallops to lose the ability to control the vertical component of their swimming (47), thus compromising a primary mechanism of predator avoidance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abdominal sense organ has also been suggested to contribute to predator detection, with the detection of waterborne vibrations originating from above the scallop filling in a blind spot of the visual, tactile, and chemoreceptive systems (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The physiological response to exposure was explored through the hemolymph of the scallop, which is the invertebrate analog to vertebrate blood and performs many of the same functions, including gas exchange, nutrient and waste transport, osmoregulation, and immune function (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these hemolymph parameters are useful for interpreting health, care must be taken in comparisons over time, as bivalve hemolymph tends to show considerable variation in hemolymph parameters in response to biotic (reproductive cycle, nutritional condition) and abiotic (temperature, food availability) factors (30, 4951).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variability is particularly relevant to the 2015 experiment in this study, which was conducted in the summer, whereas the 2013 and 2014 experiments were conducted in the winter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This seasonal difference, along with having only one sampling point in the 2015 experiment, makes comparing the 2015 experiment to the winter experiments difficult, due to the influence of water temperature, nutritional condition, and reproductive state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effect of exposure on the cellular component of the hemolymph, which is responsible for mediating immune function, was quantified through total hemocyte counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that our hypothesis regarding hemocyte counts, that exposure would cause a short-lived increase in the number of circulating hemocytes in a response similar to that of other stressors, was largely unsupported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2013, scallops had comparatively low hemocyte levels early in the experiment (i.e., days 0 and 14), with exposed treatments receiving multiple passes showing depressed hemocyte counts compared with controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, in 2014, exposed scallops showed elevated hemocyte numbers at day 14 compared with controls, consistent with the typical bivalve response to stress (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissimilarities between experiments in hemocyte response at initial sample points can likely be attributed to the differences in collection methods, as scallops for the 2013 experiment were collected via dredging and scallops for the 2014 and 2015 experiments were hand-collected by divers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response to exposure of the 2013 scallops probably includes a latent response to the stresses resulting from dredging and repeated transportation (41), with the comparatively low levels of hemocytes and the immediate hemocyte response observed in exposed scallops in the 2013 experiment suggesting a synergy between dredging stress and seismic exposure that accelerated the overall response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In both the 2013 and 2014 experiments, hemocyte numbers had decreased by day 120 in exposed scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although conclusions regarding immune function cannot be directly drawn from hemocyte count results, the depressed levels in exposed scallops suggest that the scallops in this study were immunocompromised, one of the most important drivers of mortality in bivalves (52, 53), and direct assays of immune function (i.e., differential hemocyte counts; assays of phagocytosis, hemocyte membrane stability, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are an important next step for understanding the impacts of exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Like hemocyte counts, hemolymph pH indicated that the scallops in the 2013 experiment showed stress from dredging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that experiment, hemolymph pH values were high at days 0 and 14 in control and all exposed treatments compared with those from the subsequent experiments, with levels of 8.00 and 7.85, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By day 120 postexposure, pH levels in all treatments, including controls, had returned to the expected range (between 7.46 and 7.63), with no difference between any treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results followed our hypothesis of stable hemolymph biochemistry; however, the stress response would have masked any experimental response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 2014 and 2015 experiments, the prediction of stable pH was unsupported, as exposure resulted in elevated pH levels, or alkalosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reports of alkalosis in marine invertebrates are rare in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only report of alkalosis in a marine bivalve, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (54), resulted from extensive handling, shell drilling, cannulation, and repeated drawing of hemolymph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More broadly, alkalosis in marine invertebrates, primarily cephalopods, has been reported to occur in response to functional and environmental hypoxia as metabolism shifts to anaerobic pathways (5560).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are considerable differences between these reported cases of alkalosis and its occurrence observed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, scallops were in normoxic seawater throughout the experiment and demonstrated a decrease in hemolymph bicarbonate, rather than the increase typical of other molluscs, suggesting that mobilization of bicarbonate from the shell is unlikely to be a factor in the response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, alkalosis in scallops was persistent for at least 14 d, far longer than the scale of hours previously reported in any invertebrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms of this response warrant further study, as they likely differ from those previously investigated, given the substantially different circumstances between this study and previous reports of alkalosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exposure to air gun signals also resulted in considerable and persistent osmoregulation disruption, as the a priori hypothesis of stable hemolymph biochemistry was again unsupported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to adaptation to the stable nature of their sublittoral habitat, scallops show a limited capacity for regulation of hemolymph ion concentration (61, 62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a broad scope of changes was observed, with every mineral and electrolyte assayed showing a significant alteration in response to exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in hemolymph ion concentration have been observed in abalone (Haliotis diversicolor supertexta) in response to osmotic stress (63) and hypoxia (64), but not in response to thermal stress (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is notable that hemolymph electrolyte ions in stressed abalone stabilized within days, whereas the scallops in the present study showed changes over chronic time scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular damage decreased hemolymph sodium and chloride concentration and increased potassium concentration in mussels (Mytilus edulis) in response to the interaction of anoxia, metal toxicity, temperature, and salinity (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is difficult to conclude whether cellular damage played a role in the scallops response to exposure, as damage causing cellular leakage would be expected to increase the hemolymph concentration of all hypotonic cellular ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although some hypotonic ions (e.g., potassium) increased as would be expected, others (e.g., magnesium) decreased following exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whatever the mechanism, these imbalances in hemolymph electrolyte ions can disrupt the membrane potential, affecting a range of biological functions, such as proton pump function, active transport across the cell membrane, and enzyme function within the cell (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exploration for petroleum and the development of shellfish fisheries are necessary processes for these extractive industries that need to coexist in the marine environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, exposure to seismic surveys left scallops behaviorally and physiologically impacted and in a state such that any additional stress (e.g., dredging, warm water conditions, predation stress) could lead to further impairment or mortality (67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate a need for further study into the impacts of seismic signals, and, more generally, anthropogenic aquatic noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the mechanistic underpinnings and ecological impacts of these responses to exposure require further characterization to understand the overall economic and ecological implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid future conflict, a comprehensive understanding of how these industries may impact each other will be required in order to facilitate effective management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Animal_Care_and_Experimental_Design  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The present study comprised three experiments exposing the commercial scallop (P. fumatus) to signals from a Sercel G Gun II operated at 2,000 psi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first experiment, referred to as the 2013 experiment hereafter, was conducted in July 2013 (austral winter) using 240 adult scallops that were collected by a commercial scallop dredge fishing vessel from the fishery near Ille des Phoques, Tasmania (42°2120.62S 148°103.25E; Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this experiment, the air gun was fitted with a 45-in3 chamber for exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scallops were randomly assigned to four treatments of exposure levels defined by the number of passes of the seismic air gunzero passes (control), one pass, two passes, and four passesand color-coded and numbered tags (Glue On Shellfish Tags; Hallprint Fish Tags) were used to identify the treatment and individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether time was a factor in any observed response, scallops from each of these treatments were sampled at three different points following exposure: 0 d, 14 d, and 120 d. Thus, 12 scallops (i.e., three sample days × four treatment levels) were placed into each of the 20 enclosures at the field site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the second experiment, referred to as the 2014 experiment hereafter, was conducted in July 2014 (austral winter) using a 150-in3 chamber on the air gun, and 240 adult scallops were hand-collected by divers from Coles Bay, Tasmania (42°0745.07S, 148°1603.83E; Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment groups and sample times were identical to those of the 2013 experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The final experiment, the 2015 experiment, was conducted in March 2015 (austral summer), again using a 150-in3 chamber on the air gun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this experiment, the number of treatment groups was reduced to two (zero-pass and four-pass) and the number of sample points was reduced to two (14 d, 120 d), so 80 adult scallops were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scallops were again hand-collected by divers from Coles Bay, Tasmania, at the same site as the 2014 experiment, with four scallops (i.e., two sample days × two treatment levels) placed into each enclosure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before and following experimental field work, scallops used in this study were held at the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), Taroona, Tasmania (42° 5659.13S, 147° 2116.60 E; Fig 4), in a 3,400-L (2 m × 2 m × 0.85 m) tank with ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10 cm of sand substrate with ambient temperature (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13 °C in 2013 and 2014 experiments, ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17 °C in 2015 experiment) seawater supplied by a flow-through system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scallops were held at IMAS for 1 wk before transport to the field site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scallops were transported to IMAS in plastic bins lined and covered with burlap sacks wetted with seawater (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The field site for all three experiments, near Blackjack Rocks north of Betsey Island, Tasmania (43°0216.37S, 147°2830.14E; Fig 4), was a sand flat at 10 m to 12 m depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scallops were transported to the site in a large bin (1.2 m × 0.75 m × 1 m) of seawater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A deck hose was used to pump fresh seawater into the bin to maintain O2 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the field site, divers placed scallops into 1.5-m-tall cylindrical enclosures (Fig S3) constructed of 2-cm mesh with a 1.2-m-diameter floating ring at the top and skirted by a ring of heavy-gauge chain at the bottom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enclosure bottoms were not meshed, allowing for scallops to be in contact with the sandy seabed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scallops were held in the enclosures for a 2-d acclimation period before the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the 2014 and 2015 experiments, video cameras were placed into 10 randomly selected scallop enclosures at the start of the experiment to allow for behavioral analysis of scallops during the control pass and before, during, and following each air gun exposure pass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All research was conducted in accordance with University of Tasmania Animal Ethics Committee Permit A13328.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with Tasmania Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment Permits 13011 and 14038.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Exposure_and_Air_Gun_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the beginning of the experimental procedure, the air gun vessel was positioned 1 km from the scallop enclosures, with the air gun deployed and towed at a depth of 5.1 m. First, a control (zero-pass) run was conducted, in which the air gun was deployed and charged but not fired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vessel approached the scallop enclosures at a speed of 1.85 ms1 (3.5 kn) following a predetermined path that was used for all runs (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the control run, divers collected the scallops assigned to the control treatment based on tag color.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon retrieval, scallops were randomly assigned to sample points (0 d, 14 d, or 120 d postexposure in 2013 and 2014; 14 d or 120 d postexposure in 2015) and placed into a large bin of seawater continually supplied with fresh seawater via the deck hose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After zero-pass control scallops were collected, the air gun vessel returned to the starting point and began firing the air gun, with one shot every 11.6s, while following the approach toward the scallop enclosures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the conclusion of the run, divers collected the scallops assigned to the one-pass treatment, which were assigned to sample times and placed into the bin of seawater and returned to IMAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same process was followed for passes two through four.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following each air gun pass, the air cylinders used to power the air gun required recharging via onboard scuba compressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As this process lasted for several hours, the number of air gun runs that could be conducted was limited, so the zero-pass and one-pass runs were conducted in 1 d and passes two through four were conducted the following day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon return to IMAS, day 0 scallops were placed into a plastic crate that remained immersed in the holding tank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scallops were haphazardly selected from this crate for sampling, until all were done.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scallops not sampled on day 0 were used in recessing tests (details in Sampling).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the recessing test, day 14 scallops were held at IMAS, whereas day 120 scallops were haphazardly distributed into two lantern nets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nets were placed into bins lined and covered with burlap sacks wetted with seawater and transported to Spring Bay Seafoods in Triabunna, Tasmania (42°3559.65S, 148°0101.83E; Fig 4), where the lantern nets were deployed on mussel aquaculture lines that were held submerged at a depth of 10 m. The nets were left undisturbed until they were recovered and returned to the holding tanks at IMAS 1 wk before sampling at day 120, to allow for acclimation following transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hydrophones placed on the seabed monitored the normal ambient noise and the air gun signals (sound pressure) received by the scallops, and geophones were placed to measure groundborne vibrations (velocity) before and during the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sea noise loggers were located next to scallop enclosures at each end of the scallop lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A near-field logger was also deployed 0.5 m off the air gun ports to allow source levels to be quantified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed description of the methods used to determine sound levels is given in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine how the exposure regimes in this experiment equated to exposure to full-scale seismic surveys, measured levels were compared with those of a modeled 3,065-in3 3D array source operating in 50-m water depth, based on data collected from previous surveys (1, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details of this model are provided in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sampling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mortality was assessed throughout the postexposure holding period through observation of abnormal positioning (i.e., inverted on the substrate, not recessed for an extended period, leaned up against the side of the tank, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  during periodic (i.e., at least three times per week) monitoring of the scallop tank or through discovery during sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any observed mortalities were rounded to the next sampling point, i.e., a dead scallop discovered at day 10 was considered dead at the day 14 sample point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the day 120 scallops, once scallops were transported to the mussel lease, mortality was not assessed until the scallops were returned to IMAS before sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mortality rate was determined by comparing the total number of dead scallops from each treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only mortalities observed following recovery were considered; that is, losses due to predation or unrecovered animals were not counted in the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Video recordings made during seismic exposure in the 2014 and 2015 experiments were used to analyze scallop behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were divided into three categories: preexposure, intraexposure, and postexposure segments, with the first 5 mins of preexposure time and the last 5 mins of postexposure time disregarded due to the influence of divers deploying and retrieving video cameras.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each segment, all visible scallops were observed and two sets of behavioral data were recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the observed behaviors were classified into two categories, classic and nonclassic, with the former encompassing visual behaviors, e.g., reflexive closure response to shadow or movement; coughs used to irrigate the mantle cavity; valve closures characterized by mantle velum retraction and valve adduction; and locomotory behaviors, such as swimming or repositioning (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any behaviors not encompassed within the classic behavior category were classified as nonclassic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second analyzed behavior was tentacle extension, which was used as a method to evaluate valve closure (39), with tentacles recorded as either extended, partially extended, or retracted for the duration of the preexposure, intraexposure, and postexposure time categories for the 2014 and 2015 experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extended and partially extended tentacles were considered to indicate that valves were open, and tentacle retraction indicated valve closure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is important to note that the preexposure periods differ somewhat between the one-pass treatment and the higher exposure treatments, in that the one-pass scallops were naïve to any air gun exposure during the preexposure period, whereas two- and four-pass scallops had been exposed during the intraexposure period of the previous treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At each of the three sample points (at days 0, 14, and 120 postexposure in the 2013 and 2014 experiments and at day 14 in the 2015 experiment), all individuals within the four treatment levels (two treatment levels in the 2015 experiment) were terminally sampled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the adductor muscle was detached from the upper valve, and then the upper valve was removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, 2.5 mL of hemolymph was drawn from each scallop from the pericardial sinus using a prechilled syringe fitted with a 26-gauge needle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sample was divided into two aliquots: a 500-L aliquot for immediate analysis of pH (Testo 205 pH meter) and a 500-L aliquot that was added to a centrifuge tube prefilled with 500 L of anticoagulant (Lillie's formol calcium: 2% NaCl, 1% calcium acetate, 4% formaldehyde) for total hemocyte counts using an improved Neubauer hemocytometer under 40× magnification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 2014 experiment, an additional 1,500-L aliquot was drawn and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 3 min, after which 1,000 L of supernatant was transferred into a cryovial and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for later biochemical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sample was shipped, frozen on dry ice, to Diagnostic Services at the Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, and analyzed using a Cobas c501 automated biochemistry analyzer (Roche Diagnostics Corporation) for a full blood profile consisting of the electrolytes (millimoles per liter = millimolars) sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and bicarbonate (bicarb); minerals (millimoles per liter) calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P); metabolites (millimoles per liter = millimolars) glucose (Gluc), lactate (Lact), cholesterol (Chol), triglyceride (Trig), total protein (TP, in grams per liter) and uric acid (Uric, in micromoles per liter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Beginning at day 0 upon return to IMAS following exposure, the scallops scheduled for destructive sampling at days 14 and 120 postexposure were used for a recessing reflex test (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from when the scallops were placed into the holding tank following exposure, scallops were visually assessed for recessing three to four times daily at 6-h intervals, with recessing defined as having an upper valve even with the substrate level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure consistent assessment of recessing, the same researcher performed all assessments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once a scallop was observed to have recessed into the substrate, it was collected, and the time taken to recess (in hours) was recorded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all three experiments, the recessing test continued until all scallops had recessed, which was under 5 d in all cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 2014 experiment, this test was also conducted a second time, before the day 120 sample point using scallops scheduled for destructive sampling at day 120 postexposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Final sample sizes for each component of the three experiments at each sample point, which exhibited some variation due to differences in mortality rates and animals lost to predation or missing tags, are given in Table S5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate cumulative mortality in the 2013 and 2014 experiments, mortalities from each treatment were compared using a binomial regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis was restricted to the 2013 and 2014 experiments, as all scallops died while deployed on the mussel lease before the day 120 sampling point for both zero- and four-pass treatments in the 2015 experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparisons of behavioral analysis were conducted on the rate (incidences per unit time) of observations of classic and nonclassic behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rates were used, as the observational period differed between the scallops, thereby complicating the use of conventional count-based models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonclassic behavior was only observed in exposed scallops; hence the nonclassic and classic behavioral modes were analyzed separately using a generalized linear model with the number of exposure passes, the year, and temporal category (preexposure, intraexposure, and postexposure) as categorical explanatory variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tentacle extension was compared for each treatment by summing the duration each individual scallop spent in each of the three states of tentacle extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sum was then converted into a proportion of total time of each temporal category, and multinomial regression was used to analyze the behavioral modes (two options, since the proportions add up to 1) as a function of the year, treatment, and phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recessing reflex data from all three experiments was analyzed using KaplanMeier estimator analysis of the time-to-recess for each individual and compared using log-rank (MantelCox) test with  = 0.05, followed by multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction and a family-wise error rate of 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hemocyte count data from the 2013 and 2014 experiments were tested for assumptions of equality of variance (Levenes test) and normality (ShapiroWilk test) before analysis using two-way ANOVAs with air gun passes and sample time as factors and  = 0.05, followed by a Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc test for significant results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from 2013 required log transformation, and data from 2014 required square root transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from the 2015 experiment were compared using a Welch Two-Sample t test between zero- and four-pass treatments at the 14-d sample point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Hemolymph pH data for the 2013 experiment did not meet normality assumptions, so a two-way randomized permutation test ANOVA (70) with 5,000 iterations was used, with passes and sample time as factors and  = 0.05, followed by post hoc Tukey HSD tests for any significant results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2014 experiment, data met ANOVA assumptions, so a two-way ANOVA with passes and sample time as factors and  = 0.05 was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant results were analyzed using a Tukey HSD post hoc test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2015 experiment, pH was compared using a Welch t test between zero- and four-pass treatments at the 14-d sample point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Biochemistry data from the 2014 experiment was analyzed using two-way ANOVA for parametric data and randomized permutation test two-way ANOVA for nonparametric data, with passes and sample time as factors and  = 0.05, followed by post hoc using Tukey HSD tests to evaluate significant results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Except where noted otherwise, all statistical comparisons were conducted using R v3.1.3 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

All times given here are Australian Eastern standard Time [EST = Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) + 10 h] or EST with daylight saving (UTC + 11 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All times zones are indicated appropriately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All air gun and spatial analysis has been carried out in the Matlab (The Mathworks Inc.) environment using purpose-built software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Air gun signals were analyzed by (i) in a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to deal with air gun signal extraction, visualizing each high gain sea noise sample (spectrogram and waveform) with potential air gun signals, obtaining a voltage threshold which delineated air gun signals from the noise and setting the preexposure and postexposure time brackets around the detections (the time window to analyze the signal in); (ii) using the signal filtered to keep the waterborne energy (removing groundborne energy), locating the leading edge of each air gun signal using the voltage threshold set and a minimum time limit of how far apart consecutive signals must be (5 s used); (iii) checking the input voltage of each air gun signal for overloads and loading the low gain channel if an overload was found (the sea noise loggers are considered as overloaded if the voltage is 2.4 V or less_than2.4 V); (iv) displaying the location of the waterborne arrival in the GUI and manually removing any false detections; (v) obtaining a time period to bracket the waterborne signal withthis was nominally set at ±3 s but altered if the air gun signal had leading or trailing energy which fell outside of this window; (vi) bracketing the identified air gun signal time window using a multiple of two points, extracting the signal and calibrating to pascals in the time domain, accounting for variation in the system gain with frequency and using the system hydrophone sensitivity for the appropriate channel (see below)this step gave the calibrated air gun signal waveform in pascals; (vii) calculating a suite of signal descriptors (41) plus identifying the time of air gun signal waterborne arrival; (viii) calculating the power spectra of each sample (as close as possible to a 1-Hz bandwidth used); and (ix) looping through all identified air gun signals and saving the signal descriptors, received times, power spectra, and the calibrated air gun waveform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each air gun signal was calibrated from volts to pascals by extracting the noise logger signal bracketing the identified air gun signal in a multiple of two points, which was greater than the identified signal length, and passing this to a program which (i) returned the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the input waveform section (multiple of two points) at a frequency resolution of close to 0.1 Hz; (ii) calculated the system gain in linear units at a frequency spacing the same as given by the above FFT step, from 0 Hz to the Nyquist frequency, this gain including the hydrophone sensitivity; (iii) applied the linear gain correction to the FFT amplitude; (iv) assumed a unity phase correction applied to the FFT phase; (v) inverted the FFT back into the time domain; and (vi) extracted the required air gun signal (since it was of shorter duration than the section calibrated) from this corrected section of the waveform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The analysis gave the air gun signal descriptors, power spectra, received arrival time of signals (logger clock corrected for drift), and the signal waveform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time of each received air gun signal was then used to extract spatial information of the receiver location relative to the source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This involved (i) using the received shot time at the sea noise logger (waterborne arrival) to locate the closest shot in the air gun track file, then iterating the time/range of this and the previous few shots, allowing for signal travel time, to find the fired shot point which best matched the fired time plus estimated travel time to give the sea noise logger received time; (ii) for the identified air gun fired location, calculating the receiver range (horizontal and slant range), the air gun speed and heading, and the take-off angle of the receiver to the air gun heading (i.e., angle of the receiver from the air gun heading); and (iii) saving all data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All data were saved in a standard format.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 16 signal parameters, saved peak pressures, rms pressure, SEL, and signal duration were pertinent here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal duration was defined as the time taken for 90% of the signal energy to pass, with the time at which 5% and 95% of the signal energy reached defining the air gun signal onset and end (72).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The geophone data were extracted from the noise loggers using the time bounds defined for the appropriate noise logger air gun waterborne signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linear calibration was assumed and applied to correct the saved volts to velocity (meters per second), according to the system gain used (0 dB or 20 dB) and the specifications of the particular geophone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geophone response had been checked and found to match the manufacturers specifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geophones gave two horizontal (90° to each other) and one vertical velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The respective velocities were differentiated to give acceleration (meters per second squared) in the vertical or the vector sum in the horizontal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For analysis, here the absolute magnitude of the three-component acceleration vector has been used, and termed ground roll acceleration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was calculated using a Matlab vector function (cart2pol.m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acceleration magnitude has been expressed throughout in linear terms (meters per second squared) or to show trends with range, in decibel terms relative to 1 ms2 [i.e., dB re 1 ms2 as 10*log10(LinearValue/1)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparative_Commercial_Seismic_Exposures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A common criticism of animal exposure experiments with air gun sources is that they do not represent real seismic sources or that the exposure exceeds or is lower than that for a real seismic source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, we have generated a simple model of air gun exposure from a real seismic source, for comparison with experimental exposures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data of the real seismic source (1, 41, 42, 69) were used to model a seismic source operating according to the following parameters: (i) a 3,065-in3 source operating in 3D mode; (ii) two sources operated alternatively, each source located centrally 50 m either side of the sail line; (iii) four streamers spaced 100 m apart and symmetric about the sail line (a 300-m spread between outermost streamers); (iv) a 25-m along-sail-line, signal spacing; (v) a 400-m sail-line spacing; (vi) 50 m water depth; (vii) two lines sailed adjacent to the chosen sail line; (viii) an eastwest orientation; and (ix) a 2-km grid about the central receiver location (point [0 0]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The water depth was chosen to be representative of that from an area commonly fished for scallops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five sail lines were used, so statistics per line and the cumulative or maximum levels reached considering one or all lines were calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry of a survey was modeled as one set of five sail lines with the central sail line directly over the receiver location (the sources were thus 50 m offset horizontally).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the air gun sources are each 50 m adjacent to the sail line, so maximum exposure is reached when a sail line has a 50-m offset from the receiver (always at [0 0]).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was set up using empirical fits given below and run with a series of sail-line offsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To model received levels, empirical curves of transmission for SEL and maximum magnitude of ground roll were sourced for a large air gun array, as best as possible operating over sand in a similar water depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the seismic decay curves with range (33), we get a relationship of SEL with range using the mean of a 3,090- and a 3,040-in3 source operating over sand in 100 m to 150 m water depth (each source gave a correlation when using a curve of the form below of r2 = 0.99 and r2 = 0.95 with similar values for each constant), defined byRL=[23.33log10(R)]+[0.003R]+234.8,where RL is received SEL (dB re 1 µPa2·s), and R is slant range (direct range source to seabed receiver in meters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values were considered to apply to a 3,065-in3 source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this curve tracks the range-averaged trend for the given air gun arrays and thus removes air gun array directionality and sound transmission effects (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A relationship for the maximum magnitude of ground roll with range was derived using the same instruments as used here and a 3,130-in3 source operating in 40 m of water (69) asGRa=[11.51*log10(R)]+[0.0004*R]+36.9,where GRa is the maximum magnitude of ground roll in decibel values (dB re 1 ms2) for each air gun signal, and R is horizontal range (in meters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured data gave a correlation coefficient, using this fit, of r2 = 0.85.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For comparison, the 150-in3 air gun measured here during the scallop experiments (45 in3 and 150 in3) gave a fitted curve for ground roll ofGRb=[6.88log10(R)]+[0.0021R]+21.1,where GRb is the maximum magnitude of ground roll in decibel values (dB re 1 ms2) for each air gun signal, and R is horizontal range (in meters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured data gave a correlation coefficient, using this fit, of r2 = 0.78.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using these semiempirical fits and the geometry including five sail lines so as to estimate cumulative exposures of multiple passes, the curves for closest sail line and (i) estimated maximum magnitude of ground roll for any single signal (no cumulative effects considered for ground roll), (ii) the maximum SEL experienced along any line, and (iii) the cumulative SEL for all five lines are shown on Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, when the model was run with only one sail line, the cumulative SEL values shifted down by only a fraction of a decibel; thus the 2D seismic case is similar to that plotted on Fig S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The x axis given on Fig S2 is for the closest sail line to the receiver location; thus the other four lines in the calculations would have been adjacent to this sail line and away from the receiver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
