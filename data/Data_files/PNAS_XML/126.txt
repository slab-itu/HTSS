title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Structural basis for antagonizing a host restriction factor by C7 family of poxvirus host-range proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Productive viral replication requires overcoming many barriers posed by the host innate immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human sterile alpha motif domain-containing 9 (SAMD9) is a newly identified antiviral factor that is specifically targeted by poxvirus proteins belonging to the C7 family of host-range factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide the first, to our knowledge, atomic view of two functionally divergent proteins from the C7 family and determine the molecular basis that dictates whether they can target SAMD9 effectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies of distantly related C7 family members suggest that SAMD9 is an evolutionally conserved immune barrier that has been overcome successfully by diverse mammalian poxviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human sterile alpha motif domain-containing 9 (SAMD9) protein is a host restriction factor for poxviruses, but it can be overcome by some poxvirus host-range proteins that share homology with vaccinia virus C7 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the mechanism of action for this important family of host-range factors, we determined the crystal structures of C7 and myxoma virus M64, a C7 family member that is unable to antagonize SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their different functions and only 23% sequence identity, the two proteins have very similar overall structures, displaying a previously unidentified fold comprised of a compact 12-stranded antiparallel -sandwich wrapped in two short  helices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive structure-guided mutagenesis of C7 identified three loops clustered on one edge of the  sandwich as critical for viral replication and binding with SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loops are characterized with functionally important negatively charged, positively charged, and hydrophobic residues, respectively, together forming a unique three-fingered molecular claw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key residues of the claw are not conserved in two C7 family members that do not antagonize SAMD9 but are conserved in distantly related C7 family members from four poxvirus genera that infect diverse mammalian species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that all in the latter group of proteins bind SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data indicate that diverse mammalian poxviruses use a conserved molecular claw in a C7-like protein to target SAMD9 and overcome host restriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Structures_of_VACV-C7_and_MYXV-M64  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VACV-C7 and MYXV-M64 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals of selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted C7 protein were obtained and used to determine the C7 structure with the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of C7 includes all but the first two and last residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It adopts a compact -sandwich fold with an overall dimension of 45 × 35 × 30 Å (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It consists mainly of two curved layers, each comprising a six-stranded antiparallel  sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One layer comprises strands 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other layer comprises strands 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strands in the center of the sheets (3, 4, 8, and 9) are significantly longer than the ones at the ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loops of varying length connect the  strands, and two short  helices (1 and 2) on the opposite side of the  sandwich embrace the  sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helix 1 links strands 9 and 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helix 2 is located at the C-terminal end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structure of MYXV-M64 was solved by molecular replacement using the C7 structure as the template (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It includes residues 1150 but lacks the 53 C-terminal residues, which are not conserved in the C7 family (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two structures resemble each other closely with an rmsd of 0.74 Å over 136 aligned C atoms (Fig S1), although the proteins share only 23% sequence identity (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notable differences between the two structures include the presence of an  helix between strands 4 and 5 of M64 instead of a loop in C7 and a longer N terminus in M64 (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A structural similarity search using the secondary structure-matching (SSM) server (19) and DALI server (20) did not yield any significant match to the structures of VACV-C7 and MYXV-M64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

A_Unique_Three-Fingered_Molecular_Claw_Is_Critical_for_the_Host-Range_Function_of_C7  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on the structure, we performed a systematic mutagenesis study of C7 to identify residues that are critical for the host-range function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VACV mutants with various mutations in C7L and a deletion in K1L were constructed on Vero cells, which permit the replication of VACV without K1 and C7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, on VERO cells all mutants replicated similarly to VACV expressing wild-type C7 (referred to as WT VACV) (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether the mutations had any significant impact on C7 protein stability, the level of C7 protein in infected cells was determined by Western blot (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the effect of the mutations on the host-range function, viral growth was determined on a representative human cell line, HeLa cells (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The C termini of the C7 family members vary in length and sequence (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both C7 and M64 structures, the C terminus after residue 140 is not part of the compact  sandwich structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The truncation of the C terminus of C7 after residue 140 did not affect C7 stability, because the VACV mutant (m1) encoding the truncated C7 [(141150)] expressed a level of C7 protein similar to that of WT VACV (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HeLa cells, the mutant replicated to a level similar to that of WT VACV (Fig S3), indicating that the C terminus is not essential for C7 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that the functional core for the C7 family is the conserved  sandwich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, the entire surface of the C7 protein was divided into different patches, which were mutated individually by charge-reversal of the polar residues and alanine or serine substitution of the nonpolar residues (Fig 2 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many mutations on the  strands and the loops at the bottom of the  sandwich had no significant effect on the host-range function of C7 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include mutations of D38/Y39 (mutant m17) on the loop connecting strands 3 and 4 (loop ß34), of K40/K41/K43 (m3) at the tip of strand 4, of F64 (m7) on 5, of Y68 (m19) at the tip of 6, of K71/K74/D76/D77 (m20) on loop ß67 and 7, of Y99 (m22) at the end of 9, and of K123/K125/K127 (m11) on 11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations of some residues at the top of the  sandwich, including D56/E57 (m13) on loop ß45, D102/D103 (m30), and E104/E106 (m31) on loop ß91, also did not affect C7 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mutations of nine residues on three loops at the top of the  sandwich completely disrupted C7 function (Fig 2 and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are mutations of K24 (m2), D26/N27 (m15) on loop ß23, D51 (m27), W52 (m5 and m29), E54 (m28) on loop ß45, and F79/Y80/Y81 (m8) on loop ß78.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, single amino acid substitutions of K24, D51, W52, and E54 completely abolished C7 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, these mutations had no negative effect on C7 stability, because a normal level of C7 protein was detected in VERO cells, suggesting that the three loops (23, 45, and 78) are directly involved in C7 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional mutations abolished the host-range function, but the majority of these mutations (m6, m10, m14, m16, m18, m21, m24, and m26 in Table 1) appeared to affect protein folding, because the C7 protein level in VERO cells was significantly reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F108A/K109E/H110A triple mutation (m23) also is likely to affect the protein conformation, because F108 is involved in hydrophobic interactions with aliphatic side chains of R31 (3), L98, Y100 (9), and Y112 (910).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, F108/K109/H110 are not conserved in other C7-equivalent homologs (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these mutations may disrupt C7 function indirectly by affecting C7 structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our data indicate that the functional site for C7 centers on three loops, 23, 45, and 78, which together form a unique three-fingered molecular claw.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Molecular_Claw_Is_Conserved_in_C7-Equivalent_Homologs_from_Diverse_Mammalian_Poxviruses_and_Is_Essential_for_SAMD9_Binding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although VACV-C7 and MYXV-M64 share limited sequence identity and perform different functions, their overall structures are almost identical, suggesting that all C7 family members adopt the same protein fold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore carried out homology modeling of other C7 family members, including YLDV-67, SWPV-64, SPPV-63, MYXV-M62, and MYXV-M63 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the nine C7 residues we identified as being critical for its function, five residues (K24, D51, W52, E54, and F79) are highly conserved among C7-equivalent homologs (MYXV-M62, YLDV-67, SWPV-64, and SPPV-63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, at the corresponding positions of the C7-equivalent homologs, K24 and W52 have identical residues, D51 has an acidic residue (Asp or Glu), and F79 has a hydrophobic residue (Phe, Leu, or Ile).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E54 has an identical residue at the corresponding position of all homologs except MYXV-M62, which lacks two residues at the corresponding loop (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in MYXV-M62 an acidic residue is located two residues downstream, which could still result in an acidic residue at the position in MYXV-M62 that corresponds to E54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, only one or two of these five residues are conserved in MYXV-M63 and MYXV-M64 (Fig S2), which are known to function differently than VACV-C7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MYXV-M62 and VACV-C7 have been shown to bind SAMD9 (11, 15), but it is unclear whether other C7 family members do so and whether the binding is essential for their host-range function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore examined the abilities of C7 family members and C7 mutants to bind SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We infected HeLa cells with VACV expressing epitope-tagged C7 homologs or mutated C7, immunoprecipitated the tagged proteins from the cells, and examined the precipitates for the presence of SAMD9 by Western blot (Fig 4 and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously (11, 15), MYXV-M62 and VACV-C7, but not MYXV-M63, coimmunoprecipitated SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYXV-M64 and an unrelated VACV protein A6 (21) failed to precipitate SAMD9, but YLDV-67, SWPV-64, and SPPV-63 were able to precipitate SAMD9 protein from HeLa cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, mutations at the C7 molecular claw, including the single amino acid substitutions of K24, D51, W32, and E54 (m2, m5, m27, m28, and m29, respectively), abolished the ability of C7 to precipitate SAMD9 (Fig 4 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mutations that have no effect on the host-range function did not disrupt the ability to precipitate SAMD9 [although some of these mutations (m1 and m11) appeared to have a reduced ability to precipitate SAMD9].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the ability of C7 family members to overcome host restriction correlates with their ability to precipitate SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The C7 family of poxvirus host-range factors is grouped together based on shared sequence homology, but the family members can be clearly divided into two subgroups based on their different functions in viral replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the C7 family members could function interchangeably with VACV-C7 in sustaining the replication of VACV in human cells, but other C7 family members, including MYXV-M63 and MYXV-M64, do not (8, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former subgroup of proteins is essential for productive poxvirus replication in many mammalian cells, but the latter group either is not essential for viral replication or is essential only in specific cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our structural and functional studies of C7 family members from the two different subgroups illustrate that all C7 family members are related by a common protein scaffold but perform distinct functions, possibly through sequence variations at a molecular claw that bind different proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As is consistent with the C7 family having no homologs outside the poxvirus family, the structures of VACV-C7 and MYXV-M64 are dissimilar to any existing structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although VACV-C7 and MYXV-M64 share only 23% sequence identity, their overall structures are almost identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because all the other C7 family members have more than 23% sequence identity to VACV-C7 or MYXV-M64, all C7 family members are predicted to adopt the same protein fold, and their structures based on homology modeling could be quite accurate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, these structures provide the first atomic view of this important family of viral host-range proteins and will be valuable in guiding functional studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the two subgroups of C7 proteins have no major differences in their overall structures, we found that they differ in their sequences at the three-fingered molecular claw and in their abilities to bind the host restriction factor SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When this article was submitted, MYXV-M62 was the only C7 family member found to bind SAMD9, and VACV-C7 was reported to be unable to bind SAMD9 (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, VACV-C7 and VACV-K1 also have been found to bind SAMD9 (15), thus explaining why these two structurally different proteins could complement each other functionally in viral replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we confirmed the binding between VACV-C7 and SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that YLDV-67, SWPV-64, and SPPV-63 also bind SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, MYXV-M64 and MYXV-M63 could not bind SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The natural hosts for MYXV, YLDV, SWPV, and SPPV are very different mammalian species, but the C7 homologs from all these viruses can bind human SAMD9 and overcome host restriction in human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding indicates that SAMD9 orthologs from different mammalian species are sufficiently similar so that the C7 homologs from these viruses antagonize SAMD9 not only from their natural hosts but also human SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAMD9 appears to have originated after the mammalian radiation, and all mammals with a completely sequenced genome encode SAMD9 and/or its paralog SAMD9L (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a C7-equivalent homolog is present in almost every poxvirus that infects mammals but not in poxviruses that infect birds or insects (8, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the C7 family of host-range factors may have been acquired by the poxviruses specifically to overcome the SAMD9-mediated host restriction in mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm the significance of SAMD9/SAMD9L in restricting poxvirus infection, it will be interesting to test whether VACV-K1LC7L, which is highly attenuated in mice, has increased virulence in SAMD9L-knockout mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Through this structure-guided mutagenesis study we have determined the molecular mechanism by which C7 targets SAMD9 and have shown that SAMD9 binding is essential for the host-range function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the main body of the  sandwich serves as a protein scaffold and that three spatially clustered loops with distinct features (basic, acidic, and hydrophobic) at one side of the  sandwich structure are the functional site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified nine residues (K24, D26/N27, D51, W52, E54, and F79/Y80/Y81) on these loops as being critical for viral replication in human cells and for binding with SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five of these residues (K24, D51, W52, E54, and F79) are conserved in all C7-equivalent homologs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D26 and N27 are not conserved, but they are located near the conserved K24 residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D26K/N27A mutation may disrupt C7 function indirectly by perturbing K24 orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Y82 is not conserved, and Y81 is not conserved in MYXV-M62 , which has a Lys instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triple mutations of F79, Y80, and Y81 may disrupt C7 function mainly by affecting the conserved F79.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on both the C7 mutagenesis result and sequence comparison between C7 family members, we conclude that five residues (K24, D51, W52, E54, and F79) probably are involved directly in binding SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these five residues are not conserved in MYXV-M63 and MYXV-M64, perhaps explaining their inability to bind SAMD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the basic loop, the equivalent position of K24 is H26 in MYXV-M63 and D27 in MYXV-M64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the single K24E mutation of C7 abolished viral replication and SAMD9 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the acidic loop, the equivalent position of E54 is a neutral residue, M57 in MYXV-M63 and N57 in MYXV-M64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single E54R mutation of C7 abolishes SAMD9 binding and consequently host-range function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D51 is present in MYXV-M64 (D54) but is replaced by S54 in MYXV-M63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single D51K mutation of C7 also abolishes SAMD9 binding and the host-range function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the nonpolar loop, the equivalent position of F79 is a polar residue, T85 in MYXV-M63 and H82 in MYXV-M64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To convert MYXV-M64 into a SAMD9-binding molecule, a triple mutation of D27K, N57E, and H82F would be required, and additional surface remodeling might be necessary to remove possible clashes with the SAMD9 surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although MYXV-M63 and MYXV-M64 do not target SAMD9, they play distinct roles in MYXV pathogenesis and host tropism (12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that they have acquired different functions by evolving their molecular claws to bind different host proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Protein_Purification_and_Crystallization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VACV C7L was cloned in a modified pET vector with an N-terminal 6xHis tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recombinant C7 and the SeMet-substituted protein were expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA as previously described (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, C7 protein was first purified from soluble cell lysate using an Ni-NTA affinity column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eluted protein subsequently was subjected to TEV protease cleavage and was collected as flow through of a second subtracting Ni-NTA column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purified protein was concentrated to 3 mg/mL, flash frozen, and stored at 80 °C until use (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C7 protein crystals were obtained at room temperature in a solution containing 0.1 M Tris (pH 8.5) and 3.5 M NaCl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycerol [25% (vol/vol)] was added to the mother liquid as cryoprotectant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MYXV-M64 was cloned, expressed, and purified the same way as C7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single M64 protein crystal was obtained after 5 mo at room temperature in a solution containing 28% (vol/vol) PEG2000, monomethyl ether, and 0.1 M Bis-Tris (pH 6.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glycerol [20% (vol/vol)] was added to the mother liquid as cryoprotectant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structure_Determination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A set of data was collected from a SeMet-substituted C7 protein crystal at the beamline 19-ID at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using program HKL3000 (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A nearly complete model was constructed from the experimental phases obtained from the SeMet crystal data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model was used to solve the native C7 structure by molecular replacement method using the Phaser program (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A set of data was collected on a single M64 crystal at beamline 19-ID at APS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the Phaser program (27) with the structure of C7 as the model template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure lacks the 53 C-terminal residues, presumably because these residues were disordered in the crystal packing or degraded during the extended crystallization period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both structures, the PHENIX program (28) was used for the refinement, and Coot (29) was used for the iterative manual model building.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Translation, libration, and screw-rotation displacement (TLS) groups used in the refinement were defined by the TLMSD server (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current models are of good geometry and refinement statistics (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrostatic surface potentials were determined by using PDB2PQR (31, 32) and APBS (33) plugin tools from PyMOL (34) and were visualized over a range of 4 kT/e to +4 kT/e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All molecular graphic figures were generated with PyMOL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cells_and_Viruses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VERO and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All recombinant viruses were propagated on VERO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Plasmid_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All plasmids for making C7L mutants were derived from the transfer plasmid described previously (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfer plasmid contains (i) 300 bp of the downstream flanking region of C7L; (ii) GFP under the control of VACV late promoter P11; (iii) C7 with a C-terminal V5 tag; and (iv) 300 bp of the upstream flanking region of C7L including the C7L promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific mutations of C7 were introduced into the plasmid through recombinant PCR as described previously (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Recombinant_Virus_Construction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Various C7 mutant viruses were constructed by homologous recombination of vK1LC7L with the specific transfer plasmid described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, the transfer plasmids containing the C7 mutation were transfected into VERO cells that were infected with vK1LC7L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant viruses encoding GFP and V5-tagged C7 were picked under the fluorescence microscope and purified by four rounds of plaque purification on VERO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  vK1LC7L/GFP+, vK1LC7L, vVACV-C7L (labeled as WT VACV here), vYLDV-67R, vMYXV-M62R, vMYXV-M63R, vMYXV-M64R, vSPPV-063, and vSWPV-064 were described previously (8, 9, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Growth_Curve_Analysis_of_C7_Mutants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
VERO or HeLa cells in 12-well plates were incubated with 0.05 pfu per cell of different C7 mutant viruses for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following adsorption, the cells were washed twice with PBS and were moved to an incubator at 37 °C to initiate viral entry and replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were harvest at 0, 12, and 48 h postinfection (hpi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The viral titers in the cell lysates were determined by plaque assays on VERO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunoprecipitation_and_Western_Blot_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Infected cells were harvested 8 hpi and were lysed on ice with a lysis buffer [0.1% (wt/vol) Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl] supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cleared cell lysates were mixed with 50 µL of 50% (vol/vol) V5-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After washing with lysis buffer, the beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and the eluted proteins were resolved by SDS/PAGE and detected with Western blot as described previously (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detection antibodies were mouse monoclonal antibodies against V5 (clone V5-10; Sigma-Aldrich) and VACV E3 (36) and rabbit anti-SAMD9 polyclonal antibody (HPA-21319; Sigma-Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
