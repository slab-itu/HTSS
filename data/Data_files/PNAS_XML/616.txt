Blockade to pathological remodeling of infarcted heart tissue using a porcupine antagonist  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A significant factor influencing longevity and quality of life in heart attack survivors is the extent of adverse tissue remodeling in injured heart tissue, which impedes mechanical function and accelerates the progression of heart failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the general consensus that mitigating fibrotic responses would delay the onset of heart failure and improve heart function after a heart attack, there currently are no agents that directly target this pathological process available for heart disease management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that chemical inhibition of the Wnt acyltransferase Porcupine results in improvements in heart function following myocardial infarction in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings advocate for the development of Porcupine inhibitors as proregenerative agents in the heart and other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The secreted Wnt signaling molecules are essential to the coordination of cell-fate decision making in multicellular organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In adult animals, the secreted Wnt proteins are critical for tissue regeneration and frequently contribute to cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small molecules that disable the Wnt acyltransferase Porcupine (Porcn) are candidate anticancer agents in clinical testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have systematically assessed the effects of the Porcn inhibitor (WNT-974) on the regeneration of several tissue types to identify potentially unwanted chemical effects that could limit the therapeutic utility of such agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An unanticipated observation from these studies is proregenerative responses in heart muscle induced by systemic chemical suppression of Wnt signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using in vitro cultures of several cell types found in the heart, we delineate the Wnt signaling apparatus supporting an antiregenerative transcriptional program that includes a subunit of the nonfibrillar collagen VI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to observations seen in animals exposed to WNT-974, deletion of the collagen VI subunit, COL6A1, has been shown to decrease aberrant remodeling and fibrosis in infarcted heart tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that WNT-974 can improve the recovery of heart function after left anterior descending coronary artery ligation by mitigating adverse remodeling of infarcted tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injured heart tissue exposed to WNT-974 exhibits decreased scarring and reduced Col6 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings support the development of Porcn inhibitors as antifibrotic agents that could be exploited to promote heart repair following injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

An_in_Vivo_Screen_to_Identify_Tissues_Sensitive_to_Porcn_Inhibitors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In an effort to anticipate dose-limiting toxicities associated with the use of Porcn inhibitors in clinical settings, we evaluated the sensitivity of various murine adult tissues to WNT-974 exposure at a dosage that previously has been associated with anticancer activity but little toxicity (10, 11) (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the central role of Wnt signaling in gut epithelium renewal (12), we first confirmed the absence of weight change in animals treated using this drug-delivery protocol (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, consistent with the importance of Wnt signaling in the gut epithelium, we noted a loss in the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive (PCNA+) cells in the jejunum crypt cells, which is indicative of decreased mitotic activity (Fig 1C and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that in the presence of cyclic exposure to Porcn inhibitors, gut epithelial stem and progenitor cells are nevertheless able to sustain tissue renewal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We examined the effects of systemic WNT-974 exposure on two other tissues that are reliant upon Wnt signaling for regeneration: hair follicles and cartilage (13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both tissue types, suppression of Wnt signaling, following either depilation or the introduction of puncture wounds in the ear, resulted in delayed hair and cartilage regrowth (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the well-established role of Wnt/-catenin signaling in promoting bone formation (15), we then determined the effects of Porcn inhibition on bone density as measured in the tibia midshaft (Fig 1F and Fig S2) and metaphasis (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A notable loss of bone mass was observed, suggesting bone health should be monitored in cases where Porcn inhibitors may be used long-term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a chemical agent targeting Porcn exhibits anticipated on-target effects in several tissues that likely stem from loss of Wnt signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unexpectedly, heart tissue exposed to WNT-974 displayed an increase in the mitotic activity of cardiomyocytes (CMs), suggesting that health of the myocardium may be improved from suppression of Wnt ligand expression (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together with conclusions drawn from other in vivo studies using Porcn inhibitors (11, 16, 17), our observations reveal potential dose-limiting on-target activities of Porcn inhibitors in adult mammals, but also reveal possible proregenerative cellular activity in heart tissue with decreased Wnt protein production (Fig 1H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

WNT-974_Alters_the_Expression_of_Profibrotic_Genes_in_the_Heart  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The recalcitrance of adult CMs to reentering the cell cycle poses a significant challenge to the development of agents that directly promote wound healing in heart tissue (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exploited the responsiveness of homeostatic heart tissue to WNT-974 exposure to identify Wnt-regulated cellular processes that may suppress CM cell cycle reentry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues exposed to WNT-974 exhibit a significant change in expression of genes that contribute to remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), including several that are associated with Wnt/-catenin signaling (14, 1921) (Fig 2A and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the secreted Wnt/-catenin signaling antagonist Dkk3 suppresses maladaptive remodeling of infarcted tissue in mice and protects against cardiac dysfunction after injury (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decreased expression of the Col6 subunit (Col6a3) is also notable, given that Col6 has been shown to suppress heart regeneration in injured murine heart tissue (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals null for COL6A1 show a marked improvement in heart function and decreased scarring following left anterior descending (LAD) ligation, as in the case of WNT-974treated animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to other collagen proteins, a Col6 monomer comprises three subunits (Col6a1, -a2, -a3) that are assembled in stoichiometric fashion in the secretory pathway (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recessive mutations associated with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy found in a single subunit of Col6 are sufficient to eliminate the production of Col6 microfibrils, thus revealing the importance of coordinated subunit expression (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, among the collagen gene family members including those abundantly expressed in heart tissue, such as Col1 and Col3, the expression of Col6a3 was the most impacted by the presence of WNT-974 (Fig 2B) (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wnt_Signaling_in_the_Heart  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CMs, cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), and endothelial cells (ECs) constitute the three major resident cell types found in the murine heart, with ECs and CFs comprising 80% of the non-CM resident cells (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We characterized the Wnt expression profile in these cells using either cultured primary ECs and CFs, or CMs generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMs engineered using this protocol have been shown to faithfully model drug responses in heart tissues, exhibit electrophysiological characteristics of true CMs, and can be stably engrafted in living heart tissue (2831).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of only three Wnt genes was detectable using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) strategy in these cells: Wnt5a/b in CFs and CMs, and Wnt3 in CFs (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis of Wnt5a/b and Wnt3 protein in the medium of cultured cells confirmed that Wnt proteins were indeed produced and secreted in CFs and CMs, suggesting they are lipidated and functional (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of phosphorylated Dishevelled 2 (Dvl2) protein, an activity reporter of the Frizzled family of Wnt receptors (32), mirror those of the abundance of secreted Wnt protein produced by each cell type (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that WNT-974 decreased the levels of Wnt protein in the culture medium without inducing an accumulation of presumably unlipidated Wnt protein in the secretory pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with an absence of enriched expression changes in genes associated with unfolded protein response (Table S1), we conclude that WNT-974 does not induce ER stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our in vitro studies reveal cell-autonomous and potential noncell-autonomous signaling events that would be disabled by WNT-974 exposure in intact heart tissue (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations also suggest that among the three major resident cell types in the heart, CFs likely exhibit the most pronounced response to Porcn inhibitors in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As in other tissue types, fibroblasts found in the heart dictate the composition of the ECM (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that CFs elaborate the entire repertoire of Wnt molecules expressed among the three major resident heart cell types (Fig 2C), we determined if suppression of Wnt production by treatment with WNT-974 is sufficient to inhibit the expression of the Col6 subunits Col6a1 or Col6a3 (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the use of an excessively high concentration of WNT-974, we observed loss in the expression of the matricellular gene connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a Wnt/-catenin target gene (34), and a subunit of collagen 1 (Col1), but little change in the expression of Col6a1/a3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the non-CF cell type that exhibits WNT-974sensitive Col6 expression, we first determined if suppression of cell-autonomous Wnt5a/b signaling in CMs using WNT-974 affected Col6 expression (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we saw no change in Col6 expression when WNT-974 was added alone, introduction of Wnt3 expressing DNA into CMs induced Col6 in a WNT-974dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our detection of changes in Col6a1 and Col6a3 transcript abundance in CMs treated with recombinant Wnt3a reveals a transcriptional activation-dependent mechanism of Col6 expression controlled by Wnt signaling (Fig 2H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, ECs failed to respond to Wnt3a protein, suggesting that CMs are the primary effector cells of WNT-974 action at least with respect to Col6 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When taken together, our observations suggest that Porcn inhibitors inhibit Wnt3 protein production from CFs, thus reducing the production of Col6 expression in CMs (Fig 2I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chemical_Inhibition_of_Porcn_Improves_Heart_Function_Recovery_Following_Myocardial_Infarction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The effects of WNT-974 in decreasing the expression of profibrotic genes, such as Col6, suggests that targeting Porcn may be a useful approach for promoting wound healing in infarcted heart tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the effects of WNT-974 on recovery in infarcted heart tissue provoked by permanent ligation of the LAD coronary artery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two blinded studies, animals were equally segregated into cohorts for vehicle or WNT-974 treatment based on echocardiography (Fig S4) or MRI (Fig 3A, Fig S5, and Table S2) following LAD ligation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although area at risk was not measured, the extent of left ventricular dysfunction as measured by ejection fraction was similar in both groups before treatment, consistent with equivalent injury (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dosing of animals was initiated 1 wk following LAD occlusion, then continued for 10 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals treated with WNT-974 for 10 wk exhibited improved heart function compared with those treated with vehicle alone, as measured by ejection fraction (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No change was observed in the heart rate of mice treated with WNT-974 compared with vehicle (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also noted that WNT-974 reduced injury-induced heart weight gain (Fig 3D) and ventricular dilation (Fig 3 E and F), which is consistent with improvements in heart function observed in the WNT-974treated animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Porcn_Inhibition_Reduces_Scarring_in_Heart_Tissue  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histological examination of heart tissue revealed reduced scarring in animals with Wnt suppression (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a reduced number of CMs expressing Col6 in the infarcted area of mice treated with WNT-974 (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Col6 is not readily detected in uninjured heart tissue confirming that Col6 is induced following injury, as previously described (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these observations suggest Porcn inhibitors promote functional recovery of heart tissue primarily by mitigating scarring that may in part be attributable to loss in expression of the anti-regenerative molecule Col6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Wound repair in heart tissue is often described as a three-phase process composed of periods of inflammation, proliferation, and healing (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contribution of Wnt signaling in each of these phases is the subject of ongoing studies (36) and an understanding of these relationships has direct bearing on the optimal recovery response that can be ultimately achieved with Porcn inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excessive deposition of collagen proteins in particular is problematic, given their slow turnover rate, which limits efforts to remove scar tissue once it is established (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the Porcn inhibitor WNT-974 prevents collagen production in CMs by blocking secretion of Wnt3, a profibrotic agonist, from CFs and its signaling to CMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Another study using a precursor compound of WNT-974 (GNF-6231) given at a comparable drug concentration recently reported similar proregenerative effects in heart tissue, including improvements in heart function following Porcn inhibition and reduced scarring (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immediate delivery of a Porcn inhibitor following LAD ligation in that study suggests that suppression of Wnt responses during the inflammatory phase does not contribute to the improvements in heart recovery seen in WNT-974treated animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the success of our approach (a 1-wk delay in drug delivery following injury) reveals at a minimum a 1-wk window in which initiation of Porcn inhibitor delivery following myocardial infarction (MI) might be beneficial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we acknowledge that changes in the expression of Col6 may be only one proregenerative consequence of Porcn inhibition and that other molecular changes (38, 39) may also be factors that influence heart function outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Porcn inhibitors are likely to also target tissue-specific mechanisms supporting fibrosis or that suppress the activity of resident stem/progenitor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, epicardial cells responding to Wnt signals after injury have been shown to undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and adopt fibroblastic features in the subepicardium of injured neonatal heart tissue (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppression of Porcn activity may blunt this phenomenon, in addition to influencing the activity of resident fibroblasts in the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study using GNF-6231 also revealed potential increased doubling in the cardiac progenitor population following injury (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, activation of stem/progenitor cells by direct/indirect action of Porcn inhibitors may also contribute to improvements in regeneration in some tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, although not addressed in this study, changes in the ECM composition because of Porcn inhibition may influence other heart repair processes, such as angiogenesis and inflammation (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the importance of Wnt signaling in cancer and the intense interest in Porcn inhibitors as anticancer agents, the contribution of Wnt proteins in cell-fate decision making and in transcriptional regulation in fibroblasts suggests that such agents could be useful in other therapeutic arenas, including regenerative medicine (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vivo chemical screen using WNT-974 has identified a tissue that is not detrimentally affected by suppression of Wnt signaling and that may benefit from diminished fibrotic responses induced by Porcn inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, other classes of small molecules with inhibitory activity for Wnt signaling have similarly shown beneficial responses in heart tissue; albeit, these molecules have not progressed further in clinical development for managing heart disease (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also reason that other tissues, like the heart (Fig 5), not yet fully investigated with Porcn inhibitors may also see similar benefits upon inhibition of Wnt ligand production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, these agents have been also shown to blunt kidney fibrosis induced by a murine model of obstructive nephropathy (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Age-dependent increases in circulating Wnt molecules promote fibrotic responses at the cost of meaningful muscle restoration after injury (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Life expectancy following heart attacks drops precipitously with increasing age after the age of 60 (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an important next step is to demonstrate that proregenerative responses to Porcn inhibitors are preserved in aged animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of such agents for tissue repair after injury will likely require transient chemical exposure, thus bypassing many of the on-target effects that may complicate the long-term delivery of these molecules in cancer management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Total RNAs were extracted from hearts or cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) or RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers instructions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNA was synthesized using RT2 HT first-strand kit (Qiagen) with 2 g of RNA as a template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qPCR was performed using Lightcycler 480 (Roche).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative fold-change was calculated using the Ct method after normalizing to Gapdh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microarray analysis was performed by the University of Texas Southwestern Microarray Core facility using the MouseWG-6 V2.0 BeadChips (Illumina) using RNA extracted from heart samples and subsequently pooled before analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MI_and_Drug_Treatment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C57BL/6, 12-wk-old male mice, underwent permanent ligation of the LAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult mice were anesthetized with isoflurane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thoracotomy was performed at the third intercostal space, and self-retaining microretractors were placed to separate the third and fourth rib to visualize the LAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LAD was surgically ligated without tearing the pericardial sac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After LAD ligation, the retractors were removed and the chest was closed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt-974 was administered by oral gavage at 5 mg/kg per mouse once per day for 10 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cardiac_MRI  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cardiac function of mice was evaluated by cardiac MRI using a 7T small-animal MR scanner [Agilent (Varian)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under anesthesia by inhalation of 1.53% (vol/vol) isoflurane, the animals were placed prone on a mouse sled (Dazai Research Instruments) equipped with a pneumatic respiratory sensor and ECG electrodes for cardiac sensing, head first, with the heart centered with respect to the center of the RF coil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chest area was shaved and a conducting gel was applied to optimize ECG contact between electrodes and mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All MRI acquisitions were gated using both cardiac and respiratory triggering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bore temperature was kept at 33 ± 2 °C to assure adequate and constant heart rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Axial images perpendicular to the long axis of the heart were chosen for Cine-imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each scan consisted of five to nine contiguous slices from apex to left ventricle (LV) outflow with 1-mm thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epicardial and endocardial borders were manually traced for calculation of left ventricular end systolic and end diastolic volumes (LVESV and LVEDV) using NIH ImageJ (v1.47j) software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total LV volumes were calculated as the sum of all slice volumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated by the equation, (LVEDV  LVESV)/LVEDV × 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigators performing MRI analysis were blinded to the assignment of mice in each group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
