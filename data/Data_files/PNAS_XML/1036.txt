Genome diversity of tuber-bearing Solanum uncovers complex evolutionary history and targets of domestication in the cultivated potato  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Worldwide, potato is the third most important crop grown for direct human consumption, but breeders have struggled to produce new varieties that outperform those released over a century ago, as evidenced by the most widely grown North American cultivar (Russet Burbank) released in 1876.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its importance, potato genetic diversity at the whole-genome level remains largely unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of cultivated potato and its wild relatives using modern genomics approaches can provide insight into the genomic diversity of extant germplasm, reveal historic introgressions and hybridization events, and identify genes targeted during domestication that control variance for agricultural traits, all critical information to address food security in 21st century agriculture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cultivated potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), domesticated from wild Solanum species native to the Andes of southern Peru, possess a diverse gene pool representing more than 100 tuber-bearing relatives (Solanum section Petota).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A diversity panel of wild species, landraces, and cultivars was sequenced to assess genetic variation within tuber-bearing Solanum and the impact of domestication on genome diversity and identify key loci selected for cultivation in North and South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence diversity of diploid and tetraploid S. tuberosum exceeded any crop resequencing study to date, in part due to expanded wild introgressions following polyploidy that captured alleles outside of their geographic origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 2,622 genes as under selection, with only 1416% shared by North American and Andean cultivars, showing that a limited gene set drove early improvement of cultivated potato, while adaptation of upland (S. tuberosum group Andigena) and lowland (S. tuberosum groups Chilotanum and Tuberosum) populations targeted distinct loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signatures of selection were uncovered in genes controlling carbohydrate metabolism, glycoalkaloid biosynthesis, the shikimate pathway, the cell cycle, and circadian rhythm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced sexual fertility that accompanied the shift to asexual reproduction in cultivars was reflected by signatures of selection in genes regulating pollen development/gametogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploration of haplotype diversity at potatos maturity locus (StCDF1) revealed introgression of truncated alleles from wild species, particularly S. microdontum in long-dayadapted cultivars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study uncovers a historic role of wild Solanum species in the diversification of long-dayadapted tetraploid potatoes, showing that extant natural populations represent an essential source of untapped adaptive potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Genome_Variation_and_Conservation_in_Solanum_Section_Petota  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A panel of 67 genotypes was used to capture a broad extent of genome variation in cultivated potato and its progenitors, including 20 wild diploid species, 20 South American landraces (groups Andigena, Phureja, Stenotomum, and Chilotanum) representing locally adapted primitive selections, 23 North American cultivars (group Tuberosum) from modern (post-1850) breeding programs, and four outgroups (Fig 1, Fig S2, and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wild accessions represented South American species sexually compatible with S. tuberosum, excluding taxa of hybrid origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Landraces included 10 diploids (primitive groups Phureja and Stenotomum) and 10 autotetraploids (eight in group Andigena and two in group Chilotanum) with habitats ranging from equatorial Colombia to southern Chile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultivars represented North American varieties (group Tuberosum) derived from Chilean landraces (group Chilotanum) and released over the last 150 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some taxonomic treatments collapse Andean S. tuberosum groups Andigena (4x), Phureja (2x), and Stenotomum (2x) (24, 25), we invoke the penultimate nomenclature (26) that distinguishes ploidy, referring to these as Andean landraces (groups Andigena, Phureja, and Stenotomum) for comparison with cultivars (group Tuberosum) and their Chilean landrace progenitors (group Chilotanum).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequence and structural variants in the form of SNPs and copy number variation (CNV) were identified by aligning sequences to the S. tuberosum group Phureja DM v4.04 reference genome (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome conservation was ascertained from CNV, using a maximum 10% deletion threshold in the respective wild, landrace, and cultivar groups to identify 390 Mb of the cultivated genome (53.5%) containing 63% of genes as conserved among sexually compatible potato species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High rates of CNV within individuals and across the panel (Fig 2A and Dataset S2) expanded previous reports of a structurally heterogeneous genome landscape containing many dispensable loci (Fig 2B and Fig S3) (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene-level CNV frequency ranged from 10.939.8% (Fig 2 A and B), averaging 12.8% in diploid landraces and 26.7% in wild species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within S. tuberosum (all cultivated) genotypes 41.7% of genes were affected by deletion (21.9% homozygous), compared with 53.6% in all nonoutgroup genotypes (35.1% homozygous), indicating a core genome containing 4665% of genes in the current annotation for cultivars and their wild progenitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence variants included 68.9 million SNPs, of which 44 million were located within the conserved genome (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nucleotide divergence from the reference genome sequence averaged 1.8% in diploid landraces, 2.2% in tetraploid landraces, 2.4% in cultivars, 3.4% among wild (nonoutgroup) species, and 4.2% in reproductively isolated Mexican relatives, reaching 4.5% in the nontuberizing outgroup Solanum etuberosum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cultivated_Potato_Genome_Diversity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pedigrees show North American potato varieties are derived from a restricted base of 19th century Chilean and European founders that survived the 1840s Irish potato famine caused by Phytophthora infestans (2830).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify potatos genetic bottleneck, we estimated the population diversity () of wild species, landraces, and cultivars using SNPs from the conserved genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultivated potato harbored striking levels of diversity: C = 0.0105 (cultivars), L = 0.0097 (landraces), and C+L = 0.0111 (all S. tuberosum), exceeding estimates from previous crop-resequencing studies (Fig 2C) (3135) and overturning historic assumptions of low founder diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite having lower heterozygosity than their tetraploid counterparts (Fig 2D), diploid potato landraces (l-2x = 0.0087) exhibited greater diversity than maize landraces (33), upholding theories that abundant genome diversity predated polyploidization (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similar genome diversities of the combined S. tuberosum lineages and wild Solanum [W/C+L = 1.101 (1.188 coding sequence, CDS)] is remarkable, given that the former represent geographic subgroups of a single cultivated species compared with the 20 distinct species representing wild diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potato autotetraploids, containing four homologous chromosomes that undergo tetravalent pairing (36), more than doubled the heterozygosity of diploid landraces (Fig 2D) with mean heterozygous nucleotide frequency increasing from 1.05% in diploids to 2.73% in tetraploid cultivars (maximum 3.04%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive allele sharing was confirmed in CDS of wild species, landraces, and North American cultivars, with 73% of wild alleles from 20 species extant in cultivated varieties (53% including rare alleles) (Fig S4A), suggesting that hybridization with wild populations could have contributed to the heterozygosity and diversification of the cultivated lineage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Population_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phylogenetic analysis of 687,172 fourfold-degenerate sites in conserved genes and analysis of population structure (Fig 1B and Fig S5) subdivided the panel into three primary populations: wild species, Andean landraces (groups Phureja, Stenotomum, and Andigena), and long-daymaturing genotypes including group Chilotanum landraces and cultivar descendants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three Peruvian species (S. medians, S. megistacrolobum, and S. raphanifolium) demonstrated substructure within the wild group, being the wild species closest to the cultivated lineage, while outgroup accessions formed a basal wild subgroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crop-species admixture was asymmetric, with few examples of cultivated alleles in wild species and frequent evidence of wild introgression into tetraploid landraces and cultivars (Fig 1B and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phylogeny resolved tetraploid group Andigena, Chilotanum, and Tuberosum as more basal to the cultivated lineage than diploids (Fig 1B and Fig S5), a surprising result given that potatoes were domesticated as diploids, and extant diploids are more primitive (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic distances between cultivated tetraploids and wild species were indeed lower than their diploid progenitors (Fig S4B) due to unequal wild introgression; nine landrace diploids had no evidence of admixture, and the tenth (PI195204) was a misidentified wild-crop hybrid, while 9 of 10 landrace tetraploids and numerous cultivars harbored wild introgression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High rates of wild allele sharing and heterozygosity in tetraploids, combined with evidence of greater admixture, suggest that autopolyploidy in the cultivated potato lineage altered the dynamics of wild species interactions, resulting in the diversification of the cultivated gene pool by the influx of novel wild alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wild_Solanum_Introgression_in_the_Cultivated_Lineage  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
High rates of unreduced (2n) gametes in diploid potatoes reduce barriers to interploidy gene flow, helping explain the frequency of wild alleles within autotetraploid S. tuberosum (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated sequence introgression in landraces and cultivars to explore genetic contributions from wild Solanum populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic regions derived from wild species were identified by comparing local genetic distances (5-kb windows) against both species and the cultivated ancestral genotype derived from a consensus of nonadmixed diploid landraces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This revealed large increases of wild introgression in tetraploid Andigena landraces from diploids and higher rates from distinct species in group Tuberosum (Fig 3A); average fractions of genomic windows predicted to contain wild alleles were 2.0% in diploid landraces, 20.2% in tetraploid group Andigena, and 31.2% in group Tuberosum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All cultivated groups harbored a significant contribution from the domestication progenitor Solanum candolleanum (Fig 3 and Fig S6A) (1), showing crop-species hybridization persisted between cultivated potatoes and local progenitors after domestication and polyploidy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diploid landrace introgression was mainly limited to S. candolleanum, Solanum medians, and Solanum raphanifolium, species native to Peru.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tetraploid introgressions broadened to include species native to Bolivia (Solanum brevicaule, Solanum leptophyes, and Solanum microdontum) and Argentina (Solanum berthaultii, Solanum chacoense, Solanum gourlayi, Solanum kurtzianum, S. microdontum, Solanum spegazzinii, and Solanum vernei) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for the Andean progenitor S. candolleanum, introgression was consistently stronger in group Tuberosum than in group Andigenum (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, no species interaction was unique to Andean landraces, while Chilean-derived group Tuberosum housed all Andean interactions and novel introgressions from S. gourlayi, S. kurtzianum, S. microdontum, and S. spegazzinii, species found only south of the Andean domestication origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S. microdontum, unrepresented in cultivar pedigrees (29), showed large historic contributions to group Tuberosum: 10 chromosomes (18, 11, 12) contained introgressions in a majority of cultivars with residual sequences in heterochromatin around centromeres on chromosomes 7, 11, and 12 (Fig 3B and Dataset S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eliminating the confounding factor of wild hybridization, we reconstructed a nuclear phylogeny excluding variants in regions of introgression (Fig S6B), unambiguously resolving group Tuberosum and group Chilotanum as derived from group Andigena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These relationships, with evidence of Chilean-derived cultivar introgressions from the same Peruvian and Bolivian species as Andean landraces, advance theories of a single Peruvian domestication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A likely scenario based on Bolivian and Argentinian species alleles in Chilean-derived Tuberosum is that Andigena tetraploids interbred with wild species en route to their eventual destination in southern Chile where long-day adaptation was required for tuberization (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of gene functions in wild-introgressed regions supports an adaptive role of crop-species hybridization in tetraploids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1,415 genes within introgressions conserved in 70% of tetraploids, showing preferential retention of wild alleles, were highly enriched (fivefold expression increase; P less_than 0.0001) among potato genes induced by abiotic stress, with 21.3% of wild-donated genes but only 1.5% of nonassociated genes being stress-responsive (Dataset S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes associated with wild species introgressions were also more likely to be highly expressed [fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) 10] than genes from nonintrogressed regions (P less_than 0.0001), supporting an impact on cultivated phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 407 genes within regions retaining 80% wild sequence contained many loci functioning in disease resistance, heat and drought tolerance, and antioxidant pathways (Dataset S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data offer one possible model by which wild Solanum species assisted the spread of cultivated potatoes by transmitting alleles for tolerance of new ecological factors, enabling colonization of nonnative habitats as they migrated south following domestication and polyploidy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Potato_Day-Length_Adaptation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A key event in the history of the cultivated potato lineage was adaptation of long-daymaturing tetraploids able to tuberize under 16-h days in southern Chile, and later in Europe and North America, enabling global cultivation at nonequatorial latitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kloosterman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (38) demonstrated that naturally occurring alleles of StCDF1 (positive regulator of tuberization via CONSTANS) harbor transposable element (TE)-induced structural variants resulting in truncated StCDF1 proteins with dominant-allele effects leading to circadian deregulation and, as a consequence, the long-daymaturity phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We resolved StCDF1 haplotypes for 58 samples in the panel along with cultivated tomato (cv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heinz 1706) to predict alleles conferring long-day tuberization in cultivars, identifying 55 haplotypes encoding 27 peptide variants (Dataset S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four haplotype groups contained conserved deletions affecting the structure of the StCDF1 peptide encoded by the short-day reference haplotype (H1) (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S7 and S8A); some encode StCDF1 proteins lacking a C-terminal domain, potentially resulting in higher protein stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analysis of StCDF1 haplotypes revealed that nearly all long-day clones (23/25) contained alleles encoding shortened StCDF1 proteins (H35, H45) derived from either S. microdontum or a second wild species (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single Andigena genotype (PI214421) contained a putative long-day allele, while PI258885 was confirmed phylogenetically as Chilotanum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two Tuberosum cultivars (Missaukee and Yukon Gold) lacked putative long-day alleles based on CDS variation; however, the DM v4.04 annotation contains an alternate StCDF1 transcript isoform (PGSC0003DMT400047371) whose exon boundary (chr5:4,539,678) is flanked by a GT SNP (left) and a single base-pair deletion (right) impacting adjacent splice motifs in both clone haplotypes (Fig S8B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two of three StCDF1 proteins identified by Kloosterman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  were identified in our panel: StCDF1.1 (short-day allele) was identical to PH1, the predominant short-day protein encoded in the DM reference and most Andigena landraces, while StCDF1.2 (long-day allele) was structurally identical to PH15, PH16, and PH20 and shared 99.75% amino acid identity with PH20 (Dataset S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  StCDF1.3 was not identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chilotanum and Tuberosums possession of wild alleles impacting the protein-coding structure of StCDF1, potatos maturity locus and the key quantitative trait locus (QTL) for yield in the northern hemisphere, shows that wild Solanum introgression (particularly from S. microdontum) not only shaped tetraploid potato diversification but may have introduced the adaptive variants enabling S. tuberosum cultivation in Europe and North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterizing a broader set of StCDF1 alleles is required as reports of this locus as a major yield QTL in Tuberosum populations lacking the TE-induced variant (StCDF1.2) support a functional impact of the wild alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discovery of alleles impacting StCDF1 protein structure beyond those previously reported shows that disruption of the predominant equatorial short-day haplotype has occurred repeatedly by TE-induced (StCDF1.2) and nonTE-induced mutations and was introduced into Andean populations from multiple sources following domestication, which may have enabled tuberization outside their earliest geographic range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Genes_Under_Selection_in_Cultivated_Potato  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Allele frequencies were used to scan the potato genome for gene-selection signatures based on population metrics comparing North American cultivars against wild species (cultivar selected) and South American Andean landraces against wild species (landrace selected).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selected genes were ranked under three stringency cutoffs: putative, confident, and core, based on scoring in the top 5% (putative), 2% (confident), or 1% (core) values for FST estimates in adjacent genomic windows (20 kb) and at least one per-locus selection metric (Tajimas D, relative nucleotide diversity, maximum single-variant allele frequency difference) within the gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach identified 2,622 (6.7%) putatively selected genes in cultivated potato, 841 (2.1%) confidently selected genes, and 315 genes (0.8%) under core selection (Fig 4, Fig S9, and Dataset S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Domestication candidates were regarded as genes under selection in both landraces and cultivars, impacting performance regardless of hemisphere or local adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These accounted for only 14.416.3% of selected loci across all confidence thresholds, evidence that highland Andigena and lowland Tuberosum populations achieved agricultural performance by distinct selection strategies, relying more on regional adaptation than on conserved developmental processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signatures of selection between groups Tuberosum and Andigena (Dataset S7) were comparatively weak, lacking strong evidence of loci approaching fixation of distinct alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A range of molecular functions, including regulation of gene expression, was enriched in genes under selection (Dataset S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tomato domestication involved modification of transcriptional networks (39), and transcription factors were enriched in potato genes with signatures of selection (152 genes, 2 test, P  0.005).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potato domestication gave rise to enlarged tubers with a concomitant increase in leaf carbon fixation and transport, tuber-specific reduction of harmful glycoalkaloids, adaptation to a long-day photoperiod, and reduced sexual fertility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signatures of selection associated with key structural and regulatory genes involved in the cell cycle, circadian rhythm, carbohydrate metabolism, endoreduplication, glycoalkaloid biosynthesis, shikimate biosynthesis, and pollen development provide insights into the biological processes and molecular mechanisms by which ancient farmers and modern breeders reshaped pathways critical to agronomic traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The potato genome remains relatively unexplored, given the crops major role in supporting global food security.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a Solanum section Petota diversity panel, we show that extant germplasm possess heterogeneous genomes littered with CNV, expanding on previous studies of cultivated genotypes (27, 97).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potato contains the highest genomic diversity of any sequenced crop species to date, partly due to autopolyploidy and wild species introgression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the remarkably similar genetic variation within cultivars and wild species (W/C = 1.157), the average genetic distance among cultivars (0.026) was 3.27-fold lower than among wild accessions (0.085), confirming that significant allelic diversity existed in 19th century founders, but their small number ensured a group of individually heterozygous but closely related descendants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with hypotheses that breeding populations are without significant structure due to the cost of genetic load on inbreeding and continuous reshuffling of alleles from the same heterozygous sites to increase gene interaction while masking deleterious mutations (98).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this creates challenges for exploiting heterosis, our discovery that over 80% of the selected genes in S. tuberosum cultivars (Tuberosum) or Andean landraces (Andigena) are population-specific shows there may be beneficial alleles in South American landraces representing untapped heterotic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently developed self-compatible S. tuberosum diploids (99) have given breeders an effective sieve to separate alleles of wider agricultural value across latitude or upland/lowland habitats from what is likely a more extensive pool of genes selected for regional adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Meyer and Purugganan (100) predict 15 changes in traits accompanying the various stages in domestication of root and tuber crops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include increased yield, modified resource allocation, reduced toxicity, stress tolerance, and reduced sexual fertilityall of which possess signatures of selection in potato.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also anticipate an increase in heterozygosity as a means to leverage heterosis, and we observed an increase in heterozygosity during the progression from wild species to landraces to elite cultivars, likely made possible by the circumstances of potato domestication: substantial nucleotide diversity within the gene pool, 2n gametes allowing for diploid introgressions, additional alleles per locus due to polyploidy, and retention of alleles due to asexual reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
With access to cataloged sequence diversity and annotation of loci controlling key agronomic traits, breeders now have a molecular framework and genome toolbox to develop cultivars outperforming century-old dominant varieties, with adaptation to a wide range of climates and conditions needed to meet global food demands in the 21st century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the uncovered contribution of wild Solanum species to cultivated diversity and the recent development of self-compatible diploid cultivars (99), primitive South American populations now offer a rich source of alleles for varietal improvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sample_Preparation_and_Sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Samples were obtained from the US Department of Agriculture potato gene bank and included South American wild species and landrace accessions germinated from seed and North American cultivars as in vitro clones (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single individuals were selected from accessions to represent populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was purified from leaves using the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Tissue Kit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Illumina-compatible paired-end sequencing libraries (500-nt fragment size) were prepared and sequenced in paired-end mode (125 nt) to 8× genome coverage (diploids) and 16× coverage (tetraploids) on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 system at the Michigan State University Research Technology Support Facility Genomics Core; one library (Superior) was sequenced in paired-end mode to 150 nt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of libraries was sequenced in paired-end mode (100 nt) on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Read_Alignment_and_Variant_Calling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sequence reads were processed with Trimmomatic (v0.32) (MINLEN = 50, LEADING = 20, TRAILING = 20, SLIDINGWINDOW = 5,20) (101) to remove low-quality bases, adapters, and primers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clean reads were aligned to the S. tuberosum group Phureja DM reference genome (v4.04) (27) using BWA-mem (v0.7.11) (102).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alignments were processed with Picard tools (v2.1.1) (broadinstitute.github.io/picard) to mark duplicates, and indel realignment was performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (v3.3.0) (103).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Processed alignments were used for variant genotyping in FreeBayes (v0.9.21.19), requiring minimum 4× coverage in diploids and 8× coverage in tetraploids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alignments with a MapQ score less_than20 or base Phred qualities less_than20 were excluded, and only properly oriented read pairs mapping to the same chromosome were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants were filtered to remove low-quality sites (QUAL less_than20), mean mapping quality of reference (MQMR) or alternate (MQM) alleles less_than20, and sites where mean reference allele quality differed from alternate allele quality by 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variant sites with 80% strand bias for any allele were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variant calling ignored regions in the reference genome within 150 bp of gaps to avoid false positives in poorly resolved sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Singleton allele variants were removed from downstream analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample genotypes were filtered for genotype quality (GQ 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide CNV was calculated by comparison of median read coverage in 5-kb windows and within genes to genome-wide median coverage, with copy number (CN) reported as copies per monoploid genome [CN = (region median/genome median)/ploidy].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were classified as homozygous deletion/absent (CN less_than 0.1), partial/heterozygous deletion (0.1  CN less_than 0.6), conserved (0.6  CN  2.0), or duplicated (CN  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Population_Analysis_and_Phylogenetics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Population structure was calculated using FastStructure (v1.0) (104), testing replicates of five at K = 210 with a set of 50,000 biallelic SNPs randomly sampled at equal counts from genome-wide 5-kb windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal number of model components reflecting structure was selected by the internal fastStructure script chooseK.py.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analysis and estimates of genetic distance (Nei) were performed using PHYLIP (evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A coding-sequence SNP phylogeny was generated using 687,172 fourfold degenerate sites from conserved genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neighbor-joining trees were constructed using a consensus derived from 1,000 bootstrap datasets, with branch lengths from the original dataset fitted over the topology of the consensus tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Wild_Introgressions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The ancestral potato consensus genotype was reconstructed from diploid landrace accessions (excluding the PI195204 hybrid) by selecting the most common allele composition across variant sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic-distance matrices were calculated within 5-kb windows and were used to identify windows in which genetic distances between cultivated genotypes and wild species were smaller than between cultivated genotypes and the ancestral cultivated diploid ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consecutive windows at least 20 kb in length and of the shortest distance to a single wild species were collapsed into putative introgressions from the corresponding species, and those of shortest distance to multiple species were assigned as ambiguous wild introgressions accounting for the heterozygosity of various wild/cultivated haplotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Selection_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Population statistics used as indicators of selection included FST, Tajimas D, and nucleotide diversity relative to the founder population (wild/cultivated).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FST was calculated using Hudsons estimator (105) for biallelic sites with minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tajimas D and population nucleotide diversity were calculated in BioPerl.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FST was calculated in 20-kb windows (5-kb steps) using a combining approach described by Bhatia et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (106).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes were categorized under three levels of selection: putative, confident, and core selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes under putative selection were identified as those intersecting genomic windows ranked within the top 5% FST values and ranking in the top 5% per-gene estimates of maximum single variant allele frequency difference, Tajimas D, or reduced nucleotide diversity ( wild/ cultivated).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes within the top 5% of all three single-gene metric values were considered selected regardless of FST window overlap to allow for erosion of linkage disequilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes under confident and core selection were identified using the same criteria with 2% and 1% cutoffs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A universal StCDF1 (PGSC0003DMG400018408) primer pair was designed using Primer3 (biotools.umassmed.edu) and a FASTA sequence extracted from the DM v4.04 reference genome containing the gene plus 1-kb flanking regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positions containing variants with MAF 0.10 were masked to reduce amplification failure from sequence variation within primer-binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  StCDF1 PCR amplicons were generated with the Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase kit (New England BioLabs) using 10 ng genomic DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions were cycled at 98 °C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 2 min and were sheared to a 400-bp average insert size using a Covaris S2 ultrasonicator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Illumina-compatible paired-end libraries were prepared as previously described (27) using StCDF1 DNA amplicons and were sequenced in paired-end mode on the Illumina MiSeq, generating 250-nt reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequences were processed as described above, and overlapping reads were merged using FLASH (-m 10 -M 100 -× 0.1) (107).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to excessive heterozygosity, the haplotypes could not be properly assembled and were manually phased in Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV) (108).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide sequences were derived from the StCDF1 representative transcript isoform (PGSC0003DMT400047370) using TransDecoder (https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/wiki), and both DNA and peptide sequences were aligned with ClustalW (109).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Circadian_Rhythm  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In vitro plantlets were acclimated in a growth chamber in Redi-Earth soil mix under a 12-h photoperiod (500 molm2s1 light intensity) at 22 °C for 2 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For imaging, plants in 0.12-L plastic pots were transferred to 22 °C and constant 70 molm2s1 light provided by Heliospectra RX-30 (Heliospectra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light spectrum was set up to mimic the initial growth chamber: 1% 400 nm, 2% 420 nm, 10% 450 nm, 66% 530 nm, 20% 620 nm, 0.5% 660 nm, and 0.6% 735 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delayed fluorescence was detected using an Andor iKon-M DU-934N-BV camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images (1-min exposure time) were collected 2 s after the light was turned off every hour for 45 d. Raw fluorescence data were detrended using a linear polynomial function of degree 2, and single-plant measurements were normalized between 0 and 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Period length was quantified using BRASS (110).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Period values with a relative amplitude error larger than 0.6 (less_than5% total) were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tomato genotypes Heinz 1706 (S. lycopersicum) and LA0716 (Solanum pennellii) were included for comparing estimates of previous studies using a leaf-movement assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
