title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Detergent-extracted Volvox model exhibits an anteriorposterior gradient in flagellar Ca2+ sensitivity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The multicellular green alga Volvox rousseletii displays phototaxis by changing its flagellar beating pattern in response to photoreception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular mechanism underlying flagellar regulation is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study describes a method to demembranate whole spheroids using a nonionic detergent, with the addition of ATP reactivating flagellar motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reactivated spheroids swam like live spheroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flagellar beating direction was altered in a Ca2+-dependent manner, with a greater change in the anterior hemisphere than in the posterior hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that V. rousseletii has an anteriorposterior gradient of flagellar sensitivity to Ca2+, which likely plays a key role in V. rousseletii phototaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Volvox rousseletii is a multicellular spheroidal green alga containing 5,000 cells, each equipped with two flagella (cilia).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This organism shows striking photobehavior without any known intercellular communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To help understand how the behavior of flagella is regulated, we developed a method to extract the whole organism with detergent and reactivate its flagellar motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon addition of ATP, demembranated flagella (axonemes) in the spheroids actively beat and the spheroids swam as if they were alive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under Ca2+-free conditions, the axonemes assumed planar and asymmetrical waveforms and beat toward the posterior pole, as do live spheroids in the absence of light stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of 106 M Ca2+, however, most axonemes beat three-dimensionally toward the anterior pole, similar to flagella in photostimulated live spheroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This Ca2+-dependent change in flagellar beating direction was more conspicuous near the anterior pole of the spheroid, but was not observed near the posterior pole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This anteriorposterior gradient of flagellar Ca2+ sensitivity may explain the mechanism of V. rousseletii photobehavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reactivation_of_the_Motility_of_V_rousseletii_Axonemes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To reactivate the flagellar motility of detergent-extracted V. rousseletii, we first tested the method developed for C. reinhardtii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this method was not successful, we found that several modifications of the original protocol resulted in successful demembranation and reactivation (details are provided in Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) Because V. rousseletii spheroids cannot be efficiently concentrated by centrifugation, buffer exchange entailed trapping (Fig 2A) or a strainer-scooping method (see Fig 5A) rather than centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) The concentration of nonionic detergent used for C. reinhardtii (0.1%) demembranation was too high for V. rousseletii, resulting in deflagellation during perfusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal concentration for V. rousseletii, as determined by the degree of deflagellation and the efficiency of reactivation, was much lower, in the range of 0.010.03%, and varied by developmental stage (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1C and 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was omitted from the reactivation buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The buffer used to reactivate C. reinhardtii cell models contained 0.5% PEG [molecular weight (Mw) = 20,000] to mimic the molecular crowding effect in vivo (6), thereby increasing the reactivation rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PEG increased the reactivation rate in V. rousseletii, it tended to distort the spheroids (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PEG was therefore added only when the trapping method was used (see Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) Although dark-field microscopy is often used to monitor demembranated C. reinhardtii cells, the flagellar axonemes of V. rousseletii were not clearly visible by dark-field microscopy because of strong halation from the spheroid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, demembranated V. rousseletii was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The optimal concentration of a nonionic detergent, Igepal CA-630 (a substitute for Nonidet P-40; hereinafter referred to as Igepal) was determined by washing spheroids with a buffer and trapping them between a glass slide and a coverslip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was then gently perfused with Igepal-containing buffer for demembranation (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determinations of the demembranation rate (defined as 1 when no flagella moved and 0 when at least one flagellum moved after demembranation in a given sector of a spheroid) indicated the presence of an AP gradient in Igepal sensitivity throughout the developmental stages (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells at the anterior pole were the most sensitive to Igepal (i.e., their flagella stopped beating at lower concentrations), and those at the posterior pole were the least sensitive (Fig 2B and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reproducibly repeat experiments, we selected three easily distinguishable stages in development, termed stages IIII (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage I consisted of newly hatched spheroids, with flagella most sensitive to Igepal (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage II consisted of middle-aged spheroids whose gonidia were in the midst of cell division, with cells in the posterior hemisphere becoming less sensitive than in stage I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage III consisted of the expansion stage, when gonidia finished inversion, with the Igepal concentration necessary to demembranate posterior flagella being the highest among the three stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then determined the optimal conditions to reactivate the motility of demembranated flagella and spheroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because high concentrations of Igepal cause deflagellation, lower concentrations of Igepal were desirable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage II spheroids are best suited for monitoring flagella because the distance between flagella on the spheroidal surface is longer than in stage I, which allows monitoring of their waveforms, and because their gonidia are smaller than in stage III, making the AP axis clearly identifiable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stage I, however, is optimal for monitoring whole spheroids, because the same low concentration of Igepal (0.01%) effectively demembranates both anterior and posterior hemispheres (Fig 2B, arrowhead).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, high-speed monitoring of axonemes in trapped spheroids was performed using stage II spheroids demembranated with 0.01% (for anterior flagella) or 0.03% (for posterior flagella) Igepal (Fig 2B, closed and open arrows, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactivation of whole detergent-extracted spheroids was assessed using stage I spheroids demembranated with 0.01% Igepal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The axonemal motility of detergent-extracted V. rousseletii spheroids (DEVs) was successfully reactivated by treatment with an ATP-containing buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average beat frequencies of reactivated axonemes in DEVs, as determined using a high-speed camera, increased with ATP concentration in a manner consistent with MichaelisMenten kinetics (Fig 3 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average beat frequencies of DEVs reactivated with  greater than 1 mM ATP were higher than those of flagella in live spheroids, which were 29.2 ± 2.7 Hz at the anterior pole and 25.1 ± 1.9 Hz at the posterior pole (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under all conditions tested in this study, the average beat frequencies of flagella/axonemes were slightly higher near the anterior pole than near the posterior pole (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the beat frequencies in DEVs at 1 mM ATP were 41.8 ± 3.1 Hz near the anterior pole and 33.8 ± 0.9 Hz near the posterior pole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using double-reciprocal plots, the maximal beat frequencies at the anterior and posterior poles were 43.5 Hz and 48.8 Hz, respectively, and the apparent Michaelis constants were 0.10 mM and 0.22 mM ATP, respectively (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calcium_Control_of_Flagellar_Stroke_Direction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our primary interest was the identification of the factor that causes ciliary reversal in photostimulated V. rousseletii flagella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal candidate was Ca2+, a major factor that modulates flagella/cilia beating in various organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore examined the effect of Ca2+ on axonemal motility in the DEV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first assessed flagellar motion in live spheroids that responded to photostimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under continuous light, all flagella on a spheroid beat in a posterior direction in a ciliary waveform [Fig 4 A, Left (setup A), B, Center (setup B), and C, Right (setup C) and Movie S1].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After photostimulation (Materials and Methods), flagella in the anterior hemisphere showed ciliary reversal, with flagella beating in an anterior direction for a short period of time, usually 23 s (Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beating direction of a ciliary-type waveform can be determined from the appearance of a typical hook shape in a series of waveforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in beating direction from before to after photostimulation was most clearly observed near the anterior pole, with none observed near the posterior pole (Fig 4 B and C and Movies S3 and S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A surface view of a region close to the anterior pole, as observed from within the spheroid [Fig 4 A, Center (setup B) and D and Movie S5], showed that, in response to photostimulation, the beating direction of flagella gradually changed toward the anterior end after one or two strokes toward the posterior end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direction of beating was almost completely reversed, but did not last long, returning to the original direction in a few seconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to anterior flagella, flagella near the spheroids equator (as observed from outside) [Fig 4 A, Right (setup C) and E and Movie S6] continued beating in a posterior direction for one or two strokes after photostimulation, but gradually rotated stroke direction by 90°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These flagella returned to their original posterior direction more rapidly than the anterior flagella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the beating direction of reactivated axonemes in DEVs in the absence and presence of Ca2+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under Ca2+-free conditions, axonemes in reactivated DEVs beat in a posterior direction (Fig 4 F and G and Movie S7), similar to flagella in live spheroids in response to continuous light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of 106 M Ca2+, however, the axonemes beat in an anterior direction, similar to flagella in the anterior regions of photostimulated live spheroids (Fig 4 F and G and Movie S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the reactivation rate and the beating amplitude became smaller in the presence of 106 M Ca2+ than under Ca2+-free conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strokes in the anterior direction were most clearly visible around the anterior pole, with axonemes near the posterior pole beating in a posterior direction, similar to those under Ca2+-free conditions (Fig 4 F and G and Movies S9 and S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perfusion with a buffer containing 103 M Ca2+ resulted in axonemes that displayed waveforms of smaller amplitude and lower beat frequency (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These waveforms, however, were not observed in photostimulated live spheroids, suggesting that the maximum in vivo Ca2+ concentration after photostimulation is in the range of 106104 M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall, our in vitro experiments using DEVs showed that (i) ciliary reversal is a Ca2+-dependent event and (ii) cells and axonemes on spheroids show a Ca2+ sensitivity gradient along the AP axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Motility_Reactivation_of_Whole_Multicellular_Spheroids_of_V_rousseletii  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we examined whether the Ca2+ effect on axonemal beating direction contributes to the changes in spheroid swimming velocities that occur during the photoshock response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After photostimulation, live V. rousseletii spheroids show photoshock response, with their swimming velocity decreasing to 5060% (3) (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if this response can be reproduced in vitro by changing the Ca2+ concentration, stage I spheroids were demembranated with 0.01% Igepal by the strainer-scooping method, which demembranates spheroids while preserving their overall morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No spheroids displayed movement in this demembranation solution (Fig 5A and Movies S11 and S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the spheroids in the demembranation solution were transferred to a buffer solution containing 0 M or 106 M Ca2+ for reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon the addition of 1 mM ATP, most of the DEVs started to swim like live spheroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average swimming velocities, as calculated from the swimming tracks, were 588 ± 99 ms1 for live spheroids, 499 ± 97 ms1 for DEVs reactivated in Ca2+-free solution (85% of live spheroids), and 285 ± 83 ms1 for DEVs reactivated in buffer containing 106 M Ca2+ (49% of the velocity of live spheroids before photostimulation and 94% of the velocity after photostimulation) (Fig 5 B and C and Movies S11 and S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the photoshock response is caused by Ca2+-mediated ciliary reversal on the anterior hemisphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand how changes in flagellar waveform are regulated in V. rousseletii upon photostimulation, we developed a method to demembranate whole spheroids with a detergent and reactivate their motility by addition of ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method enabled us to examine the motility of dead multicellular spheroids in vitro and to assess the effects of Ca2+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the flagellar axonemes show ciliary reversal in a Ca2+-dependent manner and that these axonemes are sensitive to Ca2+ with a gradient along the AP axis, such that the cells near the anterior pole show the greatest changes in axonemal motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ca2+_Mediates_Light-Induced_Ciliary_Reversal_in_V_rousseletii  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The beating patterns of Volvox flagella change upon photostimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In V. aureus and V. carteri (Eudorina group), the most sensitive cells are localized at the anterior pole, at which flagella stop beating in response to photostimulation (9, 10, 1416).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In V. rousseletii, cells near the anterior pole show ciliary reversal (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the intracellular signals that trigger these flagellar responses have remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results using DEVs strongly suggest that ciliary reversal in V. rousseletii is induced by Ca2+ influx into the flagella in response to photoreception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At intraflagellar Ca2+ concentrations less_than106 M, flagella beat in a posterior direction, whereas at intraflagellar Ca2+ concentrations 106 M, flagella near the anterior pole beat in an anterior direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to C. reinhardtii, photoreception by channelrhodopsin at the eyespot may cause membrane depolarization, followed by Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels localized at the flagellar tips (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ca2+ has been shown to modulate flagellar/ciliary beating in various organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modulation includes (i) waveform conversion, (ii) reversal of bend propagation, (iii) reversal of beating direction, (iv) rotation of beating direction, (v) increase in beat frequency, and (vi) arrest of beating (18) (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Ca2+-dependent modulations are responsible for various important biological events, such as (i) waveform conversion in sperm flagella for sperm chemotaxis toward eggs during fertilization and (ii) increase in beat frequency in mammalian tracheal epithelial cilia for airway clearance (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ciliary reversal has been found in several organisms, including Ctenophora, Paramecium, and sea urchin, and is regarded as (iii) reversal of beating direction in these organisms (11, 21, 22) (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our present study has shown that ciliary reversal in V. rousseletii is (iv) rotation of beating direction with various rotation angles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of Ca2+, V. rousseletii flagella near the anterior pole show almost full reversal (rotation of 180°) of beating direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of rotation of beating direction decreases with distance from the anterior pole, and becomes 90° at the equator and 0° near the posterior pole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism of rotation of beating direction has been suggested to be different from that of reversal of beating direction in sea urchin larvae, and is not well understood to date (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We may expect that identification of molecular/structural differences between anterior and posterior flagella in V. rousseletii will provide clues to understand the molecular mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_AP_Gradient_in_Spheroids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The amplitude of Ca2+-dependent directional change in axonemal beating showed a gradient along the AP axis, being high in cells close to the anterior pole and almost zero near the posterior pole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AP gradient in flagellar photoresponse has been attributed to the gradient in eyespot size, with eyespots larger in cells near the anterior pole (3, 8, 15, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In V. rousseletii, our results clearly showed that the Ca2+ sensitivity of the flagellar axonemes also displays an AP gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, several Ca2+-binding proteins have been identified in C. reinhardtii axonemes, although none has been attributed as responsible for Ca2+ sensitivity in axonemal beating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a promising candidate for the flagellar regulator is LC4, a Ca2+-binding subunit in outer arm dynein (18, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protein may show a gradient in concentration in properties along the AP axis of V. rousseletii axonemes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The light sensitivity of an eyespot may increase with size, such that a larger eyespot more readily promotes light-induced increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, V. rousseletii spheroids may have a strong AP gradient in photosensitivity, resulting from the combined effects of two kinds of gradients: one in the mechanism that regulates light-induced Ca2+ influx and the other in the flagellar mechanism to change the waveform in a Ca2+-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our study showed an AP gradient in detergent sensitivity (i.e., the Igepal concentration required for complete cessation of flagellar beating), with the detergent sensitivity in the posterior region decreasing with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that flagellar membrane properties, such as the contents of particular lipids or membrane proteins, also differ along the AP axis and with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these features of V. rousseletii spheroids may jointly constitute a robust system that enables efficient photobehavior of this organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Volvox_Evolution_for_Phototactic_Steering  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results obtained in this and previous studies indicate how flagellar regulatory mechanisms for phototactic steering have changed during evolution from Chlamydomonas-like unicellular organisms to multicellular Volvox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the cellular level, the perception of a sudden increase in light intensity by the eyespot and the increase in intraflagellar Ca2+ seem to be common to C. reinhardtii and V. rousseletii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the process that follows the intracellular Ca2+ increase seems to differ significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In C. reinhardtii, flagellar beat frequency and amplitude of bending increase with increasing Ca2+ concentrations up to 106 M, causing phototactic turning through a change in the beating balance between the two flagella (6, 25, 26), and at 104 M Ca2+, when the photophobic response takes place, flagellar waveform is converted from a ciliary type to a flagellar type causing backward swimming (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In V. rousseletii, the direction of ciliary-type beating is reversed at 106 M Ca2+ (Fig 4 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1A and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important feature of V. rousseletii behavior is that both photoshock response and phototaxis involve a Ca2+-induced ciliary reversal (3) (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When photostimulation is sufficiently strong for all cells in a spheroid, all flagella in the anterior hemisphere show ciliary reversal with a gradient of amplitude that halts or greatly slows spheroid swimming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, when a spheroid is stimulated by continuous light coming from the side, only the flagella on the illuminated side in the anterior hemisphere should undergo ciliary reversal, causing the spheroid to turn to the light source (3) (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the gradient along the AP axis is very important: If flagella on the illuminated side in the posterior hemisphere also reverse their beating direction, then the entire spheroid would rotate rather than gradually turn to the light source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The AP gradient in V. rousseletii may have other advantages in photobehavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the gradient may enable a spheroid to continue rotation around the AP axis even during photoshock response; such continuous bodily rotation should be important for a spheroid to promptly resume phototactic steering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the gradient may contribute to fine-tuning of the amplitude of photoresponse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the AP gradient, the number of cells (or the surface area of a spheroid) responding to photostimulation changes depending on the light intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might help the spheroid to respond to a wide range of light intensities with varying amplitude of photoshock response or phototaxis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, our DEV experiments showed that, in addition to eyespot size, the properties of flagella in V. rousseletii, including their Ca2+ sensitivity, have a gradient along the AP axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During evolution from Chlamydomonas-like unicellular organisms to Volvox-like multicellular organisms, Volvocales have acquired a spheroidal shape with a functional gradient along the AP axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the spheroid increased in size, it may have differentiated into an anterior hemisphere for steering or braking after photoreception and a posterior hemisphere for constant propulsion of the spheroid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This division of roles in the two hemispheres may be important for the effective photobehavior of spheroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strain_and_Culture_Conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The wild-type V. rousseletii strain MI01 (NIES-4029) was grown in Volvox thiamin acetate (VTAC) medium (27, 28) at 28 °C on a 16-h/8-h light/dark cycle under white fluorescent light at 120 mol of photons m2s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reactivation_of_Detergent-Extracted_Volvox_Spheroids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DEVs were prepared similar to the method used to produce C. reinhardtii cell models (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spheroids were obtained 1224 h after transfer to a new medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For experiments in Ca2+-free conditions, spheroids were washed in HMDEK solution [30 mM Hepes, 5 mM MgSO4, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, and 50 mM potassium acetate at pH 7.4], demembranated in HMDEK solution containing an appropriate concentration (as described in main text) of Igepal (no.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18896; SigmaAldrich), and reactivated in HMDEK with ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For experiments in the presence of Ca2+, spheroids were washed in HMDEK or HMDKP solution [HMDEK without EGTA containing 1% PEG (average Mw = 20,000) at pH 7.4], demembranated in HMDEK or HMDKP solution containing Igepal, and reactivated in one of the Ca2+-buffered reactivation solutions (Table 1) containing ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free Ca2+ concentration of each sample was calculated using CALCON software, written by Shinji Kamimura of Chuo University (www.bio.chuo-u.ac.jp/nano/calcon.html).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two methods were used for buffer exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in the trapping method for monitoring of flagellar motion, washed spheroids were placed in a perfusion chamber made of a glass slide, spacers (0.2-mm-thick vinyl tape), and a coverslip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of the spacer was adjusted to match the size (developmental stage) of the spheroid (single layer for stage I, double layer for stage II, and triple layer for stage III).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was perfused first with the demembranation solution and then with the reactivation solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, in the strainer-scooping method for monitoring of swimming spheroids, spheroids swimming in medium in a Petri dish (35 mm in diameter, 10 mm thick) were scooped with a 40-m nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon 352340; BD Biosciences), sequentially dipped in washing solution and demembranation solution, and soaked in reactivation solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Beat_Frequency_Analysis_and_Waveform_Monitoring_of_Flagella_Axonemes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Flagellar and axonemal beating were video recorded at 500 frames per second with a phase-contrast microscope (BX-53; Olympus) equipped with a high-speed CCD camera (HAS-L2; DITECT Corporation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beat frequency was calculated from the average time interval required for 20 strokes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flagellar/axonemal waveforms were traced frame by frame on transparency films on the monitor screen and digitized using Adobe Illustrator software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tracking_of_Reactivated_DEVs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Reactivated DEVs were monitored under a stereomicroscope (SMZ1000; Nikon) and recorded using a Macromax Scope MVC-DU CCD camera (GOKO Camera).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyze swimming velocity, swimming paths of live spheroids and DEVs were tracked for 3 s and 5 s, respectively, using Image Hyper software (Science Eye).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The swimming velocities were measured from the trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
