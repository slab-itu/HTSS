Hall effect in quantum critical charge-cluster glass  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In cuprates, when doping is reduced superconductivity weakens and eventually disappears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample becomes insulating insofar that resistivity increases as the temperature is lowered, but the conductivity remains high, so the nature of this strange insulating state has been a puzzle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we study the superconductorinsulator transition, improving the control of the doping level by 2 orders of magnitude and the sensitivity in probing transport fluctuations by 3 orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data reveal that at the lowest temperatures superconductivity competes with a charge-glass state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the latter is a glassy version of a charge density wave, and that it originates from strong localization due to chargelattice coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon doping, cuprates undergo a quantum phase transition from an insulator to a d-wave superconductor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nature of this transition and of the insulating state is vividly debated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we study the Hall effect in La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) samples doped near the quantum critical point at x  0.06.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dramatic fluctuations in the Hall resistance appear below TCG  1.5 K and increase as the sample is cooled down further, signaling quantum critical behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explore the doping dependence of this effect in detail, by studying a combinatorial LSCO library in which the Sr content is varied in extremely fine steps, x  0.00008.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that quantum charge fluctuations wash out when superconductivity emerges but can be restored when the latter is suppressed by applying a magnetic field, showing that the two instabilities compete for the ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Schematics showing how the Hall resistance can be more sensitive to domain switching than the longitudinal resistance, for geometric reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) A narrow strip containing two types of domains that differ significantly in carrier mobility and densitye.g., domains A (dark blue) are more metallic than domains B (pink).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When domain A is between the contacts C1 and C2, the Hall voltage is VHA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) If domains jump leaving domain B between the contacts C1 and C2, the Hall voltage jumps abruptly to VHB, whereas there is little change in the longitudinal resistance measured between the contacts C1 and C3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) The domain size is smaller by a factor NW than the strip width W and by a factor NL than the length L from C1 to C3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (D) Switching of a single domain causes a jump in H roughly proportional to 1/NW, whereas in  it is on the order of 1/(NLNW) so it can be much smaller.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimental_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have measured the dependence of  and H in LSCO films on temperature, magnetic field, and doping near the quantum critical point (QCP) at x  0.06.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have traversed the SIT varying x in exquisitely fine steps, x = 0.00008, by using the COMBE technique (13, 14), illustrated in Fig 2 and described in more detail in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2D, we show (T) measured with the current flowing parallel to the crystallographic ab plane and along the gradient in Sr doping, in various pixels from a COMBE library with the doping level varied from x = 0.062 to x = 0.065, as a function of temperature T. As a result of the doping gradient, across the library the critical temperature (Tc) varies from 9 K down to less than 0.3 K, the limit of our measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To elucidate our key experimental findings, we first present and discuss the H(T) data for one representative doping level, x = 0.063.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [The (T) and magnetoresistance data, presented in the Supporting Information, show superconducting fluctuations up to about 1015 K above Tc, in line with the estimates from NMR (34), terahertz spectroscopy (35), Nernst effect (36), and magnetization measurements (37).]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed H(T) dependence is striking (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 3 K less_than  less_than 20 K, H is essentially linear in B, except for a small deviation in the low-B region due to superconducting fluctuations (SFs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, below TCG = 1.5 K the H(B) curves become erratic and exhibit kinks, spikes, and jumps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We emphasize that this is not the instrumental noise, but rather intrinsic behavior of LSCO samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be proven in several ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the instrumental noise of our setup is on the scale of few tens of nV, and it is essentially independent of the sample temperature in the region of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the erratic jumps in Hall voltage can be as large as 5 V (using the same probe current I = 10 nA)at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than our noise floor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The second argument is the striking temperature dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be visualized by comparing the H(B) traces recorded at various temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top two traces in Fig 3B, recorded at T = 5 K and T = 3 K, respectively, are apparently quite smooth; this gives a clear indication that our noise floor is quite low on this scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when we lower the sample temperature by just a couple of degrees, the traces become visibly erratic, the more so as the temperature is lowered further, becoming quite dramatic at T = 0.4 K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The third argument is an equally dramatic dependence on the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is illustrated in Fig 3C, for a sample with slightly higher doping level (black curve), so that Tc = 3 K. For low fields, the H(B) trace shows no switching; however, when the field strength exceeds a certain critical value, BCG, the H(B) trace becomes quite erratic, with large spikes and jumps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At T = 0.4 K, in the (T) data of this sample we see clear signs of SFs, which are suppressed by the magnetic field of a few T. Concomitantly, switching appears in H as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fourth proof is the systematic and dramatic doping dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 3C, we show the H(B) data for an overdoped LSCO film (red curve), with the same Tc = 3 K, taken at the same temperature (T = 0.4 K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the overdoped film (red curve), the instrumental noise is hardly visible; it is about 2 orders of magnitude lower than in underdoped film (black curve) for B  greater than  BCG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison also shows that the dc magnetic field does not affect our instrumental noise, as indeed expected, and as we have also verified directly on many other samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Now that we have established that a large switching effect is intrinsic to underdoped LSCO, we proceed with characterizing it in more detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it should be pointed out that as the temperature is lowered toward zero, both the frequency and the magnitude of jumps strongly increase, pointing to the switching of quantum origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this sample is doped very close to the SIT quantum critical point, one indeed expects strong quantum fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore possible hysteretic and memory effects, we repeated a number of times the measurements of H(B) in the same sample under identical experimental conditions, i.e., at a fixed temperature and sweeping the magnetic field in the same way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of two such traces, taken from the x = 0.063 sample at T = 0.4 K, is shown in Fig 4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In repeated measurements, the jumps in H(B) occur at different values of the magnetic field, indicating that these jumps are random in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we established that the samples show some memory of the magnetic field history, by comparing the results of measurements done over the entire field range, 9 T less_than B less_than 9 T, swept in four different ways, as indicated by arrows in Fig 4 B and C. Apparently, the resulting H(B) curves are vastly different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At lower fields (B less_than 6 T), the four curves show differences not only in the absolute value of H but also in its sign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the field is ramped, every H curve changes the sign at least once, but the sign reversals occur at quite different B values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For higher fields, above about 6 T, the H(B) curves start to merge, i.e., the hysteresis becomes less pronounced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Note that at T = 0.4 K we observe switching and memory effects in the longitudinal magnetoresistivity (B) as well, but this effect is less striking; the relative magnitude of random jumps is much smaller, about 0.1% of the average value of (B), so no jumps are clearly visible on the scale of Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, at the same temperature, the amplitude of random jumps in H exceeds 100% of the average value of H. Thus, the measurement of the Hall effect is a much more (3 orders of magnitude) sensitive method to detect this hysteretic state than the magnetoresistance technique, in line with our expectations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We turn now to the results of Hall effect measurements for the entire combinatorial library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 5A, we show H(B) at low temperature (T = 0.4 K) for several representative pixels; it apparently shows the characteristic random jumps in every device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corroborates that their occurrence is indeed intrinsic to underdoped LSCO over some range of doping levels near the QCP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig 5B, we show the values of Tc(R = 0) and of the field BCG that destroys any remnants of superconductivity and makes the hysteretic switching appear, measured at a fixed temperature (T = 0.4 K), for different doping levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general trend, a monotonic increase of BCG with x, is understandablea higher doping level corresponds to a higher Tc and to a larger condensation energy, and hence it takes a stronger magnetic field to destroy the superconducting state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We mention in passing that this is yet another direct proof that the effect is intrinsic; all of the channels are measured simultaneously in the same field and at the same temperature, and show essentially the same instrumental noise, 2 orders of magnitude lower than the jumps in H.) The phase diagram of underdoped LSCO, determined by the measurements on the entire combinatorial library, is sketched out in Fig 5C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase characterized by erratic switching in H is denoted as the CCG state, for the reasons presented in Discussion below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear that the insulator state evolves into the CCG state when the temperature decreases due to the strong localization at low temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the ground (zero-temperature) state is determined by competition between the superconducting and CCG states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The so-called superconductor-to-insulator transition indeed is a superconductor-to-CCG quantum phase transition that can be triggered by decreasing the doping level or by increasing the applied magnetic field, as demonstrated in Fig 5C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We now outline a physical picture that can account for our experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that in underdoped LSCO at fixed (low) temperature and magnetic field, the value of H can fluctuate by several hundred percent, and even change sign, depending on the samples history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This H behavior, fundamentally different from the smooth and monotonic magnetic field dependence of H in LSCO reported in the literature (38, 39), remained undetected so far because it only occurs at very low temperature (T less_than 1.5 K) and in a narrow composition range near the QCP at xc  0.06.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon cannot be explained within the framework of standard theories of transport in conventional metals and semiconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in the Drude model, H is inversely proportional to the carrier density, so the reversal of sign of H would imply that the carrier type changed from holes to electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it seems unlikely that one could switch between holes and electrons by just tweaking the magnetic field up and down.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we argue that this phenomenon is intrinsic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas atomic and structural defects inevitably occur in any film, this cannot be the origin of the observed switching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, for fluctuations in H by more than 100% to come from impurities and defects, their density would have to be very high, and we would have easily picked up their signature in reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurementswhich we have not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We monitored the RHEED pattern throughout the growth process and we observed no signals attributable to defects or precipitates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The postgrowth AFM and XRD measurements indicated an atomically smooth single-crystal LSCO film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper limit on the density of conceivable defects is orders of magnitude too low to cause jumps by 100% in H. Second, the critical field BCG shows continuous and monotonic dependence on the doping (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unlikely that this could originate from some random defects (none of which have been observed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the doping dependence of BCG can be naturally understood as a consequence of the gradual approach to the SIT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the overall time to ramp the magnetic field in the Hall experiment at one fixed temperature is about 4 h, so the time scale between two local peaks/valleys in H is typically a few minutes (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluctuations under discussion are very slow, indicating that the domains are large, probably on the micrometers scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fast fluctuations, as would be caused by atomic defects, may be present as well, but are averaged out and not detectable in our experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, H manifests hysteretic behavior and memory effects as shown in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these findings can be attributed to intrinsic fluctuations in H. Moreover, our findings are corroborated by direct STM imaging of localized charge domains in bulk single crystals of NCCOC (31, 32) and BSCCO (33), indicating that the occurrence of CCG is not only intrinsic but also universal to the HTS cuprates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Therefore, we have to consider more exotic mechanisms, beyond the nearly free electron model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we should contemplate the Hall effect in a charge-, spin-, or superconducting vortex-glass state, all of which were reported to occur in underdoped cuprates (612).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although regrettably a broadly accepted quantitative theory of these phenomena is still missing, we can discriminate between these three glassy states based on qualitative arguments, as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to the previously reported muon spin rotation and magnetic susceptibility experiments (68), our underdoped LSCO films should exhibit spin-cluster-glass behavior at low temperature (TSG  3 K for x = 0.063).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the spin-glass state there should be no long-range order of magnetic moments, and the net moment should vanish after averaging; thus one should not expect the spin degrees of freedom to strongly affect the electric transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Superconducting vortex-glass and vortex-liquid states are both expected to appear (12, 4043) in underdoped LSCO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vortex motion is involved as long as the SFs are present, which is the case in Fig S1 for T less_than 15 K. In the vortex-liquid state, continuous flow of vortices should create no discontinuity in transport properties such as H. On the other hand, in the vortex-glass state, at low density and low probe currents the vortices should all be pinned and immobile, thus not contributing to the Hall effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the phase transition between the vortex-liquid and the vortex-glass states should be of the first order, in line with the observed hysteretic behavior, this occurs only within a very narrow (10-mK wide) temperature window centered at the transition temperature, and in a very narrow field range (41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we have shown that for x = 0.063 H is hysteretic at all temperatures below T = 1.5 K and in all fields up to 9 T (the maximum available in this setup).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whereas the spin-glass and vortex-glass states likely both occur in our LSCO samples in certain temperature ranges, we conclude that they are not responsible for the fluctuations and hysteresis in H reported here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The only remaining possibility is the CCGa state where the charges are localized and distributed nonhomogeneously across the sample (911).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One envisions many different, metastable charge distribution patterns, essentially degenerate in energya situation we have illustrated by sketches in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes the sample very susceptible to fluctuations, which trigger frequent switching from one metastable pattern to another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This kind of switching can explain random jumps in our H. Quantum fluctuations are expected to grow upon approach to the SIT quantum critical point, as observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disappearance of the glassy state for T  greater than  1.5 K indicates either that quantum fluctuations diminish rapidly with the temperature, or that thermal fluctuations wipe out glassiness, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observed, in agreement with ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11, that SFs intensify as the temperature is lowered until TCG but then weaken and disappear as the temperature is lowered further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, hysteretic switching due to charge localization in clusters gets stronger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is indeed what one would expect from the charge-phase uncertainty relation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important point is that this clearly indicates that the two orders compete for the ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The key open question is what the effective charge of localized carriers is.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  STM in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 revealed (15, 16) checkerboard patterns of static CDW, with periodicity 4a0 × 4a0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been interpreted as a Wigner crystal formed by hole pairs at x = 1/8 doping, dubbed the pair density wave or CDW of Cooper pairs (CPCDW) (4449).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In previous experiments (50) with electrolyte gating of LSCO we were able to traverse the SIT using the electric field effect, and found that the transition (in zero magnetic field) occurs at the quantum resistance for pairs, Rc = RQ = h/(2e)2 = 6.5 k. This is suggestive of the existence of pairs on both sides of the SIT, which are localized in the insulator whereas delocalized and condensed in the HTS state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have shown that in LSCO doped near the QCP at x  0.06 the superconducting state is competing with a quantum CCG statea glassy version of CDW, clustered but without long-range coherence, pinned on defects such as Sr2+ dopant ions, and subject to massive quantum critical fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that this strange state of condensed matter occurs in HTS cuprates may not be a mere coincidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For sample synthesis, we have used the COMBE system at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  La2-xSrxCuO4 films, 20 unit cells (26.4 nm) thick, were grown on LaSrAlO4 substrates polished perpendicular to the crystallographic [001] direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We monitored synthesis in real time by RHEED, which indicated perfect atomic-layer-by-layer growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a single Sr source aimed at a shallow angle (20°) with respect to the heated substrate, we varied the doping level x in the film continuously from 0.062 to 0.065.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two sources each were used for La and for Cu, and their deposition rates and shuttering times were adjusted to preserve accurately the 2:1 ratio between (La + Sr) vs. Cu; this is critically important to avoid nucleation and growth of unwanted precipitates of secondary phases, such as CuO and La2O3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The film as grown is a single crystal, just with a small gradient in Sr doping level (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used photolithography to pattern the film into a Hall bar, 10 mm long and 300 m wide, with 64 gold contact pads and leads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample is thus formed into a one-dimensional combinatorial library with 31 segments (pixels), each with a slightly different chemical compositionfrom one pixel to the next, the doping level x increases in extremely fine steps, x = 0.00008.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can estimate the error bars as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measure the deposition rates by quartz crystal monitor and atomic absorption spectroscopy in situ, cross-calibrated by ex situ Rutherford back-scattering spectroscopy and X-ray reflectometry measurements, with compound absolute accuracy conservatively estimated to be better than 3%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the Sr doping level at the sample center is x = 0.0635 ± 0.0019.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the doping gradient is continuous, linear, and fixed very accurately by the system geometry at 4% per 1 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the relative (pixel-to-pixel) accuracy is much better.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 1 pixel, the uncertainty in its relative composition (say, compared with its nearest neighbor) is determined by its length, 300 m, so one can take it to be ±0.00004, although this is not random.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the width of voltage contacts is just 10 m, making this (relative) uncertainty 30× smaller in Hall effect measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these error bars are orders of magnitude smaller than the markers we use in the figures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Magnetotransport measurements were performed in a Helium-3 cryogenic system equipped with a superconducting magnet, providing field up to 9 T. To enable multichannel data collection, electronic connections to the custom-designed sample-mounting stage are made by 32 pairs of individually twisted and shielded manganin wires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heat load to the sample is minimized by appropriate thermal anchoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature can be varied between 300 mK and 300 K, with stability better than ±1 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all transport measurements reported here, the excitation (bias) current density was kept very low, j = 3 × 102 A/cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding voltages are measured by a custom-built, parallel-running, multichannel digital lock-in setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus,  and H are measured simultaneously at every pixel in the combinatorial library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A multiplex is used for easy switching between the  and H measurement configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Apart from allowing the study of doping dependence with unprecedented accuracy, the COMBE technique reduces the sample-to-sample variations, because each sample (i.e., pixel) is synthesized on the same substrate under the same thermodynamic conditions and undergoes the same history including lithographic process steps, exposure to atmosphere, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Longitudinal_Magnetoresistance_in_LSCO_Doped_near_the_SuperconductorInsulator_Transition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have measured the dependence of the in-plane longitudinal resistivity () on the magnetic field up to B = 9 T in the same set of samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To illustrate our main observations, we here present and discuss the data for one representative doping level, x = 0.063the same sample for which we have shown the Hall effect data in Fig 3 A and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig S1, we show  as a function of temperature T and magnetic field B, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with earlier experiments in zero field (2, 3), for 20 K less_than T less_than 100 K the slope of dab/dT is negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behavior is customarily referred to as insulating (although the sample is actually still quite conductive) and attributed to some sort of charge localization or ordering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below T  15 K, superconducting fluctuations become visible, and the superconducting transition occurs at Tc  2 K. When superconductivity is suppressed by an external magnetic field, the sample shows insulating behavior down to the lowest temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Fig S1A, one can see a magnetic-field-driven SIT, occurring for T  0 at some critical value of sheet resistivity, Rc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value of Rc is not universal, in contrast to the case of doping-driven SIT where it was found in both LSCO (50) and YBCO (51) that Rc  RQ = 6.5 k. However, Rc is expected (5255) to be universal only for a strictly 2D SIT, whereas the applied magnetic field makes the carrier motion in CuO2 planes quasione-dimensional, and in this case, Rc may depend both on the doping level x and on the sample size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig S1B highlights the magnetic field dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For strong magnetic fields and/or higher temperatures, the field dependence of the magnetoresistance  (B) is quadratic in B, as expected for a normal metal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low fields and low temperatures, the dependence deviates from the B2 behavior, showing significant excess conductivity; this is commonly attributed to SFs (56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our magnetoresistance data show SFs up to about 1015 K above Tc, in line with the estimates from NMR (34), terahertz spectroscopy (35), Nernst effect (36), and magnetization measurements (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
