Biodegradable Piezoelectric Force Sensor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measuring physiological pressures such as lung pressure, brain pressure, eye pressure, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is important for monitoring health status, preventing the buildup of dangerous internal forces in impaired organs, and enabling novel approaches of using mechanical stimulation for tissue regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pressure sensors are often implanted and directly integrated with soft biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the devices should be flexible and at the same time biodegradable to avoid invasive removal surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present the study and processing of a biodegradable polymer which can convert mechanical force to electricity, and employ the polymer to develop a biocompatible implanted force sensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensor, relying solely on common medical materials, can monitor important biological forces and eventually self-vanish, causing no harm to the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Measuring vital physiological pressures is important for monitoring health status, preventing the buildup of dangerous internal forces in impaired organs, and enabling novel approaches of using mechanical stimulation for tissue regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pressure sensors are often required to be implanted and directly integrated with native soft biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the devices should be flexible and at the same time biodegradable to avoid invasive removal surgery that can damage directly interfaced tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite recent achievements in degradable electronic devices, there is still a tremendous need to develop a force sensor which only relies on safe medical materials and requires no complex fabrication process to provide accurate information on important biophysiological forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a strategy for material processing, electromechanical analysis, device fabrication, and assessment of a piezoelectric Poly-l-lactide (PLLA) polymer to create a biodegradable, biocompatible piezoelectric force sensor, which only employs medical materials used commonly in Food and Drug Administration-approved implants, for the monitoring of biological forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show the sensor can precisely measure pressures in a wide range of 018 kPa and sustain a reliable performance for a period of 4 d in an aqueous environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate this PLLA piezoelectric sensor can be implanted inside the abdominal cavity of a mouse to monitor the pressure of diaphragmatic contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This piezoelectric sensor offers an appealing alternative to present biodegradable electronic devices for the monitoring of intraorgan pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensor can be integrated with tissues and organs, forming self-sensing bionic systems to enable many exciting applications in regenerative medicine, drug delivery, and medical devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We present a strategy for material processing, characterization, electromechanical analysis, and device fabrication of biodegradable piezoelectric PLLA to create a biodegradable piezoelectric force sensor to monitor important physiological forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensor has a wide range of measurable pressures and can be implanted anywhere in the body with minimal immune response due to the sensors ability for miniaturization and the biocompatible and biodegradable nature of the materials used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the simple fabrication process, compared with photolithography-assembled sensors, makes the sensor more favorable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PLLA sensor relies on piezoelectricity, which allows the device to generate electrical output upon applied force, and therefore, in principle, we could eliminate the use of a battery to power this device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we showed the PLLA sensor can be implanted into the abdomen of a mouse to measure the pressure of diaphragmatic contraction, we anticipate many other applications of this sensor for biointegration, enabling the development of a new class of organs and tissues with the ability of self-monitoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the piezoelectricity of PLLA could be employed to harvest energy from alternative biological deformations (e.g., the beating of heart, lung, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to produce useful electrical stimulation for tissue repair/regeneration, while the material will be degraded to facilitate the tissue-regeneration process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several improvements can be made to the current sensor design, including implementation of a wireless transmitter, creating a fully implanted system and improvement of piezoelectricity to reduce the sensor dimensions for further miniaturization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, this sensor, only made of common biomedical materials, is a significant step forward for the field of implantable force sensors and offers an appealing alternative to the present biodegradable electronic devices for monitoring a variety of important biophysiological pressures such as the pressure of diaphragmatic contraction, intraarticular pressure, intraabdominal pressure, intraocular pressure, intracranial pressure, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
