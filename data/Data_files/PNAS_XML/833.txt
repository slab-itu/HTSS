Origin, paleoecology, and extirpation of bluebirds and crossbills in the Bahamas across the last glacialinterglacial transition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On tropical islands, extensive extirpation of birds and other vertebrates occurred during the Holocene, following human arrival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much less is known about pre-Holocene extirpation on islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focus on two species (Eastern bluebird Sialia sialis and Hispaniolan crossbill Loxia megaplaga) that were lost in the Bahamas to changes in sea level (becoming higher), land area (getting smaller), climate (becoming warmer and wetter), and habitat (loss of pine grassland) that took place during the last glacialinterglacial transition, many millennia before peopling of the islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While volant, the bluebird evolved a short wing in the Bahamas, whereas the crossbill retained a similar morphology to the surviving population on Hispaniola.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each major glacialinterglacial shift reconfigured the resident Bahamian flora and fauna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On low islands or island groups such as the Bahamas, surrounded by shallow oceans, Quaternary glacialinterglacial changes in climate and sea level had major effects on terrestrial plant and animal communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examine the paleoecology of two species of songbirds (Passeriformes) recorded as Late Pleistocene fossils on the Bahamian island of Abacothe Eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) and Hispaniolan crossbill (Loxia megaplaga).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each species lives today only outside of the Bahamian Archipelago, with S. sialis occurring in North and Central America and L. megaplaga endemic to Hispaniola.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unrecorded in the Holocene fossil record of Abaco, both of these species probably colonized Abaco during the last glacial interval but were eliminated when the island became much smaller, warmer, wetter, and more isolated during the last glacialinterglacial transition from 15 to 9 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Todays warming temperatures and rising sea levels, although not as great in magnitude as those that took place from 15 to 9 ka, are occurring rapidly and may contribute to considerable biotic change on islands by acting in synergy with direct human impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bluebirds  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We assign 35 Bahamian fossils (eight different skeletal elements) to the Eastern bluebird (S. sialis) based on a combination of 13 osteological characters from six skeletal elements that distinguish them from other turdine genera (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the three species of Sialia, the fossils agree with S. sialis in the proportions of the humerus, ulna, and carpometacarpus (stouter in Sialia mexicanus, more slender in Sialia curricoides).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no intraspecific features in any single skeletal element to distinguish the Bahamian fossils from any living form of S. sialis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bluebird fossils from Abaco also are similar in overall size to the modern bones of S. sialis from the North and Central American mainland (Fig 4), except that females of S. s. fulva average smaller than all others (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the Bahamian bluebird fossils do differ from all other forms of S. sialis in having a relatively short distal wing (low ratio of carpometacarpus length to humerus length; an exception being the single specimen of S. s. guatemalae from Chiapas) and a relatively large body for its wing size (high ratio of femur length to humerus length (32), although these ratios are not necessarily based on bones from the same individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These trends in the limb proportions of Bahamian Eastern bluebirds, which are to be expected in resident insular versus continental populations of conspecific volant songbirds (32, 33), were not evident in the two bluebird skeletons from Bermuda (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The subspecies S. s. fulva (southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico) and S. s. guatamalae + S. s. meriodionalis are predicted to have very low average per-area climate suitability in modern Bahamas (0.003 and 0.007, respectively, relative likelihood of occurrence, scale 01; SI Appendix, Table S2) and higher in the ice age Bahamas based on species distribution models (SDMs) projected to LGM climates for at least one climate model, but still with low suitability (0.0060.024).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area-summed suitability of the ice age Bahamas is predicted to be 580 times greater than at present, primarily because of the greater land area (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subspecies combination S. s. episcopus + S. s. sialis shows a similar pattern (0.048 for the current climate vs. 0.0260.114 for LGM climate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the paleodistribution models provide no strong evidence for which subspecies of S. sialis might have colonized Abaco.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sialia s. grata (confined to Florida, questionably distinct from S. s. sialis) (19) is the subspecies of Eastern bluebird whose modern distribution shares the most similar climate to the modern in Bahamas (0.231), but the SDMs predict it to have lower climatic suitability in Bahamas at the LGM than at present (0.0200.058; SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even S. s. grata is predicted to have a greater area-summed climatic suitability at the LGM (SI Appendix, Table S3) because of the much greater land area in the Bahamas at that time (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Crossbills  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The crossbill fossils from Abaco (eight specimens, four skeletal elements) include a complete mandible (Fig 5) that shares two of three characters with modern specimens of the Hispaniolan crossbill L. megaplaga (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In size, the Bahamian crossbill fossils also resemble both modern and fossil L. megaplaga specimens from Hispaniola (SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This species is much larger than in any modern specimens of L. leucoptera, its continental sister species based on molecular data (28, 29) and plumage (white wing bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  James (34) distinguished L. leucoptera from Loxia curvirostra by the number of fused thoracic vertebrae in the notarium (three in the former, two in the latter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the number is three in L. megaplaga, further supporting its close relationship with L. leucoptera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Modern specimens of L. curvirostra, especially the relatively large L. c. stricklandi, resemble in size the modern and fossil specimens of L. megaplaga more than L. leucoptera (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2S4 and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crossbill fossils from the Bahamas and Haiti have a slightly larger body for its wing size compared with others (high ratio of tibiotarsus length to humerus length; SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S3 and S4 and Table S4; femur not available in fossils).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with Eastern bluebirds, resident populations of L. curvirostra exist today in southern Mexico and northern Central America (35), including in lowland savannas and woodlands featuring Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea), the same species as occurs in the Bahamas (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we evaluated the SDM for L. curvirostra as well as that of L. l. leucoptera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the subspecies of L. curvirostra, the model based on modern distribution of L. c. mesoamericana + L. c. stricklandi shows the highest climatic suitability in the Bahamas based on modern climate, but still is low (median 0.055).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under three LGM climate models, the Bahamas are climatically much more suitable for these combined subspecies (median 0.0930.133) because of higher per-area suitability (SI Appendix, Table S2) and greater insular land area (Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
L. l. leucoptera, with a high latitude distribution in North America (Fig 3), shows no similarity in climatic conditions to the modern Bahamas, and average climatic suitability for the LGM also was very low (0.0020.009), which is lower than for all but three of the L. curvirostra subspecies (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low SDM climatic suitability of L. l. leucoptera shows that these values may not be evidence of source area of the extirpated Bahamian population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Compared with Pinus occidentalis measured on Hispaniola (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29, table 2 therein), P. caribaea var.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bahamensis, the only pine in the Bahamas, has cones that average longer but not wider or heavier, cone scales that are thinner, and seeds that are much lighter (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale thickness of the Bahamian pine falls between the values for Pinus cubensis and P. occidentalis measured by Parchman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (29), who argued that the thick scales of P. occidentalis (thicker than in P. cubensis) had evolved as a defense to seed predation by L. megaplaga.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Origin_of_Bluebird_and_Crossbill_Populations_in_the_Bahamas  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The tectonically stable (37) Bahamian islands never have been connected directly to North America, Cuba, or Hispaniola, even during the LGM (26.519.0 ka) (38), when sea level was as much as 120 m lower than today (39) (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dispersal among these geologically distinctive places, as well as among the low, geologically uniform islands sitting atop the carbonate banks of the Bahamas, involved shorter distances during glacial than interglacial times but still required the birds to fly over the ocean (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6, tables S2 and S3 therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For Eastern bluebirds (S. sialis), the extirpated Bahamian population is not clearly attributable to any particular mainland form based on morphology or climatic similarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colonization of Abaco was more likely during glacial times because of closer proximity to North America, especially Florida (75 km; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6, tables S2 and S3 therein), the much larger land area of the Little Bahama Bank (Fig 6), and Abacos widespread pine grasslands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LGM habitat of Florida has been interpreted as an open conifer woodland dominated by pine (40), just as in the Bahamas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Which other islands in the Bahamas may have been colonized by bluebirds awaits further fossil studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hispaniolan crossbill (L. megaplaga) probably colonized the Little Bahama Bank from Hispaniola by island-hopping across the Great Bahama Bank where it likely also resided, although this has yet to be confirmed by fossils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both colonization events must have taken place after the sea-level highstand of MIS 5e (120 ka) but well before that of MIS 1 (150 ka; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Extirpation_of_Bluebirds_and_Crossbills_in_the_Bahamas  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the few places where they have been documented by fossils, the composition of late Pleistocene passerine bird communities on the neotropical mainland was very different from those existing in the same places today (4244).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it should be little surprise that the same holds true on neotropical islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither S. sialis nor L. megaplaga are likely to have survived on Abaco after the PleistoceneHolocene Transition (PHT) in climate, habitat, and island area that took place from 159 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PHT on Bahamian islands such as Abaco was characterized by major changes in climate (becoming more warm and moist), habitat (expanded coverage by broadleaf forest at the expense of pine woodland), sea level (rising from 80 m to nearly modern levels), and island area (being reduced from 17,000 km2 to 1,214 km2) (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These land area values are just for AbacoLittle Bahama Bank; for the entire Bahamian Archipelago, the land area was reduced from 130,000 km2 to 13,000 km2; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the much smaller, more isolated island of Bermuda, fossil deposits from dated Quaternary contexts provide ample evidence of glacialinterglacial changes in the vertebrate community, especially birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a breeding population of short-tailed albatross (Phoebastria albatrus), represented by fossils of embryos, juveniles, and adults, was eliminated on Bermuda by a sea-level highstand during MIS 11 at 405 ka (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other species of reptiles and birds (mostly endemic) were lost from Bermuda during this and subsequent sea-level highstands, such as a tortoise (Hesperotestudo), a skink (Eumeces), and numerous birds, including rails (Rallus, Porzana, and Gallinula), a crane (Grus), a night heron (Nyctanassa), great auk (Pinguinus impennis), a duck (Anas), a crow (Corvus), and a towhee (Pipilo) (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Bermuda does not lie nearly as close to other, higher islands (Cuba and Hispaniola) or to the North American continent as the Bahamian islands, the glacialinterglacial turnover in its bird communities probably was more drastic, lacking nearby landmasses where volant species perhaps could survive when land areas were reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By inference with the habitat preferences of living populations, the relative abundance of fossils from Sawmill Sink of Eastern bluebirds (n = 35) and Hispaniolan crossbills (n = 8) suggests that the dominant late Pleistocene terrestrial habitat on Abaco was pine woodland with a grassy understory or a mosaic of pine woodland and grassland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This idea is reinforced by co-occurring late Pleistocene fossils at Sawmill Sink of nine other species of songbirds with similar habitat affinities (5), namely, Eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna; n = 1,075), brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla; n = 20), chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina; n = 12), pine warbler (Dendroica/Setophaga pinus; n = 10), loggerhead kingbird (Tyrannus caudifasciatus; n = 6), greater Antillean oriole (Icterus cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dominicensis species group; n = 4), yellow-throated/Bahama warbler (D./S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dominica/flavescens; n = 3), Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis; n = 2), and grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum; n = 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six of these 10 species no longer occur on Abaco (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with the abundant fossils of burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia; n = 1,914), the passerine species strongly support the idea that the dominant late Pleistocene habitat on Abaco (and probably most other Bahamian islands) was a grassy pine woodland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In North America, Loxia l. leucoptera feeds mostly on seeds of spruce (Picea spp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and larch (Larix laricina) (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither spruce nor larch occurs on Hispaniola or the Bahamas, where the only common conifers are pines (P. occidentalis on Hispaniola, P. caribaea in the Bahamas).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (The Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) is listed as an occasional food for L. l. leucoptera in North America (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The closely related J. barbadensis var.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  lucayana occurs in the Bahamas, where it may have supplemented the diet of Pleistocene crossbills.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pine seeds are eaten only rarely today by L. l. leucoptera, thus the evolution of L. megaplaga likely involved a major shift in food habits, not unlike that seen in crossbills on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca versus those on the European continent (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such shifts in food habits might help to explain the low SDM climatic suitability scores of crossbills on the North American mainland versus those of the extirpated population in the Bahamas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parchman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (29) suggested that coevolution with L. megaplaga led to the thicker cone scales in P. occidentalis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the ice-age Bahamas, L. megaplaga presumably fed on the seeds of P. caribaea var.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bahamensis, which are protected by somewhat thinner cone scales than in P. occidentalis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Speculation about possible coevolution awaits further research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We propose that bluebirds and crossbills probably colonized the Bahamas sometime during the last glacial interval (i.e., subsequent to MIS 5e; less_than125 ka), when habitat conditions would have been more favorable than during the interglacial MIS 5e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Going from glacial (MIS 2) to interglacial (MIS 1) conditions during the PHT (159 ka; cool  warm; dry  moist; large island  small island; near island  more isolated island; pine woodland and grassland  pine forest and broadleaf forest) would have depleted many of the pine grassland-dependent species of birds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether from glacial to interglacial or vice versa, each major shift in climate/sea level/habitat would cause some reshuffling of the resident Bahamian flora and fauna.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike on Bermuda, we currently lack a pre-LGM fossil record of Bahamian vertebrates, so the differences through time in this reshuffling (new colonizations, new extirpations) are speculative at this point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing a pre-LGM fossil record in the Bahamas is a major research challenge for the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Scientists agree nowadays that global temperatures are rising, as are sea levels (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these changes may not be as dramatic in magnitude as those that took place at the PleistoceneHolocene Transition from 159 ka, they are occurring rapidly and still are likely to contribute to floral and faunal changes on islands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is especially the case because of the highly variable and often poorly understood effects that novel (= indigenous + introduced species) plant and animal communities will have on island ecosystems (50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes in climate, sea level, habitat, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  brought on by the PHT rearranged insular biotic communities without any human influence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Today, these types of changes are exacerbated by all manner of human impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparative osteology was done with modern skeletons from the American Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Delaware Museum of Natural History, Los Angeles County Museum, Minnesota Museum of Natural History, Moore Laboratory of Zoology, Occidental College, Museum of Southwest Biology, University of New Mexico, Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida (UF), National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, and the Yale Peabody Museum (SI Appendix, Table S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All fossils are from the UF Vertebrate Paleontology Collection, on long-term loan from the National Museum of the Bahamas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Loxia fossils are UF 297336297342.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Sialia fossils are UF 312822312824, 411423411455.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We compared cones and seeds of P. caribaea var.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bahamensis from the Bahamas to published measurements of P. occidentalis from Hispaniola, based on the proposal of coevolution in size between the cones of P. occidentalis and the bill of L. megaplaga (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using similar sampling methods that those authors used for P. occidentalis on Hispaniola, we measured cones and seeds for P. caribaea var.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bahamensis from Abaco (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took the following measurements from two cones per cones collected from 23 different trees from eight locations on Abaco: cone length (in millimeters); cone width (in millimeters); cone mass (in grams); scale length and scale thickness (in millimeters) three scales per cone from middle third of cone (from each of the cones with seeds); seed mass (in milligrams) for all seeds filled with kernel (from any cone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To evaluate the fluctuating land area in the Bahamian Archipelago for the past 492,000 y, spanning MIS 12 to the present, we use the sea level curve from Grant et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sea level relative to present, at increments of 1,000 y, was applied to a global topographic database that includes seafloor topography (52) to estimate land area above sea level, at each time step, as in Steadman and Franklin (6) (for details see SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Species distribution modeling (53) was used to estimate the relative likelihood (54) of climatically suitable conditions in the current and ice age Bahamas for extant subspecies of S. sialis, L. curvirostra, and L. leucoptera (in North America only).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Occurrence data were combined for some geographically adjacent subspecies that had small sample sizes (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Occurrence data were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, restricted to vouchered and research grade records, and six bioclimatic variables (55) were analyzed: annual temperature, temperature seasonality, maximum temperature of the warmest month, minimum temperature of the coldest month, annual precipitation, and precipitation seasonality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioclimatic data for current climate and Last Glacial Maximum based on three paleoclimate models were obtained from www.worldclim.org at 2.5 resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Climate data and modeling procedures using MaxEnt software (56, 57) were as in Steadman et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (5) and see SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Averaged (and summed) climatic suitability (relative likelihood) predicted from SDMs, projected to current climate and hindcast to the LGM paleoclimate maps for Bahamas (including land areas exposed by lower sea level), were used to evaluate the degree of similarity between climate currently occupied by these populations and the current and ice age Bahamas climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
