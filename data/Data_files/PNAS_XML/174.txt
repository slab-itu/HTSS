The effect of rights-based fisheries management on risk taking and fishing safety  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Commercial fishing is a dangerous occupation despite decades of regulatory initiatives aimed at making it safer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We posit that the individual allocation of fishing quota can improve safety by solving many of the problems associated with the competitive race to fish, which manifest themselves in risky behavior such as fishing in poor weather.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present a previously unidentified approach to evaluation: estimating the change in the propensity to start a fishing trip in poor weather conditions as a result of the management change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chronicle a revolution in risk-taking behavior by fishermen (a 79% decrease in the annual average rate of fishing on high wind days) that is due to the change in economic incentives provided by rights-based management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Commercial fishing is a dangerous occupation despite decades of regulatory initiatives aimed at making it safer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We posit that rights-based fisheries management (the individual allocation of fishing quota to vessels or fishing entities, also called catch shares) can improve safety by solving many of the problems associated with the competitive race to fish experienced in fisheries around the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The competitive nature of such fisheries results in risky behavior such as fishing in poor weather, overloading vessels with fishing gear, and neglecting maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not necessarily intended to address safety issues, catch shares eliminate many of the economic incentives to fish as rapidly as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We develop a dataset and methods to empirically evaluate the effects of the adoption of catch shares management on a particularly risky type of behavior: the propensity to fish in stormy weather.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After catch shares was implemented in an economically important US West Coast fishery, a fishermans probability of taking a fishing trip in high wind conditions decreased by 82% compared with only 31% in the former race to fish fishery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, catch shares caused the average annual rate of fishing on high wind days to decrease by 79%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are evidence that institutional changes can significantly reduce individual, voluntary risk exposure and result in safer fisheries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By 2001, the primary sablefish fishery on the West Coast had been fully transitioned from a management system that limited exploitation by controlling the length of the fishing season to one that limited exploitation through a system of catch shares (SI Appendix, section S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our estimates indicate that the average annual rate of fishing on high wind days decreased dramatically as a result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Controlling for the changes that occurred independently of the management change via the difference-in-differences specification with individual fixed effects, the average annual rate of fishing on high wind days decreased by 0.428 or 79% (Fig 2; P = 0.000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unobservable shifts in the propensity to fish in poor weather that are not accounted for in the vessel fixed effects would have also occurred in the comparison trip limit fishery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full regression output is available in SI Appendix, Table S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The results from modeling the daily fishing participation choices of each vessel in the primary fleet show that the average daily fishing rate decreased substantially post-ITQ implementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probability of beginning a fishing trip on a given day decreased by 85% (P = 0.000; Table 1; odds ratios available in SI Appendix, Table S5), as expected given the increase in season length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pre-ITQ, expected revenue had no effect on the probability of starting a fishing trip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is consistent with fishermens incentives in a derby fishery: any delay would result in the fish being caught by someone else.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post-ITQ, higher expected revenue had a positive effect on the probability of starting a trip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High winds had a negative effect on the probability of starting a fishing trip, but the effect increased after the ITQ program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the pre-ITQ period, a high wind day caused a 31% decrease in the probability of taking a fishing trip, from a mean rate of 24% (P = 0.000; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post-ITQ, a high wind day caused an 82% decrease in the probability of taking a fishing trip, from a mean rate of 3.5% (P = 0.000; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the pre-ITQ period, the marginal rate of substitution between revenue and risk cannot be calculated because the coefficient on expected revenue is not significantly different from zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post-ITQ, the marginal rate of substitution is $33,000, implying that, on average, a fisherman would require three times the mean expected revenue per trip of $11,000 to fish on a high wind day (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results are indicative of a transformation of the incentive structure fishermen face, from one in which they must fish almost regardless of conditions to one in which they make rational tradeoffs between the risks involved with fishing in poor weather and the potential revenue to be gained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Catch shares affect the incentives that fishermen face in many ways, and a variety of confounding mechanisms could be contributing to the estimated effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the intensive-margin behavioral changes that have been observed in other catch shares fisheries, such as targeting higher value fish (larger, higher quality, etc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), utilization of byproducts, or changing product types (21, 34, 35) have not occurred in this fishery (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of change is likely due to the characteristics of the market for West Coast sablefish; it is sold almost exclusively as a frozen, minimally processed product to Japan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another of the most immediate results of catch shares is often consolidation, whether through vessel or permit buyback programs, or permit sales and quota trading (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there was no buyback program, the number of active vessels in the primary fishery fell by about 30%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vessels that stopped fishing were smaller on average and had the associated characteristics of lower catch per trip and more trips per year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there was a change in the spatial distribution of fishing: 56% of the vessels that exited the primary fishery fished in California compared with 27% in Oregon and 16% in Washington (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the vessels that exited the primary fishery were less risk averse or more likely to take trips in poor weather, the estimated impact of the ITQ program on risk-taking behavior (Fig 2) would be overstated, especially if some of the vessels continued to fish in the trip-limit fishery only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested for variation in the propensity for risk taking across vessel size and for vessels that fished in California in the pre-ITQ period (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smaller vessels are more susceptible to the risks associated with strong winds, large waves, and other stormy weather conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vessels fishing in California may be more or less risk averse because of other, unobservable factors (how far off the coast they are fishing, for example).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the average aversion to high winds in the pre-ITQ period is similar for large and small vessels: both groups were about 36% less likely to start a trip on a high wind day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smaller vessels had a higher mean probability of taking a trip because they can store less fish, meaning that their trips are shorter and they must make more trips to catch the same amount as a larger vessel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vessels that fished out of California ports were somewhat more risk averse than those that fished from Washington and Oregon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  California vessels also tended to be smaller; hence, their mean probability of starting a trip is higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results imply that small vessels and those that fished in California in the pre-ITQ period may have been slightly more risk averse than average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we estimate the model for vessels that exited the fishery after the ITQ, and for those that remained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high wind day was associated with a 63% decrease in the probability of fishing for the set of vessels that exited compared with a 25% decrease among those vessels that remained (Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern of consolidation means that our estimate of a 79% decrease in the average annual rate of fishing on high wind days could be biased downward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Had the risk-averse vessels that left the fishery remained, the effect may have been even larger (SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
While often glamorized for their fortitude, commercial fishermen are one of the most at-risk groups in terms of occupational hazards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fishing safety policies generally address one of two objectives: reducing the probability of death or injury in the event of an accident or reducing the probability of accidents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Limited empirical evidence suggests that regional fishing safety policy in the United States has been marginally effective in improving on the first objective (10, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most policy intended to reduce risk exposure, however, tends to attempt to tell fishermen how to fish, advice that is poorly received in such an adventurous and fiercely independent lot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Catch shares alter the incentives that underlie fishermens decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the fishery considered here, management prior to catch shares involved limiting the season length to restrict total harvest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This management strategy is not uncommon in the United States and around the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Often, season length restrictions make the risk-reward tradeoff essentially degenerate: by delaying a trip, profits can only be lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, fishermen have been observed maximizing effort through every margin available to them: forgoing sleep or vessel repairs, overloading vessels, or removing safety equipment in favor of additional fishing gear behavior that is risky, but not unexpected given their economic incentives (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incentives are present regardless of the legality of such actions, necessitating substantial enforcement effort and penalties to prevent (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Technological safety regulations, such as a requirement to carry emergency equipment, cannot be expected to be markedly effective in preventing accidents in such a landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Catch shares, a management system not directly designed to improve safety in its inception, corrects the market failure that contributes to the dangerous nature of commercial fishing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Catch shares change fishing incentives such that fishermen themselves decide to expose themselves to less risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the West Coast sablefish fishery, this has resulted in a dramatic decrease in risk-taking behavior by fishermen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average annual rate of fishing on a high wind day decreased by 79% as a result of the change in economic incentives provided by rights-based management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After catch shares, a vessel would have to expect over three times the expected revenue to fish on a high wind day than to fish on a day without high winds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consolidation resulted in a 30% reduction in the size of the fishing fleet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vessels that exited were smaller, more likely to fish from California ports, and more risk averse than vessels that remained in the fishery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without this consolidation, the decrease in the average annual rate of fishing in high winds may have been even larger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is worth noting that the dramatic change in the propensity to fish in poor weather measured for this particular fishery may be at the upper end of the distribution of expected effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The West Coast sablefish fixed gear fishery is a single-species fishery that transitioned from a condensed derby-style fishing season of only a few days to a 7-mo season in a region with relatively good weather.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vessel allocations are tradeable, but with restrictions and relatively low quota accumulation limits (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catch shares program in the West Coast sablefish fixed gear fishery was very effective in eliminating the race to fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are many situations in which the competitive nature of the fishery may not be completely eliminated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If prices, the size of fish, or the catchability of fish (due to the concentration of biomass, for example) are highest during a short time in the fishing season, harvesters may still compete for the highest-value or easiest-to-catch fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other compounding factors include bycatch restrictions or bycatch quota that is constraining, fisheries in which quota is mainly leased rather than fished by the quota owners, or fisheries in which the timing of fishing and deliveries is controlled by processors (35, 3840).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the extent of season compression and post-ITQ expansion is not unprecedented [e.g., Alaska sablefish (41), Alaska halibut (42), British Columbia halibut (21), and Alaska crab (43) ITQ programs], in other programs the difference in season length may not be as extreme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, a more nuanced effect can be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complexity of the incentives harvesters face before and after catch shares is an important consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
According to data from the US Coast Guard, the average annual incident rate (safety incidents per 1,000 vessel days at sea) in the West Coast sablefish fixed gear primary fishery fell from 0.8 in 19942000 to 0.1 in 20012012, an 87% decrease (P = 0.006) (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the behavioral changes we describe appear to be consequential in terms of occupational safety outcomes, even with the statistical limitations of establishing identification and robust estimates using traditional types of occupational health data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we empirically demonstrated that the changed incentive structure faced by fishers operating under a catch share system caused them to take fewer weather-related risks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a derby fishery, the risk/reward tradeoff of forgone catch is identical whether the source is a weather-related delay in fishing, a pot left on the dock to not overload a vessel, or space taken up by survival suits or other safety equipment rather than captured fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we expect the effect of catch shares on these other margins of risk exposure to be similar, the outcome of which will quite credibly be a decrease in injuries, pollution events, vessel losses, search-and-rescue missions, and deaths from fishing accidents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Empirical_Approach  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data constitute a long unbalanced panel: daily fishing activity by nearly 500 vessels from 1994 to 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we have repeated observations on individuals, as well as a treatment group (the primary sector: the group that was exposed to the policy change) and a comparison group (the trip-limit sector: the group that was not exposed to the policy change), we can fully identify the effect of the management change on the average annual fishing rate in poor weather (as identified by a high wind day, defined in the previous section) using a difference-in-differences strategy with individual fixed effects (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonexperimental research designs can be assessed by comparing pretreatment trends for the treatment and comparison group (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy relies on the assumption that in the absence of the policy changethe change to ITQs in the primary fisherythat the average annual fishing rate in poor weather in the primary fishery would have evolved similarly to the average annual fishing rate in poor weather in the trip limit fishery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the average fishing rate on high wind days was consistently higher in the primary fishery, the trends were similar (SI Appendix, Fig S4 and Table S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the gears, target species, and even many of the participants are the same, the two sectors are subject to similar unobserved shocks or trends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inclusion of individual fixed effects eliminates bias from unobserved and unchanging vessel characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a difference-in-differences specification with individual vessel fixed effects can precisely estimate the effect of the change in management regime (the treatment) on the annual proportion of fishing trips that occurred on high-wind daysRift|(w=1)=0+1Primaryf+2PostITQ+3(PrimaryfPostITQ)+i+eift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Rift|(w=1) is the annual average fishing rate (Rift) for vessel i in each fishery f on high wind days (w=1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primaryf indicates the primary fishery (treatment group) vs. the trip-limit managed fishery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PostITQ indicates the years after individual quotas were institutionalized in the primary fishery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, 3 estimates the average treatment effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters i are individual fixed effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fishermen make tradeoffs between risk and financial gain when they decide to start a fishing trip on a particular day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tradeoffs are expected to change under catch share management.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify them, we model the daily fishing decision as a fixed effects logit model that accounts for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity among vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The log-odds ratio for starting a fishing trip on day t is a linear function of expected revenue and weather in each management regimeln[P(Fmit=1|xmit,wmit,i)]ln[1P(Fmit=1|xmit,wmit,i)]=rmit+wmit+i,[3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where Fmit=1 indicates vessel i took a trip on day t in management regime m. We define weather wmit as a binary variable equal to 1 if there were high winds on day t in vessel is port of potential departure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expected revenue rmit is estimated using observed prices and catches and was detailed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between risk and financial gain is MRS =(/), which gives the compensation (in dollars of expected revenue) that would be required for a fishermen to begin a fishing trip on a high winds day (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretically, the decision is a function of expected profit rather than revenue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cost data are not available, so we assume revenue and profits evolved similarly, a common assumption in fisheries economics research, where cost data are rare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot observe nonfishery outcomes, so the model assumes that the latent net revenue of not fishing is constant over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Consolidation that occurred after the ITQ program (Table 2) could bias the results if there were systematic differences in the vessels that exited the fishery correlated with risk preferences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vessels that exited tended to be smaller and were more likely to be based in California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimate Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3 separately for vessels less than and greater than the median length (43 ft), for vessels that fished in California (which experienced significant effort reduction after the ITQ program) and those that fished in Oregon or Washington, and for vessels that exited the fishery after the ITQ and those that stayed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dividing the sample into length categories allows the retention of the vessel fixed effects in each regression but will obscure the likely continuous nature of the effect of vessel length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we also estimate model 3 with a continuous interaction between vessel length and each independent variable, but excluding the vessel fixed effects (SI Appendix, Table S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In SI Appendix we report the results of several analyses that examine the identification assumptions (SI Appendix, Tables S13 and S14) and robustness of the estimates presented in the main article (SI Appendix, Tables S6S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimates pass the identification tests and were found to be extremely robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
