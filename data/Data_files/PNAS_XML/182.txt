Slip-mediated dewetting of polymer microdroplets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Contact lines form at phase boundary intersections, quintessentially liquid/vapor interfaces at solid surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas classical hydrodynamic models predict that contact line motion requires infinite energy, common observations of moving droplets show that huge amounts of energy are unnecessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slip, wherein a fluid slides along a solid boundary, offers relief of such divergences, and has gained attention with the developing fields of micro- and nanofluidics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This article focuses on contact line motion of retracting liquid droplets with micrometric dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slip is tuned by changing a nanometric substrate surface layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting contact line motion and droplet evolutions are hugely influenced by slip, thus offering insights on the question: How do contact lines move?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Classical hydrodynamic models predict that infinite work is required to move a three-phase contact line, defined here as the line where a liquid/vapor interface intersects a solid surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a slip boundary condition, in which the liquid slides against the solid, such an unphysical prediction is avoided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this article, we present the results of experiments in which a contact line moves and where slip is a dominating and controllable factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spherical cap-shaped polystyrene microdroplets, with nonequilibrium contact angle, are placed on solid self-assembled monolayer coatings from which they dewet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relaxation is monitored using in situ atomic force microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that slip has a strong influence on the droplet evolutions, both on the transient nonspherical shapes and contact line dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observations are in agreement with scaling analysis and boundary element numerical integration of the governing Stokes equations, including a Navier slip boundary condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

(A) Experimental AFM data for PS microdroplets dewetting from OTS; here, Hm(r/Rm)=h(r,tm)/h(0,tm), where the subscript m refers to the time when the height profile achieves maximal deviation from a spherical cap (compare gray lines in Fig 1 of the main text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The legend shows the initial contact line radius, R0 in micrometers and the initial central height, h0, in nanometers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ridge disappears for an initial contact line radius in the range 2.7mless_thanR0less_than4.1m (slip length, bOTS160 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Conversely, the ridge does not appear for droplets with R05m and below when dewetting from DTS (bDTS2,250 nm), even while the initial contact angle, 0, is slightly smaller in the DTS case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(A) Experimental height profiles of a dewetting PS droplet on DTS (compare Fig 1 of the main text), from which contact angles, (t), can be obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tangents (dashed gray lines) of a fourth-order polynomial fit to the data (solid lines, not all fitted data shown) at the substrate, i.e., at h=0, are obtained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The curve with larger contact angle has been shifted horizontally for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Contact angle as a function of time for the droplet represented in A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red lozenges indicate the curves shown in A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the initial angle (before dewetting starts) is 07°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Contact angle as a function of time for the PS droplet on OTS shown in Fig 1 of the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Contact angles as shown in Fig S3 are only measured in directions where there is no overshoot on the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(A) Experimental early-time dynamics of the normalized contact line radius, for the two PS droplets of Fig 1, dewetting from OTS and DTS substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid lines represent power laws tm, with exponent m=0.54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Inset) Such exponents measured for all studied droplets for which an early-time dynamics was accessible, as a function of b1/3, where  is the droplet volume; the dashed lines indicate m=0.5 and m=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Numerical early-time dynamics obtained from the NYM using various =b/R0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along with unit initial radius, parameters used were 0=9.9°,=62°, leading to =R/R00.54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(Top) Squared slip velocity (i.e., the fluid velocity at the substrate) as a function of the radial position, normalized by the contact line radius.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimensionless slip lengths are the same as those for the droplets shown in Fig 2 of the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Bottom) Normalized frictional dissipation power (i.e., the dissipation due to fluid sliding against the solid substrate) on a disk of size r as a function of the normalized radial coordinate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed line represents y=1x with y the vertical coordinate and x the horizontal one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The points at which the solid lines cross the dashed one are always below y=0.5, which demonstrates that most of the frictional dissipation occurs near the contact line for both cases, especially at early times (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To prepare the nonequilibrium droplets, PS (Polymer Standards Service GmbH) with weight-averaged molecular weight 10.3 kg/mol and polydispersity index 1.03, was dissolved into toluene (chromatography grade, Merck), and spin-coated onto freshly cleaved mica sheets (grade V2, Plano GmbH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a dewetting process in toluene-saturated atmosphere at room temperature, glassy spherical cap-shaped droplets on mica were produced with initial contact angles 0=9±3°, and contact line radii 2mR07m (measured using AFM; Dimension FastScan and FastScan A tips, Bruker).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Under ambient conditions, the glassy droplets were then floated from mica onto the surface of an ultraclean water bath (18 M cm, total organic carbon content less_than6 ppb; TKA-GenPure, TKA Wasseraufbereitungssysteme GmbH), and transferred onto the SAM-coated silicon wafers [(100) crystal orientation with native oxide layer present; Si-Mat Silicon Materials].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two types of SAMs were used, being prepared from either OTS or DTS; Sigma-Aldrich), with the self-assembly procedure and full characterization described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both SAM coatings render the Si wafers hydrophobic, and lead to equilibrium PS contact angles in air of =62±3°, as measured by AFM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The droplets dewet when heated above the glass-transition temperature 90°C (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heating stage on the AFM was set to 110°C and AFM was used to measure in situ height profiles of the dewetting microdroplets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This annealing temperature is low enough to ensure no loss of PS due to evaporation or degradation; volume conservation was verified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the capillary velocity of our system was measured using the stepped-film method (62) to be /=0.07±0.01m min1 at the experimental annealing temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Error_and_Model_Deviations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We note that relative deviations between profiles predicted by the NYM and those measured with AFM are up to 5% (Fig 2, main text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the typical contact angles are rather high, 60°, overshoot can affect the absolute height measurement in the forward and reverse directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show an example of this overshoot in Fig S4, where the feedback parameters that control the interaction between the AFM tip and the substrate and droplet surfaces are tuned to minimize the difference between forward and reverse traces, while allowing for a minimum tip penetration (63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The typical deviations associated with various instrumental effects for the parameter settings of this scan (and those presented in the rest of the paper) are thus on the order of 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, independent checks on static profiles have shown that the overshoot presented here is rate dependent, and can lead to variations on the height of 5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the overall error on the height measurement at the ridge is roughly the same as the discrepancy between experiment and the NYM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the profiles alone, a discrepancy between the NYM and the experiments cannot be resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although we cannot rule out other models that would change predicted profile shapes beyond the resolution of the current measurements (i.e.,  5% relative error), our numerical model with Navier slip and Young-angle boundary condition has quantitatively corroborated the experimental height profile evolutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the NYM and the scaling approaches have captured the main features of the contact line dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we caution that the agreement is not quantitative in all respects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At small b/R, the experimental time constants in Fig 4D deviate from the NYM data and the scaling asymptotics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several effects may explain this discrepancy: nonlinear (28) or spatially nonuniform (29, 30) slip may be operative; the assumption of constant microscopic contact angle (17, 18), (t)=, could be relaxed as well (Fig S3); furthermore, in ultrathin (5 nm) dewetting polymer films, thermal fluctuations are known to enhance the dynamics (64), which could also affect the effective liquid mobility at the solidliquid boundary, or at the three-phase contact line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, at relatively small slip length, other mechanisms of CLM may contribute (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present results thus open a perspective to more detailed studies from both theoretical and experimental sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Asymptotic_Early-Time_Scaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we provide quantitative arguments for the scaling law given in Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2, using lubrication theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the experiments are performed in a situation where the slip length b is comparable to the initial droplet radius R0, and because we focus on the short-term asymptotic behavior near the contact line, we invoke the 2D thin-film equation for intermediate slip (65):th+bx(h2x3h)=0,[S1]where  is the PSair surface tension and  the PS shear viscosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This partial differential equation describes the viscocapillary evolution of a thin liquid film of profile h(x,t) in space x (coordinate taken in the frame of the substrate) and time t, with intermediate slip at the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contact line is located at x=R(t), and the liquid film is chosen to occupy the xless_thanR(t) region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two boundary conditions at the contact line are thus h(R(t),t)=0 and xh(R(t),t)=tan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus assume an equilibrium microscopic contact angle  at any time, consistent with the NYM used in the numerics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Let us nondimensionalize the problem through x=XR0, t=TR02/b, R(t)=(T)R0, h(x,t)=H(X,T)R0, such thatTH+X(H2X3H)=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We now look for a self-similar asymptotic form at short times near the contact line:H(X,T)=TF(U),[S3]U=X(T)T,[S4]where  and  are unknown exponents, and (T) is the law of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Invoking the boundary conditions above, one obtains =, F(0)=0, and F(0)=tan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, injecting the self-similar form into Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2, one gets(FUF)=T1FT12(F2F),[S5]where the prime represents the derivative with respect to U, and the dot represents the derivative with respect to T. The proposed self-similar form is a possible solution if and only if the previous equation is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) on the single variable U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is thus given by =1/2, together with=1CT,[S6]which satisfies the initial condition, where C is a positive numerical constant, and where the minus sign corresponds to the dewetting situation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that case, the ODE satisfied by F readsF+(CU)F+2(F2F)=0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S7]The latter could be solved numerically by adding three boundary conditionsespecially in the unperturbed far-field regionand by shooting on C. Finally, putting back real dimensions, one obtainsR0R(t)=Cbt,[S8]which demonstrates the scaling law of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, one can validate the proposed self-similar form by comparison with the experimental profiles, as shown in Fig S6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We note that the essential ingredients in both the power balance and the thin-film equation are the same: capillarity drives a viscous flow and the dissipation is mostly due to friction at the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that we neglected the H3 term in the thin-film equation, according to the intermediate-slip model (65), is consistent with the fact that we also neglected the bulk viscous dissipation near the contact line in the power balance leading to the scaling of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Asymptotic_Late-Time_Scalings  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We will assume that the shape of the contracting droplet is close to that of a spherical cap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the late-time regime of the contraction process, the apparent contact angle  (evaluated through the assumed spherical cap profile) deviates from the microscopic contact angle , but the difference  is small and approaches nil at asymptotically large times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The interfacial energy of a spherical cap with an apparent contact angle  is given byE=(AlvcosAsl),[S9]where we have defined the area of the substrate wet by liquid,Asl=R2,[S10]and the interfacial area between the liquid spherical cap and the vapor phase,Alv=2(1cos)R2sin2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S11]The contact line radius R is linked to the apparent contact angle  by the condition that the volume of the liquid,=(1cos)2(2+cos)R33sin3,[S12]is constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first invert Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S12 to obtainR=[3sin3(1cos)2(2+sin)]1/3,[S13]and insert the latter into Eqs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10 and S11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus obtain from Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S9 the total interfacial energy of the spherical cap E() as a function of the apparent contact angle  only.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We finddEd|==0,[S14]as expected in mechanical equilibrium for =, and a second derivatived2Ed2|==2R22+cos greater than 0,[S15]because the spherical cap is a stable shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Similarly, we could use an energy E(R) that depends only on the radius of the contact line R and (R).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results aredEdR|R=R=0,[S16]andd2EdR2|R=R=2(2+cos)sin2 greater than 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S17]Here, we make use of the chain rule of differentiation:dEdR|R=RdEd|=(dRd)1|=,[S18]and the identityd2EdR2|R=Rd2Ed2|=(dRd)2|=,[S19]which holds for an equilibrium state at = and R=R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Expanding the energy E(R) around R=R up to second order yieldsE=E+(2+cos)sin2(RR)2,[S20]which, when differentiated with respect to RR, yields a linear restoring force as claimed in the main text.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injected power from the gain of interfacial energy then readsPinj=2(2+cos)sin2(RR)R.[S21]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Weak_Slip__bR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the limit of weak slip, the dissipation is mainly due to viscous losses in the bulk flow close to the contact line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this contact line region, the free-surface profile of the droplet is assumed to be a wedge described by z=h(x,t)=x, where x denotes the distance from the contact line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the droplet spreads with a contact line velocity R, there is a flow in the wedge that is described by a Poiseuille velocity profile:v=3R2h2z(z2h),[S22]with a local average velocity (0hdzv)/h=R, and where we assumed a no-slip boundary condition at the substrate and a no-shear boundary condition at the free surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The partial-slip boundary condition gives a noticeable departure from the Poiseuille profile only in the vicinity of the contact line where h(x)m, with a microscopic length, m=Cb, where CO(1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the viscous dissipation power readsPdis=2RmRdx0hdz(zv)2=6RR2ln(RCb).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S23]Balancing the dissipated power, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S23, and the injected power, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S21, yields a differential equation for R(t) with the solutionR(t)Rexp(t),[S24]with a time constant=Rf(b/R),[S25]f(b/R)=3ln(b/R)(2+cos)sin2+C1,[S26]where C1 is a nonuniversal constant that depends on the global interfacial geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S26 with the corresponding expression in the main text, f=C0ln(b/R)+C1, and substituting =62°, we find C0=1.44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Strong_Slip__bR  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because of incompressibility we have Tr()=0 for the rate-of-strain tensor .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For flat droplets 1, we can assume an axially symmetric and uniform straining flow in the horizontal and vertical direction of the droplet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we find that the rate of strain z into the axial direction is twice the rate of strain in the two directions parallel to the substrate:x=y=z2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S27]For a Newtonian fluid, we have =, which provides us with the viscous dissipation:Pdis=dV:,[S28]which yieldsPdis=122,[S29]where the volume  is given by Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Balancing the injected power of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S21 with the dissipated power of Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S29, and relations R/R=x=y, we finally arrive at the relaxation timescale:()=R2(1cos)2sin5,[S30]valid in the limit of full slip b/R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the particular case considered here, we have(62°)1.05R.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [S31]  #@NEW_LINE#@#
