Invariances in the architecture of pride across small-scale societies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been proposed that one key function of pride is to guide behavior in ways that would increase others valuation of the individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To incline choice, the pride system must compute for a potential action an anticipated pride intensity that tracks the magnitude of the approval or deference that the action would generate among local audiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from industrial mass societies support this expectation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is presently not known whether those data reflect cultural evolutionary processes or a panhuman adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments conducted in 10 traditional small-scale societies with widely varying cultures and subsistence modes replicate the pattern observed in mass societies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that pride is a universal system that is part of our species cooperative biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Becoming valuable to fellow group members so that one would attract assistance in times of need is a major adaptive problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To solve it, the individual needs a predictive map of the degree to which others value different acts so that, in choosing how to act, the payoff arising from others valuation of a potential action (e.g., showing bandmates that one is a skilled forager by pursuing a hard-to-acquire prey item) can be added to the direct payoff of the action (e.g., gaining the nutrients of the prey captured).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pride system seems to incorporate all of the elements necessary to solve this adaptive problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, data from western(-ized), educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies indicate close quantitative correspondences between pride and the valuations of audiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Do those results generalize beyond industrial mass societies?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To find out, we conducted an experiment among 567 participants in 10 small-scale societies scattered across Central and South America, Africa, and Asia: (i) Bosawás Reserve, Nicaragua; (ii) Cotopaxi, Ecuador; (iii) Drâa-Tafilalet, Morocco; (iv) Enugu, Nigeria; (v) Le Morne, Mauritius; (vi) La Gaulette, Mauritius; (vii) Tuva, Russia; (viii) Shaanxi and Henan, China; (ix) farming communities in Japan; and (x) fishing communities in Japan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite widely varying languages, cultures, and subsistence modes, pride in each community closely tracked the valuation of audiences locally (mean r = +0.66) and even across communities (mean r = +0.29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the pride system not only develops the same functional architecture everywhere but also operates with a substantial degree of universality in its content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Within-Community_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we report the valuation and pride results for each community (SI Appendix, SI Text and Tables S1S2j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was widespread agreement on how valuation-enhancing these situations are relative to one another: mean intraclass correlation (ICC) across the 10 communities: ICC (2,n) = 0.70 (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, participants agreed about the extent to which they would positively view the individual described in these scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants also agreed about the relative degree to which these various situations would elicit pride: mean ICC (2,n) = 0.61 (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the main prediction that pride tracks audience valuation, we calculated, for each scenario, the mean pride ratings provided by participants in the pride condition and the mean valuation ratings provided by participants in the audience condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pride and valuation means were highly correlated with one another within each community, with a mean r = 0.66 (SD = 0.24; minimum r = 0.36; maximum r = 0.92; N r values = 10) and P values = 0.00020.31 (Fig 2 and Table 2, diagonal values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recall that the pride ratings and the valuation ratings originate from different participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, these high correlations cannot be attributed to participants matching their pride ratings and valuation ratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the primary hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Between-Community_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pride system evolved for making decisions inand tracking the values ofones local group and not people from other cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obviously, there would have been no selection to map the valuations of persons with whom one has never interacted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if there is a human-universal system of social valuation, then scenarios that tap this system may elicit agreement across cultures about what is worthy of valuation and pride, and pride in a given culture may track valuation in other cultures, despite a lack of contact between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Are there situations that provoke valuation and elicit pride across cultures?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for between-community agreement in valuation, in pride, and in the pridevaluation link, we computed the extent to which the mean valuation ratings and the mean pride ratings are correlated across communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is between-community agreement on average on the extent to which a given situation would elicit valuation: mean r = 0.37 (SD = 0.30; minimum r = 0.26; maximum r = 0.91; N r values = 45) and P values = 0.00020.96 (SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is also between-community agreement on the extent to which a given situation would elicit pride: mean r = 0.20 (SD = 0.38; minimum r = 0.80; maximum r = 0.92; N r values = 45) and P values = 0.00020.99 (SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the pride elicited in each of 10 communities is positively correlated on average with the valuation from the other 9 communities: mean r = 0.29 (SD = 0.34; minimum r = 0.62; maximum r = 0.87; N r values = 90) and P values = 0.0010.98 (Table 2, off-diagonal values)71 of these 90 correlations (79% of them) have a positive sign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is substantial variation in the extent to which pride tracked valuation across communities, including null and negative correlations, the pride elicited by these scenarios in one community (e.g., Mayangna foragerhorticulturalists of the Bosawás Reserve, Nicaragua) tended to track how positively people viewed these scenarios in the other communities (e.g., pastoralists from Tuva, Russia; Amazigh farmers from Drâa-Tafilalet, Morocco; and farmers from Enugu, Nigeria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, some actions, traits, and situations elicit valuation and pride in some cultures but not others (33, 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A cross-culturally replicable, close quantitative correspondence between anticipated pride and the valuation of local audiences is what one expects of a computational system that is well-designed for furthering the social value of the individual in the minds of others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Features causing this close calibration assist the individual in balancing the competing demands of effectiveness and restraint by steering between an internal pride signal that is too strong (which would lead to, for example, the overpursuit of socially valued acts) and one that is too weak (which would, for example, insufficiently motivate acts that are socially valued).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This match is not limited to industrial mass societies but generalizes across populations with widely different cultures, subsistence modes, institutions, and languages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this feature is more likely to originate in a human-universal adaptation designed by natural selection than in cultural evolutionary processes (76).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement across cultures, and not just within them, on pride, valuation, and their interrelationship is noteworthy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to some accounts, different cultures are richly and arbitrarily different from each other (77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this were true, then what cultures value and what members of different cultures are proud about should be radically different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultural differences in pride and in the underlying items granted respect and valuation do exist, as shown here and elsewhere (45, 78, 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these cultural differences can be adaptively patterned (33), and therefore cultural variation is not necessarily divorced from the logic of adaptive functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, regularities across vastly disparate cultures can emerge when pride is analyzed from the standpoint of its probable function and target domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data contribute to a growing body of findings indicating that theories of adaptive function are a powerful tool for identifying regularities in the structure and content of human emotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The study procedures were approved by the institutional review boards at the University of California, Santa Barbara; East China Normal University; the University of Nigeria, Nsukka; Universidad San Francisco de Quito, and the University of Cincinnati, and the research ethics committee of the Institute of Psychology, Russian Academy of Sciences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the participants gave informed consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data and study materials are included in Dataset S1 and SI Appendix, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We collected data from 567 participants in Bosawás Reserve, Nicaragua (sample A); Cotopaxi, Ecuador (sample B); Drâa-Tafilalet, Morocco (sample C); Enugu, Nigeria (sample D); Le Morne, Mauritius (sample E); La Gaulette, Mauritius (sample F); Tuva, Russia (sample G); Shaanxi and Henan, China (sample H); farming communities in Japan (sample I); and fishing communities in Japan (sample J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample sizes and demographic information are described in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The 10 scenarios are shown in SI Appendix, Tables S2aS2j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were randomly assigned to either the audience condition or the pride condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The language in the scenarios was gendered according to participants stated gender, except for at the two Japan sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At both Japan sites, data collection was through self-administered questionnaires sent by mail; here, we used gender-neutral pronouns and instructed respondents in the audience condition to imagine the target individual was someone of their same sex and age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample size, order in which the scenarios were administered, method of stimuli administration, and language of stimuli are listed in SI Appendix, Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
