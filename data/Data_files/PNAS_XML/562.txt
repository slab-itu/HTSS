Utility-value intervention with parents increases students STEM preparation and career pursuit  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The need for students trained in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) jobs is growing rapidly in the United States, yet students do not enroll in the necessary courses to prepare for STEM careers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a randomized controlled trial, parents in the utilityvalue intervention group received materials detailing the importance of STEM for their adolescents in high school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intervention increased mathematics and science ACT scores and course-taking in high school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This greater high-school STEM preparation was associated, 5 y later, with increased STEM career pursuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that educational policies should promote the personal relevance of high-school mathematics and science courses and involve parents in helping to promote STEM preparation and career pursuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During high school, developing competence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is critically important as preparation to pursue STEM careers, yet students in the United States lag behind other countries, ranking 35th in mathematics and 27th in science achievement internationally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the importance of STEM careers as drivers of modern economies, this deficiency in preparation for STEM careers threatens the United States continued economic progress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we evaluated the long-term effects of a theory-based intervention designed to help parents convey the importance of mathematics and science courses to their high-schoolaged children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A prior report on this intervention showed that it promoted STEM course-taking in high school; in the current follow-up study, we found that the intervention improved mathematics and science standardized test scores on a college preparatory examination (ACT) for adolescents by 12 percentile points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater high-school STEM preparation (STEM course-taking and ACT scores) was associated with increased STEM career pursuit (i.e., STEM career interest, the number of college STEM courses, and students attitudes toward STEM) 5 y after the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the intervention can affect STEM career pursuit indirectly by increasing high-school STEM preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding underscores the importance of targeting high-school STEM preparation to increase STEM career pursuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these findings demonstrate that a motivational intervention with parents can have important effects on STEM preparation in high school, as well as downstream effects on STEM career pursuit 5 y later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Current_Study  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is a long history of so-called two-generation interventions, which are defined as interventions that involve both parents and children (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this tradition of two-generation interventions, Harackiewicz et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (32) tested an intervention that encouraged parents to communicate the utility value of STEM topics to their high-schoolaged children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parents were randomly assigned to the intervention or control condition, and the intervention materials (i.e., two brochures and a website) were distributed to parents when their children were in the 10th and 11th grades of high school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intervention materials provided information about the utility and relevance of mathematics and science for high-school students and encouragement to discuss this information with their child.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, parents were given advice and recommendations about how to most effectively communicate this information to their children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, parents were advised to personalize the information to their childrens interests and goals by helping their children generate their own connections with STEM topics and supporting these connections with information and examples from the intervention materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parents in the control group did not receive any additional materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Students could only be affected by the intervention through interactions with their parents because none of the intervention materials were ever directed to students.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Harackiewicz et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (32) found that this intervention increased students STEM course-taking in the 11th and 12th grades of high school by approximately one semester of additional STEM course-taking on average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Rozek et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (33) showed that those effects were mediated by changes in parents and students attitudes about STEM topics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current study extended the original study in two important ways: first, we investigated if this parental intervention affected students mathematics and science achievement in high school; second, we conducted a 5-y follow-up when the participants were 20-y-old to examine students STEM career aspirations, college STEM course-taking, likelihood of choosing a STEM major in college, and perceptions of STEM value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine academic achievement as an additional measure of students high-school STEM preparation, we collected and analyzed students college preparatory standardized test scores (i.e., ACT scores) from their high-school records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scores on this test reflect knowledge accrued from mathematics and science courses taken in high school, and we hypothesized that scores would be higher in the intervention condition, given that those students enrolled in more STEM courses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we tracked participants 5 y after the initial intervention (age 20) to assess long-term intervention effects on posthigh-school STEM career pursuit outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this time, we asked students about the type of career they desired, how many STEM courses they had taken in college, their current plans for their college major, and about their STEM attitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The goal of the current study was to examine the effects of the intervention on an additional high-school STEM preparation variable (i.e., ACT scores), as well as downstream effects on posthigh-school STEM career pursuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we hypothesized that this parent-centered utility-value intervention would increase students mathematics and science ACT scores, in addition to the already documented effects on 11th and 12th grade mathematics and science course-taking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we predicted that these effects on high-school outcomes would better prepare students for STEM careers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we predicted that the intervention would have long-term positive effects on posthigh-school STEM career pursuit (i.e., college STEM course-taking, the likelihood of choosing a STEM major, self-reported STEM value, and whether students aspired to a STEM career 5 y after the initial intervention) to the extent that the intervention improved students high-school STEM preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the intervention could also directly affect posthigh-school outcomes, research on the lasting effects of psychological interventions suggests that they are maintained by initiating a chain of positive recursive processes (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the intervention may change some outcome (behavior or psychological process) in the short term, and that outcome then has an effect on later outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested our hypothesis by examining the indirect effect of the intervention on STEM career pursuit variables via high-school STEM preparation variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all, this study is unique in terms of being able to test both the short-term and long-term effects of a cost-effective parent-centered intervention on critical STEM preparation and career pursuit outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Descriptive statistics and zero-order correlations are reported in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_Equation_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used structural equation modeling to examine the relationships between variables over time during and after high school (Fig 1 for the theoretical model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were seven base predictors for our model, which were used to predict all high-school and posthigh-school outcomes: the intervention (+1 for intervention group and 1 for control group), students gender (+1 for male and 1 for female), level of parental education (z-scored), and all resulting two-way interactions as well as the three-way interaction between the intervention, students gender, and parental education.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that increased high-school STEM preparation would have positive long-term effects on posthigh-school STEM career pursuit; we therefore allowed mathematics and science ACT scores and mathematics and science course-taking in 11th and 12th grade to predict the posthigh-school outcomes, along with the base predictors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All variables measured at the same time point (e.g., high school) were allowed to correlate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the long-term effect of the intervention on posthigh-school STEM career pursuit, we examined the total indirect effect of the intervention on posthigh-school outcomes through high-school variables (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Missing data were accounted for by using full information maximum-likelihood methods (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was saturated, which does not allow for a meaningful test of model fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For additional information on the model and measures, SI Materials and Methods (Table S2 summarizes the significant direct and indirect effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the need to promote preparation and career pursuit in STEM domains in the United States (13), the goal of this project was to develop and test an intervention that engaged parents to encourage their children to take STEM courses in high school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We randomly assigned families to an intervention or control group, and intervention group parents received materials about the relevance of mathematics and science for their children and encouragement to discuss the relevance of these topics with their children during high school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports on this intervention found that it increased mathematics and science course-taking in high school (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current study followed up on those findings by examining the effect of the intervention on standardized test scores in high school as well as the long-term effects of increased high-school STEM preparation on STEM career pursuit after high school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the intervention improved performance on ACT mathematics and science test scores by 12 percentile points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a recursive process model whereby an initial improvement spurs on later positive outcomes (34), greater STEM preparation in high school was associated with increased STEM career pursuit after high school (i.e., STEM course-taking in college, STEM career aspirations, and perceived STEM value).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
These results suggest that students motivation is one key factor that can be leveraged to enhance STEM competence and career pursuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent research has shown that precise, theory-driven social-psychological interventions can have powerful and long-lasting effects on educational outcomes when applied directly with students in schools (16, 17, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study contributes to that body of knowledge by showing that parents are an additional resource that can be engaged to promote important student outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are also consistent with expectancy-value theory, which predicts that increasing the personal relevance of topics will increase motivation and achievement (13) and points to the important role of parents in helping children to develop their motivational beliefs (2527).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior research on parents utility-value beliefs and students outcomes is correlational, so this project shows that parents can play a causal role in improving students motivation by helping their children to find the utility and relevance in what they are learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current study underscores the value of parents as communicators of STEM information to their children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although parental involvement declines from elementary school to high school, it is still associated with academic success during the high-school years (40) and when it is the right type of involvement, such as emphasizing the personal relevance and importance of course material (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little research has examined the efficacy of interventions with parents or focused on investigating if there is a positive effect of providing parents with resources to help promote optimal types of parental involvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current study does just this by providing parents with information and strategies to spur effective communication with their adolescents about STEM topics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interventions directed at parents, in comparison with those directed at students, have many advantages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the intervention can change parents behavior over the long term, so that pro-STEM messages are reinforced over time (e.g., with multiple conversations between parents and children).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, student-centered classroom interventions are limited by the number of times that they are implemented in the classroom (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, a parent-centered intervention can lead to a more customized implementation (e.g., by allowing parents to decide how to best use intervention materials with their child) and allow for one-on-one conversations, whereas teacher-led interventions often require less individualized communication, given the logistics of the classroom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, one parent might know that their child reacts well to direct conversations, whereas another parent might know that their child does not learn well from direct conversations and prefers to explore information on their own.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, these interventions can capitalize on parents experiences and history with their children to facilitate personalizing the relevance of STEM topics by making connections to their childrens specific interests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these are strengths of parent-centered interventions, this does not guarantee that all parents will effectively communicate the information to their children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, other types of interventions (e.g., student-centered interventions) show great promise as well (17), and the most effective method to improve students educational outcomes likely involves careful intervention at multiple levels with students (e.g., parents, teachers, peers) to leverage all available resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, although we found that this intervention was equally effective for both high and low socioeconomic status (SES) families in our sample, we note that the intervention effect on ACT performance was equivalent to about 50% of the SES gap on mathematics and science test score performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the low enrollment rates of low SES groups in STEM courses (e.g., only 11.3% of low SES students enroll in precalculus or calculus compared with 39.6% of high SES students) (10) and general achievement gaps related to SES (42), parent-centered utility-value interventions might be one way to increase STEM course enrollment for underrepresented groups and reduce persistent achievement gaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, because STEM jobs are projected to grow in the future and often pay well (2, 3), interventions that increase representation of low SES groups in STEM fields might help to reduce persistent unemployment and income inequality gaps as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the current study showed initial evidence to support this type of parent-centered intervention in helping to address STEM pipeline problems, there are several limitations to this study that should be addressed in future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the sample in this study was recruited in Wisconsin and may not be representative of the overall population in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies have shown that utility-value interventions show similar effects for individuals from diverse racial and SES groups (20, 21), and two-generation interventions have been shown to be effective even in very low SES populations (43), but future studies are needed to test this type of parent-centered utility-value intervention in more diverse populations to show that the effects generalize to various racial and SES groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the families in this study had been part of an ongoing longitudinal study for many years, which might have increased the level of engagement that parents had with intervention materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that parents in the current study might have been more likely to use intervention materials than a newly recruited group of parents would be because the parents in this study were accustomed to participating in study activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies should take this into account and ensure that parents engage with intervention materials at high enough rates to see similar gains in students outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, although this study involved 181 families and 543 total participants, including parents and children in all of the families, future studies should examine these effects in larger samples to demonstrate the scalability of these results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility would involve working directly with school districts to engage parents in these activities with their children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, although we found a direct effect of the intervention on two indicators of STEM preparation (ACT scores and STEM course-taking), we did not find direct effects on posthigh-school STEM career pursuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we found an indirect pathway: the intervention improved high-school STEM preparation, which predicted subsequent STEM career pursuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One limitation of such indirect effects is that they are correlational; thus, a third variable could be responsible for this lasting effect instead of the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, an indirect effect is consistent with our contention that the intervention had lasting effects on important STEM outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An indirect effects analysis is powerful because it moves further down the causal chain by testing the more proximal effect of an initial mechanism (e.g., high-school STEM preparation) on the distal outcome (e.g., STEM career pursuit) (34, 37, 38, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, based on the findings from the current and previous utility-value intervention studies (16, 39), there is mounting evidence that promoting the relevance of STEM topics for students is an effective method for increasing students STEM achievement, career pursuit, and motivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these interventions are cost-effective to implement; for example, the parent-centered utility value intervention was comprised of two informational brochures and access to a website.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent recommendations from the US Congress and the Department of Education make no mention of this psychological perspective as a way to grow STEM education and alleviate the pipeline problem (45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, recommendations center on increasing the budget for STEM classes and resources from kindergarten through 12th grade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although increasing STEM-education funding will likely increase overall STEM preparation, the body of research on STEM motivation in generaland on utility-value interventions in particularhighlights the importance of targeting students psychological beliefs about STEM topics as one pathway to promote further STEM engagement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, findings from the current study emphasize the value of taking a psychological approach to the present STEM pipeline problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The participating families were originally recruited from the state of Wisconsin in 19901991 when mothers were pregnant with their children as part of a longitudinal study with various aims over the years (SI Materials and Methods for additional information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current sample included 181 families (543 participants including parents and children) with students who attended 108 different high schools, mostly remaining in the state of Wisconsin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participating students and parents provided written informed assent and consent approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of WisconsinMadison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were 100 students (47% female) in the control group, and 81 students (48% female) in the intervention group, and the racial breakdown of participants reflected the population of Wisconsin in general (90% White) (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Procedure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current study involved parents and students for a time period of 5 y, starting when the students were in 10th grade in high school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variables of interest included students 10th grade standardized state test scores (WKCE scores), students STEM course-taking during 11th and 12th grade of high school, students mathematics and science ACT scores, and students survey responses 5 y after the beginning of 10th grade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The posthigh-school survey assessed four self-reported outcome measures: STEM career aspirations, college STEM course-taking, desired college major, and perceived STEM value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Families were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group, and intervention group parents were sent intervention materials during 10th and 11th grade, whereas control group parents were sent no materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, parents in the intervention group received a brochure in the fall of 10th grade, another brochure in January of 11th grade, and access to a website in January of 11th grade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brochures and websites gave information about the utility of various STEM topics for adolescents, encouragement to communicate this information, and advice about how parents might most effectively communicate this information to their children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A previous report showed that 86% of the parents (either mother, father, or both) reported remembering and using the intervention materials, and 75% of the adolescents confirmed exposure to the intervention materials from their parents, demonstrating a high degree of overall engagement with the intervention (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Materials and Methods for further details on intervention materials and measures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The families who participated in this randomized controlled trial (32) have also participated in a larger, longitudinal study since 19901991 (Wisconsin Study of Families and Work; for recruitment details, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Median household income at the time of recruitment was $50,000; in 1991, the median income of married couple families in the United States with the wife in the paid labor force was $48,169 (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our sample matches the national figure well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average years of parents education was 15.42 y (SD = 1.92) on a scale where 12 y was equivalent to high-school graduation or GED completion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The racial breakdown of the students reflected the state in which the sample was recruited: 90% were White (not of Hispanic origin), 2% were African American, 1% were Native American, and 7% were biracial or multiracial (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The original sample for the current study had 188 families in 108 different high schools, but seven students and their parents were dropped from analyses because we did not receive a high-school transcript for them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lack of transcript occurred for a variety of reasons, including a lack of consent and homeschooling (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collection of the transcript did not vary by condition or gender.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Intervention_Materials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The intervention consisted of sending intervention group parents two brochures in the mail and also giving them access to a password-protected website.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first set of intervention materials consisted of a single brochure entitled, Making Connections: Helping Your Teen Find Value in School, sent to both parents when the students were in 10th grade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because prior research had shown that many parents did not know why common topics in mathematics and science could be useful or relevant (30), this brochure contained information and examples about the usefulness of STEM topics in their childs life (e.g., calculating sales prices when shopping, mathematics courses in high school as necessary for a variety of college majors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also encouraged parents to discuss these topics with their child and provided them with strategies and advice about how to communicate this information most effectively with their child.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advice centered on involving children in generating personally relevant examples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A second set of intervention materials was sent in 11th grade to both parents individually and included a second brochure entitled, Making Connections: Helping Your Teen with the Choices Ahead, as well as access to a password-protected website entitled Choices Ahead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This brochure gave additional examples of how STEM topics were relevant in everyday life and also included a greater focus on how STEM topics were important for a variety of careers and majors in college.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were also additional tips and encouragement given to parents about the ways in which they could communicate this information effectively to their child.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, there were three overarching sections in this brochure: (i) information on specific occupations in mathematics, physics, biology, and chemistry, as well as how individuals in these fields used mathematics and science in their everyday activities; (ii) separate sections on the relevance of STEM topics for everyday activities, adult life more generally, and college and career planning in particular; and (iii) information on ways to overcome challenges in communicating this information to the child (e.g., parents were asked to first find connections with mathematics and science in their own lives and then help their child discover examples specific to their lives).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The website contained extensive information related to the relevance of mathematics and science for college and career planning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also offered parents the opportunity to send specific links from the website to their students via email.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The information on the website was broken up into four sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precollege planning section included specific pages for both the parent and student, and each page provided links and information on websites where students could find more career and college planning information (e.g., a link to a website that focused on finding the right college, a link to a website that allowed one to search a database of potential careers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next section included information on the preparation needed to obtain a career in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics, with more clickable links specific to those fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third section provided parents and students with career information on four career domains in particular: biology and chemistry, healthcare (medicine, nursing, and veterinary), physics and engineering, and mathematics and architecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the last section included more information on mathematics and science in ones everyday life as well as testimonials from students at University of WisconsinMadison detailing how their mathematics and science preparation in high school has been important for their college trajectories (e.g., Although I did not particularly care for math or science in high school, once I got to college, I was so glad that I opted to take advanced level courses in each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I didnt realize at the time how much a strong background in math and science would help me with the required courses for my major, like zoology and statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Math and science classes werent the most interesting to me, but they very well may have been the most useful, and I probably would have struggled through many college courses had I decided only to take the minimum level of math and science required for graduation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Students transcripts were collected after graduation, as previously reported (32), and we also collected students WKCE and ACT scores from school records for the current study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another set of measures was collected through a survey given during the summer 2 y after students senior years of high school.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of missing data for the variables described below did not significantly differ by experimental condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Variance_Explained_in_Main_Structural_Equation_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The main model of interest in the paper (all predictors included and allowed to predict all subsequent variables in the model) accounted for 9.1% of the variance for 11th and 12th grade mathematics and science course-taking, 25.0% of mathematics and science ACT score, 9.0% of students college STEM value, 31.9% of college STEM course-taking, 13.5% of STEM career aspirations, and 11.3% of college STEM major choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Regression_Analyses_on_ACT_Scores  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We conducted two additional regressions to address concerns about randomization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first regression, we tested whether the intervention affected mathematics and science ACT score, as we do in the main model in the paper, which involved regressing mathematics and science ACT score on the seven base predictors (intervention, students gender, parents education level, and the interactions between those variables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the next regression, we ran the same model on the same dependent variable, but we included students preintervention mathematics and science test score measure in the analysis, which controlled for preintervention competence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When controlling for prior performance, there was a significant effect of the intervention on mathematics and science ACT score (z = 3.61,  = 0.20, P less_than 0.001), consistent with the analysis without controlling for prior performance (z = 2.45,  = 0.19, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full results from these two regressions are reported in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these analyses, the intervention has a consistent and significant positive effect on students mathematics and science ACT scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Supplemental_Structural_Equation_Model__Including_Perceived_Parental_STEM_Support  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For this analysis, we estimated an identical model to the model described in the main text, except that we also included perceived parental STEM support as a posthigh-school outcome along with perceived STEM value, college STEM course-taking, STEM career aspirations, and college STEM major.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purpose of this analysis was to examine whether the intervention had a long-term effect on students perceptions of the amount of encouragement and support they had from their parents to pursue STEM careers, even years after the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brief, theory-based interventions are hypothesized to work via recursive processes, whereby a change in attitude helps to change behavior, which in turn supports the initial change in attitude (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we are able to test for part of this recursive process by examining the long-term effect of the intervention on students perceptions of how supportive and encouraging their parents are about STEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the important roles that parents perceived attitudes have in students motivation (27, 33), it is useful to know if this parent-delivered intervention affected students long-term perceptions of their parents attitudes in addition to their own STEM attitudes and behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, although this was not a primary dependent variable of interest, it does speak to how a parent-centered intervention might have lasting effects on how students feel supported by their parents in STEM domains long after the initial interactions that were encouraged by the intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As with the primary model, this model is saturated, so there are not interpretable indices of model fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All significant effects from the model reported in the main text remained significant in this supplemental model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New tests showed that mathematics and science ACT score was a significant predictor of perceived parental STEM support (z = 3.47,  = 0.38, P less_than 0.001), such that students with higher mathematics and science ACT scores reported greater levels of perceived parental STEM support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, there was a significant indirect effect of the intervention on perceived parental STEM support through high-school STEM course-taking and ACT scores (z = 2.13, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all, the model explained 16.4% of the variance in perceived parental STEM support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this finding supports the recursive process theory of psychological interventions by demonstrating that the intervention affected perceptions of parental STEM support 5 y after the intervention through effects on high-school STEM course-taking and ACT scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
