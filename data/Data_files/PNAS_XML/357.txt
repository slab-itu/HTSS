Pubertal activation of estrogen receptor  in the medial amygdala is essential for the full expression of male social behavior in mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Testosterone stimulation during the pubertal period is necessary for the full expression of male-type social behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not known whether estrogen receptor (ER)  may be involved in pubertal organizational action of testosterone on the regulation of male-type social behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we showed that the prepubertal knockdown of ER in the medial amygdala (MeA) of gonadally intact male mice reduced both sexual and aggressive behaviors as well as the number of MeA neurons later in adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that not only aromatization but also ER expression in the MeA during the pubertal period is required for organizational action of testosterone to fully masculinize neural circuitry responsible for the expression of male-type social behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Testosterone plays a central role in the facilitation of male-type social behaviors, such as sexual and aggressive behaviors, and the development of their neural bases in male mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The action of testosterone via estrogen receptor (ER) , after being aromatized to estradiol, has been suggested to be crucial for the full expression of these behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously reported that silencing of ER in adult male mice with the use of a virally mediated RNAi method in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) greatly reduced sexual behaviors without affecting aggressive behaviors whereas that in the medial amygdala (MeA) had no effect on either behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well accepted that testosterone stimulation during the pubertal period is necessary for the full expression of male-type social behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is still not known whether, and in which brain region, ER is involved in this developmental effect of testosterone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we knocked down ER in the MeA or MPOA in gonadally intact male mice at the age of 21 d and examined its effects on the sexual and aggressive behaviors later in adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the prepubertal knockdown of ER in the MeA reduced both sexual and aggressive behaviors whereas that in the MPOA reduced only sexual, but not aggressive, behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the number of MeA neurons was reduced by prepubertal knockdown of ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that ER activation in the MeA during the pubertal period is crucial for male mice to fully express their male-type social behaviors in adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Experiment_2__Effects_of_the_Site-Specific_Knockdown_of_ER_During_the_Prepubertal_Period_on_the_Morphological_Development_of_the_MeA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Prepubertal knockdown of ER in the MeA caused a significant reduction in the number of neuronal cells within the region examined (see Fig S4 A and B) in adulthood [t(9) = 2.986, P less_than 0.05] (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the neuronal cell number, there was no difference in the volume of the MeA between MeA-ERKD mice and MeA-control mice [t(9) = 1.591, N.S.]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the uninjected reference groups used for examination of sex differences of the MeA morphology, both number of neurons [t(6) = 5.794, P less_than 0.01] (Fig 4A) and the regional volume [t(6) = 3.446, P less_than 0.05] (Fig 4B) were significantly greater in gonadally intact males compared with gonadally intact females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study aimed to investigate the involvement of ER and its site specificity in the pubertal organizational action of gonadal steroids on the regulation of male-type social behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of puberty in rodents is known to be around postnatal day (PND) 28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In male mice, testosterone production in testis begins to rise around PND 28, and plasma concentration also starts to rise around PND 30 (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our pilot experiment, we observed the uptake of vectors by 90% of neuronal cells at as early as the fifth day after injection (Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed that a 5-d interval was sufficient for the AAV-shER to almost completely silence the expression of ER in the target area after AAV injection on PND 21 (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is assumed that ER must have been absent in the targeted area well before the mice used in the present study reached the age of puberty onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In experiment 1, we found that prepubertal ER knockdown in the MeA greatly reduced both sexual and aggressive behavior in male mice tested in adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that AAV-shER used in this study irreversibly knocked down ER expression in transfected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we have previously shown that site-specific injection of AAV-shER in the MeA at 16 wk of age (well after the end of the pubertal period) did not affect the expression of sexual or aggressive behaviors in male mice (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, behavioral alterations found in the present study must be due to the lack of ER activation by testosterone in the MeA during the pubertal period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that all mice were tested as gonadally intact in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is expected that endogenous testosterone action via ARs was intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, testosterone action via ER and ER, after being aromatized to estradiol, was not disrupted except that through ER in the target region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, prepubertal, but not postpubertal, ER knockdown in the MeA greatly altered both sexual and aggressive behaviors in adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These facts indicate that the ER in the MeA is crucial for the pubertal organizational action of testosterone on male-type social behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It may be argued that the behavioral alteration may simply be due to reduced levels of testosterone at the time of testing, potentially caused by prepubertal ER knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility cannot be completely ruled out because we did not measure circulating levels of gonadal steroids at the time of behavioral tests in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this possibility seems less likely because previous studies have reported that adult ERKO male mice have rather elevated levels of testosterone (28, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it is necessary to investigate whether similar behavioral effects of prepubertal ER knockdown may be observed in mice gonadectomized and treated with a fixed amount of testosterone before behavioral testing in adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, prepubertal knockdown of ER in the MeA may have affected onset of puberty itself, including timing and/or magnitude of pubertal testosterone rise, and may have caused behavioral alterations found in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possibility, which further suggests the importance of ER in the MeA for the regulation of puberty onset, needs to be addressed in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to the findings in the MeA, the effect of ER silencing in the MPOA before the onset of puberty did not differ from that induced by AAV-shER injection in adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous study, knocking down of ER in the MPOA at 16 wk of age greatly reduced the expression of male sexual, but not aggressive, behaviors (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that ER activation in MPOA neuronal cells at the time of testing in adults is necessary for induction of sexual behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we could not determine whether ER stimulation during the pubertal period may also be necessary for the full masculinization of male sexual behavior because prepubertal injection of AAV-shER permanently blocked ER gene expression in the MPOA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this possibility still needs to be probed using different techniques in a future study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, as for aggressive behavior, we found that lack of ER in the MPOA even before the onset of puberty did not affect the expression of this behavior in adult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is concluded that ER gene expression in the MPOA is not involved in the regulation of male aggressive behaviors by aromatized testosterone in terms of both pubertal organizational action and activational action in adult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains to be determined in future studies whether and how ER in the MPOA may be responsible for perinatal organizational action of testosterone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In our previous study investigating the effects of site-specific ER knockdown in adults, we found that activation of ER in the VMN at the time of testing is necessary for the induction of both sexual and aggressive behaviors in male mice (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lee et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (30) have also shown that ER-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of the VMN regulate the expression of various social behaviors, including both sexual and aggressive behavior in the activity level-dependent manner in adult male mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reports together clearly suggest the significant contribution of ER in the VNM for the facilitation of male social behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether ER stimulation during the pubertal period may also be necessary for the full masculinization of male sexual and aggressive behaviors remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differential effects of prepubertal ER knockdown in the MeA and MPOA suggest that the role of ER for masculinization of neural circuitry for male social behaviors through organizational action of gonadal steroids is site-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further characterize the effects of prepubertal ER knockdown in the MeA at neuroanatomical levels, we performed thorough analysis of MeA cells (experiment 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the number of neuronal cells was reduced in the MeA-ERKD group compared with the MeA-control group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar difference was also observed between males and females analyzed as a reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that MeA undergoes structural changes during the pubertal period in a sex-specific manner that leads to sexually dimorphic adult phenotypes in various species (24, 25, 31, 32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In gonadally intact rats, it is reported that a greater number of neuronal cells were proliferated in the MeA during the pubertal period in males compared with females and that these sexual differences were eliminated by prepubertal gonadectomy (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, gonadectomy in adulthood did not affect the number of neuronal cells in the MeA of male rats (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the number of neuronal cells in the MeA undergoes irreversible change during the pubertal period in a gonadal steroid-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings showing a reduced number of MeA neurons in the MeA-ERKD group suggest that the presence of ER is required for testosterone to masculinize the neuronal number in the MeA during the pubertal period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of the MeA in the regulation of male-type social behaviors has been demonstrated in numerous studies (1318).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, the MeA plays a significant role in chemosensory information processing (15, 16, 33, 34) as part of the social behavior network in the CNS (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It relays socially meaningful signals to activate or inhibit various downstream brain sites, such as the MPOA, anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), and VMN, that are more directly involved in the execution of male sexual and aggressive behaviors (14, 3640).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, incomplete masculinization of the MeA may cause an improper functioning of the neural circuitry for the expression of male-type social behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Testosterone and/or estradiol are involved in development of sexually dimorphic brain morphology by promoting cell proliferation, differentiation, or survival, or by inducing apoptosis in a sex-specific manner in certain brain regions (4145).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the exact mechanisms of ER-mediated action of testosterone for full masculinization of the MeA structure and function during the pubertal period still remain unknown and need to be elucidated in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it is our great interest to identify the profile of the lost neuronal population(s) that might be responsible for the disruption of sexual and aggressive behaviors by prepubertal knockdown of ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optogenetic stimulation of the GABAergic neuronal population in the posterodorsal region of the MeA has been shown to promote sexual and aggressive behaviors in a scalable manner in male mice (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another study with pharmacogenomical manipulations has reported that aromatase-expressing neurons in the sexually dimorphic posterodorsal region of the MeA are necessary for both male and female mice to express their sex-specific forms of aggression whereas they do not seem to be crucial for the expression of sexual behaviors (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies determining the identity of the lost neuronal population(s) in MeA-ERKD mice will provide further insight into the mechanisms of how exactly the function of the MeA is organized in a sex-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, our results clearly demonstrated that the absence of ER only in the MeA (while all of the other physiological conditions are kept intact) dramatically alters brain development and expression of male social behaviors in adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this study is the first study indicating that not only aromatization of testosterone but also ER expression in the MeA during the pubertal period is absolutely necessary for testosterone to fully organize/masculinize neural circuitry governing male-type social behaviors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, considering that the amygdala is a major region responsible for sex differences in socio-emotional states that become more prominent after the onset of puberty, our findings offer insights for better understating of the neuroendocrine basis of gender-specific neurobehavioral development in human adolescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Subjects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult ICR/Jcl male and female mice were purchased from a commercial breeder (CLEA) and mated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When females became visibly pregnant, they were housed individually in plastic cages (29 × 19 × 12 cm) with cotton nesting material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then monitored for parturition once a day at the end of the light phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The day of parturition was defined as postnatal day (PND) 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On PND 21, male offspring were weaned and used for the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mice were housed at constant temperature (23 ± 2 °C) with a 12:12-h light/dark cycle (lights off at 1200).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Food and water were provided ad libitum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Stereotaxic_Surgery  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) and then placed in a stereotaxic frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 5-L Hamilton syringe was aimed at either the MeA [anteroposterior (AP) 1.25, mediolateral (ML) ± 2.2, dorsoventral (DV) 5.15] or MPOA (AP +0.02, ML ±0.5, DV 5.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These coordinates were determined based on The Mouse Brain Stereotaxic Coordinates (47) with an adjustment for brain size on PND 21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mouse was given bilateral injection of 1 µL of either AAV-shER or AAV-shLUC (1012 packaged genomic particles, 0.5 L per hemisphere) using a micropump injector (World Precision Instruments Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injection lasted 5 min, and the needle was left in place for an additional 5 min after the end of infusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After surgery, all mice were group housed with their littermates (45 mice per cage) until further use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sexual_Behavior_Test  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each male mouse was tested in its home cage for sexual behavior against a group-housed, ovariectomized ICR/Jcl female mouse biweekly for a total of three trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The duration of each trial was 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All female stimuli were hormonally primed with s.c. injections of estradiol benzoate dissolved in sesame oil (10 g/0.1 mL) at 48 and 24 h before testing and progesterone dissolved in sesame oil (500 g/0.1 mL) 46 h before testing to ensure high sexual receptivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each male encountered a different receptive female mouse for each trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of attempted mounts, mounts, intromissions, and ejaculations was scored for each mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because no male mice exhibited ejaculation in any group, no further statistical analysis was performed on ejaculatory behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Aggressive_Behavior_Test  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Aggressive behavior of experimental mice toward an intruder male mouse was assessed biweekly in a residentintruder paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each week, mice were tested on three consecutive days for a total of nine trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mouse was tested in its home cage against a gonadally intact, group-housed (four mice per cage), olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) ICR/Jcl male intruder mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of aggressive behaviors in mice is highly dependent on olfactory cues, and OBX male mice rarely show aggression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, testing experimental mice against OBX intruder mice allowed us to observe offensive aggressive responses from the resident mouse that were not influenced by any experience of defeat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that our focus in the present study was on observing offensive aggressive responses although aggressive behavior has been known to consist of offensive and defensive response components (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The duration of each trial was 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mouse encountered a different intruder mouse in each of the nine trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Duration and number of aggressive bouts were scored for each experimental mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data from three trials performed each week were averaged for each mouse and used for statistical analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An aggressive behavior bout was defined as a set of behavioral interactions including at least one of the following behavioral acts: chasing, boxing, wrestling, tail rattling, biting, and offensive lateral attack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the interval between two aggressive bouts did not exceed 3 s, the two bouts were considered continuous and scored as one bout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Brain_Tissue_Preparation_for_Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All mice were deeply anesthetized with a solution of 1:1 mixture of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg) and heparin (1,000 units/kg) and transcardially perfused with 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.2, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate-buffer (PB), pH 7.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brains were removed and postfixed overnight at 4 °C in 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were then rinsed with 0.1 M PB and cryoprotected in 0.1 M PB containing 30% sucrose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the completion of tissue processing, free-floating coronal sections of brain (30-m thickness) split into four series were prepared on a freezing microtome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ER_Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sections were incubated in a rinse buffer, TBS-X (0.05 M Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and 0.2% Triton X-100), containing 1% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity, and then blocked in an incubation buffer (3% skim milk and 3% BSA in TBS-X) for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were incubated in a rabbit polyclonal anti-ER antiserum (C1355, 1:25,000; 48 h; Upstate) dissolved in the incubation buffer for 48 h at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then treated with a 1:250 dilution of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) in the incubation buffer for 2 h at room temperature, followed by 1-h incubation with avidinbiotin complex (Vectastain ABC Elite kit; Vector Laboratories) in TBS to amplify the staining intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the completion of antiserum reaction procedures, sections were visualized with 0.02% diaminobenzidine, 0.15% nickel ammonium sulfate, and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide in TBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ER_and_GFP_Double-Label_Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sections were incubated in a rinse buffer, PBS-X (0.05 M Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Triton X-100), containing 0.6% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity, and then blocked in an incubation buffer (5% normal goat serum in PBS-X) for 1 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were incubated in buffer containing either a rabbit polyclonal anti-ER antiserum (C1355, 1:10,000; 48 h; Upstate) at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then treated with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (K4003; DAKO) for 30 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the completion of antiserum reaction procedures, sections were visualized with DAB (Liquid DAB+ Substrate Chromogen System, K3468; DAKO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the visualization of ER, antigens were retrieved from sections using 0.1 M glycine-HCl buffer solution (pH 2.2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then incubated in PBS-X containing 0.6% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were incubated in buffer containing either a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum [ab290, 1:30,000; overnight (o/n); Abcam] at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then treated with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (K4003; DAKO) for 30 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the completion of antiserum reaction procedures, sections were visualized with a VECTOR SG Peroxidase (HRP) Substrate Kit (SK-4700; Vector).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air-dried, and dehydrated through an ascending alcohol series, which were cleared with xylene, and coverslipped with Permount (Fisher Scientific).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To verify the specificity of immunohistochemical procedures, we included negative controls that the primary antiserums (ER or GFP) were omitted from the staining procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these conditions, neither cells nor fibers were stained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all experiments, only the mice who showed a spread of GFP-immunopositive cells in the targeted area were used for statistical analysis of anatomical and/or behavioral data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

ER-Immunopositive_Cell_Count  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Eight MeA sections (Bregma 1.10 to 1.94) and nine MPOA sections (Bregma 0.38 to 0.58) were analyzed for number and distribution of ER-immunopositive cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each brain area was photographed at 40× magnification with a digital camera mounted on an Olympus microscope (BX61; Olympus), and ER-immunopositive cells were bilaterally counted using the Adobe Photoshop Creative Suite software (Adobe Systems Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that ER knockdown was limited within the targeted area, ER-immunopositive cells in adjacent regions, such as the basomedial amygdala (BMA) for the MeA groups and the ventral portion of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) for the MPOA groups were also counted bilaterally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Stereological_Analysis_of_the_MeA  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The MeA was observed on a PC monitor with the aid of a CCD camera connected to a light microscope (DM5000B; Leica Microsystems), and the total number of neuronal cells in the MeA and the regional volume of the MeA was estimated bilaterally with the aid of Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience, Inc.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight sections (30-µm thickness, 90-µm intervals) containing the MeA (Fig S4A) (Bregma 1.10 to 1.94 according to The Mouse Brain Stereotaxic Coordinates (47) were analyzed in each mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To measure the MeA neuronal cell number and volume, the optical fractionator method in accordance with the system workflow of the Stereo Investigator (MBF Bioscience, Inc.) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outlines of the MeA were determined on digital images to define the region for cell counts and calculate the estimated volume of the MeA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The counting frame size (40 × 40 µm), the grid size for arrangement of the counting frame size (120 × 120 µm), the highest optical dissector setting (1012 µm), and the highest top guard zone setting (2 µm) were set first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuronal cells within the counting frames were then counted manually, by an experimenter not aware of the treatment of the sample, to estimate the total numbers of neuronal cells in the MeA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuronal cells were defined as those containing blue or purple colored rough endoplasmic reticulum (Nissl bodies) in the cytoplasm and having an oval or spherical nucleus with a blue or purple colored nucleolus (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Additional_Procedure_for_Fig_S5  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A total of eight mice were unilaterally injected with AAV-shER in the right or left hemisphere of the MPOA on PND 21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time point of 4 h (PND 21, n = 2), 5 d (PND 26, n = 2), 10 d (PND 31, n = 2), or 15 d (PND 36, n = 2) after the injection, they were transcardially perfused, and brain tissues were processed for NeuN and GFP double-label fluorescent immunohistochemistry or single-label immunohistochemistry for GFP or ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Sections were incubated in a rinse buffer, TBS-X (0.05 M Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and 0.2% Triton X-100), containing 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity, and then blocked in an incubation buffer (3% skim milk and 3% BSA in TBS-X) for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were incubated in buffer containing a rabbit polyclonal anti-NeuN antiserum (ab104224, 1:5,000; 48 h; Abcam) at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then treated with a 1:400 dilution of donkey anti-rabbit IgG Alexa 594 (Invitrogen) in the incubation buffer for 4 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the visualization of NeuN, sections were incubated in buffer containing a goat polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum (ab6673, 1:3,000; o/n; Abcam) at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then treated with a 1:400 dilution of donkey anti-goat IgG Alexa 488 (Invitrogen) in the incubation buffer for 4 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify the specificity of immunohistochemical procedures, we included negative controls that the primary antiserums (GFP or NeuN) were omitted from the staining procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

GFP_Single-Label_Immunohistochemistry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sections were incubated in a rinse buffer, TBS-X (0.05 M Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and 0.2% Triton X-100), containing 1% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity, and then blocked in an incubation buffer (3% skim milk and 3% BSA in TBS-X) for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were incubated in buffer containing a goat polyclonal anti-GFP antiserum (ab6673, 1:5,000; o/n; Abcam) at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections were then treated with a 1:250 dilution of biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) in the incubation buffer for 2 h at room temperature, followed by a 1-h incubation with avidinbiotin complex (Vectastain ABC Elite kit; Vector Laboratories) in TBS to amplify the staining intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the completion of antiserum reaction procedures, sections were visualized with 0.02% diaminobenzidine, 0.15% nickel ammonium sulfate, and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide in TBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify the specificity of immunohistochemical procedures, we included negative controls that the primary antiserums (GFP) were omitted from the staining procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
