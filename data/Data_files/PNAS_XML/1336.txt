title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Species diversity concurrently dilutes and amplifies transmission in a zoonotic hostpathogen system through competing mechanisms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There has been an impassioned debate in recent years about whether biodiversity is negatively or positively correlated to wildlife and zoonotic disease transmission and risk, suggesting a dilution or amplification effect, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate for an important zoonotic disease (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) that species diversity can act differently on competing drivers of disease transmission (host density, contact rates, transmissibility) and may cause increases and decreases in transmission, concurrently in the same hostpathogen system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net effect (dilution, amplification, or no effect) is determined by the strength of the competing mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to move forward, researchers should focus on how biodiversity affects individual mechanisms separately and their net effects if we want to make generalizable predictions across systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this era of unprecedented biodiversity loss and increased zoonotic disease emergence, it is imperative to understand the effects of biodiversity on zoonotic pathogen dynamics in wildlife.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether increasing biodiversity should lead to a decrease or increase in infection prevalence, termed the dilution and amplification effects, respectively, has been hotly debated in disease ecology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sin Nombre hantavirus, which has an 35% mortality rate when it spills over into humans, occurs at a lower prevalence in the reservoir host, the North American deermouse, in areas with higher small mammal diversitya dilution effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanism driving this relationship is not understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics and a unique long-term, high-resolution, multisite dataset, it appears that the observed dilution effect is a result of increasing small-mammal diversity leading to decreased deermouse population density and, subsequently, prevalence (a result of density-dependent transmission).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, once density is taken into account, there is an increase in the transmission rate at sites with higher diversitya component amplification effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, dilution and amplification are occurring at the same time in the same hostpathogen system; there is a component amplification effect (increase in transmission rate), but overall a net dilution because the effect of diversity on reservoir host population density is stronger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest we should focus on how biodiversity affects individual mechanisms that drive prevalence and their relative strengths if we want to make generalizable predictions across hostpathogen systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Study_Sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyze data from small mammal capturemarkrecapture SNV studies in Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data span June 1994 through 2015, with sites trapped an average of 79 mo (range 3 to 179).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Table S1 summarizes data from all 40 sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied our model to sites in which there was an average of 2 deermice/hectare, 4% SNV prevalence, and 12 mo of data (18 sites, Table 1); because our model is dynamical and prevalence depends on previous population density, we excluded sites with too few data points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Montana, 10-by-10 trap grids contained 100 Sherman (8 × 9 × 23 cm; H.B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sherman Trap Company) live-capture traps at 10-m intervals covering 1 ha.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23 for details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grids were trapped monthly as weather allowed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the SW (Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico), trapping webs were used rather than grids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each web covered 3.14 ha and contained 12 100-m transects radiating from a central point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each web contained 148 Sherman traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Webs in Arizona and New Mexico were trapped monthly and in Colorado every 6 wk, as weather allowed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Appendix, Table S1 for details about frequency and duration of trapping at sites, deermouse population densities, SNV prevalence, and small mammal diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24 for more details of sites and protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Trapping protocols were similar across sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a rule, researchers trapped for three consecutive nights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traps were set in the evenings baited with peanut butter and oats, cracked corn, or mixed grain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cotton or polyester fiberfill was added for nest material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traps were checked in the mornings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Captured small mammals were anesthetized, ear-tagged, weighed, and a blood sample taken to test for SNV antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because SNV is a chronic infection in deermice, antibodies are an appropriate indicator of current infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serologic testing was conducted at CDC, Atlanta; the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services; Montana State University; or Montana Tech using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgG antibody to SNV (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We analyze each web/grid separately because often they were trapped for differing lengths and were sufficiently distant from one another that many of the grids community dynamics were not significantly correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we group Montana and SW sites separately because of the different trapping structure and minor differences in data collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparing data across Montana and the SW, we normalize density to 1 ha.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Deermouse population dynamics are highly variable over time and strongly tied to local environmental conditions (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have developed a mechanistic mathematical model of SNV in deermice that allows for the environmental carrying capacity and population density to vary over time (essential in this highly variable, bottomup system) (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a version of our model, which is a type of SIR compartmental model; SNV is a chronic, probably life-long infection in deermice, and thus, there is no R class.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model includes logistic growth, where the host population experiences density dependence partitioned across birth and death rates and determined by a time-varying carrying capacity, Kt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying model isdSdt=NbarNKtSd+(1a)rNKtSIdIdt=SII+d+(1a)rNKt+,[1]where S is the density of susceptible individuals, I is the density of infected individuals, and N=S+I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [This is our published model (22), except without age structure, which did not significantly impact dynamics.]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  b is the maximum birth rate (in absence of density dependence; i.e., when N=0), d is the minimum death rate, and a is the proportion of density dependence due to density dependence in birth rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a=0, birth rates are density independent, and all of the density dependence is on the death rates; if a=1, all of the density dependence is on the birth rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  r is bd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is the disease-induced mortality rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is the transmission rate, and  is the immigration rate of infected individuals (see SI Appendix, Fig S1 for life-cycle diagram).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This is the underlying model we use; however, for the purposes of our analysesto understand the importance of deermouse population density in driving dynamicswe are interested in predicting I assuming we know the population density, N. Therefore, we only need to model I, since S=NI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previously, we estimated parameters for study sites in Montana (22, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we assume that the disease-induced mortality rate (), maximum birth rate (b), minimum death rate (d), and how density dependence is partitioned (a) are the same across all sites [b=0.315, d=3.66*105, a=0.614, and =0.085 (22)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the environmental carrying capacity (Kt) and therefore the realized birth and death rates vary across sites and over time at the same site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantities that vary across sites include the inputs for the model: N, Kt, and initial infected deermouse density (I0), all taken from the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parameters, transmission rate () and infected immigration rate (), are estimated using maximum likelihood for each site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Parameter_Estimation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously found that setting Kt to a smoothed spline of the deermouse population density 3 mo ahead approximated the time-varying carrying capacity (density lags behind carrying capacity by 3 mo) (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approximation, the model-predicted deermouse population dynamics matched observed deermouse population density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Needing future deermouse density to predict current infection levels makes this implementation of the model less useful for prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our goal is to understand what processes are leading to the observed dynamics, not prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an index of relative population density, we use minimum number known alive (MNA) (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly for relative density of infected individuals, we use minimum number known infected (MNI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See SI Appendix for justification of this index and comparisons with robust design population estimates that account for probability of detection using Program Mark.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimate a transmission rate () and infected immigration rate () for each site separately using trajectory matching (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we numerically minimize the negative log likelihood between the vector of model-predicted density of infected mice and the vector of observed MNI using the NelderMead algorithm implemented in the optim function in R, assuming Poisson errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only inputs are initial I (set to that observed in the data) and Nt and Kt (both smoothed splines from the data to accommodate the continuous-time framework).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then compare the estimated transmission rate () for each site to the average small mammal diversity for that site, using Simpsons diversity index, D=1/i=1Rpi2, where pi is the proportional abundance of species, i, and R is the small mammal species richnessthat is, total number of small mammal species trapped at that site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also compare results to the ShannonWeiner index and species richness (see SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
See SI Appendix for data and R code.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We observe a dilution effecta decrease in average SNV prevalence in deermice with increased average small mammal diversityin the SW (P = 0.002, R2 = 0.64; Fig 3A) but not in Montana (P = 0.60; Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our dynamical epidemiological (SI Appendix) model, which simulates infection based on deermouse density, fits both Montana and SW sites well (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S2 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once density is taken into account using the model, the estimated transmission rate () is significantly correlated to diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is in the opposite direction to what is predicted if the dilution effect is driven by host contact rates or transmissibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is a positive relationship between diversity and transmission ratea component amplification effect (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An increase in small mammal diversity is associated with a decrease in deermouse density in the SW (Fig 3C) and decrease in transmission and prevalencethe dilution effect (Fig 3A; as described in Fig 1, dark blue pathway).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in Montana, increased small mammal diversity does not lead to decreased deermouse density (Fig 3D), and there is not a dilution effect (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, overall small mammal diversity in Montana is lower than in the SW (see x axis for Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is not a significant dilution effect in Montana (because the relationship between diversity and deermouse density is not the same as in the SW), the relationship between transmission rate () and diversity is similar across SW and Montana sites (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are robust to different diversity measures (see SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study brings together dynamical ecological models with high-resolution, long-term data, spanning more than 20 y of data collection at 18 sites with different small mammal community composition and deermouse host population dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model accurately predicts infection dynamics over time at these disparate sites (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S2 and S3), given only deermouse population density and the initial number of infected individuals, and estimating a transmission rate () and infected immigration rate () for each site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these data and models, we can explore hypotheses about how small mammal diversity affects SNV transmission and disease risk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At our SW study sites, we observe a dilution effectsites with higher small mammal diversity had decreased prevalence of infection (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not observe a dilution effect at our Montana sites (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given the SIR framework, the dilution effect in the SW must be driven by increased species diversity leading to (i) decreased host population density or (ii) a decrease in the transmission rate, which includes contact rates between deermice and transmissibility (Fig 1, blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If population density (mechanism 1) drove the dilution effect, our model, which predicts infection given host density, should predict the dynamics well, and the transmission rate () should not be negatively correlated to diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If transmission rate (mechanism 2) drove the dilution effect, our model should predict the dynamics, and each sites estimated transmission rate should be negatively correlated to its diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found support for mechanism 1that deermouse population density drives the dilution effect in the SW. Our model fits the dynamics at disparate sites (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2), and the transmission rate is not negatively correlated to diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, it is positively correlated to small mammal species diversity (R2 = 0.83, P less_than 0.001; Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that density causes the observed dilution effect (dark blue, Fig 1) but that there is an additional component amplification effect through changes in transmission rate (dark red, Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, aspects of both dilution and amplification are occurring at the same time in the same system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For models with density-dependent transmission, the transmission rate () gives the rate of transition from susceptible to infected for a given host density; as density increases, overall transmission increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our finding of increased transmission rates with increased diversity means that for a given host density, transmission occurs at a faster rate in more diverse communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, density is a stronger driver of infection dynamics in this system, and since increased diversity leads to lower host density in the SW, there is a net dilution effect in the SW (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Montana, increased diversity does not lead to a decrease in host density, and there is not a significant dilution effect (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dilution effect has been demonstrated for hantaviruses, including SNV in Portland, OR (19) and Utah (20, 31); Puumala virus in bank voles in Finland (32); and hantaviruses (Choclo and Calabazo viruses) in their hosts in Panama (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanism driving the dilution effect has not been fully elucidated for any of these systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The studies in Finland and Panama reported that increased diversity led to decreased host density and prevalence (32, 33), suggesting density-dependent transmission and host density as a potential mechanism for the observed dilution effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither transmission rate nor its components, contact rates, or transmissibility were measured in these studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the authors of the Portland and Utah studies discounted density as the mechanism for their observed dilution effect, because they did not see a positive (concurrent) relationship between deermouse density and SNV prevalence and concluded that, therefore, transmission was not density-dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both studies noted a significant negative relationship between small mammal diversity and deermouse density (19, 20, 31, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clay et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (34) found a negative association between intraspecific contact rate and species diversity; however, the relationship may have been largely driven by one outlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent experimental study using enclosures and controlling for density showed no change in intraspecific deermouse contacts as small mammal diversity increased (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For deermouse population density to drive the dilution effect for SNV, there would need to be density-dependent transmission, which should lead to an observed positive relationship between deermouse density and SNV prevalence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Field studies have found mixed results, only rarely showing a concurrent positive relationship (36), and often showing either no relationship (21, 34, 36, 37) or a negative relationship (23, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using our dynamical epidemiological model, we recently clarified how a concurrent negative relationship between deermouse population density and SNV prevalence can be observed with (positive) density-dependent transmission (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This negative correlation observed at the Cascade, MT site is a result of the nonequilibrium dynamics (from a constantly changing carrying capacity) in deermouse population density leading to delayed density dependence, such that prevalence lags density by approximately 8 to 16 mo (22, 3941).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At that site, deermouse density peaked, and prevalence peaked later when population density had significantly declined again.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that with delayed density dependence, a positive relationship or no relationship may also be observed between concurrent density and prevalence (e.g., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21, 36, and 37), depending upon the pattern of population fluctuation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also showed that the delays may not be fixed [e.g., at 1 y (39)] but depend on host density, potentially making the relationship not apparent using conventional statistical analyses or examining averages; it can only be deciphered using a mechanistic dynamical model of infection, such as ours (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we caution against inferring too much from point estimates or averages (e.g., Fig 3); the true test is how the data match predictions from the dynamical model, which is driven by population density, because it can account for the transient dynamics and inherent variable time lags.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We see a component amplification effect through an increase in the transmission rate at sites with higher small mammal diversity (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be due to increased diversity leading to an increase in contact rates or an increase in the probability of transmission given contact (transmissibility; Fig 1, dark red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased species diversity could increase contact rates between deermice if, in more diverse areas, deermice cluster in refugia away from dominant competitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, increased species diversity could lead to increased transmissibility if host animals are stressed in the presence of competitors; increased stress can depress the immune system and lead to an increase in viral replication and increased susceptibility (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of how contact rates vary with species diversity give mixed resultsone study suggested a decrease in contacts (34), but an experimental study (with enclosures controlling for density) showed no change in contacts with increased diversity (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How transmissibility or immunity is affected by species diversity has yet to be examined and is a plausible mechanism for our observed increase in transmission rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Future studies should examine the importance of specific species or what aspects of biodiversity lead to both the dilution and component amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Host interactions with different species vary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an enclosure experiment, deermice had more interspecific interactions with Merriams kangaroo rats than desert pocket mice or Chihuahuan grasshopper mice, although intraspecific contact rates among deermice remained unchanged (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clay et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  suggested that Ords Kangaroo rats and pinyon mice may be particularly important in determining SNV prevalence (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although previous studies have shown that the dilution effect can be scale-dependent (11), we show that dilution and amplification can occur at the same time in the same system, at the same scale, and the resultant overall effect will be determined by which effect is stronger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent, impassioned debate has centered on whether loss of biodiversity should be more likely to lead to an increase (dilution), decrease (amplification), or idiosyncratic change in disease risk (68, 10, 11, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps, the reason that responses to biodiversity seem idiosyncratic (10) is because there are differential effects of biodiversity on the different mechanisms driving transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, if we want to make generalizable predictions across systems, we should focus on how biodiversity affects individual mechanisms that drive transmission and prevalence separately [as called for by, e.g., Johnson et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (45)] and the relative strength of these.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
