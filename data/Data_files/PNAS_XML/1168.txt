Dynamic patterns of cortical expansion during folding of the preterm human brain  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The human brain exhibits complex folding patterns that emerge during the third trimester of fetal development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Minor folds are quasi-randomly shaped and distributed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Major folds, in contrast, are more conserved and form important landmarks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of cortical folding is associated with devastating disorders of cognition and emotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite decades of study, the processes that produce normal and abnormal folding remain unresolved, although the relatively rapid tangential expansion of the cortex has emerged as a driving factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accurate and precise measurement of cortical growth patterns during the period of folding has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we illuminate the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical expansion by analyzing MRI-derived surfaces of preterm infant brains, using a unique strain energy minimization approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the third trimester of human brain development, the cerebral cortex undergoes dramatic surface expansion and folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physical models suggest that relatively rapid growth of the cortical gray matter helps drive this folding, and structural data suggest that growth may vary in both space (by region on the cortical surface) and time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we propose a unique method to estimate local growth from sequential cortical reconstructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using anatomically constrained multimodal surface matching (aMSM), we obtain accurate, physically guided point correspondence between younger and older cortical reconstructions of the same individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From each pair of surfaces, we calculate continuous, smooth maps of cortical expansion with unprecedented precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By considering 30 preterm infants scanned two to four times during the period of rapid cortical expansion (2838 wk postmenstrual age), we observe significant regional differences in growth across the cortical surface that are consistent with the emergence of new folds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these growth patterns shift over the course of development, with noninjured subjects following a highly consistent trajectory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information provides a detailed picture of dynamic changes in cortical growth, connecting what is known about patterns of development at the microscopic (cellular) and macroscopic (folding) scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our method provides specific growth maps for individual brains, we are also able to detect alterations due to injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fully automated surface analysis, based on tools freely available to the brain-mapping community, may also serve as a useful approach for future studies of abnormal growth due to genetic disorders, injury, or other environmental variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Global measures of cortical surface area and folding increase over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Cortical midthickness surfaces for individual hemisphere at 28 wk, 30 wk, 33 wk, and 38 wk PMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Color overlay represents nondimensional curvature, K*, a useful metric of the degree of folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Total cortical surface area (Left) and average magnitude of K* (Right) increase with time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these global measures do not provide information about regional variations in maturation and morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To visualize changes in cortical growth over the course of brain folding, we analyzed right and left hemispheres from 30 very preterm infants (born less_than30 wk PMA, 15 male, 15 female) scanned two to four times leading up to term equivalent (3640 wk PMA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six subjects were excluded from group analysis due to injury (see Materials and Methods for criteria), but all were analyzed longitudinally for individual growth patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
aMSM_Produces_Accurate_Point_Correspondence_and_Smooth_Growth_Estimation_Across_the_Cortex_of_Individual_Subjects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MSM uses a flexible spherical framework to align surfaces based on a range of available surface data (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2, anatomical surfaces (Fig 2A) and corresponding data (e.g., univariate patterns of curvature, Fig 1A) are projected to a spherical surface to provide a simpler mathematical framework for registration (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spherical registration shifts points on the input sphere until data are optimally aligned with those of the reference sphere (Fig 2C), such that reprojection onto the input anatomical surface reveals accurate point correspondence with the reference surface (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we use mean surface curvature (K), calculated at the cortical midthickness, to drive initial matching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reduce unrealistic distortions induced by both curvature matching and spherical projection, we further refine our registration to minimize physical strain energy (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) between the input and reference anatomical surfaces (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike other spherical registration methods, which reduce distortions on the sphere, this allows us to explicitly minimize deformations that are energetically unfavorable (and thus unlikely), greatly reducing artifacts associated with the spherical projection process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Supporting Information for examples and validation.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local expansion can then be estimated for each individual mesh face as the ratio of older to younger surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using aMSM, we were able to obtain physically justified point correspondence and smooth maps of cortical expansion at the individual level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3 shows results for a representative subject at multiple developmental periods: 2731 wk, 3133 wk, 3337 wk, and directly from 31 wk to 37 wk PMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitatively, plotting the same color map on registered younger (Fig 3, Top) and older (Fig 3, Bottom) geometries reveals accurate point correspondence for each time period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative analysis confirmed significant improvements in curvature correlation and strain energy due to aMSM registration (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 3, direct registration from 31 wk to 37 wk was also similar to registration from 31 wk to 33 wk and then from 33 wk to 37 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Fig S5 for group-wise comparison.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spatial_Patterns_of_Preterm_Growth_Are_Consistent_Across_Subjects_and_Correspond_to_Folding_Regions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For statistical comparisons, individuals were also registered to a 30-wk atlas generated from our cohort (Fig 4A; see Atlas Generation for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since folding patterns (primary sulci) are similar across individuals at 30 wk PMA (7), and because most subjects were scanned near 30 wk PMA, this atlas served as an appropriate reference for group analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once registration was established between 30-wk individual surfaces and the 30-wk atlas (intersubject registration, black arrow in Fig 4A), individual growth metrics determined by intrasubject registration were transformed to the atlas, facilitating statistical analysis across individuals and time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether regional differences in cortical expansion are conserved across individuals, we first considered the period from 30 ± 1 wk to 38 ± 2 wk PMA (n = 20 subjects without significant injury).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Permutation analysis of linear models (PALM) with threshold-free cluster enhancement (24) revealed significantly higher cortical expansion in the lateral parietal, occipital, and temporal regions and significantly lower cortical expansion in medial and insular regions (Fig 4B, Top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These patterns were consistent across right and left hemispheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At the individual level, we observed highest cortical expansion in areas undergoing the most dramatic folding (Fig 3), consistent with previous reports in ferrets (20, 2527).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify change in preterm folding, we analyzed nondimensional mean curvature, defined as K=KL, where L=SA/4 and SA = total cortical surface area (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1B, Right, K=1 across a spherical surface, and the global average of |K| increases for more convoluted surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local folding was estimated as the difference between |K| on the older and younger surfaces after one iteration of Gaussian kernel smoothing (=4 mm) on the atlas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4B, regions of highest cortical folding were similar, but not identical, to those of highest cortical expansion (Pearsons correlation = 0.46 and 0.42 for left and right hemispheres).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cortical_Growth_Changes_Regionally_and_Dynamically_During_Folding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From individuals with scans less than 6 wk apart (n = 27 measurements from 15 subjects), we also investigated temporal variations in regional growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5A, relative expansion initially appears highest in the early motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices, as well as the insula, but lower near term equivalent (n = 4 with four sequential scans).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, relative growth appears to increase with age in lateral parietal, temporal, and frontal regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether these dynamic shifts were statistically significant, we considered the effect of midpoint PMA (midpoint between younger and older scan PMAs) as a covariate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PALM revealed mean spatial patterns (Fig 5B, Left, mean PMA = 33 wk) similar to those for 3038 wk (Fig 4B, mean PMA = 34 wk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, temporal analysis revealed significant decreases in relative expansion of the insula and early motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices (initially fast-expanding regions slow over time relative to other regions), as well as increases in the lateral temporal lobe (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also examined dynamic changes in terms of growth rate, defined as local percentage of increase in cortical area per week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By plotting vertex values vs. midpoint PMA (Fig 6A), we quantified the rate and acceleration of cortical growth at specific locations over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For noninjured individuals (Fig 6A, blue and red dots), growth rates were generally higher at younger ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that growth decelerates significantly (P less_than 0.05) in the initially fast-growing primary cortices (3, 8, 9) and insula (7), but it remains fairly constant in frontal (12, 10), temporal (6), and lateral parietaloccipital (45) vertices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear fit and statistics are shown in Table S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Local_Growth_Estimation_Detects_Abnormalities_Associated_with_Preterm_Injury  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since our technique produces continuous estimates of cortical growth for individual subjects, we also analyzed cortical surfaces of infants identified to have grade III/IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and/or ventriculomegaly during their neonatal intensive care unit course (n = 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For illustration, Fig 6B compares a subject with no injury (same subject as in Fig 3) to one diagnosed with bilateral grade III/IV IVH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction in growth rate is particularly evident in the temporal and occipital lobes of the subject with IVH (Fig 6B, Middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that growth rate recovered to near noninjured levels during the period from 34 wk to 38 wk PMA in this individual (Fig 6B, Bottom and black open stars in Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, we implemented an automated, quantitative method for analyzing regional growth in longitudinal studies of cortical maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual registration with aMSM not only produced accurate alignment of gyri and sulci, but also effectively minimized distortions on the cortical surface (Fig 3 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shift in focusregularizing the physical anatomical mesh instead of the abstract spherical meshoffers a significant improvement for longitudinal registration using spherical techniques, which have been plagued by artifactual deformations that obscure real trends and limit interpretation of cortical growth maps (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our mechanics-inspired regularization penalty (strain energy density, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) is physically justified for longitudinal registration and has been shown to outperform other mathematical approaches (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Other registration techniques have been proposed to control distortion via spectral matching or varifolds (21, 22), but they have not been integrated into widely used analysis pipelines (9, 28, 29) or produced smooth, meaningful maps of cortical surface expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, spherical registration provides an efficient, versatile framework for inter- and intrasubject analysis based on a variety of imaging modalities (17, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this study matched curvatures, an intrinsic feature of any cortical reconstruction, MSM allows registration based on multimodal data, which may further improve the accuracy of registration (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies may exploit additional data, such as myelin content and fMRI contrasts, to establish or improve correspondence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The current approach provides continuous maps of local expansion for each individual, enabling continuous statistical analysis across the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without the limitations of ROIs (1416), spatiotemporal trends presented here offer unique insight into the trajectory of cortical growth and maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many respects, these patterns are consistent with those in past literature: Diffusion tensor imaging and histological analyses have reported mature dendritic branching in the primary motor and sensory cortices before the visual cortex, which in turn matures earlier than the frontal cortex (1, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar patterns have been reported for regional folding in the preterm brain (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamic measures of cortical surface expansion reported here offer a bridge between these metrics, supporting the idea that biological processes (neuronal migration and dendritic branching) contribute to physical expansion of the cortex (constrained regional growth), which leads to mechanical instability and folding in different areas at different times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig 7, the patterns we report for preterm growth (third trimester equivalent) may also link existing studies of cortical growth during the late second trimester and childhood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A volumetric study of fetal MRIs found maximum cortical growth at the central sulcus, which increased between 2024 wk and 2428 wk, as well as above-average growth near the insula, cingulate, and orbital sulcus (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we observe a trajectory in which the area of maximum growth migrates outward from the central sulcus at 2830 wk (Fig 7A, Top) toward the parietal and then temporal and frontal lobes while dissipating from the medial occipital lobe (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 7B, this is generally consistent with reported patterns of postnatal expansion (term to adult in human, also proposed for human evolution) (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One limitation of our study is the use of preterm infant data rather than fetal scans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the advent of improved motion correction tools (32), fetal scans have become feasible and may reveal faster or different growth patterns (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our results appear consistent with second trimester and postnatal trends, future studies should assess potential differences in preterm vs. healthy growth as in utero longitudinal scans become available with sufficient temporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the current approach may not fully characterize within-fold differences, such as gyri-specific growth (34); higher-resolution matching data may be needed to resolve growth patterns at subgyral scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also note some conflicting results with past studies using manually defined ROIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a recent study of preterm infants (30 wk PMA to term equivalent) analyzed growth by dividing the brain into its major lobes (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Authors reported high expansion in the parietal and occipital lobes, in agreement with our results, but low expansion in the temporal lobe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that this discrepancy stems from inclusion of the insula and medial temporal surface in their temporal lobe ROI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relatively low expansion of these regions (Fig 4B) may be sufficient to cancel out the high expansion we observed in the lateral temporal region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another recent study used ROIs to relate regional surface expansion and cellular maturation in the developing rhesus macaque brain (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ROI analysis did not reveal a clear relationship, whereas our current approach in humans (Fig 6) (1, 2) and ferrets (20) suggests a connection between the two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that a priori definition of ROIs may diminish the ability to detect such relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we note that, for infants with high-grade IVH and/or ventriculomegaly, our analysis was able to clearly detect alterations in local growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6B provides an example of grade III/IV IVH, where abnormal folding is evident at all time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as illustrated in Fig 4B, folding may not serve as a perfect representation of underlying growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our method revealed reduced growth rate in specific regions, followed by recovery to near-normal levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These areas and effects would be difficult to pinpoint with global measures or even local measures of folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Just as we were able to detect subtle differences in preterm growth, future studies may apply this approach to detect differences related to specific injury mechanisms, genetic disorders, or environmental variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Recruitment__MRI_Acquisition__and_Surface_Generation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preterm infants in this study were born at less_than30 wk gestation and were recruited from St. Louis Childrens Hospital.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Washington University Institutional Review Board approved all procedures related to the study, and parents or legal guardians provided informed, written consent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were obtained using a turbo-spin echo T2-weighted sequence (repetition time = 8,500 ms; echo time = 160 ms; voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm3) on a Siemens 3T Trio scanner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T2-weighted images were processed, and cortical segmentations were generated at the midthickness of the cortex using previously documented methods (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These segmentations were then used to generate cortical surface reconstructions, including midthickness and spherical surfaces, for each hemisphere using methods previously reported (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Preterm infants with moderate to severe cerebellar hemorrhage, grade III/IV IVH, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, or ventriculomegaly on MRI were identified and analyzed separately (36, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical and demographic information for included and excluded subjects is available in Table S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three of 26 included subjects exhibited noncystic white matter injuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These details, as well as PMA for each individual scan, are available in Table S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Longitudinal_Surface_Alignment_and_Theory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To obtain point correspondence across time, individual surfaces (input and reference) were projected to a sphere and registered with aMSM (18) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tool systematically moves points on the input spherical surface to maximize similarity of a specified metric and minimize strain energy between the anatomical input and reference surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean curvatures, generated in Connectome Workbench (23), were used for matching data and cortical midthickness surfaces, rescaled to the same total surface area, were used as the anatomical input and reference surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Inspired by studies that have modeled brain tissue as a hyperelastic material (3, 4, 6, 38), we define surface strain energy asW=2(R+1R2)+2(J+1J2),[1]where R=1/2 represents change in shape, J=12 represents change in size, and 1and 2 represent in-plane anatomical stretches in the maximum and minimum principal directions, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This form corresponds to a modified, compressible neo-Hookean material in 2D, and here we define bulk modulus, , to be 10 times greater than shear modulus, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent bias associated with the direction of registration (39), average results were calculated for aMSM registration performed from both older to younger and younger to older surfaces (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details on theory and implementation of aMSM, as well as parameter effects of bulk-to-shear ratio, are described in Anatomical Mesh Regularization with aMSM, aMSM Validation, and aMSM Implementation Details and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other parameter effects have been described previously (17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Group_Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To analyze trends in growth, individual metric maps were compared on the 30-wk group atlas by applying point correspondences described in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atlas generation details can be found in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual-to-atlas alignment was accomplished with aMSM, using one surface from each individual as input (time point closest to 30 wk PMA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PALM was performed with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) (24), using 1,000 iterations and a medial wall mask.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-group t tests were performed on the log transform of relative surface expansion to obtain a normally distributed metric centered at zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Atlas midthickness surfaces and vertex areas were used for TFCE surface area computations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Significance of correlations was assessed using Pearsons correlation coefficient, and total strain energy was calculated by integrating Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 with respect to cortical surface area (MATLAB; The MathWorks, Inc.) (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant improvements due to aMSM were assessed by comparing total correlation and energy values before and after registration with paired t tests (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
