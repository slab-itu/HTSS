title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selective deuteration illuminates the importance of tunneling in the unimolecular decay of Criegee intermediates to hydroxyl radical products  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ozonolysis of volatile biogenic and anthropogenic alkenes is a significant source of hydroxyl radicals, a key oxidant in the troposphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A critical step in the generation of hydroxyl radicals is a hydrogen-atom transfer reaction involving a carbonyl oxide species, known as the Criegee intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, experiment and statistical theory reveal that selective deuteration of a Criegee intermediate results in deuterium atom transfer and slows the release of hydroxyl-d radicals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large kinetic isotope effect is found at energies near the classical barrier to reaction and under thermal conditions relevant to the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that quantum mechanical tunneling significantly enhances the rate of production of hydroxyl radicals in alkene ozonolysis reactions under atmospheric conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ozonolysis of alkenes, an important nonphotolytic source of hydroxyl (OH) radicals in the atmosphere, proceeds through unimolecular decay of Criegee intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a large kinetic isotope effect associated with the rate-limiting hydrogen-transfer step that releases OH radicals for a prototypical Criegee intermediate, CH3CHOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IR excitation of selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO is shown to result in deuterium atom transfer and release OD radical products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrational activation of syn-CD3CHOO is coupled with direct time-resolved detection of OD products to measure a 10-fold slower rate of unimolecular decay upon deuteration in the vicinity of the transition state barrier, which is confirmed by microcanonical statistical theory that incorporates quantum mechanical tunneling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding kinetic isotope effect of 10 is attributed primarily to the decreased probability of D-atom vs. H-atom transfer arising from tunneling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Master equation modeling is utilized to compute the thermal unimolecular decay rates for selectively and fully deuterated syn methyl-substituted Criegee intermediates under atmospheric conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 298 K (1 atm), tunneling is predicted to enhance the thermal decay rate of syn-CH3CHOO compared with the deuterated species, giving rise to a significant kinetic isotope effect of 50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Energies and geometries of stationary points along the unimolecular decay pathway from the syn-CD3CHOO Criegee intermediate to OD products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction follows a 1,4-deuterium atom transfer mechanism to vinyl deuteroperoxide (VDP; D2C = CHOOD) via a cyclic TS, followed by prompt dissociation to OD + vinoxy (CD2CHO) products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the experiment, the IR laser is resonant with a CH stretch overtone (2CH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting OD products are detected by UV LIF on the OD A2+  X23/2 (1,0) Q1(3.5) transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the molecular structures, the D-atoms are indicated in gold, while the H-atom is shown as white.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unimolecular decay of selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO Criegee intermediates to OD + vinoxy radical products is examined experimentally and theoretically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two types of experiments are performed: (i) An IR action spectrum of syn-CD3CHOO is obtained by scanning the IR pump laser in the CH stretch overtone (2CH) region at a fixed IR pumpUV probe delay of 100 ns; and (ii) direct time-domain measurements of the rate of appearance of OD products are recorded following vibrational activation of syn-CD3CHOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the IR-UV time delay is stepped in 2- or 50-ns increments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both types of experiments, the OD X23/2 (v = 0, J = 3.5) products are detected by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) on the OD A2+  X23/2 (1,0) Q1(3.5) transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complementary theoretical calculations are carried out to predict the IR absorption spectrum of selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO and fully deuterated syn-CD3CDOO, along with RRKM calculations of the microcanonical unimolecular decay rates for the deuterated Criegee intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anharmonic frequencies and IR intensities in the 3,900- to 6,300-cm1 region are computed at the B2PLYPD3/cc-pVTZ level (29, 30), with second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) for syn-CH3CHOO, fully deuterated syn-CD3CDOO, and selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO Criegee intermediates and shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported (17, 19, 20), IR transitions involving two quanta of CH stretch excitation (e.g., 21) of syn-CH3CHOO are located in the 5,600- to 6,100-cm1 region in the vicinity of the TS barrier (17.05 kcalmol1; 5,960 cm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another group of IR transitions is predicted in the 3,900- to 4,600-cm1 region at energies as much as 2,000 cm1 below the TS barrier, which corresponds to combination bands composed of one quantum each of CH stretch and another lower-frequency mode (e.g., 1 + 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For comparison, the fully deuterated syn-CD3CDOO Criegee intermediate is predicted to exhibit an analogous set of IR transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in CH fundamental frequencies from 3,0003,200 to 2,1002,300 cm1 upon deuteration (Table S1) shifts the approximately twofold weaker IR transitions involving two quanta of CD stretch excitation of syn-CD3CDOO to the 4,200- to 4,600-cm1 region (Fig 2 and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IR transitions involving three quanta of CD stretch excitation of syn-CD3CDOO are anticipated in the vicinity of 6,000 cm1; however, their IR transition strengths are expected to be at least an order of magnitude weaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO, the focus of the present study, a similar set of IR transitions are anticipated for the carbonyl oxide CH (1) stretch and various methyl CD (2, 3, 13) stretches (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2 (Table S2), a strong CH stretch overtone (21) is predicted at 6,042.5 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several other weaker transitions are located in the 4,000- to 4,600-cm1 range involving two quanta of CD stretch (e.g., 22) or combination bands involving CH stretch and a lower-frequency mode (e.g., 1 + 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional very weak transitions are predicted in the 5,100- to 5,400-cm1 region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The weaker transitions are not expected to be observable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experimentally, the IR action spectrum of syn-CD3CHOO was scanned in the 6,030- to 6,080-cm1 range with UV LIF detection of the resultant OD products with an IR-UV time delay of 100 ns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One feature is observed at 6,055.0 cm1, as shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only one IR transition of syn-CD3CHOO is anticipated near 6,000 cm1 (Fig 2), and thus the observed feature is ascribed to the strong CH stretch overtone (21) transition predicted at 6,042.5 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No OH products are detected upon excitation of syn-CD3CHOO at 6,055.0 cm1, confirming that unimolecular decay arises from D-atom transfer and leads exclusively to OD products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The assignment is further validated by simulation of the rotational band contour by using the PGOPHER spectral simulation program (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation is generated by using calculated rotational constants for syn-CD3CHOO (A = 0.524 cm1, B = 0.208 cm1, C = 0.157 cm1), which differ only slightly from the experimental rotational constants for syn-CH3CHOO (32), and the hybrid a/b-type transition (a:b = 1:2) predicted by theory for 21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3, a simulation with band origin at 6,055.0 cm1, rotational temperature of 10 K, and homogeneous broadening with a Lorentzian linewidth of 2.7 cm1, corresponding to an intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) lifetime of 2 ps, is in good accord with the experimental band contour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experimental rate of appearance of OD products is obtained from direct time-domain measurements following CH stretch overtone (21) excitation at 6,055.0 cm1 of the selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO Criegee intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4, scanning the IR-UV time delay in 2-ns steps reveals a slower exponential appearance of OD products from unimolecular decay of IR-activated syn-CD3CHOO than the more rapid appearance of OH products arising from IR-activated syn-CH3CHOO at a similar energy (5,709.0 cm1) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The OD product temporal profile from IR-activated syn-CD3CHOO is also measured with 50-ns IR-UV time-delay increments to capture the long time behavior as shown in Fig S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall temporal profile is well represented by a dual exponential function that encompasses the rise (krise) and fall (kfall) rate constants, as well as the laser time resolution of 5.0 ± 0.1 ns (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  krise is the rate constant for appearance of OD products and corresponding unimolecular decay of syn-CD3CHOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  kfall is purely experimental in nature, which arises from the molecules moving out of the UV probe volume due to the terminal velocity of the free jet expansion and the kinetic energy release to the OD products following unimolecular decay (33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At long time delays, the temporal profile is dominated by the exponential fall-off term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated measurements yield kfall = 8.0 ± 0.5 × 105 s1, which is fixed in the subsequent determination of krise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exponential rise rate constant is then separately determined to be krise = 3.0 ± 0.3 × 107 s1, corresponding to an OD appearance time of 33.3 ± 2.8 ns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uncertainty (±1) in krise is derived from repeated measurements and takes into account the uncertainty (±1) in kfall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The microcanonical dissociation rate constants k(E) for the selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO Criegee intermediate are also computed with RRKM theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tunneling is taken into account by using semiclassical TS theory (SCTST) (35) and asymmetric Eckart (36) models that incorporate anharmonic frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D-atom transfer step is taken to be rate-limiting for unimolecular decay to OD products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The RRKM calculations are based on previous high-level electronic structure calculations of the TS barrier for syn-CH3CHOO (20) and changes in the anharmonic frequencies and ZPE of the Criegee intermediate reactant and TS upon deuteration (Tables S1 and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon selective deuteration of syn-CD3CHOO, the TS barrier increases to 17.74 kcalmol1 (6,205 cm1), and the imaginary frequency associated with 1,4 D-atom transfer decreases to 1,325i cm1; see below for comparison of these parameters with other isotopologues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The computed RRKM rate coefficients using Eckart and SCTST tunneling models are predicted to be 2.94 × 107 and 2.62 × 107 s1 (corresponding to lifetimes of 34.0 and 38.2 ns), respectively, for selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO at 6,055.0 cm1, which are in very good agreement with the experimental measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement of experiment with statistical RRKM theory for the unimolecular decay rate of syn-CD3CHOO further validates the computed TS barrier and demonstrates the importance of quantum mechanical tunneling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agreement also shows that the initial CH stretch overtone excitation (21) is rapidly randomized by IVR before unimolecular decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy-dependent RRKM unimolecular decay rates for selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO are predicted over a wide range of energies, as shown in Fig 5 (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The anti conformer of CD3CHOO is expected to undergo unimolecular decay through a three-membered ring closure to form a dioxirane intermediate and ultimately yield many products, including OH (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective deuteration allows one to distinguish between syn-CD3CHOO that yields OD and anti-CD3CHOO that produces OH, as shown in hexene ozonolysis (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the vibrational frequencies and IR spectrum of anti-CD3CHOO are also computed at the B2PLYPD3/cc-pVTZ level of theory (Fig S2 and Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An experimental search is conducted for the strongest 21 transition predicted at 5,986.1 cm1 by using action spectroscopy with OH LIF detection on the A-X (1,0) Q1(3.5) line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a weak transition is observed at 5,979.0 cm1 that is tentatively ascribed to anti-CD3CHOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OH products are rapidly formed within the time resolution of the lasers (5 ns), which is consistent with RRKM calculations based on theoretically predicted TS barriers to dioxirane (21, 28, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selective deuteration of syn-CH3CHOO provides an effective means to examine the kinetic isotopic effect associated with H/D-atom transfer from the methyl group to the terminal O atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy-specific activation of syn-CD3CHOO is afforded by IR excitation of a strong CH stretch overtone (21) transition at 6,055.0 cm1, which is followed by statistical unimolecular decay of syn-CD3CHOO to OD + CD2CHO products on a 33.3 ± 2.8-ns timescale with k(E) = 3.0 ± 0.3 × 107 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional IR transitions arising from CD stretch overtone and combination bands are predicted to occur in the 4,000- to 4,600-cm1 energy range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these excitation energies are in the deep tunneling regime, where RRKM calculations including tunneling indicate unimolecular decay rates for syn-CD3CHOO to OD products that are orders of magnitude slower (103 to 105 s1; Fig 5 and Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter are too slow to measure under the current experimental conditions, which is limited by the timescale (12 s) for molecules moving out of the probe laser detection region (18, 19) and will not be observed in the IR action spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the weak IR transitions of syn-CD3CHOO predicted in the 5,100- to 5,400-cm1 region will result in slow unimolecular decay (105 to 106 s1) and are not expected to be observable in the IR action spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO differs from the previously studied syn-CH3CHOO system in that the rate-limiting H-atom transfer step leading to OH products is now a D-atom transfer process that yields OD products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 6,055.0 cm1, the unimolecular decay time of syn-CD3CHOO is 33.3 ± 2.8 ns, while that of syn-CH3CHOO was limited by the laser time resolution (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since experiment and RRKM theory are in excellent accord for syn-CD3CHOO at 6,055.0 cm1 and for syn-CH3CHOO at slightly lower energies, we utilize RRKM theory with tunneling for the unimolecular decay time for syn-CH3CHOO at 6,055.0 cm1 (3.7 ns) to deduce a 10-fold increase in lifetime upon selective deuteration of the methyl-substituted Criegee intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equivalently, this corresponds to a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A portion of this increase, specifically a factor of 3.4, can be explained by the increase in N(E) at 6,055.0 cm1 upon selective deuteration (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The balance is primarily due to the decreased probability of tunneling through the TS barrier for D-atom vs. H-atom transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The rate of change of the unimolecular decay rate with energy is also greater for selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO than syn-CH3CHOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5, the unimolecular decay rate for syn-CD3CHOO increases 10,000-fold from 3,900 to 6,300 cm1 (Table S4), while that for syn-CH3CHOO increases by a factor of 400 (see table S4 of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KIE changes from 8 to 200 across this energy range, with the largest KIE at energies significantly below the TS barrier in the deep tunneling regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small portion of this effect can be attributed to the increase in N(E) (by a factor of 2.83.4) upon selective deuteration at these energies (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large KIE at these energies demonstrates the importance of quantum mechanical tunneling, which is much less probable for D-atom vs. H-atom transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Deuteration of the methyl-group of the Criegee intermediate results in changes in the TS barrier height and imaginary frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 6 shows an anharmonic ZPE-corrected asymmetric Eckart potential in mass-weighted coordinates to illustrate these changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TS barrier increases by 4% from 17.05 kcalmol1 (5,960 cm1) for syn-CH3CHOO to 17.74 kcalmol1 (6,205 cm1) for selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a result of a larger reduction in the ZPE of the reactant than that of the TS upon deuteration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate for H/D atom transfer also decreases by 22% from 1,696i cm1 for syn-CH3CHOO (20) to 1,325i cm1 for syn-CD3CHOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imaginary frequency is related to the curvature at the top of the barrier and results in an increase in the breadth of the Eckart potential (in mass-weighted coordinates) for syn-CD3CHOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These factors reduce the probability of tunneling through the TS barrier associated with D-atom transfer for syn-CD3CHOO compared with that for H-atom transfer in syn-CH3CHOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The k(E) for fully deuterated syn-CD3CDOO is also computed with RRKM theory by using the Eckart and SCTST tunneling models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fully deuterated syn-CD3CDOO, both the ZPE-corrected TS barrier (17.72 kcal·mol1; 6,199 cm1) and imaginary frequency (1,321i cm1) are nearly identical to those for selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant Eckart potential (Fig 6) is essentially unchanged for the fully deuterated and selectively deuterated systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the tunneling probability at a given energy will be approximately the same for the selectively and fully deuterated systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, k(E) for fully deuterated syn-CD3CDOO is slower by a factor of 1.5 compared with syn-CD3CHOO, as shown in Fig 5 (Table S4), due to the slightly higher N(E) for syn-CD3CDOO (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, at 6,055.0 cm1, the unimolecular decay rate (lifetime) computed for fully deuterated syn-CD3CDOO is 1.80 × 107 s1 (55.6 ns) and 1.93 × 107 s1 (51.8 ns) for the Eckart and SCTST tunneling models, respectively, and yields a KIE of 14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KIE changes from 11 to 260 across the energy range from 6,300 to 3,900 cm1 as tunneling becoming increasingly important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large KIE signifies the reduced probability of tunneling upon deuteration, although a small portion of this change is due to the increase in N(E) (by a factor of 3.85.1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The slow unimolecular decay rate of fully deuterated syn-CD3CDOO to OD products makes it difficult to detect via IR action spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RRKM calculations indicate that syn-CD3CDOO excited on IR transitions in the 4,200- to 4,600-cm1 range (Fig 2), assigned to transitions involving two quanta of CD stretch excitation, will decay too slowly to OD products (104 to 105 s1) to be observed under the current experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While syn-CD3CDOO prepared with three quanta of CD stretch (e.g., 31) near 6,000 cm1 would have appropriate unimolecular decay rates (107 s1) for experimental observation, these IR transitions are anticipated to be at least an order of magnitude weaker than those involving two quanta of CD stretch excitation (e.g., 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preliminary attempts to obtain an IR action spectrum of the fully deuterated syn-CD3CDOO Criegee intermediate in the 2CD and 3CD energy regions were not successful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The thermal unimolecular decay rates k(T) for the selectively and fully deuterated syn methyl-substituted Criegee intermediates have been computed under atmospheric conditions by using master equation modeling; thermal rates for syn-CH3CHOO have been reported (19, 20, 25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, the rates are predicted to be in the high pressure limit, where the thermal rate can be expressed as a Boltzmann-weighted average over k(E) and N(E), k(T)k(E)N(E)exp(E/kBT)dE (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the higher N(E) for the fully deuterated syn-CD3CDOO compared with selectively deuterated syn-CD3CHOO results in essentially the same thermal rates, aside from a minor effect due to their slightly different TS barriers arising from ZPE corrections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the 200350 K (1 atm) range, the thermal rates for syn-CD3CHOO (Fig 7) and syn-CD3CDOO are nearly indistinguishable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermal decay rates for syn-CH3CHOO (Fig 7) are significantly faster than the deuterated systems, primarily due to enhanced tunneling for H-atom transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 298 K, the thermal decay rates for both deuterated Criegee intermediates are 3 s1 compared with 166 s1 for syn-CH3CHOO (19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the effective first-order rate constants for syn- and anti-CH3CHOO with water vapor are estimated to be 101 and 104 s1, respectively, at typical atmospheric concentrations of [H2O] = 1 × 1017 to 5 × 1017 cm3 (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, thermal unimolecular decay will be the primary atmospheric loss process for syn-CH3CHOO, while bimolecular reaction with water vapor is expected to be the main atmospheric decay pathway for the less stable anti-CH3CHOO conformer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Fig 7, the thermal rates without tunneling follow simple Arrhenius behavior with slopes indicative of the TS barrier heights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal rates incorporating tunneling show significantly enhanced rates with strong curvature evident in the Arrhenius plots at lower temperatures, which can be represented by modified Arrhenius expressions (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 298 K, tunneling enhances the thermal decay rate of syn-CH3CHOO by a factor of 100 and to a lesser degree (10-fold) for syn-CD3CHOO and syn-CD3CDOO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The syn methyl-substituted Criegee intermediate is predicted to have a large KIE of 52 at 298 K upon deuteration and ranges from 15 (350 K) to 4,200 (200 K) at temperatures relevant to the troposphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This work demonstrates the importance of quantum mechanical tunneling in the energy-dependent (3,9006,300 cm1) and thermal (200350 K) unimolecular decay rates of syn-CH3CHOO to OH radical products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective deuteration of syn-CD3CHOO is shown to slow the rate of unimolecular decay to OD products by 10-fold in the vicinity of the TS barrier, primarily due to the decreased probability of tunneling in D-atom vs. H-atom transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, deuteration is shown to give rise to a large KIE of 50 in the thermal unimolecular decay rate of syn-CH3CHOO at 298 K. The large KIE emphasizes the importance of tunneling in enhancing the thermal decay rate of the syn methyl-substituted Criegee intermediate to OH products, which needs to be taken into account in atmospheric models of OH production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The methods utilized for IR action spectroscopy and time-resolved dynamics of syn-CH3CHOO to OH radical products have been described (17, 19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, the 1,1-diiodoethane-2,2,2-d3 (CD3CHI2) precursor is prepared by using the general procedures of Friedrich et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (40), starting from acetaldehyde-2,2,2-d3 (99% purity, 98% D; Sigma Aldrich).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1H, 2H, and 13C NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry confirm selective deuteration of the methyl group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details are given in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
