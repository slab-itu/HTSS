title  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Deep ocean nutrients imply large latitudinal variation in particle transfer efficiency  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Organic particles that sink to the deep ocean release carbon dioxide in waters that remain out of contact with the atmosphere on long timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This paper reconstructs particle flux profiles from large-scale ocean nutrient distributions, revealing systematic regional variations that have proved difficult to detect from direct observations alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the transfer efficiency of organic matter to depth is greatest in high-latitude regions and lowest in the subtropics, and is well explained by variations in phytoplankton community structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest a greater sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 to high-latitude carbon export, and predict reduced ocean carbon storage as subtropical communities expand in response to climate warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The transfer efficiency of sinking organic particles through the mesopelagic zone and into the deep ocean is a critical determinant of the atmosphereocean partition of carbon dioxide (CO2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ability to detect large-scale spatial variations in transfer efficiency is limited by the scarcity and uncertainties of particle flux data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we reconstruct deep ocean particle fluxes by diagnosing the rate of nutrient accumulation along transport pathways in a data-constrained ocean circulation model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with estimates of organic matter export from the surface, these diagnosed fluxes reveal a global pattern of transfer efficiency to 1,000 m that is high (25%) at high latitudes and low (5%) in subtropical gyres, with intermediate values in the tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern is well correlated with spatial variations in phytoplankton community structure and the export of ballast minerals, which control the size and density of sinking particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings accentuate the importance of high-latitude oceans in sequestering carbon over long timescales, and highlight potential impacts on remineralization depth as phytoplankton communities respond to a warming climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diagnostic_Method  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We reconstructed particle fluxes to the deep ocean by exploiting the large-scale tracer signatures of POM decomposition, which consumes oxygen (O2) and converts organic nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) to inorganic nutrients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remineralization can therefore be identified by the accumulation of apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), nitrate (NO3), and phosphate (PO43) along subsurface circulation pathways (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each tracer integrates the remineralization signal over sufficient timescales to determine time mean rates, and has a global distribution that is characterized by orders of magnitude more observations than the particle fluxes themselves (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two factors confound this tracer-based approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in poorly oxygenated waters, microbial respiration is fueled by NO3 rather than O2, so remineralization leaves no AOU signature and acts as a sink, rather than source, of NO3 (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, remineralization tracers reflect the decomposition of both POM and dissolved organic matter (DOM), so isolating the particulate signal requires an independent estimate of DOM decomposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global DOM distributions are not well sampled, but multiple observations indicate that dissolved organic phosphorous (DOP) cycles rapidly to PO4 and does not accumulate in the subsurface like dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these reasons, we focus on PO43 as the most promising tracer of particle remineralization, and restrict our analysis to the ocean interior below 300 m, where DOP concentrations are negligible throughout the stratified low latitudes (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In high-latitude regions, we further excluded seasonal mixed layers from our analysis, which entrain DOP from the surface (20) and where the nutrient concentrations vary considerably over time (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We estimated particulate organic P (POP) remineralization from the global PO43 distribution using a data-constrained ocean general circulation model (OGCM) that accurately captures the isopycnal structure of the ocean, and the mixing and aging of water masses (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed PO43 distribution in the ocean interior was first divided into two components,[PO43]interior=Pcirc+Prem(POP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [1]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pcirc represents the PO43 carried by water masses as they pass through the 300-m horizon or the base of the wintertime mixed layer, whichever is deeper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pcirc was determined using the model circulation to propagate observed PO43 concentrations at the boundary into the interior region without alteration, except by mixing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference between this transported value and the observed concentration at each location, Prem(POP), represents the PO43 produced within water masses by POP remineralization in the ocean interior (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remineralization rate, Jrem, was then diagnosed from the accumulation rate of Prem(POP) over time, as water masses spread and age along isopycnals away from the boundary in the circulation model (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, profiles of the vertical POP flux (FPOP) were reconstructed by integrating Jrem from each depth level to the seafloor, assuming that benthic POP burial is negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a Monte Carlo approach to quantify the uncertainty in these fluxes, repeating our calculation 10,000 times using eight different versions of the tracer-constrained OGCM and propagating uncertainty in the observed PO43 distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To distinguish broad spatial patterns from gridpoint noise, diagnosed POP fluxes were averaged over regions that capture large-scale variations in those factors hypothesized to influence Teff (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans were divided into warm subtropics [subtropical Atlantic (STA) and subtropical Pacific (STP)] with picoplankton-dominated communities and rapid nutrient recycling; cold northern subarctic regions [North Atlantic (NA) and North Pacific (NP)] with seasonal blooms of large microplankton (23); and productive eastern tropical upwelling zones [eastern tropical Atlantic (ETA) and eastern tropical Pacific (ETP)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Southern Ocean was divided between the productive subantarctic zone (SAZ), with deep winter mixed layers, and the upwelling Antarctic zone (AAZ), with short growing seasons dominated by heavily silicified diatom blooms (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Diagnosed profiles of FPOP (Fig 2) generally follow the same asymptotic shapes that are characteristic of observed particle fluxes (3), attenuating quickly in the upper ocean and more gradually at depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diagnosed fluxes are broadly consistent with the range of rates measured by bottom-moored sediment traps in the deep ocean (Fig S1) (25), but also exhibit systematic variations between regions that are not apparent in the sparse observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the subtropics stand out as regions of particularly low POP flux, which decreases rapidly from 45 mmolm2y1 at 300 m to values indistinguishable from zero at the base of the mesopelagic zone, defined here as the 1,000-m depth horizon (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all other regions, FPOP is significantly greater than zero down to at least 2,500 m [90% confidence interval (C.I.)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest particle fluxes to the deep ocean are found in the subarctic Atlantic and Pacific, where FPOP at 1,000 m is 6.4 ± 1.16 mmolm2y1 and 7.3 ± 0.63 mmolm2y1, respectively, and slightly lower fluxes (4.45.6 mmolm2y1) are found in the tropics and Southern Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regional patterns in particle flux attenuation between the mesopelagic zone and the deep ocean can be identified from the ratio between FPOP at 1,500 m and 500 m in each profile (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These depth horizons straddle the putative base of the mesopelagic zone, and 500 m is the shallowest depth at which FPOP estimates are available for all regions (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fastest attenuation is found in the subtropics, where only 10% of the 500 m fluxes reaches 1,500 m, followed by the two tropical zones, where FPOP at 1,500 m is reduced to 20% of its 500-m value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slower attenuation is observed in the high latitudes: Both subarctic regions retain 35% of the 500-m flux down to 1,500 m, and the Antarctic region retains 40% (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because our diagnostic method cannot be extended shallower in the water column, the reconstructed flux profiles alone cannot provide estimates of transfer efficiency (Teff) from the base of the euphotic zone (zeu) to the deep ocean (1,000 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we require an independent estimate of POM export at zeu, which can only be provided by remote sensing approaches and global biogeochemical/ecosystem models on the large spatial scales considered here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for the full range of uncertainty in these methods, we compiled 14 different estimates of POP export, nine from satellite algorithms and five from state-of-the-art Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) model predictions (Fig S2A and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Satellite estimates of particulate organic carbon (POC) export were generated using all combinations of three net primary production (NPP) climatologies and three algorithms for the export efficiency (e ratio) of organic matter (SI Materials and Methods), then converted to POP using a spatially varying relationship for particulate P:C ratios (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Export estimates were averaged over regions and combined with the reconstructed POP flux to determine Teff from zeu1,000 m (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One robust pattern to emerge from this analysis is that Teff is consistently low in the subtropics relative to the other regions, and lower than expected from the canonical Martin curve relationship often used to predict flux attenuation over depth (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, Teff estimates cluster close to the Martin curve prediction of 15% in the tropics, but span a wide range between 1050% in the high latitudes, where export estimates vary considerably (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Robust differences between these regions therefore cannot be established without additional constraints on export.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We evaluated each satellite algorithm and CMIP5 model against tracer-based observations of export production at locations within seven of the eight ocean regions considered here (27, 28) (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Composite export estimates for each region were then derived by weighting members of the satellite and CMIP5 ensembles according to their skill at reproducing the empirical estimates at these locations (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach reduces the uncertainty in our estimated POP export at zeu (Fig S2C), and better clarifies the systematic regional differences in Teff (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to confirming low subtropical Teff (5%), this result distinguishes tropical upwelling zones with intermediate Teff (15%) from high-latitude oceans with high values (25%) that exceed the Martin curve prediction (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same pattern is observed in transfer efficiency from zeu2,000 m (Fig S3) and is consistent with the attenuation estimates derived from diagnosed FPOP profiles alone (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results establish a coherent geographical pattern of particle flux attenuation through the mesopelagic zone and beyond: The subtropics deliver the smallest fraction of the surface export flux to depth, and high latitudes deliver the largest, with the tropics falling in between.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings are at odds with previous attempts to constrain deep ocean transfer efficiency (15), which estimated that 20% of the surface export flux reaches 2,000 m throughout the low latitudes, compared with less_than5% in the Southern Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large-scale distribution of remineralized PO43 does not support this pattern, which might be compromised by the collection biases of bottom-moored sediment traps (13) (Fig S1) and/or analytical errors associated with the Th-based export observations used (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, our results are highly consistent with the few available POC flux profiles to 500 m compiled from neutrally buoyant sediment traps (8, 14) (Fig 3C), and extend the observed regional difference between subtropics and high latitudes over a much larger depth range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the close quantitative agreement between these approaches (Fig 3C) indicates that large-scale patterns detected in our reconstructed POP profiles also apply to organic carbon fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the mechanisms that control remineralization depth, we compared our tracer-constrained Teff estimates (Fig 3C) to large-scale patterns in the factors hypothesized to influence particle sinking and decomposition rates (Table 1 and SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper-ocean temperature (T100500m) exhibits the opposite trend from Teff (subtropics  tropics  high latitude, Fig 1B), consistent with the effect of temperature on microbial respiration rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relationship explains 78% or 67% of the regional variations in Teff (using satellite and CMIP5 export, respectively, Table 1), but underpredicts the difference between the tropics and subtropics while overpredicting the difference between subarctic regions and the AAZ (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preferential decomposition of fresh POM, exported rapidly during blooms and not subjected to intensive recycling in the surface, has also been hypothesized as a dominant control on remineralization depth (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seasonal ranges in NPP and export ratio of organic matter are therefore expected to correlate negatively with Teff (9, 30) but we find the opposite trend, suggesting that POM lability does not drive the large-scale pattern diagnosed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Of all of the variables we considered, the size structure of the surface phytoplankton community was the best predictor of particle transfer efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of photosynthetic biomass contributed by picoplankton (Fpico), which varies between 55% in the subtropics and less_than30% in subarctic regions (Fig 1B and ref 23), explains up to 93% of the variance in Teff between regions (Table 1 and Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, this relationship might arise from the size spectrum of exported particles, which skews toward small, slowly sinking particles when picoplankton dominate the community (12, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particle models with size-dependent sinking rates (32) predict that the observed difference in size spectra between regions with high and low Fpico (31) can fully account for the range of Teff that we found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore possible that the strong relationship between T100500m and Teff identified here (Table 1) and by others (8) emerges only from the spatial covariation of upper-ocean temperature and phytoplankton community structure, or that both factors combine to explain the diagnosed pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Antarctic zone of the Southern Ocean is an outlier (90% C.I.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  to the relationship between Fpico and both sets of Teff estimates (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reconcile this anomaly, we pursued a multiple linear regression model by combining Fpico with additional predictors, in turn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most significant improvement (P less_than 0.05) was achieved by including the ballast ratio (RB) of mineral (silicate+calcite) to POC export in the statistical model (Fig 4C),Teff=0.47-0.81Fpico+0.01RB(w/satelliteexport).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  [2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ballast minerals alone are a poor predictor of Teff (Table 1), but the elevated Si:POC export ratio in AAZ (Fig 1B) may account for the anomalously high Teff in that region, raising the total explained variance to 9798%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mineral content likely contributes to Teff variations through its ballasting effect on particle density and sinking rate (11), as observed in AAZ (24), but might also protect soft organic matter from microbial degradation (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Applying our statistical description of Teff (Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) to global distributions of Fpico and RB (Fig 5A and SI Materials and Methods) highlights the biases of the commonly used Martin curve relationship: It dramatically underpredicts POM transfer to the deep ocean throughout the high latitudes and overpredicts it in the low latitudes, with the exception of narrow coastal and equatorial upwelling zones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the importance of spatially varying transfer efficiency to the ocean carbon cycle, we estimated the sequestration of remineralized carbon in waters that remain out of contact with the atmosphere for at least 100 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used our OGCM to map the minimum depth at which the transport timescale to the surface exceeds 100 y (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of exported POM that reaches this sequestration depth was then computed based on our reconstructed flux profiles (Fig 5B and SI Materials and Methods), revealing the tropics and high latitudes as regions of efficient carbon sequestration (50%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The global mean sequestration rate predicted in this scenario (0.9 mol Cm2y1) is very similar to the prediction of a globally uniform Martin curve flux profile (Fig 5C and Fig S5 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the scenario with variable Teff sequesters 30% more carbon in high-latitude regions (40°N or less_than40°S) compared with the uniform case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models with a constant remineralization scale likely underpredict the sequestration of carbon exported in these regions, suggesting an even greater sensitivity of atmospheric pCO2 to high-latitude nutrient drawdown than previously recognized (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings also have important implications for the global carbon cycle in a warming climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the upper ocean warms and stratifies, subtropical biomes dominated by picoplankton that form small, slow-sinking particles are expected to expand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with direct effects of warming on microbial respiration, this might shoal the mean depth of organic particle remineralization and recirculate carbon to the surface mixed layer on shorter timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantifying and predicting these climate feedbacks will first require a deeper mechanistic understanding of the factors responsible for varying transfer efficiency in the modern ocean than our statistical analysis provides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be achieved using realistic models of particle size spectra, ballasting, and remineralization (11, 32), constrained by our diagnostic flux estimates and further guided by novel in situ respiration measurements (35) and size-resolved particle counts provided by visual profilers (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Comparison_with_Observed_Particle_Fluxes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our new particle flux reconstructions were designed to overcome the shortcomings of bottom-moored sediment trap data traditionally used to quantify the flux of organic matter to the deep ocean: They are subject to well-known collection biases (13) and are too sparsely deployed to accurately capture time mean, large-scale patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we compared our results to a large database of bottom-moored sediment trap measurements (25) as a reality check on the magnitude our reconstructed rates (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To facilitate comparison with our results, measured POC fluxes were converted to POP using the empirical stoichiometric algorithm of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26 in which organic P:C is related to the ambient [PO43] where the organic matter formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A P:C conversion factor was determined for each sediment trap observation using the closest surface [PO43] (WOA09) to the latitude/longitude of the trap deployment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After conversion, the observations were binned to the models vertical grid and into the eight ocean provinces considered here (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the sediment traps measure local rates and are too sparse to capture regional mean fluxes, we expanded the uncertainty estimates on our reconstructed flux profiles for this comparison (Fig S1) to reflect spatial variability in diagnosed FPOP within each region (envelopes in Fig 2 represent uncertainty in regional mean fluxes only).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the most part, observed particle fluxes fall well within the range of model-diagnosed rates in each region but tend to cluster toward the lower end of that range (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be explained by a number of factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, sediment traps may have been deployed at locations or times with particle fluxes lower than the large-scale time mean rates, although it seems unlikely that this would occur systematically across regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, diagnosed flux rates in the deep ocean may be systematically too large, which would occur if the models overturning circulation were unrealistically fast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find this unlikely given the observational constraints imposed on the model and its ability to accurately reproduce water mass age tracers (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the discrepancy might arise from the incomplete collection efficiency of bottom-moored sediment traps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that such a systematic collection bias has been observed for these instruments and discussed previously in the literature (13, 41), we find this explanation most likely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Export_Estimates  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis_of_Teff  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transfer efficiency estimates were correlated against five environmental and ecological factors that have been hypothesized to control particle sinking and remineralization rates (Table 1, Fig 4, and Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained global estimates of these factors and averaged regionally over the provinces in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The previous hypotheses are reviewed below, and the global estimates we compiled are discussed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Carbon_Sequestration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We investigated the implications of our results for ocean carbon storage, by computing the amount of remineralized CO2 that remains sequestered within the ocean interior for at least 100 y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we used our OGCM to determine the mean transport timescale to the surface mixed layer from each interior grid cell (the first passage time) using the methods described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51, and found the minimum depth at which this timescale exceeds 100 y (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was defined as the sequestration depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then mapped the fraction of organic matter exported from the euphotic zone that would reach this depth (the sequestered fraction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This requires a higher-resolution estimate of spatially varying particle flux profiles than is afforded by our regionally averaged reconstructions (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained this by defining a power-law flux profile at each latitude/longitude,FPOP(z)=FPOP(zeu)(z/zeu)b,[S6]where the exponent b is fit to the map of Teff derived from our statistical analysis (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we also mapped the sequestered fraction predicted by a spatially uniform Martin curve with the canonical exponent b = 0.86 (Fig S5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, to convert to actual carbon sequestration rates, we combined our estimates of sequestered fraction with a map of carbon export rates from the euphotic zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The export map was derived by averaging nine satellite estimates (SI Materials and Methods, Export Estimates) according to the regional weighting factors listed in Table S2 (each algorithm was weighted equally outside of these regions, e.g., in the Indian Ocean).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting carbon sequestration rates (Fig S5 C and D) were averaged over low latitudes (equatorward of 40°) and high (poleward of 40°) latitudes for a simple comparison between the Martin curve and variable Teff cases (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
