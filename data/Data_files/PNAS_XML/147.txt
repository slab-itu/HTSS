S1PR1-mediated IFNAR1 degradation modulates plasmacytoid dendritic cell interferon- autoamplification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1PR1) is known to act by multiple mechanisms: limiting lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphoid organs, suppressing proinflammatory endothelial cell function, and acting directly on neurons and astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P)-S1PR1 signaling in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) directly inhibits IFN- autoamplification by induced degradation of the interferon alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1) receptor and suppression of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An endosomal regulatory interaction of a lipid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and IFNAR1 balances effective and detrimental components of immune responses and provides a previously unidentified pathway that contributes to significant and unexpected efficacy in clinical trials in multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, and likely other diseases with aberrant IFN- signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Blunting immunopathology without abolishing host defense is the foundation for safe and effective modulation of infectious and autoimmune diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) agonists are effective in treating infectious and multiple autoimmune pathologies; however, mechanisms underlying their clinical efficacy are yet to be fully elucidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we uncover an unexpected mechanism of convergence between S1PR1 and interferon alpha receptor 1 (IFNAR1) signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of S1PR1 signaling by pharmacological tools or endogenous ligand sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) inhibits type 1 IFN responses that exacerbate numerous pathogenic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, S1PR1 selectively suppresses the type I IFN autoamplification loop in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a specialized DC subset, for robust type I IFN release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1PR1 agonist suppression is pertussis toxin-resistant, but inhibited by an S1PR1 C-terminalderived transactivating transcriptional activator (Tat)-fusion peptide that blocks receptor internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1PR1 agonist treatment accelerates turnover of IFNAR1, suppresses signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation, and down-modulates total STAT1 levels, thereby inactivating the autoamplification loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of S1P-S1PR1 signaling in vivo using the selective antagonist Ex26 significantly elevates IFN- production in response to CpG-A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that S1PR1 signaling sets the sensitivity of pDC amplification of IFN responses, thereby blunting pathogenic immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data illustrate a lipid G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)-IFNAR1 regulatory loop that balances effective and detrimental immune responses and elevated endogenous S1PR1 signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism will likely be advantageous in individuals subject to a range of inflammatory conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand how S1PR1 signaling regulates IFN- and cytokine amplification, we assessed the pulmonary cell subsets that produce IFN- and cytokines/chemokines following influenza virus challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although many cell types produce IFN- following virus infection, two major pulmonary cell populations make significant quantities of IFN- in vivo following respiratory virus infection, alveolar macrophages and pDCs (11); thus, we initially focused on these populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We depleted pDCs from mice before influenza virus challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of pDCs before influenza virus challenge significantly reduced IFN- levels following influenza virus infection, as well as CCL2, CCL5, and IL-6 levels (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked whether treatment of fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)purified pDCs ( greater than 90%) from the spleen or lung with the selective S1PR1 agonist CYM-5442 (Table 1) could inhibit the production of IFN- following stimulation with influenza virus in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection of pDCs with influenza virus followed by CYM-5442 treatment resulted in the inhibition of IFN- production (Fig 1A) at an IC50 of 1.4 M, as well as an IC50 of 500 nM using the highly potent S1PR1 agonist RP-001 (11), demonstrating direct inhibition of IFN- production from pDCs by S1PR1 agonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the IC50 of S1PR1 agonist CYM-5442 required to inhibit IFN- amplification exceeds the IC50 required to activate Gi/Go signaling, suggesting a nonGi/Go-mediated mechanism for the suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of S1PR1 has not been reported in pDCs; thus, we assessed whether S1PR1 could be detected on pDCs purified from lung and spleen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the S1PR1-EGFP mice described previously (11), we determined that FACS-purified pDCs (CD11cint, B220+, PDCA-1+, and Siglec H+) expressed significant levels of S1PR1 as determined by detection of S1PR1-EGFP by flow cytometry and immunoblotting (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that CYM-5442 suppression of cytokine amplification during influenza virus challenge correlates with S1PR1 expression in pDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next asked whether pDC IFN- production requires S1PR1 agonism or if it can be replicated with a neutral antagonist of S1PR1 signaling (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate sufficient quantities of functional pDCs, we used i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hydrodynamic injection of a plasmid encoding the human Flt3 ligand gene (hFlt3L) into a mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method allowed for the generation of large numbers of quiescent pDCs in vivo, which express pDC cell surface markers and produce significant quantities of IFN- following stimulation with influenza virus or CpG-A DNA (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of purified mouse pDCs with the S1PR1 antagonist W146 (Table 1) increased IFN- production from pDCs (Fig 1B), indicating that suppression of pDC IFN- production requires S1PR1 signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, CYM-5442 treatment of pDCs following influenza virus stimulation prevented IFN- protein expression as measured by intracellular cytokine staining (Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed pharmacological inhibition of IFN- production in human pDCs following CYM-5442 treatment (Fig 1 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inability of a neutral S1PR1 antagonist to inhibit IFN- amplification was confirmed in human pDCs using the potent and selective Ex26 S1PR1 antagonist (13) (Fig 1E and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because S1PR1 signaling suppressed IFN- production from pDCs following influenza virus stimulation, which likely occurs through TLR7 signaling, we asked if CYM-5442 could also modulate TLR9 signaling in pDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two classes of immunostimulatory oligonucleotides were demonstrated to activate pDCs differentially through TLR9 stimulation (14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of pDC with CpG-A or influenza virus resulted in elevated IFN- secretion similar to previous reports, and treatment with CYM-5442 inhibited IFN- induction upon both CpG-A and influenza virus stimulation (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, treatment with CYM-5442 had no effect following CpG-B stimulation (Fig 2A), suggesting that S1PR1 agonist targets suppression of TLR9 signaling in the early endosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, CYM-5442 treatment of pDCs isolated from the peripheral blood of human donors displayed similar suppressive capacity following CpG-A stimulation and no effect following CpG-B stimulation (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because CpG-A and CpG-B are known to localize to different intracellular compartments (14), we asked whether S1PR1 agonist-mediated suppression was specific to endosome signaling in pDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To alter CpG-B trafficking, the cationic lipid N-[1-(2,3-Dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl-sulfate (DOTAP) was used to encapsulate CpG-B; this approach results in redistribution of CpG-B to early endosomes, resulting in an increase in IFN- production to levels similar to CpG-A stimulation (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Redistributing CpG-B to the endosome resulted in both IFN- secretion (Fig 2C) and CYM-5442induced suppression of IFN- production as observed following CpG-A stimulation in both murine (Fig 2C) and human (Fig 2D) pDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The S1PR1 is a heptahelical receptor that interacts with auxiliary proteins through the third intracellular loop (Gi/Go) or the C-terminal tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Canonical signaling through the third intracellular loop involves interaction with the Gi/Go protein, whereas signaling through the C-terminal tail involves transient interactions with ubiquitin ligase, GRK2, and -Arrestin (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if Gi/Go signaling is involved in the suppression of IFN-, PT was used to prevent S1PR1 signaling through Gi/Go.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of pDCs with PT alone following influenza virus (Fig 3A) or CpG-A (Fig 3B) stimulation resulted in modest but significant inhibition of IFN- production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, treatment of pDC with CYM-5442, in the presence or absence of PT, suppressed IFN- secretion following both influenza virus (Fig 3A) and CpG-A stimulation (Fig 3B), suggesting that S1PR1-mediated suppression of IFN- production does not require Gi/Go signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these data are in agreement with our suppression data with CYM-5442 (which has an IC50 for Gi/Go signaling of 1.2 nM) and support a nonGi/Go-mediated mechanism of suppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next investigated the involvement of the S1PR1 C terminus using an inhibitory peptide mimic of the S1PR1 C terminus consisting of an HIV Tat sequence coupled to amino acids that correspond to the C terminus of S1PR1 (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IFN- response to CpG-A was similar in pDCs treated with either CYM-5442 alone or with CYM-5442 and a control scrambled C-terminal peptide (control peptide) (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, inhibition of CpG-Ainduced IFN- production by CYM-5442 was lost in pDCs in the presence of the C-terminal Tat-coupled peptide, with IFN- detected at levels similar to vehicle treatment (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The C-terminal S1PR1-signaling requirement to suppress IFN- amplification in pDCs caused us to hypothesize that S1PR1 agonist treatment redirects pDC signaling components for degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Agonist signaling on S1PR1 is well known to induce S1PR1 internalization, culminating in S1PR1 sorting to lysosomes (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although TLR7 and TLR9 both appear to be within 40 nm of S1PR1 based upon proximity ligation assay (PLA) data (Fig S4), a constitutive PLA signal is seen in the presence of W146, and only a modest change in PLA signal is observed with CYM-5442 stimulation (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant degradation of either TLR7 or TLR9 was observed by Western blot analysis in the presence of either W146 or CYM-5442 (Fig S5), and no redistribution of TLR9 was detected by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that S1PR1 agonist suppression of cytokine amplification in vivo requires IFN- signaling coupled to the requirement of an IFNAR1 autocrine feedback loop for IFN- amplification (19), we hypothesized that S1PR1 signaling in pDCs modifies the IFN- amplification loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the ability of S1PR1 signaling to modulate IFN- amplification, we isolated pDCs from WT or IFNAR1-KO mice and stimulated them with CpG-A in the presence or absence of CYM-5442.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of IFNAR1 in pDCs resulted in the suppression of IFN- amplification following CpG-A stimulation (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, CYM-5442 had no effect on IFN- production in IFNAR1/ pDCs (Fig 4A), suggesting that S1PR1 signaling inhibits an IFN- autocrine feedback loop in pDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next asked if IFNAR1 expression or signaling was differentially modulated following S1PR1 agonist or antagonist treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFNAR1 protein levels were significantly reduced and smaller IFNAR1 species were observed in the presence of CYM-5442 compared with W146 (Fig 4B), suggesting that IFNAR1 is being degraded following S1PR1 agonist treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, direct stimulation of pDCs with exogenous IFN- in the presence of CYM-5442, but not W146, resulted in diminished STAT1 levels and phosphorylation (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Down-modulation of total STAT1 is likely a consequence of IFNAR1 turnover, because diminished STAT1 levels are seen in pDC from IFNAR1/ mice (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CYM-5442 treatment did not alter IFNAR2 expression in pDCs following stimulation with exogenous IFN-I (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine IFNAR1 subcellular localization, pDCs were imaged using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were treated with either W-146 or CYM-5442 and labeled with Abs for S1P1-GFP (green), IFNAR1 (red), and LAMP1 (orange), and the nucleus was stained with Hoechst (blue) (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with W-146 showed S1PR1 and IFNAR1 receptors colocalized to the plasma membrane (Fig 4D), whereas CYM-5442treated cells showed S1PR1 and IFNAR1 internalization, with significant colocalization of S1PR1 and IFNAR1 in LAMP1+ terminal lysosomes (Fig 4 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This subcellular reorganization indicates that S1PR1 agonist-induced IFNAR1 internalization directs both receptors toward a degradation pathway, preventing IFN- signaling and cytokine autoamplification (Fig 4 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimal requirement for CYM-5442induced degradation of IFNAR1 appears to be coexpression of the receptors, because the internalization/degradation paradigm can be reconstituted in Jump-In HEK 293 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reconstitution is achieved by transfecting S1PR1-EGFP, into HEK cells, resulting in S1PR1 ligand-dependent internalization and degradation of endogenously expressed IFNAR1 (Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether the S1PR1 natural ligand, S1P, suppresses IFN- amplification, human pDCs were treated with physiologically relevant concentrations of S1P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with S1P resulted in significant suppression of IFN- production (Fig 4F) and inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation (Fig 4G) in CpG-Astimulated pDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also asked whether blocking of S1PR1 signaling in vivo would alter IFN- amplification following CpG-A administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administering CpG-ADOTAP in the presence of the S1PR1 antagonist Ex26 significantly increased IFN- protein in the serum compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig 4H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
S1PR1 is not highly expressed on all leukocyte populations, with very low expression on myeloid DCs and alveolar macrophages (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1PR1 expression in pDCs and its functional coupling to turnover of IFNAR1 and STAT1 down-modulation may reflect an evolutionary pathway suited to therapeutic exploitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that S1PR1 agonism protects from influenza and mouse pulmonary virus immunopathology while allowing full development of sterilizing immunity, neutralizing Abs, and quantitatively normal immunological memory (10, 2023).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, blunting, but not abolishing, IFN-I amplification by the S1P/S1PR1 signaling axis allows host defense from pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1PR1 signaling is therefore a potential selective advantage in the face of acute pathogens, such as influenza, by limiting excessive amplification of the IFN- response, and the resulting detrimental collateral tissue damage, while allowing pathogen sterilization through adaptive immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
S1PR1 agonists are effective in treating multiple autoimmune conditions, including multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis, where clinical efficacy is only partially explained by sequestration of circulating lymphocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the sustained immune modulatory effects is important for extending treatment in additional autoimmune and infectious pathologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report here that the key innate cell subset, the pDC, is a direct target of S1PR1 drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we show that S1PR1 signaling promotes IFNAR1 internalization and degradation, resulting in attenuation of IFNAR1-mediated IFN- and cytokine amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amplification of IFN- in vivo by blocking S1PR1 function using the neutral antagonist Ex26 further suggests that endogenous S1P-S1PR1 signaling can dampen IFN-I responses physiologically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further postulate that other G protein-coupled receptors may use similar mechanisms to regulate IFN-I amplification and possibly other diverse biological responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because pDCs are causal effectors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders, including lupus and psoriasis (24), and have been linked to disease progression in animal models of multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis (25, 26), our study indicates that the efficacy of S1PR1 therapies in these disease states may manifest through attenuation of an IFNAR1 cytokine amplification loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of this pathway in therapeutic efficacy and as a biomarker for patient subsets that might benefit from S1PR1 agonist therapies warrants exploration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Purified pDCs were treated in 10% (vol/vol) FBS (charcoal-stripped), 1× penicillin and streptomycin, sodium pyruvate, and NEAA as described in Fig S4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1 h, cells were treated with 1 m of CpG-A 2336 for 2 h. After 2 h, cells were placed in a V-bottom 96-well plate and were briefly acid-washed twice with a solution of 200 mM acetic acid and 500 mM NaCl, followed by a 1× PBS wash.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were plated on poly-d-Lys coverslips and fixed with 3.7% PFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton-X for 15 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PLA proceeded essentially as described by the manufacturer (Olink Bioscience).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abs were purchased from Abcam and used at a 1:50 dilution (anti-TLR9 37154 and anti-GFP 5450).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were incubated with the primary Ab for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidity chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this step, the PLA proceeded essentially as described by the manufacturer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PLA for TLR7 and S1P1-GFP was performed by incubating pDCs on poly-d-Lys coverslips for 1 h and fixation with 3.7% PFA for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and permeabilized with digitonin (50 g/mL)-PBS for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were incubated with anti-TLR7 (IMG-581A; Novus Biologics) and anti-GFP (ab6673; Abcam), and the PLA was performed as described by the manufacturer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Human_p-STAT1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human pDCs were stimulated with 1 M CpG-A 2216 and treated with vehicle, CYM-5442, or S1P for 18 h. Cells were pelleted, solubilized, and loaded onto a gel as previously described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gel was transferred to PVDF membranes and immunoblotted with anti-pStat1 or anti-Actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phospho-STAT1 and -Actin levels were analyzed by densitometer readings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phospho-Stat1 levels were then normalized to the respective -Actin levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized measurements were used to calculate relative density, with lane 1 serving as the standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_S1P_Competition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Six- to eight-week-old C57BL/6 female mice were injected i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with 8 g of CpG complexed with DOTAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were then injected i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with either 100 L 50 mM sodium carbonate or 100 L of Ex26 (5 mg/mL) dissolved in 50 mM sodium carbonate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 6 h, the mice were killed, and blood was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The serum was collected by removing the supernatant, and the IFN- levels were examined by ELISA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
