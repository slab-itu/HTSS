Adjuvant effect of the novel TLR1/TLR2 agonist Diprovocim synergizes with antiPD-L1 to eliminate melanoma in mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adjuvants enhance adaptive immune responses, sometimes through unknown mechanisms, and can be used to augment both humoral and cellular responses to cancer antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report the immunological effects of the synthetic chemical adjuvant Diprovocim, which targets the innate immune receptor TLR1/TLR2 in mice and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diprovocim displayed strong adjuvant activity in mice, particularly abetting cellular immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunization against a genetically engineered tumor-specific antigen, ovalbumin, when adjuvanted with Diprovocim, inhibited growth of B16 melanoma and prolonged survival in the presence of immune checkpoint blockade by antiPD-L1; 100% of mice responded to treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest Diprovocim boosts the success of antiPD-L1 treatment by increasing the number and activation of tumor-specific CTLs capable of responding to this checkpoint inhibitor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Successful cancer immunotherapy entails activation of innate immune receptors to promote dendritic cell (DC) maturation, antigen presentation, up-regulation of costimulatory molecules, and cytokine secretion, leading to activation of tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we screened a synthetic library of 100,000 compounds for innate immune activators using TNF production by THP-1 cells as a readout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified and optimized a potent human and mouse Toll-like receptor (TLR)1/TLR2 agonist, Diprovocim, which exhibited an EC50 of 110 pM in human THP-1 cells and 1.3 nM in primary mouse peritoneal macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, Diprovocim-adjuvanted ovalbumin immunization promoted antigen-specific humoral and CTL responses and synergized with antiPD-L1 treatment to inhibit tumor growth, generating long-term antitumor memory, curing or prolonging survival of mice engrafted with the murine melanoma B16-OVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diprovocim induced greater frequencies of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes than alum, of which CD8 T cells were necessary for the antitumor effect of immunization plus antiPD-L1 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Diprovocim_Induces_Cytokine_Production_in_both_Human_and_Mouse_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From a chemical library containing 100,000 members, we identified a class of compounds with bilateral symmetry capable of activating TNF biosynthesis in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated human THP-1 myeloid cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial members of the class emerged from an undisclosed compound sublibrary designed to promote cell surface receptor dimerization (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diprovocim (Fig 1A) was developed from this class after extensive structureactivity relationship (SAR) studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It induced dose-dependent TNF production by THP-1 cells (EC50 110 pM) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (EC50 875 pM) (Fig 1 B and C) and by mouse peritoneal macrophages (EC50 1.3 nM) and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) (EC50 6.7 nM) (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to TNF, Diprovocim induced IL-6 production by mouse BMDC (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Diprovocim failed to stimulate type I IFN production by mouse peritoneal macrophages (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diprovocim_Targets_TLR1_TLR2_and_Activates_Downstream_MAPK_and_NF-B_Signaling_Pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the molecular target of Diprovocim, we analyzed its effects on peritoneal macrophages from wild-type C57BL/6J mice and C57BL/6J mice deficient in various TLR signaling components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of TNF by Diprovocim was completely absent in TLR1- or TLR2-deficient macrophages but not in TLR-6 deficient macrophages (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diprovocim activity was also dramatically reduced in macrophages from MyD88-, TIRAP-, and IRAK4-deficient cells (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that Diprovocim targets the mouse TLR1/TLR2 heterodimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TLR1 or TLR2 antibody significantly reduced the effect of Diprovocim on THP-1 cells, indicating that human TLR1/TLR2 is also a target of Diprovocim (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diprovocim induced phosphorylation of IKK, IKK, p38, JNK, and ERK, as well as degradation of IB in THP-1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages, indicating that Diprovocim activates conventional TLR1/TLR2 signaling, including MAPK and canonical NF-B signaling (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diprovocim_Exhibits_Adjuvant_Activity_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Intramuscular immunization of wild-type mice with ovalbumin (OVA) plus either alum or Diprovocim induced similar levels of serum OVA-specific IgG, which were highly elevated compared with levels induced by immunization with OVA plus vehicle (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas immunization with OVA + alum induced primarily the Th2-related Ig subclass IgG1, OVA + Diprovocim induced both IgG1 and the Th1-related IgG2b (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
DCs purified from draining lymph nodes and spleens 24 h after immunization of mice with OVA + Diprovocim activated OT-I CD8 T cells cocultured with them, as evidenced by CD69 up-regulation on the OT-I cells (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, DCs from mice immunized with OVA + vehicle failed to induce CD69 expression on OT-I CD8 T cells (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests that Diprovocim activates antigen cross-presentation by DCs and cross-priming of CD8 T cells in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate whether cross-priming stimulated by Diprovocim results in the development of killing ability by CD8+ T cells in vivo, a CTL killing assay was performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent labeled and OVA peptide (aa 257263)-pulsed target cells were injected i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  into mice immunized with OVA + Diprovocim, and the number of live target cells was measured by flow cytometry 2 d later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 70% of target cells had been eliminated in mice immunized with OVA + Diprovocim, compared with 10% in mice immunized with OVA + vehicle (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that Diprovocim exhibits adjuvant activity in antigen-specific antibody production and CTL killing, which was abrogated in TLR1- and/or TLR2-deficient mice (Fig 3 AC, F, and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Complete_Inhibition_of_B16_Tumor_Growth_by_Combined_Checkpoint_Blockade_and_Anticancer_Vaccine_Adjuvanted_with_Diprovocim  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested the adjuvant activity of Diprovocim in preventive immunization of wild-type mice against B16 melanoma expressing OVA (B16-OVA) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were injected i.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  distal to the tumor cell injection site with OVA with or without Diprovocim on the same day but before inoculation with B16-OVA cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor growth rates and survival times were similar for mice immunized with vehicle alone, Diprovocim alone, or OVA alone (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to OVA alone, immunization with Diprovocim + OVA modestly but significantly slowed tumor growth rate but failed to prolong survival; a similar effect was observed with OVA immunization combined with antiPD-L1 treatment (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, although without effect by itself (SI Appendix, Fig S2), when antiPD-L1 treatment was added to Diprovocim + OVA immunization, there was complete inhibition of tumor growth and 100% survival through 8 wk of observation (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dramatic antitumor effect was dependent on OVA immunization because Diprovocim alone combined with antiPD-L1 treatment had no effect on tumor growth or mouse survival (Fig 4 D and E); this finding is consistent with poor immunogenicity of B16 melanoma (1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether surviving mice were endowed with specific and long-term memory directed against the cancer antigen, we rechallenged the 5-wk survivors from Fig 4C with B16-OVA cells and B16 cells lacking OVA (B16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of any further therapy, we observed complete failure of B16-OVA tumor growth, whereas B16 tumors grew rapidly (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both B16 and B16-OVA tumor cells grew at similar rates in na√Øve C57BL/6J mice (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that when used as an adjuvant in a cancer vaccine, Diprovocim promotes antigen-specific antitumor immunity, which is greatly enhanced when combined with T cell checkpoint blockade in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunization with Diprovocim as an adjuvant produces antigen-specific memory responses that protect the host from relapse of tumor growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We tested the antitumor effect of Diprovocim in therapeutic immunization of mice with already established B16-OVA tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C57BL/6J mice were immunized with OVA with or without Diprovocim on the day of or 3 d after tumor inoculation and received a booster immunization 7 d later (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some mice, alum was substituted for Diprovocim to permit direct comparison between these two adjuvants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all conditions, antiPD-L1 treatment was initiated on day 3 after tumor inoculation and repeated every 3 d thereafter for 12 d. Mice immunized with OVA alone on the day of tumor inoculation survived an average of 24 d, and 100% of mice (8/8) died by 38 d after tumor inoculation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, Diprovocim + OVA administered on the day of tumor inoculation completely inhibited tumor growth, permitting 100% of mice (8/8) to survive through 54 d of observation (Fig 4 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When alum was used instead of Diprovocim in the same experiment, tumor growth was partially inhibited, and the average survival time was 37 d, with 25% of mice (2/8) surviving past 54 d (Fig 4 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When immunization was delayed until 3 d after tumor inoculation, Diprovocim + OVA still significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged average survival compared with OVA alone (41 d vs. 22 d) (Fig 4 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, alum + OVA inhibited tumor growth but only slightly increased average survival time (30 d); the survival curve for alum + OVA was not significantly different from the curve for OVA alone (P = 0.082) (Fig 4 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pretumor and posttumor treatment, the effect of Diprovocim on tumor growth, survival rate, and survival time was superior to that of alum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Diprovocim_Enhances_Antitumor_CTL_Responses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the cellular mechanism by which combined antiPD-L1 treatment and Diprovocim-adjuvanted immunization eliminates tumors, we analyzed the tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) of mice immunized with Diprovocim + OVA or alum + OVA 3 d after tumor inoculation (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumors were collected 14 d after inoculation, and single-cell suspensions were antibody stained and analyzed by flow cytometry to detect total leukocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells, NK cells, DCs, and macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leukocytes were also stained with antibody to the H-2Kb MHC-class I tetramer bound to the OVA peptide (aa 257264), as well as antibody against CD8 to identify tumor-specific CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OVA immunizations containing Diprovocim significantly increased the frequency of leukocytes in tumors compared with vehicle + OVA (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis of these TILs revealed that Diprovocim increased the frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T cells including activated CD4 and CD8 T cells (CD44high) and OVA-specific CD8 T cells, as well as the frequency of NK cells (Fig 5 CH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alum + OVA immunization showed a trend toward increasing TILs (Fig 5B), which reached statistical significance for total and CD44high CD8 T cells (Fig 5 E and F); however, the magnitude of the increase was reduced compared with that induced by Diprovocim + OVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OVA-specific CD8 T cells were not increased by alum + OVA immunization (Fig 5G) on day 14 after tumor inoculation; neither were total and CD44high CD4 T cells (Fig 5 C and D), nor NK cells compared with vehicle + OVA (Fig 5H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequencies of intratumor DCs and macrophages were similar for mice immunized with vehicle + OVA, Diprovocim + OVA, and alum + OVA (Fig 5 I and J).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these data indicate that the intratumor frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T cells, activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, OVA-specific CD8 T cells, and NK cells, but not DCs or macrophages, correlated with the antitumor effects of Diprovocim and alum in immunized mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the immune cell population(s) necessary for the antitumor effect of Diprovocim + OVA plus antiPD-L1, we depleted mice of CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells, NK cells, or all three cell populations using cell type-specific antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depletion antibodies were administered i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  on the day of B16-OVA tumor inoculation (day 0) and every 3 d thereafter for 15 d (Fig 5K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of Diprovocim + OVA on both tumor growth and mouse survival was abrogated when mice were depleted of CD8 T cells or all three cell types together (CD4 T, CD8 T, and NK cells) (Fig 5 L and M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, depletion of CD4 T cells or NK cells had little effect on the antitumor activity of Diprorocim + OVA (Fig 5 L and M).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted a slight, statistically significant difference between the effects of CD8 T cell depletion vs. CD4 + CD8 + NK cell depletion on tumor growth in mice treated with Diprovocim + OVA plus antiPD-L1, in which tumor growth was greater in mice depleted of all three cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this difference did not translate to a difference in either survival rate or time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding suggests a minor role of either CD4 T cells, NK cells, or both, in mediating the antitumor effects of Diprovocim + OVA plus antiPD-L1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that CD8 T cells are necessary for tumor eradication by therapeutic Diprovocim + OVA immunization and checkpoint inhibition in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is believed that cancer vaccines targeted to tumor neoantigens can boost the success of immune checkpoint inhibition for cancer treatment by increasing the number and activation of tumor-specific CTLs capable of responding to checkpoint inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the type and magnitude of the T cell response to immunization depends critically on the vaccine adjuvant; currently, only few adjuvants are approved for use in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the actions of a potent adjuvant, Diprovocim, that engages and activates human and mouse TLR1/TLR2 heterodimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diprovocim bears no structural similarity to other reported synthetic chemical ligands, nor to the natural ligands that activate TLR1/TLR2 (2226).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diprovocim is more potent and efficacious in activating human TLR1/TLR2 than Pam3CSK4 (SI Appendix, Fig S3), a well-known ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, Diprovocim induces strong TLR1- and TLR2-dependent humoral and CTL responses to a coadministered antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When combined with checkpoint inhibition, Diprovocim-adjuvanted immunization causes antigen-specific eradication of a rapidly fatal tumor and induces memory responses capable of preventing tumor regrowth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cure of the tumor is observed despite the fact that checkpoint inhibition alone is insufficient to prevent a fatal outcome (SI Appendix, Fig S2), supporting the premise of this combination immunotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our data support the following key mechanistic events mediating the antitumor effect of Diprovocim-adjuvanted immunization plus checkpoint inhibition (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diprovocim binds to TLR1/TLR2 on APCs, activating them to produce proinflammatory cytokines and take up the administered tumor-specific antigens for processing and presentation via MHC I and MHC II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antigen presentation, costimulatory molecule expression, and cytokine secretion by APCs induce proliferation and activation of antigen-specific CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, which develop cytolytic activity toward tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NK cells are also activated by proinflammatory cytokines and infiltrate the tumor site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of antiPD-L1 inhibits the major immunosuppressive mechanism active in the tumor microenvironment, permitting uninhibited T cell activation and proliferation in response to TCR/CD28 ligation (2729), further promoting tumor cell lysis mediated by CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Numerous reports document both protumorigenic and antitumorigenic effects of TLR2 signaling, which may depend on the cell type or type of cancer under study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, TLR2 signaling supports tumor growth through induction of immune suppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and activation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (3032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, TLR2 signaling also promotes tumor regression by stimulating DC activation and cross-presentation (33) and down-regulating Treg function (3436).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that for Diprovocim, the overall outcome of systemic TLR2 activation, in the context of OVA immunization combined with immune checkpoint inhibition, was tumor cell lysis and tumor growth inhibition mediated by tumor-infiltrating antigen-specific CD8 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The therapeutic index of an adjuvant presumably depends upon the efficiency of conjoint targeting of antigen to an APC and activation of that APC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mode of interaction between Diprovocim and TLR2 has been studied by X-ray crystallography, and its contacts with this subunit of the receptor will be reported elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of the DiprovocimTLR1/TLR2 complex points to opportunities for Diprovocim modification to incorporate immunogenic peptides, which might allow optimization of the therapeutic index by assuring that all active Diprovocim molecules are accompanied by antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diprovocim is easy to synthesize and can be rapidly adapted to incorporate tumor-associated antigens and neoantigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features make it an attractive candidate for clinical development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C57BL/6J, Tlr2/, Myd88/, and OT-I mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ly96/ (MD-2/) mice were from Riken BioResource Research Center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tlr4lps3/lps3, Tlr6int/int, Tlr7rsq1/rsq1, Tiraptor/tor, Ticam1Lps2/Lps2, and Ticam1Lps2/Lps2/Irak4otiose/otiose mice were generated on a pure C57BL/6J background by ENU mutagenesis and are described at mutagenetix.utsouthwestern.edu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tlr1/ mice were created by CRISPR/Cas 9 gene targeting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Female C57BL/6J mice were superovulated by injection of 6.5 U pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG; Millipore), followed by injection of 6.5 U human CG (hCG; SigmaAldrich) 48 h later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The superovulated mice were subsequently mated overnight with C57BL/6J male mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following day, fertilized eggs were collected from the oviducts, and in vitro-transcribed Cas9 mRNA (50 ng/L) and Tlr1 small base-pairing guide RNA (50 ng/L; 5-CAAACCGATCGTAGTGCTGA-3) were injected into the cytoplasm or pronucleus of the embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injected embryos were cultured in M16 medium (SigmaAldrich) at 37 ¬∞C in 5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the production of mutant mice, two-cell stage embryos were transferred into the ampulla of the oviduct (1020 embryos per oviduct) of pseudopregnant Hsd:ICR (CD-1) female mice (Harlan Laboratories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All experimental procedures using mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and were conducted in accordance with institutionally approved protocols and guidelines for animal care and use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the mice were maintained at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in accordance with institutionally approved protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were recovered 4 d after i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of 2 mL BBL thioglycollate medium, brewer modified (4% wt/vol; BD Biosciences) by peritoneal lavage with 5 mL PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peritoneal macrophages were cultured in DMEM cell culture medium [DMEM containing 10% vol/vol FBS (Gemini Bio Products), 1% vol/vol penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies)] at 37 ¬∞C and 95% air/5% CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For murine BMDCs, bone marrow cells were cultured in Petri dishes in 10 mL DMEM cell culture medium containing 10 ng/mL of murine GM-CSF (R&D Systems).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 3 of culture, this was replaced with fresh GM-CSF medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loosely adherent cells were transferred to a fresh Petri dish and cultured for an additional 4 d. Human PBMC were purchased from Stemcell Technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  THP-1 (American Type Culture Collection) cells were differentiated by treatment with 100 nM PMA (Sigma) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) cell culture medium [RPMI containing 10% vol/vol FBS (Gemini Bio Products), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies)] for 24 h. After that, cells were washed with PBS and cultured in fresh RPMI cell culture medium for 24 h before use in experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_Cytokine_Production  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at 1 √ó 105 cells per well and stimulated with Diprovocim [dissolved in DMSO, and final DMSO concentrations (0.2%) were kept constant in all experiments] for 4 h. Mouse TNF, IL-6, or IFN- or human TNF in the supernatants were measured by ELISA kits according to the manufacturers instructions (eBioscience and PBL Assay Science).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pretreatment with 20 g/mL anti-TLR1, anti-TLR2, or isotype control antibody (eBioscience) was for 1 h. Unless otherwise indicated, mouse cells were from wild-type C57BL/6J mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Western_Blotting  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mouse peritoneal macrophages or human THP-1 cells (1 √ó 106 per well) were stimulated in 12-well plates with Diprovocim at 500 nM for mouse cells or 5 nM for human cells for the indicated times and lysed directly in sample buffer (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell lysates were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membranes were probed with the following antibodies: phospho-IKK (Ser176)/IKK (Ser177), IB, phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (Cell Signaling Technology), and -Actin (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

EndoFit ovalbumin (OVA) with 98% purity minimum (SDS/PAGE) and endotoxin levels less_than1 EU/mg was purchased from Invivogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice (four mice per group) were immunized i.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with 100 g OVA mixed with vehicle (DMSO:Tween 80:saline = 1:1:8), with 10 mg/kg Diprovocim, or with 2 mg/kg Alum (Alhydrogel adjuvant 2%; Invivogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 14 d, serum titers of OVA-specific IgG, IgG1, or IgG2b (SouthernBiotech) were measured by ELISA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

In_Vivo_CTL_Killing_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C57BL/6J male mice were injected i.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with 100 g OVA plus 10 mg/kg Diprovocim (n = 4 mice per group).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One week later, naive C57BL/6J mice were killed, and splenocytes were collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Half of the splenocytes were left unpulsed, and half were pulsed with OVA257263 peptides for 2 h in complete medium (RPMI containing 10% vol/vol FBS, 1% penicillin and streptomycin) at 37 ¬∞C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unpulsed and peptide-pulsed cells were labeled with 0.5 M (low) or 5 M (high) CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen), respectively, in serum-free medium for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal numbers (2 √ó 106) of CellTrace Violethigh (OVA pulsed) and CellTrace Violetlow (unpulsed) cells were mixed together and injected i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  into the immunized mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h, blood from treated mice was collected and subjected to flow cytometry analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numbers of remaining live CellTrace Violethigh and CellTrace Violetlow cells were determined and used to calculate the percentage of OVA peptide-pulsed target cells killed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific killing was defined as the ratio = CellTrace Violetlow cells/CellTrace Violethigh cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of target cell lysis = (1  unimmunized ratio/immunized ratio) √ó 100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A total of 2 √ó 105 B16-OVA cells in 100 L PBS were injected s.c. into the flank of each mouse to establish tumors (n = 6 mice per treatment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 3 after tumor inoculation, 10 mg/kg Diprovocim or 2 mg/kg alum with OVA (100 g) was injected i.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  into mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice received a booster shot 7 d after the first immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 3, 6, 9, and 12 after tumor inoculation, mice were also injected i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with 200 g antimPD-L1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 14 after tumor inoculation, tumors were harvested, minced, and filtered through a 40-m strainer to obtain single-cell suspensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red blood cells were lysed with RBC lysis buffer (Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After pelleting, cells were stained with a mixture of antibodies for 45 min, including anti-mouse CD45.2-PE or CD45.2-APC (BioLegend), anti-mouse CD3-FITC (BD Biosciences), anti-mouse CD4-BV786 (BD Biosciences), anti-mouse CD8-BV510 (BioLegend), anti-mouse CD44-PE-CF594 (BioLegend), APC-conjugated H-2Kb/OVA (SIINFEKL) tetramer (Baylor College of Medicine), anti-mouse F4/80-PE (Tonbo Bioscience), anti-mouse CD11b-BV605 (BioLegend), antiCD11c-BV711 (BD Biosciences), and antiNK1.1-BV650 (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the cells were washed twice with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stained cells were analyzed with an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Measurement_of_Cross-Priming_of_CD8_T_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
C57BL/6J male mice were injected i.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with 100 g OVA mixed with vehicle or with 10 mg/kg Diprovocim (n = 4 mice per treatment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-four hours later, DCs from draining lymph nodes and spleen were purified by Mouse Pan Dendritic Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD8 T cells from OT-I transgenic mice were purified by Mouse CD8+ T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotech).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, 3 √ó 105 DCs were cocultured with 3 √ó 105 OT-I CD8 T cells in RPMI medium containing 10% vol/vol FBS and 1% vol/vol penicillin and streptomycin for 24 h. Then, cells were collected and stained with anti-mouse CD3-FITC, anti-mouse CD8-BV510, and anti-mouse CD69-PE-CF594 (BioLegend) for 45 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the cells were washed twice with PBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stained cells were analyzed with an LSRII instrument, and the flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Data represent means ¬± SEM in all graphs depicting error bars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical significance of differences between experimental groups was determined using GraphPad Prism 7 and the indicated statistical tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparisons of differences between two unpaired experimental groups, an unpaired Students t test was used, and two-tailed P values are reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values are indicated by *P  0.05, **P  0.01, ***P  0.001, and ****P  0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P  0.05 was considered statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
