Cocapture of cognate and bystander antigens can activate autoreactive B cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The immune system normally produces antibodies against pathogens and avoids making antibodies against self-proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some individuals, antibodies against self-proteins (autoantibodies) are made and can cause debilitating disease, but the reasons for this failure of self-tolerance are not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments described test the following hypothesis linking viral infections and production of autoantibodies: A B cell whose immunoglobulin receptor recognizes a self-membrane protein can capture that protein from the membrane of a virus-infected cell and simultaneously cocapture viral proteins; fragments of the viral protein can then be presented to antiviral T cells and qualify for the positive signals for proliferation and antibody production known as T-cell help.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed this phenomenon in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Autoantibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) are associated with autoimmune central nervous system diseases like acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ADEM, it is speculated that a preceding infection is the trigger of the autoimmune response, but the mechanism connecting the infection to the production of MOG antibodies remains a mystery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that the ability of B cells to capture cognate antigen from cell membranes, along with small quantities of coexpressed bystander antigens, might enable B-cell escape from tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested this hypothesis using influenza hemagglutinin as a model viral antigen and transgenic, MOG-specific B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using flow cytometry and live and fixed cell microscopy, we show that MOG-specific B cells take up large amounts of MOG from cell membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uptake of the antigen from the membrane leads to a strong activation of the capturing B cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When influenza hemagglutinin is also present in the membrane of the target cell, it can be cocaptured with MOG by MOG-specific B cells via the B-cell receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hemagglutinin and MOG are both presented to T cells, which in turn are activated and proliferate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, MOG-specific B cells get help from hemagglutinin-specific T cells to produce anti-MOG antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, the transfer of MOG-specific B cells into recipient mice after the cocapture of MOG and hemagglutinin leads to the production of class-switched anti-MOG antibodies, dependent on the presence of hemagglutinin-specific T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism offers a link between infection and autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Capture_of_Cognate_Antigen_from_Membrane_Is_Rapid_and_Robust  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Capture of cognate antigen from membrane has been examined in molecular detail (10, 11), generally using isolated membrane preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the capture of cognate antigen from membranes of live cells by IgHMOG transgenic B cells, whose BCR recognizes the extracellular domain of MOG (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When IgHMOG B cells were exposed to adherent HEK cells that express a MOG-GFP fusion, GFP capture was detected in the B cells by flow cytometry as soon as 1 min after contact and continued to increase for more than 1 h (Fig 1 AC and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Capture was paralleled by loss of surface IgM, indicating internalization of the BCRantigen complex (Fig 1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunolabeling of cocultures showed that captured antigen and IgM associate with LAMP1-immunoreactive structures within the B cell, presumably lysosomes (Fig 1 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially these structures are seen only at the interface of B cell and antigen-expressing HEK cell (Movie S2), but upon prolonged interaction, they distribute throughout the B cell (Fig 1 D and E and Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After extended interaction, the majority of the Ig colocalizes with antigen (Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Membrane_Antigen_Capture_Renders_B_Cells_Highly_Antigenic_for_T_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We exposed IgHMOG B cells for 8, 12, or 20 h to adherent TE cells that express MOG (TE MOG) and examined expression of activation markers by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TE cells are more strongly adherent than HEK cells, facilitating their separation from B cells, but less efficiently transfected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our hands, the type of antigen-presenting cell has no obvious influence on B-cell antigen capture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared these membrane antigen-capturing B cells with identical B cells exposed to nonantigen-expressing TE cells or to soluble MOG protein or to an IgM-crosslinking antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of surface IgM was similar for B cells exposed to soluble or membrane-expressed antigen, but up-regulation of the activation markers CD69 and CD25 was far greater on the B cells exposed to membrane antigen (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up-regulation of class II MHC and CD86 was similar for the three kinds of BCR stimulation (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated class II expression was maintained longer after membrane capture than after other forms of BCR stimulation, but this effect was not statistically significant at the time points studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the presentation of captured membrane antigens to T cells by coculturing IgHMOG B cells (MHC class II allotype I-Ab) with TE MOG cells and then retrieving and coculturing them with 2D2 T cells, which recognize MOG 3555 in the context of I-Ab (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D2 T cells exposed to IgHMOG B cells after membrane capture proliferated more strongly than those cocultured with naive B cells in the presence of a high concentration of cognate peptide (Fig 2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soluble MOG protein was no more effective than peptide (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither B cells exposed to culture supernatants from antigen-expressing cells nor to TE cells that did not express antigen stimulated any proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rules out involvement of secreted soluble antigen or antigen-independent properties of the TE cells (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, it appears that the act of antigen capture renders the capturing B cell highly stimulatory for T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test this interpretation, we assessed the stimulatory properties of B cells after membrane capture of antigens that were irrelevant for the responding T cell, with or without additional peptide that matches the T-cell specifitiy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exposed HA-specific FluBI B cells (I-Ab) to TE cells stably transfected with HA (TE HA) and then retrieved and cocultured these B cells with 2D2 T cells in the presence or absence of exogenous MOG 3555 peptide (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without additional peptide, FluBI B cells stimulated no proliferation of 2D2 T cells, whether or not the B cells had previously encountered HA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With added peptide, even antigen-naive FluBI B cells stimulated T-cell proliferation but much less than B cells that had been previously activated by membrane HA capture (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced ability of B cells after membrane capture to stimulate T-cell proliferation may thus be due to the high level of activation of B cells and the concomitant increase in costimulatory ligands (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also measured 2D2 T-cell proliferation in response to MOG-specific B cells exposed to the same TE cells with or without peptide (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, preexposure to membrane-expressed MOG rendered the B cells more stimulatory for the T cells than pulsing with peptide, whereas the presence of HA had no effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Providing the antigen in a form recognizable by the BCRthat is, soluble MOG 1125 proteinresulted in only slightly greater stimulation of T-cell proliferation than pulsing with MOG 3555 peptide, and IgHMOG B cells were only slightly better in inducing 2D2 proliferation after capture of MOG 1125 protein compared with FluBI B cells, which must take up the protein via a BCR-independent route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most strikingly, FluBI cells exposed to TE cells that express both HA and MOG stimulated the proliferation of MOG-specific T cells, without the addition of exogenous MOG peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that MOG had been cocaptured with HA and processed and presented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cocaptured__Noncognate_Antigen_Is_Presented_and_Can_Qualify_B_Cells_for_T-Cell_Help  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To visualize the capture of noncognate, bystander antigen, we generated an adherent HEK cell line stably cotransfected with MOG-GFP and HA (HEK HA MOG-GFP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cocultured these cells with IgHMOG B cells or with FluBI B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Capture of MOG-GFP by IgHMOG B cells followed similar kinetics with or without coexpression of HA, but MOG-GFP capture by FluBI B cells was dependent on HA (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bystander cocapture was as rapid as cognate capture, being observable after 3 min of contact, but quantitatively less.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not all antigens we examined were cocaptured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, when FluBI B cells were exposed to TE cells that express HA, MOG-GFP, and mOVA-Cherry, the MOG-GFP is cocaptured but the mOVA-cherry is not (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ig-bound antigens may be more efficiently presented to T cells than other endocytosed cargo (1416).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address whether coacquired membrane antigens were processed and presented on MHC class II, we used TE cell lines stably transfected with MOG and HA or with HA alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because WSN/33 HA-specific, class II-restricted transgenic T cells were not available, we added a carboxy terminal fusion to the HA including amino acids 323339 of ovalbumin (OVA), a peptide recognized by OT-II T cells in the context of I-Ab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IgHMOG B cells were exposed to TE HA-OVA or TE MOG HA-OVA for 3 h and then retrieved and cocultured with OT-II T cells for 4 d. T-cell proliferation and activation were assessed by flow cytometry of Cell Trace Violet (CTV) dilution and CD25 immunofluorescence, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results from this model were consistent with the degree of cocapture observed previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After exposure to TE MOG HA-OVA, IgHMOG B cells stimulated robust proliferation in OT-II T cells, and this was dependent on MOG (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in CD25 expression was not as great as in the cognate capture condition (Fig 4A), and the percentage of proliferated T cells was also lower (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also saw secretion of IFN-, IL-2, and IL-4 in the interaction between B cells presenting a cocaptured antigen and T cells responding to that antigen, albeit less than in the cognate capture condition (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presentation of the noncognate antigen is dependent on cocapture, because mOVA, which contains the OT-II epitope but is not cocaptured with HA or with MOG (Fig 3B), is also not presented to OT-II T cells by IgHMOG or FluBI B cells after exposure to TE MOG mOVA (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be certain that this result was not due to inadequate expression of the mOVA protein at the cell membrane, we confirmed the accessibility of extracellular, membrane-bound OVA in live TE MOG mOVA cells (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether cocaptured antigen would qualify B cells for T-cell help, we used the same combination of model antigensthat is, IgHMOG B cells capturing antigen from TE cells expressing both MOG and HA-OVAbut extended the subsequent coculture of IgHMOG B cells with OT-II T cells to 7 d. To exclude the involvement of BCR-independent antigen uptake and the possibility that the mere fact of capturing antigen stimulates antibody production, we included negative controls of IgHMOG B cells interacting with TE HA-OVA or with TE MOG HA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a positive control, another cell line was established that stably expresses MOG fused to the OT-II OVA epitope (TE MOG-OVA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exposed the IgHMOG B cells to the TE cells expressing the different antigen combinations, retrieved and cocultured them with OT-II T cells, and measured anti-MOG antibodies in the culture supernatants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Omitting the T cells, the OVA epitope, or MOG, no antibodies were detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When OT-II T cells were present and the OVA epitope was included in the B-cell cognate antigen, antibody production was robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We clearly detected antibodies also when the OVA epitope was present on the HA antigen (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autoreactive B cells that present cocaptured viral antigen can thus be triggered to produce autoantibodies by unrelated antiviral T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether cocaptured antigen could mediate T-cell help in an in vivo setting, we exposed IgHMOG B cells to adherent cells expressing the same four combinations of antigens and adoptively transferred them into Rag / mice, together with OT-II T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two weeks later, the mice were killed and anti-MOG antibodies in the serum were measured using an IgG2a-specific secondary antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results mirrored those obtained in vitro: Antibodies were clearly produced in the cocapture condition (antigenic cells coexpressing MOG and HA-OVA)at a lower level than in the cognate capture paradigm (cells expressing MOG-OVA) but well above the baseline level (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IgG2a production in the two negative control conditions (cells expressing either HA-OVA alone or MOG and HA) was not significantly different from baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Capture of antigen from membranes represents an alternative way of collecting antigen for B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It leads to strong activation of the B cell and robust antigen presentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that membrane capture carries the risk that other antigens than the cognate one are cocaptured via the BCR, with two potentially pathological consequences: (i) Antiviral B cells acquire autoantigens together with the viral antigen and activate autoreactive T cells, and (ii) autoreactive B cells acquire viral antigens together with the autoantigen and get T-cell help from antiviral T cells to produce autoantibodies (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that both consequences can occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is clear from our results that not all combinations of antigen, although present in the same membrane, will be cocaptured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of significant cocapture of the membraneOVA fusion protein indicates that the phenomenon does not involve wholesale capture of large fragments of membrane and is likely to be limited to a subset of protein antigens that either share some particular localization in the membrane or else have some direct interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility, for example, is that the interaction we observe here depends on the interaction between sialic acid residues on the MOG protein and the sialic acid-binding domain of the HA (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would limit the phenomenon to the set of sialated proteins, which includes much but not all of the membrane proteome (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major function of viral glycoproteins is attachment to host cell membranes, and therefore, the likelihood that viral proteins bind to the extracellular domains of membrane proteins is high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A limitation of our study is that antigen capture takes place in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally, this enables us to control the coexpression of antigens, and to be sure that they are captured directly by B cells rather than by some third cell type, but begs the question of how and where B cells capture and cocapture antigen in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large body of work has demonstrated that soluble antigens and fluid-borne viral particles are trapped and offered to B cells in the secondary lymphoid tissue by specialized cells including subcapsular macrophages and follicular dendritic cells (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we envisage that cocapture events relevant to autoimmunity are more likely to occur during direct capture of viral antigen from infected cells, which is likely to occur during the B-cell infiltration of infected tissues that is seen during the acute response to virus (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The generation of autoantibodies via the cocapture mechanism is likely to be limited in several parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it will only occur during infections by viruses that encode abundant membrane proteinsthat is, enveloped viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, autoantigens are limited to membrane proteins with an exposed extracellular domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the availability of nonanergised autoreactive B cells will be greatest for antigens that are not expressed in the bone marrow and particularly for antigens whose expression is limited to tissues that are not patrolled extensively by B cells under normal (i.e., noninflamed, noninfected) conditions, thereby avoiding the mechanisms of peripheral tolerance that are known to be triggered by exposure to self-antigen in the absence of cognate T-cell help (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These limitations might explain why this phenomenon rarely translates into the infection-associated autoimmunity seen in clinics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless this mechanism represents an important deviation from a fundamental principle of immunology that has stood up well since its formulation in 1969: that antibody secretion by a B cell depends on an interaction with a T cell recognizing the same antigen (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We envisage that this and further study of the phenomenon will lead to significant modifications in the understanding of B-cell biology, autoimmunity, and tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

C57BL/6 and Rag / mice were bred in the University of Basel Mouse Core Facility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn (OT-II) mice on a Rag2/ background were a kind gift from Ed Palmer, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FluBI mice (23) were bred from founder members provided by Stephanie Dougan and Hidde Ploegh, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IgHMOG (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12; also known as Th B cells) and C57BL/6-Tg(Tcra2D2,Tcrb2D2)1Kuch/J (2D2) mice (13) were bred from founder members provided by Guru Krishnamoorthy and Hartmut Wekerle, Max-Planck-Institut für Neurobiologie, Martinsried, Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary immune cells were obtained from spleens by mechanical disruption and brief settlement to remove tissue fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B cells and CD4-positive T cells were obtained by negative selection using biotinylated antibodies and magnetic beads from Miltenyi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All procedures involving animals were considered and authorized by the Cantonal Tierversuchskommission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anti-MOG_Antibody_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anti-MOG antibodies were measured in sera and in culture supernatants by flow cytometry as previously described (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were mixed with two volumes of reporter cell suspension in PBS containing 2% FCS by volume and 1 g/L of sodium azide on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter cells include equal numbers of unlabeled TE MOG cells and CTV-labeled TE 0 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min on ice, the cells are washed, and antibodies adhering to the TE MOG cells are detected with Alexa 647 anti-mouse IgG or PerCP-conjugated anti-IgG2a secondary antibodies (both from Jackson Immunoresearch) and measured by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TE 0 and TE MOG populations are then separated by CTV label, and the ratio of geometric mean fluorescence intensities between TE MOG:TE 0 indicates the abundance of antibody in the supernatant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Geometric mean fluorescence intensities of activation markers on B cells were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (time versus condition) and the effect of condition by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnetts Multiple Comparison Test to compare each of the conditions against no stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cell proliferation data (proportions of cells in the CTV-low gate) and anti-MOG Ig levels in sera were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnetts test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-MOG IgG levels in culture supernantants, expressed as ratios of geometric mean immunofluorescence TE MOG:TE 0, were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (presence of T cells versus antigen condition), revealing a strong interaction, with an effect of condition limited to the T cells present condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KruskalWallis test was therefore used to assess the effect of antigen condition, and Dunns Multiple Comparison Test was used to compare each of the conditions with the T cells absent condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

A full list of antigen-expressing cells used in the study is presented in Table S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ORF encoding rat MOG was amplified with its STOP codon from pRSV-MOG and cloned into the blasticidin (Gibco) resistance-conferring pcDNA6.2C-EmGFP-DEST (Invitrogen) by gateway cloning, following the manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An expression plasmid encoding A/WSN/33 influenza HA under hygromycin (Sigma Aldrich) selection was purchased from Sino Biological.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fusion constructs MOG-GFP, MOG-OVA, and HA-OVA were made by template-switching PCR and cloned by Ligation Independent Cloning into the PigLIC vector, which confers puromycin (Gibco) resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mOVA construct was amplified from pODpCAGGS (24) (a  kind gift from Marc Jenkins, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis) and cloned into PigLIC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells transfected with this construct express OVA at the cell surface, which can be detected by flow cytometry on living cells using a polyclonal rabbit anti-OVA antibody (Ab1225, Millipore).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HEK 293 embryonic kidney cells and TE671 rhabdomyosarcoma cells (referred to as TE cells throughout the text) were obtained from ATCC (LGC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were transfected by exposure to 2 g/mL of plasmid DNA and 5 g/mL of polyethylenimine in RPMI medium without serum for 4 h. Cells were cultured in complete medium [RPMI medium containing 10% (vol/vol) FCS, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 g/mL of streptomycin, all from Gibco] at 37 °C in 5% carbon dioxide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells resistant to the appropriate selective antibiotic were sorted by the Department of Biomedicine Flow Cytometry Core after labeling, as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were tested for mycoplasma infection on arrival and subsequently (LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit, Sigma).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cell-Surface_Antigen_Confirmation_and_General_Flow_Cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For each cell line designed to express a cell membrane antigen, we verified expression at the establishment of the cell line and subsequently periodically checked the expression of the antigen by immunofluorescence flow cytometry (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adherent cells were washed in PBS, trypsinized, resuspended in complete medium, washed in labeling buffer (PBS containing 2% FCS by volume and 1 g/l of sodium azide), incubated for 30 min on ice in primary antibody, washed again, incubated with fluorescent secondary antibodies, washed, and measured on a BD LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells known to be positive and negative for the target antigen were labeled and measured in parallel each time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical result from such an experiment is shown in Fig 4E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When flow cytometry results are shown as contour plots, the contour lines are spaced at 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gating strategies for each figure are shown in Fig S1 for each figure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

B-Cell_Flow_Cytometry  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
IgHMOG B cells isolated by negative selection were cocultured with TE MOG or TE 0 cells for 820 h in complete medium at 37 °C in 5% carbon dioxide and then retrieved and labeled with the following antibodies before analysis as above: APC-Cy7 anti-B220 (clone RA3-6B2), PerCP-Cy5.5 anti-CD69 (clone H1.2F3), PE-Cy7 anti-CD86 (clone GL1), APC antiI-A/I-E (clone M5/114.15.2, Biolegend), PE anti-CD25 (clone PC61.5), AlexaFluor488 donkey anti-mouse IgM (Jackson Immuoresearch), and FITC R35-95 rat IgG2a kappa isotype control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All antibodies were from BD Biosciences unless otherwise specified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

T-Cell_Proliferation_Assays  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
B cells were exposed to antigen-expressing adherent cells in 25 cm2 flasks for 3 h and then retrieved, counted, and put into the wells of 96-well plates at 50,000 per well in complete medium supplemented with 50 M 2-mercaptoethanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T cells were labeled with 5 M CTV in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco) at 37 °C for 15 min and then washed thrice in complete medium, counted, and added to the B-cell wells at 25,000 per well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 4 or 5 d, the cocultures were retrieved; labeled with anti-CD19, anti-B220, anti-CD4, and anti-CD25 (all from BD Biosciences); and analyzed by flow cytometry on a BD LSR Fortessa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fixed_and_Live_Cell_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For high-resolution immunolabeling, B cells were added to HEK MOG-GFP cells growing in chambered coverslips (Ibidi) at 37 °C and at various time points were fixed in ice-cold 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then washed in PBS, blocked in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.02% TritonX, and and immunolabeled with rat anti-mouse LAMP1 (Southern Biotech), followed by Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and Rhodamine RedX-conjugated goat anti-rat antibodies, both from Jackson Immunoresearch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were aquired with a Nikon a1r in line-scanning mode with a 60×, 1.40 NA oil immersion objective using voxel dimensions set at approximately Nyquist sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acquisition was controlled by Nikon Elements software, and the same software was used to create three-dimensional reconstructions and maximum intensity projections from the stacks of XY planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions of interest were subsquently cropped, and when necessary to enhance visibility, brightness and contrast were increased using the Fiji distribution of ImageJ (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For live cell imaging, a similar setup was used, but the B cells were prelabeled with Cell Tracker Deep Red (Invitrogen) following the manufacturers instructions, and without fixing the cells, the chambered coverslips with the cells growing in complete medium were placed into a humidified chamber on the microscope stage held at 37 °C and 5% carbon dioxide by an INU-TIZ-F1 controller (Tokai Hit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pinhole was opened to 5.0 Airy units and other parameters (PMT voltages, voxel dimensions, etc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  optimized to minimize laser light exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately one frame per minute was captured, and frames were assembled into movies with Nikon Elements software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Adoptive_Transfer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CD4-positive OT-II cells were separated from mouse spleens as above, washed in PBS, resuspended in cold PBS, and injected intraperitoneally into Rag / mice at 1 million per mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One day later, IgHMOG B cells were isolated as above, exposed to antigen-expressing adherent cells in 75 cm2 flasks for 3 h, and then retrieved, washed in cold PBS, counted and resuspended in cold PBS, and injected intraperitoneally at 4 million cells per mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two weeks later, mice were killed and blood was taken from the right atrium, refrigerated overnight, and then cetrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sera were stored at 20 °C until antibody assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Anti-MOG_Antibody_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Anti-MOG antibodies were measured in sera and in culture supernatants by flow cytometry as previously described (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supernatants were mixed with two volumes of reporter cell suspension in PBS containing 2% FCS by volume and 1 g/L of sodium azide on ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter cells include equal numbers of unlabeled TE MOG cells and CTV-labeled TE 0 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 min on ice, the cells are washed, and antibodies adhering to the TE MOG cells were detected with Alexa 647 anti-mouse IgG or PerCP-conjugated anti-IgG2a secondary antibodies (both from Jackson Immunoresearch) and measured by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TE 0 and TE MOG populations were then separated by CTV label, and the ratio of geometric mean fluorescence intensities between TE MOG and TE 0 indicated the abundance of antibody in the supernatant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Geometric mean fluorescence intensities of activation markers on B cells were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (time versus condition), and because an effect of condition but not of time was found, the effect of condition was examined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnetts Multiple Comparison Test to compare each of the conditions against no stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cell proliferation data (proportions of cells in the CTV-low gate) and anti-MOG Ig levels in sera were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnetts test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-MOG IgG levels in culture supernantants, expressed as ratios of geometric mean immunofluorescence TE MOG:TE 0, were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (presence of T cells versus antigen condition), revealing a strong interaction, with an effect of condition limited to the T cells present condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KruskalWallis test was therefore used to assess the effect of antigen condition, and Dunns Multiple Comparison Test was used to compare each of the conditions with the T cells absent condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
