Emergent chirality in the electric polarization texture of titanate superlattices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many natural structures exhibit chirality that is essential to their functional interactions, yet the chiral electronic structures found in condensed matter systems have been primarily limited to magnetic materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the electric dipole equivalent of magnetic skyrmions has remained conspicuously elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent theoretical predictions and experimental observations of the continuous rotation of electric polarization in titanate superlattices suggests that such complex oxide nanocomposites are ideal candidates for realizing chiral electric dipole configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present the results from superlattices of PbTiO3 and SrTiO3 using a combination of resonant soft X-ray diffraction and second-principles simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe chiral arrays of polar line defects, spontaneously formed by the complex interactions in these artificial superlattices constructed from two nonchiral lattices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Chirality is a geometrical property by which an object is not superimposable onto its mirror image, thereby imparting a handedness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chirality determines many important properties in naturefrom the strength of the weak interactions according to the electroweak theory in particle physics to the binding of enzymes with naturally occurring amino acids or sugars, reactions that are fundamental for life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In condensed matter physics, the prediction of topologically protected magnetic skyrmions and related spin textures in chiral magnets has stimulated significant research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the magnetic dipoles were replaced by their electrical counterparts, then electrically controllable chiral devices could be designed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complex oxide BaTiO3/SrTiO3 nanocomposites and PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices are perfect candidates, since polar vortices, in which a continuous rotation of ferroelectric polarization spontaneously forms, have been recently discovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using resonant soft X-ray diffraction, we report the observation of a strong circular dichroism from the interaction between circularly polarized light and the chiral electric polarization texture that emerges in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hallmark of chirality is explained by a helical rotation of electric polarization that second-principles simulations predict to reside within complex 3D polarization textures comprising ordered topological line defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The handedness of the texture can be topologically characterized by the sign of the helicity number of the chiral line defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This coupling between the optical and novel polar properties could be exploited to encode chiral signatures into photon or electron beams for information processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
(PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n superlattices were grown epitaxially by pulsed laser deposition on DyScO3 (001)pc substrates (pc indicates pseudocubic indices) as described previously (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For n = 10 to 16, the balance of elastic, electrostatic, and gradient (or anisotropy) energies forms the curled polar textures (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) confirmed sharp interfaces and coherent atomic layers, as well as highly aligned superlattices of polar cores, both vertically and laterally (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the film plane, the periodic cores of curled polar texture define a lateral repeat direction (designated [100] in Fig 1A, where  denotes the chiral phase) along one of the principal axes of the pseudocubic perovskite cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have performed RSXD (12, 13) on PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The soft X-ray wavelengths (2 nm to 3 nm) are well matched to the periodicity of the lateral modulations in the polar texture, leading to satellites that decorate the 00 diffraction rod (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1B shows a line cut through the lateral satellite peaks in proximity to  = 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak positions (qlateral = ±q_pair = ±2/d_pair) indicate a lateral period equal to that of a pair of counterrotated polar cores, d_pair, which is 11.4 nm for n = 16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
By tuning the X-ray energy within the vicinity of resonant electronic transitions from the titanium 2p3/2 (L3) and 2p1/2 (L2) core levels into empty 3d valence states, we directly probe the anisotropic electronic structure of distorted TiO6 octahedra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the intensity of the lateral satellites at qlateral = ±q_pair has a remarkable dependence on the photon energy of the incoming X-rays (Fig 1C), predominantly concentrated at t2g-like states near the L3 edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In X-ray absorption studies of ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3, the same t2g feature highlights the anisotropy of the polar TiO6 distortion (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resonant behavior in Fig 1C can be understood (ATS Diffraction) by considering that the supermodulation diffraction peaks are due to anisotropic tensor susceptibility (ATS) scattering (15, 16), driven by periodic rotational patterns of electric polarization in the textured arrays (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strikingly, the diffraction peaks of the polar texture exhibit pronounced X-ray circular dichroism (XCD), with intensity differing on the order of 20% when the circular polarization of incident X-rays is reversed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XCD in resonant diffraction peaks can contain contributions from a number of mechanisms, including chiral motifs (17), scattering from ordered magnetic moments (18), and dynamical effects (1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antisymmetric XCD signal in Fig 1B is a hallmark of chirality in magnetic materials such as those with chiral domain walls (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no magnetism is expected nor found in the d0 configuration of PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, XCD here must be generated by a chiral rotation of electric polarization within the textured arrays (Fig 2), as is expected for ATS diffraction peaks from chiral structures (16, 2224).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these materials, the polarity of the XCD signal reverses when either the chirality of the crystal structure or the direction of the diffraction vector is independently inverted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is observed in Fig 1B by reversal of the lateral component of the diffraction vector, qlateral, and Fig 1D shows evidence of the former.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One must also consider dynamical effects in resonant X-ray scattering, such as the refraction and polarization rotation of both incident and diffracted X-rays, which have been shown in antiferromagnetic ordering diffraction peaks to produce significant XCD in addition to the XCD expected from kinematical models (1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinematical scattering amplitude is the Fourier transform of the materials effective electronic density, directly linked to the ordered state being studied (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of dynamical effects also reveal information about material properties, but are strongly dependent on the particular geometry of each diffraction experiment (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these components can be principally distinguished via their azimuthal dependence, in particular by the reversal (or not) of XCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next demonstrate that the azimuthal pattern of XCD (Fig 3A) measured in the qlateral = ±q_pair diffraction peaks from PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices is indicative of the chiral electric dipole configuration in the textured arrays, and that it is also distinct from that of other systems whose XCD is dominated by dynamical effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we have also confirmed that XCD is essentially negligible (XCD of Ordered Phases, Fig 4, and Fig S2) in thinner (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n superlattices (e.g., n = 4), which have no curled polar structure but which still possess periodic arrays of ferroelectric a domains that exhibit resonant diffraction peaks (Phase Coexistence).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the dramatic difference in XCD between samples with and without curled polar textures directly points to the chiral structure of the arrays, rather than dynamical effects, as the primary origin of XCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The helical polarization structure depicted in Fig 2A and its inherent broken mirror symmetry along qlateral will produce a resonant ATS diffraction pattern whose peaks, qlateral = ±qhelix = ±2/dhelix (dhelix is the period of the helix), have opposite XCD, similar to Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The twofold symmetry of the helix implies that its diffraction pattern after a 180° rotation is indistinguishable from the diffraction pattern of the original orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, however, because qlateral is fixed to the sample (by construction), the peak with positive dichroism in the original orientation is located at qlateral = +qhelix, whereas, after rotation, it is located at qlateral = qhelix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe similar behavior from the PbTiO3/SrTiO3 polar arrays, as seen in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 3A shows that, for a single diffraction spot with qlateral = +q_pair, XCD is large and positive (red) across a range of azimuths, spot near +90°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XCD in that same spot is strongly negative (blue) for spot near 90°, and, in between these extremes, the XCD tends toward zero at spot near 0° or 180°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar azimuthal patterns were measured for multiple diffraction spots from the polar arrays (Materials and Methods), and have been overlaid in Fig 3A to highlight this commonality via judicious selection of the origin, spot = 0°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the azimuth, spot, has been defined for each diffraction spot, to measure the in-plane projection of its scattering vector relative to the projection of incident X-rays onto the sample surface (dashed green line in Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cartoon in Fig 3B illustrates the data in Fig 3A, to emphasize that either diffraction spot exhibits positive XCD (red disk) when its in-plane scattering vector is +90° from the dashed green reference line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This condition is fulfilled for qlateral = +q_pair (thick black arrow, parallel to [100]) in Fig 3B, Left and also by a 180° azimuthal rotation of the sample for qlateral = q_pair (thick gray arrow, antiparallel to [100]) in Fig 3B, Right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a fixed sample orientation, however, the mirrored diffraction spots (qlateral = ±q_pair) have XCD with opposite polarity, as in Fig 1B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the inversion of XCD polarity with reversal of qlateral persists at all azimuths, as deduced from Fig 3A, and is a defining feature that points toward the chiral origin of this XCD signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This azimuthal pattern of XCD in the polar array diffraction spots is functionally similar to that of the ideal electric polarization helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the reference frame of the diffractometer, this twofold rotation of the sample results in a similar (albeit not identical) XCD diffraction pattern from the polar texture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An immediate implication of this XCD pattern is that the electric polarization of the chiral array must possess a broken mirror symmetry along qlateral, with an additional restriction that the electric polarization texture must be considerably unchanged by a 180° azimuthal rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These constraints extracted from experimental results help to identify the most likely candidate structures calculated from second-principles atomistic simulations, which are discussed in Calculation of Polarization Textures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The XCD pattern of PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices is not perfectly antisymmetric with respect to azimuth, largely because the magnitude is smaller for azimuths with negative XCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the chiral arrays do not perfectly mimic the ideal helix in their polarization configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might arise, in part, due to a skewing of the atomic positions, which leads to a systematic asymmetric offset (i.e., buckling) of the polar core positions, as seen in Fig S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skewed profiles of periodic structures are well known to produce asymmetric intensity in the mirrored diffraction spots of, e.g., surface gratings made of patterned lines with asymmetric cross-section (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamical effects might also partially contribute to the XCD signal, causing it to deviate from an idealized antisymmetric azimuthal pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In studies where dynamical modulation of dichroism [either XCD or X-ray linear dichroism (XLD)] in the diffraction peaks was found to be significant (20, 21), the azimuthal patterns possess twofold symmetry or else mirror symmetry that deviates only slightly from twofold symmetry (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in stark contrast to the inversion of XCD polarity that we observe with a 180° azimuthal rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our current analysis focuses on the general trend that positive XCD is observed at positive azimuths, while negative XCD is measured at negative azimuths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other features of the azimuthal pattern in Fig 3A could be manifestations of dynamical effects (Azimuthal XCD and Chirality), including fine intensity modulations and a notable imbalance of intensity between the azimuthal lobe of positive XCD and the lobe with negative XCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, these two primary lobes of XCD with opposite polarization are clearly visible in the azimuthal pattern, even though some regions of the azimuthal circle are inaccessible due to geometrical constraints of the experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this distinct azimuthal pattern, we can rule out dynamical effects as the principal source of XCD in the polar array diffraction spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, in the absence of magnetic order, we conclude that XCD in these diffraction patterns is primarily the result of a chiral configuration of electric polarization in the curled textures of PbTiO3/SrTiO3 arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Calculation_of_Polarization_Textures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To ascertain more specifically the structure that produces the observed XCD signal, we have performed second-principles (27, 28) simulations, which allow for the treatment of thermal effects and larger systems than standard first-principles calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural relaxations (Materials and Methods) yield different atomic geometries (Fig 5 AC) that are very close in energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pairs of clockwise and counterclockwise rotation patterns alternating along [100] are clearly visible, with a period of 8 nm for n = 10, closely matching experimental observations (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amazingly, these simulations also reveal that the previously reported characterization (5) as alternately rotating vortices is only a partially complete description of the polarization texture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Superimposed onto this curled polar texture, we observe the condensation of a robust polarization component along the axial direction of the polar cores (29, 30), [010], that triggers the appearance of chiral geometries (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations at low temperature (10 K) predict the stabilization of enantiomers where the axial component points in opposite directions at the center of the clockwise and counterclockwise cores (Fig 5 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our second-principles calculations also find an achiral structure, where the axial component is parallel throughout the structure (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in energy between these configurational states is small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This therefore requires that we look at these calculated results within the context of our experimental data to identify the most likely ground states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ab initio calculations do not overtly include the consequence of finite size effects, because of the periodic boundary conditions used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The net component of polarization along [010] in the achiral structure would lead to polarization charges at the surfaces of a real sample, destabilizing this achiral state with respect to the chiral geometries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polar reconstructions at the lateral surfaces by mobile carriers are unlikely because the superlattices are highly insulating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though we cannot rule out all screening mechanisms that might help stabilize achiral textures, we emphasize that only the chiral polar textures are compatible with the experimental XCD results presented earlier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated chiral structures are stable up to higher temperatures, where a transition toward dynamically changing polar textures is predicted (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The helicity density (31), defined as =p(×p)d3r, and the sign of this scalar field,  = sign(), allow an unambiguous classification of the handedness of a given polar core (Fig 5 DF), and its volume integral over the clockwise and anticlockwise pair defines the overall chirality of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The handedness is identical for both cores in Fig 5A, leading to a net positive helicity (Fig 5G), and positive XCD for positive spot in Fig 3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatial agreement between Fig 5G and the azimuthally robust polarization texture (averaged for  = 0 and 180° in Fig 3C) identifies the helicity of alternating polar cores as the primary source of XCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the central PbTiO3 layers of these chiral arrays, the electric polarization forms a helical structure (Fig S1) similar to Fig 2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, the helicity number simultaneously describes the handedness of the individual cores and the handedness of the collective helical rotation within each layer (Helicity of Calculated Polarization Textures).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The polarization texture in Fig 5C is a mirror image of Fig 5A, with opposite handedness, net negative helicity, and an XCD signal that must be opposite in sign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both enantiomers coexist as macroscale domains in the XCD map shown in Fig 1D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The axial components of polarization in Fig 5 could potentially be visible in planar view HR-STEM or dark-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, however, variations in the strength and orientation of the axial polarization as a function of depth act to dilute the signal below detection limits (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This discovery of chirality in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices stemming from helicity of the modulated polar arrays is of profound fundamental importance and poses new lines of inquiry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most exciting discovery is the design of an emergent chirality into a material using building blocks that do not by themselves exhibit chirality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to other chiral crystals with a well-defined handedness that cannot be changed, such as -quartz, here it should be possible to switch between the two energy-degenerate enantiomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such control could be intrinsically affected by a yet unrealized electrical analog to the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya interaction, or extrinsically by electrically poling the cores of the chiral textures on a local scale to reverse their axial components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By extension, one might also control optical (32) or magnetic (33, 34) properties of other materials coupled to the polar textures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, there is reason to believe that these chiral structures could possess a negative index of refraction (28), applicable in tunable frequency oscillators and filters for communication devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Deposition_and_Structural_Characterization_of_Thin_Film_Superlattices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Superlattices of (SrTiO3)n/(PbTiO3)n were synthesized on DyScO3 (110)O substrates by pulsed laser deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here n refers to the thickness in unit cells of respective materials oriented along the [001]pc (pseudocubic) direction, defined relative to the orthorhombic substrate as [001]pc//[110]O; [100]pc//[1¯10]O; and [010]pc//[001]O. Superlattice films were grown (Synthesis and Structural Characterization) to a total thickness of 100 nm and were monitored throughout using Reflection High Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) in situ characterization; they exhibited Frankvan der Merwe growth mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various characterization techniques such as XRD, Rutherford back scattering (RBS), and TEM were employed to ensure structural and chemical homogeneity of superlattice films (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each superlattice, the lateral period of the counterrotated pair of polar cores (d_pair) is well defined, ranging from 8 nm (n = 10) to 11.4 nm (n = 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Detecting_Chirality_by_RSXD  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Synchrotron-based resonant diffraction experiments were performed at the Advanced Light Source, using the scattering endstation at beamline 4.0.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polarization and photon energy of the X-ray source were tuned by an elliptically polarizing undulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intensity of X-rays scattered by the sample were measured using an in-vacuum CCD, and background dark counts were removed (RSXD Measurements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CCD detector was also used to record X-ray absorption spectra via fluorescence (RSXD Measurements) and monitor small shifts in the diffraction peak position as a function of photon energy due to dynamical scattering effects (RSXD Peak Shifts and Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Resonance profiles were measured by tuning the photon energy through the titanium L3,2 edges (450 eV to 470 eV), while sample and detector angles were adjusted to maintain the Bragg condition for each energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The satellite features have an out-of-plane modulation along , commensurate with the superlattice peaks observed in a specular 2 XRD scan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Bragg condition in Fig 1C is (+q_pair, nSL = 3); i.e., the lateral component of the wavevector was set to +q_pair, and the out-of-plane component was set to the third-order superlattice peak (and the axial component was zero).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All spectra have been corrected for the energy-dependent intensity of the incoming beam (I0) and are normalized to the maximum intensity of the polarization-averaged spectrum, after subtracting the nonresonant intensity in the preedge region (RSXD Measurements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Line cuts through reciprocal space were measured at fixed photon energy, while adjusting sample and detector angles to vary qlateral (qout-of-plane) at a fixed value of qout-of-plane (qlateral).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1B shows a line cut parallel to qlateral with fixed qout-of-plane corresponding to nSL = 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were normalized to the average intensity at qlateral = ±q_pair for the polarization-averaged curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photon energy was fixed at the most intense feature in the resonance profile, identified as having t2g character (456.5 eV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All measurements were performed with nearly 100% circularly polarized X-rays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data were collected in pairs, with helicity of the circular polarization reversed for each energy (resonance profiles) or momentum vector (reciprocal space line cuts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XCD (RSXD Measurements) was calculated as the difference of the scattered intensity for the two helicities; subtraction was performed after normalizing the scattered intensities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Azimuthal data in Fig 3A were collected from three diffraction spots, two of which were qlateral = ±q_pair for the primary ordering direction, [100]//[001]O (Azimuthal XCD Measurements and Fig S10 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third diffraction spot was qlateral = +q_pair for the secondary ordering direction, [100]//[1¯10]O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample azimuth () was adjusted to vary the azimuth (spot) of each diffraction spot, as depicted in Fig S10 DF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XCD resonance profiles were collected at each azimuth, then normalized and fitted by a reference spectrum (Azimuthal XCD Measurements).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The chirality map in Fig 1D displays the XCD measured in the primary diffraction spot, qlateral = +q_pair, with spot fixed near +90°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XCD intensity was recorded at fixed diffraction geometry while scanning the sample, with the effect of rastering the X-ray beam across the surface of the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Second-Principles_Simulations_of_PbTiO3_SrTiO3_Superlattices  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The superlattice potentials are identical to those used in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume in-plane lattice constants of a = b = 3.901 Å and  = 90°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To counteract the underestimate of the lattice constant due to the well-known overbinding error of the local density approximation, which is the first-principles theory used to compute the parameters of our model, an external expansive hydrostatic pressure of 11.2 GPa is imposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For computational feasibility, we have focused on a simulation supercell made from a periodic repetition of 2n × n × 2n elemental perovskite unit cells, sufficiently large to simulate domains in the n = 10 superlattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We solved the models by running Monte Carlo simulations typically comprising 10,000 thermalization sweeps, followed by 40,000 sweeps to compute thermal averages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ran Monte Carlo simulated annealings down to very low temperatures to perform structural relaxations and find the ground state or metastable solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details of the simulation parameters and the resulting structures are discussed in Second-Principles Calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Local polarizations are computed within a linear approximation of the product of the Born effective charge tensor times the atomic displacements from the reference structure positions divided by the volume of the unit cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the complex polarization texture, we can compute the helicity density as proposed by Moffatt (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed description of the helicity calculations and the polar texture chirality is found in Helicity of Calculated Polarization Textures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
