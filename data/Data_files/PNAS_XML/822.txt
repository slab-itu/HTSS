Compounding effects of sea level rise and fluvial flooding  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Population and assets in coastal regions are threatened by both oceanic and fluvial flooding hazards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Common flood hazard assessment practices typically focus on one flood driver at a time and ignore potential compounding impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we outline a unique bivariate flood hazard assessment framework that accounts for the interactions between a primary oceanic flooding hazard, coastal water level, and fluvial flooding hazards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the notion of failure probability, we also assess coastal flood hazard under different future sea level rise scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that, in a warming climate, future sea level rise not only increases the failure probability, but also exacerbates the compounding effects of flood drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sea level rise (SLR), a well-documented and urgent aspect of anthropogenic global warming, threatens population and assets located in low-lying coastal regions all around the world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Common flood hazard assessment practices typically account for one driver at a time (e.g., either fluvial flooding only or ocean flooding only), whereas coastal cities vulnerable to SLR are at risk for flooding from multiple drivers (e.g., extreme coastal high tide, storm surge, and river flow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we propose a bivariate flood hazard assessment approach that accounts for compound flooding from river flow and coastal water level, and we show that a univariate approach may not appropriately characterize the flood hazard if there are compounding effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using copulas and bivariate dependence analysis, we also quantify the increases in failure probabilities for 2030 and 2050 caused by SLR under representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the increase in failure probability is shown to be strongly affected by compounding effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed failure probability method offers an innovative tool for assessing compounding flood hazards in a warming climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we discuss the differences between univariate and bivariate flooding probabilities for three selected estuarine systems along the coasts of United States, where the variables of interest (fluvial flow and coastal WL) are statistically dependent, namely, Philadelphia, PA; San Francisco, CA; and Washington, DC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results for the rest of the studied estuarine systems, with no significant dependence between variables, are presented in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, a direct approach to the hazard assessment is adopted, as clarified in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  76.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target is to compute the return periods and/or the failure probabilities associated with observed (and future projected) occurrences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fig 1A shows the annual maximum fluvial flow versus the associated maximum coastal WL measured within 1 day of the flood peak (black dots).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the sake of illustration, a reference bivariate occurrence z=(x,y) is chosen, and is indicated by a red circle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here x and y correspond, respectively, to 20-y return levels of the variables X (fluvial flow) and Y (coastal WL), so that z has marginal univariate return periods (RPs) equal to 20 y (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These univariate hazard scenarios (HSs) for z are shown by a thick green line on the x axis (for X) and a thick blue line on the y axis (for Y).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the bivariate framework, we use copulas to model the compounding effects of fluvial flow and coastal WL (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the HS of interest is the OR one, meaning that it is sufficient that either the fluvial flow or the coastal WL or both be large to make a bivariate occurrence hazardous (i.e., the union of the regions i, ii, and iii in Fig 1A, where either Xx, Yy, or both).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To highlight the differences between the case of assuming the variables X and Y as dependent or independent within this bivariate framework, in Fig 1, the red curve indicates the isoline of the actual joint distribution FXY crossing z, whereas the black curve indicates the isoline of FXY under the unreasonable assumption of independence between the variables X and Y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the more the variables are dependent, the more the two curves are different (e.g., compare Fig 1 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The univariate analysis (i.e., green and blue dashed lines in Fig 1), however useful for flood events driven only by river discharge (i.e., far upstream in tidal rivers) or only by coastal WL (i.e., at coastal regions not influenced by fluvial flow), may not appropriately characterize the flood hazard at/near estuaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In estuaries, flood hazard can be influenced by interactions between fluvial flooding and coastal WL (30, 31, 33, 82), and hence a particular hazard level may be more frequent than expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the case of z (indicated by the red circle) with a marginal univariate RP of 20 y, the associated estimates of the bivariate OR RPs are shown in Fig 1, for Philadelphia, PA (Fig 1B), San Francisco, CA (Fig 1C), and Washington, DC (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, it is evident that the bivariate OR RP is shorter than the 20-y univariate RP (see also Methods): 13 y for Philadelphia, 11 y for San Francisco, and 16 y for Washington, DC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that ignoring the compounding impacts of fluvial flow and coastal WLs may inappropriately characterize the coastal flood hazard, and can lead to underestimation of it: Actually, a shorter RP entails a larger frequency of occurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results for 5-, 10-, 20-, and 50-y RPs for all of the studied coastal systems are shown in SI Appendix, Section 5 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S20S27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The dependence between coastal WL and fluvial flow strongly influences the joint flood probability and, in turn, the OR RP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Washington, DC (Fig 1D), where the two flood drivers are highly correlated (Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient of 0.53; see also SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S10 and S18), an event with marginal univariate RPs of 20 y, and a 10-y OR RP based on the incorrect assumption of independence, becomes a 16-y event when the dependence structure is resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, in San Francisco (Fig 1C), where the two flood drivers are weakly correlated (Kental tau 0.15), an event with a marginal univariate RP of 20 y, and a 10-y OR RP based on the assumption of independence, becomes an 11-y event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the theory of copulas, the marginal univariate RP becomes a better predictor of the OR RP with increasing correlation between the two drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, resolving the correlation structure is critical to quantifying the compound OR RP precisely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A further key question is, to what extent will the flood hazard change as a result of increasing sea levels?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With rising sea levels, the likelihood of high WLs at any given time increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the bivariate OR flood hazard necessarily increases as well, and we can quantify the effects of SLR conditions on coastal flooding using a failure probability approach (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The term failure probability refers to the probability of observing a potentially hazardous flood event (i.e., lying in a specific HS) at least once in a given design lifetime (e.g., 30 y) (74, 83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 2 shows the failure probability computed following a univariate approach (black curves), and compounding fluvial flow and coastal WL for current (red curves) and future SLR conditions over a 30-y temporal horizon for 2030 SLR based on RCP 4.5 (purple curves) and 2050 SLR based on RCP 8.5 (green curves).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each case, it is assumed that the WL distribution does not change over the design lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering the three sites where the dependence is significant [namely, Philadelphia (PA), San Francisco (CA), and Washington (DC)], the plots also show the OR failure probabilities under an unreasonable independence assumption (blue lines in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, these probabilities are always larger than the ones computed using the true copula fitted on the data; in turn, including compounding effects but (falsely) assuming independence may overestimate the hazard (at least in the OR case), suggesting that a correct modeling of the dependencies should always be carried out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Fig 2 suggests that (i) neglecting the compounding impacts of flood drivers causes significant underestimation of failure probabilities; (ii) the assumption of independence between variables, when there is significant correlation, results in overestimation of failure probabilities; and (iii) SLR significantly increases the failure probability in the near future/midfuture in all of the cases studied here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we consider New York, NY, which is projected to experience US$174 million per year of loss due to flooding if no further flood management measures are implemented (84).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the current conditions, the failure probability at the 20-y return level over a 10-y design life time (e.g., 20172026) is expected to be 0.40 based on univariate analysis, and 0.65 based on the bivariate OR analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Now considering 2030 sea levels based on RCP 4.5, the failure probability at the same return level based on the bivariate OR analysis increases to 0.95 (0.82 to 1.00 with 95% confidence), a significantly larger value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The situation becomes worse under more-threatening SLRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same return level, 2050 SLR under RCP 8.5, representing the worst-case scenario among the CMIP5 models used for AR5 (85), failure probability increases even more in the following decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results suggest that, under this scenario, the failure probability approaches one in six of the study areas (namely, Houston, TX; Los Angeles, CA; New York, NY; Norfolk, VA; Philadelphia, PA; and San Francisco, CA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar failure probability figures for different HSs are shown in SI Appendix, Section 6 and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S28S59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This increase in failure probability due to SLR is a natural consequence of compounding effects of flood drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the expected rise in incidence and/or magnitude of high coastal WLs in the coming decades, this bivariate OR approach may be important for assessing socioeconomic impacts on coastal communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The United States, for example, has two of the three top at-risk coastal cities in terms of assets exposed to flooding, and 17 port cities with populations larger than 1 million (44, 45, 85), and so suffers and will suffer from increased frequency of coastal flooding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in addition to the rise in mean coastal WL due to SLR, we expect that other impacts may also affect the frequency of flooding in estuaries, like changes in future fluvial flow regimes, wavetide interaction, and geomorphic evolution affecting tide/surge propagation along the channel (72, 73, 76, 84, 8689).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we focus on the interactions between different SLR scenarios and current fluvial flood information, mainly because we have more confidence in the sign of change in future sea levels in a warming climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other components of coastal flood hazard (e.g., change in local fluvial flow regimes) are more uncertain and require further in-depth research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, a key issue is developing datasets for coastal communities with contemporaneous measurements of different flood drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the proposed framework can incorporate any combination of two (or even more) flood hazard drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also able to systematically deal with nonstationarity, and thus it can quantify the change in failure probability in response to the trending nature of drivers/hazards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this work, we consider annual maxima, and use the corresponding block maxima mathematical framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Robust definition of compound events (3) and the efficient sampling for joint probability analysis (90) are challenging tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A desired approach should appropriately represent the information entailed in the data while simplifying the sources data (i.e., refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5, 91, and 92).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two variables of interest here are (i) the largest annual freshwater inflow to the lower estuary and (ii) the corresponding largest observed hourly WL within ±1 d. This procedure provides the pairs of interest for any given year (annual bivariate vectors) that can be assumed to be independent for physical reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we need to identify suitable HSs that refer to the regions where the values of the variable(s) of interest may be considered as hazardous according to appropriate criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An HS is simultaneously characterized by (i) a geometrical component (i.e., a hazardous region, either on the real line in the univariate case or in the real plane in the bivariate case) and (ii) a probabilistic component (i.e., the probability that an occurrence belongs to the hazardous region).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes it possible to use the HS for both RP and failure probability analyses (74, 77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the univariate case, given a critical threshold x, the corresponding univariate HS is defined as the set of occurrences such that {Xx}.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the bivariate case, given a critical pair z=(x,y), the corresponding bivariate HS is taken to be the inclusive OR one, defined as the set of occurrences such that either {Xx}, {Yy}, or both (74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choice of a bivariate OR approach is a natural one in the present context, since it is sufficient that either the fluvial discharge, the coastal WL, or both be large to produce a potentially hazardous occurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents a valuable approximation of the dynamics of coastal flooding, in which the combined events due to nonextreme discharges and WLs might also potentially generate hazardous occurrences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The geometry of the HSs introduced above are illustrated in Fig 1A, for given critical thresholds x and y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The green half-line on the horizontal axis indicates the univariate HS {Xx} corresponding to the variable X, and the blue half-line on the vertical axis indicates the univariate HS {Yy} corresponding to the variable Y.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shaded region is the bivariate OR HS corresponding to the pair (X,Y), where either Xx, Yy, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The fundamental difference between a univariate and a bivariate approach lies in the related failure mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the former case, failure is ruled solely by a single variable, whereas, in the latter, the compounding effects of two variables may result in hazardous occurrences, even if none of the variables take on extreme values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An occurrence may be labeled as hazardous or not, depending on the chosen failure mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the occurrences in regions ii and iii of Fig 1A would be considered as hazardous if the ruling variable were the fluvial flow X, but the ones in region iii would not be hazardous according to their WL (since Yy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the occurrences in regions i and ii would be hazardous if the ruling variable were the WL Y, but the ones in region i would not be such in terms of the river flows (since Xx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, all of the occurrences in the regions i, ii, and iii would be hazardous according to the (bivariate) OR criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the OR approach may account for the physically based fact that the combined events of X and Y (even if not extreme) may yield hazardous events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Univariate_and_Bivariate_Models  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Below, the construction of an appropriate probability model is explained, separately, for the univariate and the bivariate approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

RP_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present annual-based framework, the RP T associated with a given HS (either univariate or bivariate) can be defined asT=1/P{HS},[2]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where, P{HS} is the probability that an event occurs in the HS of interest (74, 77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the univariate case, where the HS is identified via a critical threshold x (or y), Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 reduces to the traditional formulaTX=1/(1FX(x)),[3]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where FX is the distribution of X, and 1FX(x) represents the probability that an occurrence lies on the horizontal green half-line in Fig 1A (or, equivalently, the probability of the region iiiii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same approach can be taken to define the RP TY for Y and the region iii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the bivariate OR case, where the HS is identified via a critical pair z=(x,y) as in Fig 1A, exploiting the Sklars Theorem, Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2 becomesTOR=1/(1FXY(x,y))=1/(1CXY(FX(x),FY(y))),[4]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
where, FXY is the joint distribution of the pair (X,Y), and 1FXY(x,y) is equal to the probability of X x OR Y  y, i.e., the probability that a bivariate occurrence lies in the shaded region iiiiii in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a thorough mathematical treatment, see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  74 and 77.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since, for all copulas, CXY(FX(x),FY(y))min{FX(x),FY(y)}, it turns out that both TORless_thanTX and TORless_thanTY.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, potentially hazardous bivariate OR regions are more frequent than the corresponding univariate ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, neglecting the compounding effects of hazard drivers may result in an underestimation of the hazard when the combined action of X and Y plays a significant role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Failure_Probability_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For a given design lifetime T (typically in years), let (S1, , ST) be a sequence of relevant annual bivariate HSs (in the present case, the OR ones).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the corresponding failure probability pT can be defined aspT=1P{(X1,Y1)S1,,(XT,YT)ST},[5]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
equivalent to the complement of the probability that no hazardous event occurs in T years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an OR HS, identified by a critical pair z=(x,y), in the case of independent identically distributed occurrences, the failure probability is a monotonically increasing function of T, and is given bypT=1[CXY(FX(x),FY(y))]T,[6]  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
representing the probability that at least one bivariate OR hazardous occurrence happens during a T-year temporal horizon (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  74 for further details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As explained earlier, since CXY(FX(x),FY(y))min{FX(x),FY(y)}, and FX(x) and FY(y) represent the probabilities of safe univariate X and Y occurrences, it turns out that pT,ORpT,X and pT,ORpT,Y for all Ts, implying that OR occurrences are generally more hazardous than univariate ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To integrate the concept of nonstationarity to the proposed bivariate HS and failure probability estimates framework, we perturbed the annual bivariate vectors using Monte Carlo simulations exploiting the projected distribution of SLR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details are explained in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Results and Discussion, it is shown how the SLR may increase the failure probability of coastal flood defenses in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
