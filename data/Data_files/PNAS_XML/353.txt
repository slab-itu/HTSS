Quantity discounts on a virtual good: The results of a massive pricing experiment at King Digital Entertainment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We report on a natural field experiment on quantity discounts involving more than 14 million consumers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Implementing price reductions ranging from 970% for large purchases, we found remarkably little impact on revenue, either positively or negatively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was virtually no increase in the quantity of customers making a purchase; all the observed changes occurred for customers who already were buyers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found evidence that infrequent purchasers are more responsive to discounts than frequent purchasers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was some evidence of habit formation when prices returned to pre-experiment levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There also was some evidence that consumers contemplating small purchases are discouraged by the presence of extreme quantity discounts for large purchases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Background__Experimental_Design__and_Implementation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
King is one of the worlds most successful makers of online games, most notably the blockbuster game Candy Crush, which has been downloaded onto more than 500 million devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  King is widely recognized as being among an elite set of firms that have parlayed big data acumen and a culture of experimentation into business success (21, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (As of this writing, King has a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion, annual revenues of more than $2 billion, and net profits of $575 million.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
King games are provided to users free of charge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The great majority of Kings revenues are generated through in-game purchases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the game we study, players are allotted a fixed set of moves to complete a task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the player is successful, he/she moves on to the next level; if unsuccessful, the player repeats the current level until success is achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the course of play, consumers have the opportunity to purchase a virtual currency (gold bars) which can be redeemed for game features that facilitate completion of the level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, nine gold bars are needed to purchase extra moves or boosters, and this is the smallest quantity of gold bars sold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consumer pays 99 cents for nine gold bars, or 11 cents per bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically King has offered extremely modest discounts: The price per bar is reduced by less than 10% for a purchase of 1,000 gold bars, the largest quantity offered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This practice stands in stark contrast to many of Kings direct competitors and to many other producers of consumer goods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (For instance, in the popular game Clash of Clans, Supercell offers quantity discounts up to 28% percent for in-game gems purchases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, at the McDonalds restaurant in Hyde Park, IL, a 10-piece Chicken McNugget order sells for $5.12, and 20 pieces sell for $5.70.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that although, in general, price discrimination is carried out by firms to maximize profit, it also may benefit consumers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this particular experiment, for instance, all our treatment interventions involved reducing prices relative to Kings status quo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our experimental intervention took the form of four treatment arms that offered different degrees of quantity discounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1 shows the four different price schedules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prices were held fixed for small purchases (959 gold bars) across the four treatment arms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prices varied only for purchases of 100 or more gold bars, allowing us to isolate the impact of quantity discounts from the impact of lower prices per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, about 10% of purchases involved at least 100 gold bars, and these purchases account for 45% of revenue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottom line in Fig 1, which we denote the standard discount, mirrors historical pricing by King and offers quantity discounts of less than 10%, even for purchases of 1,000 gold bars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second treatment enhanced discount, mirrors the shape of the historical pricing pattern but roughly doubles the quantity discount offered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a third treatment, which we denote deep discount, the per-unit discount rises monotonically to almost 60% for the largest purchases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the most extreme intervention, which we call the radical discount treatment, even intermediate-sized purchases were offered per-unit price discounts of more than 60%; the largest purchases were rewarded with discounts of more than 70%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In total, more than 14 million consumers were included in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A given consumer saw the same price schedule for the 3-mo duration of the experiment, after which all prices reverted to the historical price discounts offered by King.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consumers were not informed that prices were being experimentally varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (We can find no evidence that our experimental prices were discussed on forums or chat groups related to the game.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other than the differences in prices, the purchase screen was identical across treatments and was similar to how it always had appeared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No mention was made during the experiment as to whether the prices presented were temporary or permanent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were randomized into one of the four possible price schedules, with a 20% probability of assignment to the standard discount or the radical discount and a 30% probability of being assigned to the enhanced discount or the deep discount.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The researchers received only aggregated data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data used in this analysis are available to other scholars for replication purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because no individual data were provided to us, and because the experiment was carried on as part of normal business operations at King, our project was deemed exempt from human subjects regulations by the University of Chicago Institutional Review Board.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1 examines the extent to which the four arms of the study are balanced on observable pretreatment characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each row of the table represents a different pretreatment characteristic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four columns of the table correspond to the four treatment arms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each cell of the table, we report the mean within the treatment arm along with SEs where relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the request of King, we normalized many of the outcome variables to be equal to 100 for the standard discount group in the preperiod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the massive samples, revenues per user differ by up to 3% across treatments because there is a long right tail in revenues, with a small number of high-value customers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other measures are well balanced across treatments: levels attempted, levels completed, and the share of customers falling into each of three customer segments, i.e., players who have never made purchases, medium-value customers, and high-value customers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Short-Term_Results_of_the_Experiment  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 2 summarizes the key results of the experiment for the 12 wk in which it was running.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four columns of the table again correspond to the four treatment arms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each row represents a different outcome measure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Entries in the table are means across all subjects in a treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top row reports revenues per customer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that all these values are higher than in the top row of Table 1 because the pre-experimental window was 1 mo, but the experimental period was 12 wk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are remarkably similar across the standard discount, enhanced discount, and deep discount treatments, with revenues varying less than 1% across those treatments and with no statistical differences between the treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding implies that, over an extremely wide range of quantity discounts, the short-run price elasticity of demand is very close to one, i.e., that a 1% decrease in price leads to a 1% increase in quantity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only for the radical discount is this pattern broken, with revenues falling 10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The small differences in revenue across treatments disguise significant impacts on quantities purchased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to the standard discount treatment, the progressively deeper discounts drive quantity increases of 6.7%, 11.2%, and 44.9%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Consumers who respond to the discounts by buying larger quantities use the items they purchase quickly rather than saving them, even though the items are storable.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences are all highly statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average price paid falls by similar proportions, however, leaving revenue essentially unchanged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the increases in average quantity, the fourth row of the table shows that there is no difference across treatments in the share of consumers making at least one purchase during the treatment period: In all four treatment arms this share is 0.026.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of consumers making a purchase is affected by two potential forces in this experiment: (i) bigger quantity discounts may induce more purchases along the extensive margin, and (ii) large quantity discounts may discourage consumers who are interested only in making a small purchase but who are made to feel that small purchases are a bad deal in the face of steep quantity discounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that both these forces are at work, offsetting one another, but that both are relatively weak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, among those who have never made a purchase before, the radical discount treatment induces a 16% increase in purchases (although this increase is from an extremely low base rate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among customers who have made a positive number of small purchases in the past, the number making a purchase in radical discount scheme actually falls by 2% relative to the standard discount; this result is consistent with the second force highlighted above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Indeed, roughly 4 wk into the experiment, the share of players making at least one purchase fell monotonically with the size of the discounts offered, exactly the opposite of the predictions of standard economic theory, which ignores the second force highlighted above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects were undone in the latter part of the experiment.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data suggest that large numbers of low-priced boosters have little allure for consumers who historically have made little use of boosters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether such consumers could be transformed through price discounts on smaller bundles remains an open question and one that is of central interest to King.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The quantity discounts had only a minor impact on game play, as demonstrated in the final two rows of Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of rounds played (i.e., roughly 194 rounds) was virtually unaffected across treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of levels successfully completed per user rose slightly with the magnitude of the discounts, but the increase was only a fraction of a percent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the results on purchases, this outcome is not surprising.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the quantity purchased rose substantially in percentage terms, purchases were quite rare overall, so these changes did not have a major impact on game play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The aggregate results reported above potentially hide substantial heterogeneity across customers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unrelated to and before our experiment, players had been segmented into categories based on past purchasing behavior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 3 reports the results when all customers who had previously made a purchase in the game are divided into two mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories based on these predefined segments, medium-value and high-value players.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (There also was a large group of players who had never made a purchase before the experiment, but these players accounted for a trivial share of revenue in the experimental period.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once again, treatments are shown in four columns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outcome variables are presented first for the medium-value segment and then for the high-spending segment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is interesting that the radical discount, which performed so poorly overall, actually generated the most revenue from the medium-value group (23% more than the other treatments, statistically significant at the 0.05 level) but fared very badly for the high-value users, with a highly statistically significant decline in revenue of almost 15%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For medium-value customers, the price discounts induced sufficient substitution from small to large purchases to be revenue enhancing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among high-value customers, the quantity response was not sufficient to offset the price declines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Put another way, the high-value customers are less price elastic than the medium-value customers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absent other constraints, it would be profit maximizing to charge the high-value players higher prices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For legal reasons and because of fairness concerns, King would never do so.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (One potential pricing scheme King could consider would be a price per unit of 4 for the first 20 units, a price per unit of 2 for the next 10 units, and a price per unit of 3 thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average price never increases with quantity in this scheme, so consumers do not have an incentive to divide their purchases into smaller chunks, but it does provide a lower marginal price for purchases of intermediate size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thank a referee for suggesting this mechanism.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Had the high-value customers been more price elastic than other players, then steeper quantity discounts likely would have been strongly profit enhancing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced discount yields the best results for high-value customers but generates only a statistically insignificant 1% increase in revenues for that group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The other important difference that emerges between medium-value customers and high-value customers is the pattern of levels successfully completed per customer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For medium-value customers, we see little impact; among high-value customers that number jumps by 12% between the standard discount and the radical discount treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note also that in the radical discount treatment the increase in successful completions is accomplished using slightly fewer game rounds: The players use their gold bars more frequently to complete the task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Impacts_of_the_Pricing_Experiment_on_Behavior_After_It_Ends  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is impossible to determine from the results presented above which of the pricing schedules yields the greatest value to King.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short-term impact on revenue is so small that any persistent effects of the experiment may swamp these differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 4 presents results, broken down into medium-value consumers and high-value consumers, for the month following the end of the experiment when all consumers saw the same price schedule, i.e., the standard discount.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For medium-value players, those who had been exposed to the radical discount continued to spend a statistically insignificant additional 34%, as is consistent with habit formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For high-value customers, there are no clear patterns of behavioral spillovers into the postexperimental period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this paper we report on a massive field experiment investigating the impact of quantity discounts in a virtual environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of findings are surprising, at least to the authors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, varying quantity discounts across an extremely wide range had almost no profit impact in the short term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, almost all of the impact of the price changes was among those already making a purchase; radical price reductions induced almost no new customers to buy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, there was heterogeneity in response, especially to the radical discount treatment, which led to increased revenue from medium-value customers but a sharp reduction in revenue from high-value customers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we observe few differences in behavior in the postexperimental period, although there is some evidence of habit formation among medium-value consumers who bought only small amounts of gold bars and did so sporadically before the price cuts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is difficult to know to what extent the results of this experiment will generalize to other settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The product we examined has many unusual aspects: The goods being purchased are virtual; consumers can play the game without these goods, which only enhance the experience; and consumers had substantial experience with the game before this pricing experiment and potentially had already formed habits in advance of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given how little is known empirically about consumer response to quantity discounts, every additional data point represents a material increase in knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From a corporate perspective, this experiment was somewhat a failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It did not reveal a pricing strategy that led to a large immediate increase in profitability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Had this experiment yielded different results, however, it easily could have generated hundreds of millions of dollars in profit for King.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the experiment did not directly generate profits, it strongly suggests future experiments that could answer important theoretical questions and/or generate increased profit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the limited evidence of movement along the extensive margin makes it more likely than otherwise that price increases for small quantity purchases would be profit enhancing, a possibility that the company has not previously tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From an academic perspective, however, the experiment was at least partially successful in that it raises many challenges to the conventional thinking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on both the theory literature and previous empirical research, one might have suspected that increased profits would result from second-degree price discrimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, medium-value and high-value customers reacted in offsetting ways, diluting the gains from the quantity discounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding why Kings customers exhibit this pattern would be valuable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another potentially interesting and surprising feature observed in the data is that this experiment suggests that some consumers who would have made small purchases were discouraged from doing so when faced with large-quantity discounts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That phenomenon would not occur under standard economic models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not having anticipated that particular result, we did not design the experiment to isolate it cleanly, but it suggests a fruitful avenue for future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results imply that prices change people's perception of the value of goodsperhaps more so in virtual settingsbut little is known about this topic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There can be little doubt that partnering with firms offers opportunities for scientific advances that otherwise would be out of reach (23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without collaboration with a firm such as King, it is hard to imagine a project like this one ever being carried out as academic research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, there was essentially no cost to the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  King had to offer some menu of prices to these 14 million customers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because King has invested in an infrastructure for and a mindset of experimentation, only a few person days of effort were needed to implement and analyze the basic findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cost per subject of running this experiment was perhaps 1/100th of one cent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are many notable examples of firms sharing data for academic analysis, to date there are surprisingly few cases in which academics and firms have collaborated to run randomized experiments and have made the findings available to the scientific community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the quest to test economic theory in real-world settings, firm-based field experiments represent a unique opportunity previously out of reach for academic economists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This path appears to be a promising one for future scientific advances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
