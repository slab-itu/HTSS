Ultrathin dendrimergraphene oxide composite film for stable cycling lithiumsulfur batteries  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The promise of lithiumsulfur batteries for future electric transportation and stationary energy storage is being limited by their poor cycling stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous approaches to improvement often involve incorporating additional components with significant dead weight or volume in battery structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We develop an ultrathin functionalized dendrimergraphene oxide composite film which can be applied to virtually any sulfur cathode to alleviate capacity fading over battery cycling without compromising the energy or power density of the entire battery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The design provides a new strategy for confining lithium polysulfide intermediates and thus stabilizing lithiumsulfur batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also brings a suitable platform for elucidating the underlying materials and surface chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Lithiumsulfur batteries (LiS batteries) have attracted intense interest because of their high specific capacity and low cost, although they are still hindered by severe capacity loss upon cycling caused by the soluble lithium polysulfide intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although many structure innovations at the material and device levels have been explored for the ultimate goal of realizing long cycle life of LiS batteries, it remains a major challenge to achieve stable cycling while avoiding energy and power density compromises caused by the introduction of significant dead weight/volume and increased electrochemical resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce an ultrathin composite film consisting of naphthalimide-functionalized poly(amidoamine) dendrimers and graphene oxide nanosheets as a cycling stabilizer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining the dendrimer structure that can confine polysulfide intermediates chemically and physically together with the graphene oxide that renders the film robust and thin (less_than1% of the thickness of the active sulfur layer), the composite film is designed to enable stable cycling of sulfur cathodes without compromising the energy and power densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our sulfur electrodes coated with the composite film exhibit very good cycling stability, together with high sulfur content, large areal capacity, and improved power rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The PAMAM G4 dendrimer was first functionalized by reacting the terminal amine groups with 1,8-naphthalic anhydride (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful decoration was confirmed by UV-vis (SI Appendix, Fig S1) and 1H NMR (SI Appendix, Fig S2) spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mixing the Naph-Den N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution with an mGO DMF suspension forms a sticky slurry (Fig 1B) that can be conveniently casted onto substrates using doctor blading to afford a thin film (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image shows that the thickness of the film is about 100 nm (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We coated the Naph-DenmGO slurry onto a prepared GOS (SI Appendix, Fig S3) electrode surface (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof of concept, the GOS electrode material had a sulfur content of 65 wt % and the sulfur mass loading on the cathode was 1 mg cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1F shows the top view of the GOS electrode coated with the Naph-DenmGO film (Naph-DenmGO/GOS), where a thin surface layer is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C, N, O, and S elements are identified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), which confirms the existence of the N-containing dendrimer in the surface layer (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1G shows the side view of the Naph-DenmGO/GOS electrode, where the Naph-DenmGO layer can be clearly distinguished from the underlying GOS layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Naph-DenmGO film has a thickness of 90 nm shown in the enlarged image, which is a negligible fraction (less_than1%) in volume compared with the active GOS layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Naph-DenmGO/GOS electrode was evaluated in a coin cell with a Li metal anode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell was first discharged and recharged at various current rates (0.110 C), and then tested for consecutive long-term cycling at 1.0 and 2.0 C. Specific capacities of 1,472, 1,255, 1,083, and 943 mAh g1 (based on sulfur mass) were observed at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0 C together with well-defined voltage profiles (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, reversible capacities of 785 and 530 mAh g1 were obtained at high rates of 2.0 and 5.0 C (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a comparison, the GOS cathode without the Naph-DenmGO film exhibited comparable capacities at low rates but much lower capacities at high rates (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 5.0 C the specific capacity was already as low as 143 mAh g1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cell was then cycled at 1.0 C with a starting capacity of 830 mAh g1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 560 cycles at 1.0 C, the Naph-DenmGO/GOS electrode retained a capacity of 757 mAh g1, corresponding to an average capacity loss of 0.016% per cycle (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After that the cell was further cycled for another 665 cycles at 2.0 C, during which the capacity dropped from 668 to 562 mAh g1, giving an average capacity decay of 0.024% per cycle (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable charging and discharging voltage profiles with well-defined voltage plateaus were recorded throughout the cycling process (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, the GOS cathode without the Naph-DenmGO film showed inferior cycle life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capacity decreased 0.054% per cycle at 1.0 C, and then 0.073% per cycle at 2.0 C (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further increased the sulfur content in the GOS electrode material to 76 wt % (SI Appendix, Fig S7) and the sulfur mass loading on the electrode to 2 mg cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Naph-DenmGO/GOS electrode still had better kinetics than the GOS electrode as evidenced by the voltage profiles with flatter discharging plateaus (SI Appendix, Fig S8), although both electrodes manifested compromised specific capacities and rate capabilities as the sulfur content and mass loading increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the Naph-DenmGO/GOS electrode still exhibited excellent cycling stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting from 727 mAh g1 at 1.0 C, the capacity remained 698 mAh g1 after 500 cycles, giving an average capacity loss as low as 0.008% per cycle (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the discharge voltage did not decay over the 500 cycles (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without the Naph-DenmGO film, the GOS electrode experienced much faster capacity decay (0.068% per cycle) accompanied by decreasing discharging voltages (Fig 3 A and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parallel testing demonstrated consistency in electrochemical performance of the Naph-DenmGO/GOS cathodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Capacity decay of about 0.01% per cycle over 1,000 dischargingrecharging cycles can be realized (SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As sulfur mass loading further increased to 3.5 mg cm2, the Naph-DenmGO/GOS electrode was able to deliver a stable specific capacity of 1,000 mAh g1 at 0.2 C, corresponding to a high areal capacity of 3.5 mAh cm2 (SI Appendix, Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 0.5 C, 750 mAh g1 and 2.8 mAh cm2 could be achieved with negligible capacity fading over cycling (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Naph-DenmGO film can also enhance cycling performance of other sulfur electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protected by the composite film, a carbon nanotube buckypaper electrode loaded with 6 mg cm2 of sulfur exhibited stable capacity of 750 mAh g1 at 0.5 C (SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed for the Naph-DenmGO/GOS and GOS electrodes before and after long-term cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig 4A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically the depressed semicircle in the high-to medium-frequency region reflects charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the inclined line in the low-frequency region is related to mass transfer process (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GOS cathode had an initial Rct of 25 , which rose to 175  after 1,275 dischargingcharging cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying the Naph-DenmGO film drastically suppresses the increase of charge transfer resistance over cycling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Rct of the Naph-DenmGO/GOS cathode only increased to 45  from the initial 32  over 1,275 cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Naph-DenmGO/GOS electrode after long-term cycling was imaged with SEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface of the cycled electrode remained smooth and clean without chunk precipitates (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EDX spectrum (SI Appendix, Fig S13) revealed C, N, O, F, and S elements on the electrode surface, which indicated the robustness of the Naph-DenmGO film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The side-view image of the cycled electrode further confirmed the integrity of the surface film over cycling (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was observed that the thickness of the film increased to 400 nm due to uptake of sulfur species during the cycling process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elemental distributions of C and S in the vertical cross-section of the electrode are shown in Fig 4D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear that the sulfur species are well confined by the surface film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrochemical stability of the composite film was also verified by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements: In the potential window of 1.72.7 V vs. Li+/Li (the operating voltage range of sulfur cathodes), the film showed no obvious redox peaks during repeated CV cycles (SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further examine the LPS-confining effect of the Naph-DenmGO film, Li | GOS and Li | Naph-DenmGO/GOS cells were disassembled after 250 cycles, and the used Li anodes were carefully analyzed with SEM and EDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the digital photos of the disassembled cells (SI Appendix, Fig S15 A and B), it is obvious that the separator of the cycled Li | GOS cell contains a significant amount of LPS (yellow), whereas the separator of the cycled Li | Naph-DenmGO/GOS cell is almost free of LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined SEM imaging and EDS mapping (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1517) shows that the cycled Li anode paired with the GOS cathode is composed of loosely packed small Li particles with a high amount of sulfur species, whereas that paired with the Naph-DenmGO/GOS cathode features densely packed, larger Li granules containing a much smaller amount of sulfur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data, taken together, reveal that the shuttle effect has been substantially suppressed by deploying the Naph-DenmGO interlayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The polysulfide-confining Naph-DenmGO film promotes high electrochemical performance of sulfur cathodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composite film not only prevents LPS from diffusing away from the cathode and thus avoids active material loss and Coulombic efficiency decrease, but it also affords a uniform environment on the cathode surface for facile LPS redox conversion and thus ensures a high degree of utilization of active material and low electrochemical resistance throughout the long-term cycling process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the Naph-DenmGO/GOS electrode has a long cycle life with a capacity decay of less_than0.01% per cycle, which substantially outperforms any other sulfur cathode with interlayer protection (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also arguably the best cycling stability among all sulfur cathodes reported to date (SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth mentioning that our Naph-DenmGO film is only 100 nm thick; its small volume and light weight allow for cycling stability enhancement without compromising the battery energy and power densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is difficult to achieve with previously reported interlayers that are usually thicker or heavier by at least one order of magnitude (SI Appendix, Fig S18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With N- and O-containing functional groups embedded in its branched structure, the Naph-Den is expected to interact with LPS strongly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a control experiment, we evaluated a GOS electrode coated with an mGO film without the dendrimer component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capacity fading over cycling (0.049% per cycle) was substantially faster than the Naph-DenmGO/GOS electrode, although slightly slower than the GOS electrode without any film coated (SI Appendix, Fig S19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thus clear that the Naph-Den is the central component of the composite film for confining polysulfides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The following part of the article will discuss the molecular origins of the binding between the Naph-Den and LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We first used XPS to probe the chemical interactions between Naph-Den and LPS using Li2S4 as a model compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S 2p core-level spectrum of Li2S4 exhibits two sets of doublets located at 163.1/164.3 eV and 161.4/162.6 eV (Fig 5A), with binding energy splittings of 1.2 eV, which are attributed to the bridging and terminal sulfur (SB0 and ST-1) atoms, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectral features agree well with previous results reported elsewhere (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of Naph-Den, the S 2p doublets both shift to lower binding energy (Fig 5A), indicating increased valence electron density on the S atoms upon interaction with Naph-Den.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding energy of the N 1s electrons in the Naph-Den remains almost unchanged upon interaction with Li2S4 (Fig 5B), which suggests a minor contribution from the N sites in the dendrimer structure for LPS binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is distinct from previous reports where N atoms in the carbon materials bind LPS strongly (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The O 1s spectrum of Naph-Den exhibits two components at 531.8 and 533.5 eV (Fig 5C), which could be due to the O atoms of the amide and imide groups in the Naph-Den structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of Li2S4, the O 1s peak shifts to lower binding energy, indicating that the O atoms interact strongly with LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further XPS studies reveal that the PAMAM dendrimer interacts with Li2S4 in a similar manner as the Naph-Den (SI Appendix, Fig S20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thus likely that the O atoms of the amide groups in the PAMAM structure are the major interactive sites responsible for Naph-Den binding with LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then performed DFT calculations to examine the LPS binding mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We modeled LPS with LiSSH to include S atoms representing both the terminal and bridging S atoms in LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different from many previous reports based on binding energy (EB) (14, 23), we focused on the binding free energy (GB) to evaluate the interaction strength between LiSSH and different binding sites (BSite) and/or solvent molecules (Sol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GB is defined as follows:GB=G(HSSLiSolmBSiten)G(HSSLi)mG(Sol)nG(BSite),where HSSSLiSolmBSiten is the complex of LiSSH with m solvent molecules and n binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of GB in place of EB brings the advantage of including both thermal and entropy corrections, which is important for accurate modeling of the interaction strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, we calculated the EB of LiSSH to the 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) solvent molecule to be 20.7 kcal mol1 (SI Appendix, Fig S21), in excellent agreement with previously reported values for similar systems (14, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, taking entropy into consideration, GB for binding of LiSSH to DOL is 10.6 kcal mol1, which differs substantially from EB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that GB for binding of LiSSH to another solvent molecule, dimethoxyethane (DME), is 20.6 kcal mol1, significantly more negative than that for DOL (Fig 6 A and B), suggesting that LiSSH prefers to be solvated by the chelating ligand DME.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GB for binding of LiSSH to two DME molecules is 24.3 kcal mol1 (Fig 6C), corresponding to G of 3.7 kcal mol1 for HSSLi-DME to bind a second DME molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, LiSSH prefers to be solvated by two DME molecules in the battery electrolyte, consistent with previous reports on DME-solvated Li complexes in both solution (39) and crystals (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Now we turn to the binding of LiSSH to Naph-Den.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are three sites in the Naph-Den molecular structure that can bind LPS, namely the O atoms in the amide groups (O1 site), the N atoms in the tertiary amine groups (N1 site), and the O atoms in the terminal imide groups (Ot site), as shown in SI Appendix, Fig S22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S23 shows that the binding between LiSSH and a functional group is hardly affected by other atoms beyond the functional group, and thus demonstrates the validity of our model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 6 DF, GB values for binding of LiSSH to the N1, O1, and Ot sites in Naph-Den are 13.2, 19.0, and 17.3 kcal mol1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All are smaller than that to DME, indicating that the three types of binding sites are unlikely to replace the DME ligand in HSSLi(DME).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GB values for binding of LiSSH to the N1, O1, and Ot sites in the presence of one DME molecule are calculated to be 22.8, 27.0, and 24.5 kcal mol1, respectively (Fig 6 GI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GB values for binding of HSSLi(DME) to the N1, O1, and Ot sites can thus be derived to be 1.2, 6.4, and 3.9 kcal mol1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the GB values for binding of HSSLi(DME) to a second DME molecule (3.7 kcal mol1), our results suggest that it is thermodynamically favorable for the O1 site to replace a DME molecule in HSSLi(DME)2 (G = 2.7 kcal mol1) and thus bind LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also suggest that the N1 site is unlikely to bind the solvated LiSSH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering that the samples for XPS study are under high vacuum condition in which the volatile organic solvents are likely to be removed from the samples, we include analysis of interactions between LiSSH and Naph-Den in the absence of solvent molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated binding free energies suggest that the O1 site should still be the dominant binding sites for LPS (SI Appendix, Fig S24 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the optimized structure for LiSSH binding to the O1 site of the Naph-Den, we further calculated the partial atomic charges for the S, O, and N atoms in the structure to correlate with the binding energy shifts measured by XPS (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in SI Appendix, Fig S24D, the Mulliken charges on the O atom of the Naph-Den O1 site and on the S atoms of the LiSSH all become more negative (with increased electron density) upon interaction, which well explains the experimentally observed red shifts of O 1s and S 2p binding energies in the XPS spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, therefore, confirmed that the O atoms of the amide groups in the Naph-Den structure are the dominant sites that bind LPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, we have designed and developed an ultrathin dendrimerGO composite film to mitigate the polysulfide shuttling problem and stabilize the cycling of LiS batteries without compromising their energy and power densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dendrimer molecules provide strong affinity to polysulfides via specific chemical interactions between amide groups and Li ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graphene oxide nanosheets ensure mechanical robustness and low thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting combination of materials leads to a composite film interlayer with unique properties and outstanding performance, opening a viable and effective strategy to afford high-performance cathodes for LiS batteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
