Daple coordinates organ-wide and cell-intrinsic polarity to pattern inner-ear hair bundles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Each hair cell of our auditory and vestibular systems transduces stimuli into electrical signals through its mechanosensitive hair bundle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the bundle is responsive along only a single axis, its orientation is crucial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two systems determine hair-bundle polarity: planar cell polarity proteins, which establish axes along which hair cells are oriented, and the proteins Gi and LGN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigating how these two systems are coordinated so that each hair bundle is appropriately aligned, we identified Daple.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mutants lacking Daple, hair bundles are misoriented and misshapen, a phenotype suggestive of both organ-wide and cell-intrinsic defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study indicates how Daple interacts with proteins of the two systems and proposes a model for its role in determining hair-bundle polarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The establishment of planar polarization by mammalian cells necessitates the integration of diverse signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the inner ear, at least two systems regulate the planar polarity of sensory hair bundles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins coordinate the orientations of hair cells across the epithelial plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell-intrinsic patterning of hair bundles is implemented independently by the G protein complex classically known for orienting the mitotic spindle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the primary cilium also participates in each of these pathways, its role and the integration of the two systems are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that Dishevelled-associating protein with a high frequency of leucine residues (Daple) interacts with PCP and cell-intrinsic signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regulated by the cell-intrinsic pathway, Daple is required to maintain the polarized distribution of the core PCP protein Dishevelled and to position the primary cilium at the abneural edge of the apical surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the primary cilium or an associated structure influences the domain of cell-intrinsic signals that shape the hair bundle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daple is therefore essential to orient and pattern sensory hair bundles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Daple in cochlear hair-bundle development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) Schematic diagram of the cochlear sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, depicts one row of inner hair cells and three rows of outer hair cells (pink) surmounted by the gelatinous tectorial membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up-and-down vibration of the basilar membrane causes mechanical stimulation along the neural-to-abneural axis (arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) Schematic representation of the surface of the organ of Corti portrays the single row of inner hair cells (IHC) and the three rows of outer hair cells (OHC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each hair bundle (green) forms an arrowhead pointed toward the abneural edge of the sensory epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A kinocilium (black dot) stands at the apex of each bundle, and the domain of Gi expression (pink) extends from the hair bundle to the abneural edge of the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) Phalloidin labeling (green) reveals hair bundles in a postnatal day (P) 0 wild-type cochlea (Left) and a Daple/ littermate (Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although wild-type bundles orient toward the abneural edge of the cochlea, Daple/ hair bundles are misshapen and do not orient uniformly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Scale bar: C and E, 10 m.) (D) Scanning electron micrographs portray hair bundles from P2 wild-type and Daple/ animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of the mutant bundles are misoriented and deformed, and some are fragmented (dashed circles; kinocilia at arrowheads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Scale bar: 5 m.) (E, Left and Inset) Immunohistochemistry reveals Daple (magenta) at the abneural boundaries of wild-type P0 hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (E, Right) This junctional enrichment is not visible in Daple/ littermates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The_Loss_of_Daple_Causes_Severe_Hair-Bundle_Defects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using full-length Gi3 as bait, we screened a cDNA library derived from 600 inner ears of mice aged 2 to 6 d (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the screen identified the Gi regulator Gpsm2, also termed Leu-Gly-Asn repeat-enriched protein (LGN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemical localization of several other candidates revealed expression in the nucleus, membrane-bounded organelles, or cellular cortex (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prominent among the products of the screen was the coiled-coil domain-containing protein 88c (Ccdc88c), also termed Dishevelled-associating protein with a high frequency of leucine residues (Daple).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Dishevelled-binding protein that inhibits canonical Wnt signaling in Xenopus, Daple also directs cell migration through noncanonical Wnt signaling (11, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Daple is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that can bind and activate Gi3 downstream of Wnt (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interactions of Daple with both Dishevelled and Gi3 have been demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation (1315).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Daple can regulate both Gi and the core PCP protein Dishevelled, we sought to characterize the proteins role in hair-bundle development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Adult animals of the Ccdc88ctm1(KOMP)Mbp strain, subsequently referred to as Daple/ mutants, resembled their heterozygous littermates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their cochleae, each containing one row of inner hair cells and three rows of outer hair cells (Fig 1B), were grossly normal at birth (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the absence of Daple did not affect the organization of these four rows, Daple/ mice displayed striking defects in their hair bundles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The staircase of stereocilia was both misoriented and grossly misshapen (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the Ccdc88ctm1(KOMP)Mbp strain contained a floxed neomycin-resistance cassette (Fig S2B), we confirmed that Ccdc88ctm1b(KOMP)Mbp with no neomycin-resistance cassette also exhibited hair-bundle defects (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified the genomic deletion by sequencing and RT-PCR (Fig S2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further investigate whether the genetic deletion eliminated Daple function, we conducted immunohistochemistry with two antibodies that target parts of the protein outside the genetic deletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both antibodies revealed Daple at the abneural intercellular junctions of cochlear cells, an enrichment not visible in Daple/ mice (Fig 1E and Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Dishevelled and Gi localized on the abneural side of cochlear hair cells (1618), suggesting that Daple is positioned to interact both with core PCP components and with cell-intrinsic signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Coupling_of_Gi_and_the_Kinocilium_Shapes_the_Hair_Bundle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although postnatal Daple/ hair bundles were severely misshapen, the apical enrichment of cell-intrinsic signals did not appear diminished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LGN colocalized with Gi3, and aPKC formed a complementary domain (Fig 2 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, postnatal Daple/ hair cells exhibited a variety of hair-bundle shapes characterized by the relationship between Gi3 and the kinocilium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild-type cells, the kinocilia were always centered within the Gi3 domains (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some Daple/ cells, the kinocilia lay near the corners of the Gi3 domains, correlating with S-shaped bundles (Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other cells, the kinocilia more closely aligned with the Gi3 domain but were shifted toward the centers of the apical surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gi3 spread to encompass the kinocilia, and the cells exhibited C-shaped bundles (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a third subset of cells, the kinocilia adopted approximately normal positions and the hair bundles resembled those of wild-type animals (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a final subset of hair cells, Gi3 was entirely uncoupled from the kinocilia (Fig 2G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each of these cells, the kinocilium localized near the neural edge, whereas Gi3 formed an abneural crescent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the stereocilia formed misshapen but cohesive bundles that bordered Gi3 (Fig 2 CF) in most hair cells, the stereocilia of these cells grew in a disperse pattern, extending from the border of the Gi3 domain toward the kinocilium and encircling it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hair bundles may correspond to the fragmented bundles visualized by scanning electron microscopy (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result provides evidence that coupling of the kinocilium and Gi is crucial to maintain the coherent structure of the hair bundle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Postnatal_Daple__Hair_Cells_Exhibit_Planar-Polarity_Defects  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We quantified cell-intrinsic defects by immunolabeling the kinocilia (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the kinocilia of heterozygous littermates, which occurred near the abneural edges of hair bundles, the kinocilia of Daple/ hair cells were distributed across the apical surfaces (Fig 3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because disruption of the core PCP pathway affects the angular positions of the kinocilia but not their distances from the cellular boundaries, the randomized distribution of kinocilia in outer hair cells signaled a defect in cell-intrinsic polarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To quantify the defects associated with organ-wide polarity, we used the localization of Gi3 to denote the orientations of hair cells within the cochlear sensory epithelium (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For individual Daple+/ and Daple/ hair cells, we plotted the angles of the Gi3 domains with respect to the centers of the apical surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The domain of Gi3 was misoriented in both inner and outer hair cells (Fig 3 D and E), with more significant defects in the latter (P less_than 0.01 and P less_than 0.001, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the localization of Gi3 was still biased toward the abneural edges of Daple/ hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We further characterized the contributions of organ-wide and cell-intrinsic signals to the Daple/ phenotype by comparing orientation defects among the three rows of outer hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Looptail mutants lacking Vangl2, the third or outermost row of outer hair cells is the most affected, whereas the first row is the least disturbed (4, 19, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trend was apparent near the apices of Daple/ cochleae, where a greater number of hair cells were reversed in the third row of outer hair cells than in the other two rows (Fig 4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, near the bases of Daple/ cochleae, the third row exhibited milder orientation defects than did the other two rows (Fig 4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased severity of misorientation in the first row of outer hair cells, rather than the third row, occurs after exposure to the G protein inhibitor pertussis toxin (6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apices of Daple/ cochleae thus resembled those of core PCP mutants, whereas the bases suggested cell-intrinsic defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data therefore supported our observation of organ-wide and cell-intrinsic defects in Daple/ hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the kinocilia in Daple/ hair cells were no longer biased in the abneural direction, we wondered to what extent localization of the kinocilia remained correlated with G protein signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore compared the angle of the Gi3 domain and the corresponding angular position of the kinocilium with respect to each cells center.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the two angles were correlated in both Daple/ mice and heterozygous littermates, the correlation was imperfect in the absence of Daple (Fig 4 EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the domain of Gi3 expression was oriented toward the abneural edge of the hair cell, the kinocilium could be found in either half of that domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relationship changed when the domain of Gi3 shifted away from the abneural edge; when Gi3 was misoriented, the kinocilium then occurred preferentially in the neural half of the Gi3 domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Daple__Kinociliary_Defects_Precede_Gi3_Mislocalization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explain this trend, we investigated the developmental progression of the relationship between Gi3 and the kinocilium (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hair cell maturation proceeds in a gradient from the cochlear base toward the apex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although in both Daple+/ and Daple/ cochleae at embryonic day (E) 17.5, nearly all kinocilia were located near the centers of hair cells at the apex, we found very few central kinocilia at the base (Fig 5 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial off-center shift of the kinocilia toward the cellular boundaries therefore occurred in the absence of Daple.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because kinocilia lay near the centers of postnatal Daple/ hair cells (Fig 3C), the second shift of the kinocilium evidently occurred as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both movements exhibited directional errors: In 47 of 141 hair cells in the middle turn of an E17.5 Daple/ cochlea, the kinocilia were displaced in the neural direction, whereas only three of 134 kinocilia of a heterozygous littermate showed such a shift (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Near the bases of Daple/ cochleae, 66 of 119 kinocilia were displaced in the neural direction, whereas the kinocilia of heterozygous littermates were uniformly abneural (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early errors in the initial shift of the kinocilia were therefore augmented by relocalization defects as hair cells matured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast, the angular distributions of Gi3 were comparable in E17.5 Daple+/ and Daple/ cochleae near both the middle turn and the base (Fig 5 E and F; P  0.5 and P  0.1, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In immature hair cells near the middle cochlear turns, Gi3 domains were not yet precisely oriented in either Daple+/ or Daple/ mice (Fig 5E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In more mature hair cells near the cochlear bases, Gi3 was distributed abneurally in both genotypes (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daple/ Gi3 crescents were not yet misshapen as in postnatal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Near the middle turn of a Daple+/ cochlea, most kinocilia were aligned with the Gi3 domains or found closer to the abneural edges of the hair cells (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gi3 and the kinocilia more closely aligned near the base of the cochlea (7) (Fig 5H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of Daple, the kinocilia were frequently farther from the abneural edges of the hair cells than were the centers of the Gi3 domains (Fig 5G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was most severe at the base (Fig 5H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in postnatal mice, some kinocilia lay opposite the crescents of Gi3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data imply that although the kinocilium sometimes preceded the Gi3 domain at the abneural edge of a wild-type hair cell, the abneural distribution of Gi3 did not rely on similar positioning of the kinocilium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Daple_Interacts_with_Dishevelled_and_the_Cell-Intrinsic_Pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify potential partners of Daple in the core PCP or cell-intrinsic pathways, we conducted a second yeast two-hybrid screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the carboxyl-terminal half of Daple protein as bait, we isolated 66 candidates, including Gi3 and Gi2 (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the most frequently detected candidates were the three Dishevelled proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Daple extended more apically than Dishevelled2, the two proteins colocalized in cochlear hair cells (Fig 6 and Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated whether Daple is necessary for the localization of PCP proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core PCP components Vangl2 and Frizzled6 were distributed similarly in Daple+/ and Daple/ cochleae (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With zonula adherens 1 (ZO-1) as a label for cellular boundaries, we found that Dishevelled2 also occurred normally near the cochlear apices of Daple/ mice (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Near the bases of Daple/ cochleae, however, Dishevelled2 was absent from the abneural edges of hair cells (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that Daple maintained the localization of Dishevelled as hair cells matured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using ZO-1 as a marker for tight junctions, we compared Daple and Gi3 in postnatal hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daple overlapped with and extended below the junction, whereas Gi3 was found above the junction at the apical membrane (Fig 8 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daple and Gi3 therefore occupied distinct but adjacent subcellular compartments, but their subcellular domains coincided in orientation during embryonic development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As early as E16.5, Daple and Gi3 were visibly enriched at the apical surfaces of immature hair cells near the apex of the cochlea (Fig 8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the proteins were enriched in similar regions of each cell; in a subset of cells, both proteins occurred at the neural cellular boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their localizations were refined in more mature hair cells near the base of the cochlea, adopting an abneural distribution (Fig 8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Daple clearly colocalized with Pard3 in both apical and basal hair cells, confirming that Daple associates with junctional cell-intrinsic signals (Fig 8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like Gi3, Pard3 and Daple colocalized near the neural boundaries of some immature hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our yeast two-hybrid assay with Daple revealed two isoforms of Pard3, the immunohistochemical colocalization of Daple and Pard3 likely reflected an authentic biochemical interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because Daple and other cell-intrinsic polarity signals exhibited similar subcellular asymmetry in each region of the cochlea, we asked whether Daple exhibits cell-intrinsic polarity in solitary hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electroporation of Atoh1-IRES-EGFP plasmids into cochlear explants produced hair cells in the greater epithelial ridge of the cochlea, a region normally devoid of hair cells (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these ectopic hair cells were not aligned consistently along any axis, the subcellular localizations of Daple and Gi3 remained closely correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a subset of ectopic hair cells, neither protein was asymmetrically distributed (Fig 9A): Daple associated with junctions at the circumference of the cells, whereas Gi3 expanded across the entire apical surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cells, however, both Daple and Gi3 were asymmetrically distributed with the same orientation (Fig 9B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daple therefore associated with cell-intrinsic markers in the absence of organ-wide directional cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because the maintenance of Dishevelled in hair cells required Daple, we wondered whether Dishevelled might also exhibit cell-intrinsic polarity in ectopic hair cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore coelectroporated Atoh1 and Dvl2-EGFP plasmids into cochlear explants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dvl2-EGFP was enriched asymmetrically and colocalized with Daple in ectopic hair cells (Fig 9C), suggesting that Daple provides a link between G protein signals and Dishevelled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because cell-intrinsic signals appeared sufficient to specify the asymmetry of Daple and Dishevelled, we inquired whether G protein signals are necessary for the normal localization of Daple at hair cell junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed immunohistochemistry in LGN/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of LGN, Gi and Insc were depleted from the apical surface (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Daple was significantly reduced at abneural junctions and occurred near the bases of kinocilia (Fig 9D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although anti-Daple sometimes labeled kinocilia in both wild-type and Daple/ tissues (Fig S3), the label did not accumulate near the bases of kinocilia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the pattern observed in LGN/ mice likely reflected a change in the distribution of Daple.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pertussis toxin inactivates G protein signaling in hair cells without disrupting core PCP signals (6, 7, 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the role of Gi directly, we therefore used a Foxg1-cre transgenic mouse (23) to express pertussis toxin (24) throughout the embryonic cochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gi3 was depleted but detectable at apical hair cell surfaces (Fig 9E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the absence of LGN, Daple occurred asymmetrically but was diminished at intercellular junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of pertussis toxin inverted the orientations of the first two rows of outer hair cells so that the tall edges of their hair bundles faced neurally (6, 7) (Fig 9E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daple localization was also inverted in those cells, confirming that Daple is regulated primarily by G protein signals rather than by core PCP proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We propose that the Dishevelled-binding protein Daple shapes the cell-intrinsic blueprint of a developing hair cell by coordinating the position of the kinocilium with the crescent of Gi expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results imply that during embryonic development, LGN and Gi promote the enrichment of Daple at the abneural junction of each hair cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gi is enriched independent of Daple in a crescent at the abneural surface of each hair cell; this initial pattern is then modulated by the kinocilium or its appendages as the hair cell matures (Fig 10A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To our knowledge, Daple/ animals are the first mutants to be described in which kinocilia are mislocalized across hair cell surfaces despite the presence of apical G proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When kinocilia are mispositioned in the absence of Daple, G protein signals are evidently reoriented and expanded toward the kinocilium as a hair cell matures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hair cells therefore develop organ-wide and cell-intrinsic polarity defects (Fig 10B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis explains the tendency in a postnatal Daple/ hair cell for the kinocilium to occur in the neural half of the Gi3 domain; the postnatal orientation of the Gi3 domain represents a compromise between its embryonic abneural distribution and the angular position of the kinocilium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also consistent with this hypothesis, some postnatal Daple/ hair cells exhibit an abneural crescent of Gi3 but a neural kinocilium (Fig 10C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells likely result from defects in the initial shift of the kinocilium; mislocation in the neural direction precludes the kinocilium from modulating abneural Gi localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting that our yeast two-hybrid screen identified RGS14, a regulator of G protein signaling previously characterized as a centrosomal protein (25, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Daple is also crucial for patterning the hair bundle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have suggested that the cell-intrinsic blueprint proteins determine hair-bundle shape (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We accordingly observe that the edge of the developing hair bundle abuts the domain of Gi3 in both wild-type cells and most Daple-deficient cells (Fig 10 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of Daple, the staircase pattern of stereocilia is distorted but preserved when the kinocilium occurs near the Gi domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when Gi and the kinocilium occur on opposite sides of a hair cell, the hair bundle becomes highly fragmented (Fig 10C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stunted stereocilia often encircle the kinocilium, suggesting that the kinocilium can also promote stereociliary elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the observation that normal positioning of the kinocilium in a Daple/ mutant rescues bundle shape, these results indicate that Gi3 and the kinocilium cooperate to shape the hair bundle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because Gi occurs abneurally in embryonic Daple/ hair cells, the loss of Daple does not uniformly affect all manifestations of organ-wide orientation but disrupts the association between the crescent of G protein signals and the kinocilium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither Daple nor the Gi crescent appears to be necessary for the initial movement of the kinocilium away from the center of a hair cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even those kinocilia opposite the crescent of Gi reach the cellular boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional pathway might regulate the migration of the kinocilium, with Daple aligning this system with the apical crescent of Gi and LGN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daple might activate Gi directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the two proteins do not colocalize in postnatal hair cells, they might interact at earlier stages of hair cell development or at the boundaries of their subcellular distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During asymmetrical divisions of mammalian cells, nuclear mitotic-apparatus protein (NuMA) binds the microtubule motor Dynactin to couple the mitotic spindle to cortical Gi and LGN (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our yeast two-hybrid assay, Daple interacted with Dynactin and other microtubule-associated proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daple might therefore couple microtubules with Gi, Pard3, or even Dishevelled, which can also regulate mitotic-spindle orientation (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The absence of Daple affected outer hair cells more severely than inner hair cells, suggesting that different mechanisms contribute to PCP and intrinsic polarization in different cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Daple also influences the translational and rotational polarity of the cilia in ependymal cells (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Daple is evidently necessary in that context for the accumulation of Frizzled, we find that Frizzled6 expression is unaffected by the absence of Daple in the cochlea; instead, Daple is necessary to maintain the localization of Dishevelled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although Dishevelled mutants display core PCP defects, the localization of a Dvl2-EGFP fusion construct in BAC transgenic mice differs from that of other core PCP proteins (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas in Vangl-2 Looptail mutants, Frizzled3 fails to localize, Dvl2-EGFP is diminished but still asymmetrically distributed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that Dvl2-EGFP localizes with cell-intrinsic signals in ectopic hair cells (Fig 9C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results imply that Daple provides a conduit through which cell-intrinsic polarity signals affect the distribution of a core PCP factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Daple interacts both with apical Gi proteins and with junctional Dishevelled, it is well positioned to link these two systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Experiments were conducted in accordance with the policies of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of The Rockefeller University and The Jackson Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of the coding sequence for Mus musculus Gi3 in a yeast two-hybrid screen identified Daple as a potential interaction partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry was used to demonstrate the location of the Daple protein in cochlear specimens from wild-type and Daple/ [Ccdc88ctm1b(KOMP)Mbp] mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details are provided in Supporting Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
