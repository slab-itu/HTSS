CK1/ protein kinase primes the PER2 circadian phosphoswitch  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our innate circadian clocks control myriad aspects of behavior and physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of our clocks by shift work, jet lag, or inherited mutation leads to metabolic dysregulation and contributes to diseases, including diabetes and cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A central step in clock control is phosphorylation of the PERIOD 2 (PER2) protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we conclusively identify the elusive PER2 priming kinase and find it to be the well-known circadian kinase, casein kinase 1 (CK1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, different forms of CK1 have differing abilities to phosphorylate the PER2 priming site, adding to the complexity of circadian regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These insights into the phosphoregulation of PER2 will be of broad interest to circadian biologists, computational modelers, and those seeking to pharmacologically manipulate the circadian clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Multisite phosphorylation of the PERIOD 2 (PER2) protein is the key step that determines the period of the mammalian circadian clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies concluded that an unidentified kinase is required to prime PER2 for subsequent phosphorylation by casein kinase 1 (CK1), an essential clock component that is conserved from algae to humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These subsequent phosphorylations stabilize PER2, delay its degradation, and lengthen the period of the circadian clock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we perform a comprehensive biochemical and biophysical analysis of mouse PER2 (mPER2) priming phosphorylation and demonstrate, surprisingly, that CK1/ is indeed the priming kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that both CK1 and a recently characterized CK12 splice variant more efficiently prime mPER2 for downstream phosphorylation in cells than the well-studied splice variant CK11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CK1 phosphorylation of PER2 was previously shown to be robust to changes in the cellular environment, our phosphoswitch mathematical model of circadian rhythms shows that the CK1 carboxyl-terminal tail can allow the period of the clock to be sensitive to cellular signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies implicate the extreme carboxyl terminus of CK1 as a key regulator of circadian timing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Processive_Phosphorylation_of_the_mPER2_FASP_Region_Is_Dependent_on_S659_Phosphorylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Phosphorylation of the FASP serine cluster of mPER2 by CK1/ following a pSxxS consensus motif is thought to occur processively, but only after phosphorylation of an upstream priming site (S659 on mPER2) by an unidentified kinase, as illustrated in Fig 1A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the priming kinase and assess the activity of CK1/ on primed peptides, we synthesized a peptide of the mPER2 FASP region containing three potential phosphorylation sites, complete with its native upstream sequence and an amino-terminal basic tag to facilitate peptide kinase assays (Fig 1A and SI Appendix, Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted, kinase reactions with limiting concentrations of CK1 C [a constitutively active form of recombinant CK1 lacking its carboxyl-terminal autoregulatory domain (26)] led to efficient phosphorylation of a primed FASP peptide that was synthetically phosphorylated on S659 (pS659).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we noted that the unprimed wild-type peptide (FASP-WT) was also a potential substrate for CK1 C, albeit with 50-fold lower efficiency (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since CK1/ is found stably associated with PER1 and PER2 complexes in vivo (2, 27, 28), we reasoned that increasing the kinase concentration would better mimic the in vivo setting where kinase and substrate are found in a stoichiometric complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the concentration of CK1 C by only 10-fold led to phosphorylation of the unprimed FASP-WT peptide, but not the S659A mutant (Fig 1C), suggesting that CK1 C may be capable of acting as the priming kinase when its local concentration is increased relative to the mPER2 substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that phosphorylation of the S662A mutant occurred at a rate similar to FASP-WT (Fig 1C), suggesting that phosphorylation of the priming site at S659 by CK1 C is the rate-limiting step in regulation of the FASP region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As an independent quantitative approach to study phosphorylation of the mPER2 FASP peptide by CK1, we developed an NMR-based kinase assay that utilizes uniformly 15N-labeled FASP to monitor site-specific detection of phosphorylated residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of CK1 C led to kinase-dependent perturbations of FASP peptide chemical shifts that only occurred in the presence of ATP, consistent with phosphorylation (Fig 1D and SI Appendix, Fig S1 BE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By quantifying peak intensities over time after quenching the kinase assay with EDTA, we observed a progressive loss of intensity for unphosphorylated serines 659, 662, 665 and surrounding peaks, followed by a concomitant increase in intensity for new downfield peaks that correspond to phosphorylated serines (Fig 1E), as seen in other NMR-based kinase assays (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CK1 C specifically targets S659 and downstream serines for phosphorylation, because a representative serine upstream of the priming site did not exhibit chemical shifts indicative of phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed similar results for kinase assays monitored in real time by NMR (SI Appendix, Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peaks for phosphorylated S659 and S662 arise at essentially indistinguishable rates, consistent with earlier observations that phosphorylation of the priming site appears to be rate limiting, while phosphorylation of the consensus site downstream at S662 occurs nearly instantaneously after the priming site (SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphorylation of S665 was noticeably slower, perhaps due to its location near the carboxyl terminus of our minimal FASP peptide (Fig 1E and SI Appendix, Fig S1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test the role of priming phosphorylation on S659 for CK1 C activity on downstream sites, we examined activity of the kinase on the 15N FASP S659A mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of the priming site, we found no detectable phosphorylation anywhere on the FASP peptide (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides clear evidence that CK1 C requires S659 for priming phosphorylation of the mPER2 FASP region in vitro to elicit phosphorylation of downstream consensus sites at S662 and S665.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used our NMR assay to examine the processivity of phosphorylation at these downstream consensus sites by CK1 C. If phosphorylation of the priming site at S659 establishes the pSxxS CK1 consensus motif, then loss of the second site with the S662A mutant should allow us to identify whether phosphorylation proceeds in a processive manner down the FASP peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although phosphorylation of the priming site in the S662A mutant occurred with a similar rate to FASP-WT, phosphorylation of the downstream site at S665 was abolished (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that the kinase phosphorylates S659 independently of S662 and uses a processive mechanism to phosphorylate target downstream serines in the mPER2 FASP region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether phosphorylation of S662 of mPER2 requires priming phosphorylation in full-length protein in cellular system, as an independent approach, we used a newly generated affinity-purified pS662-mPER2 antibody (Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 1H, mutation of the priming site (S659) abrogated phosphorylation of S662, confirming the processive nature of FASP phosphorylation in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CK1_Protein_Is_Sufficient_to_Phosphorylate_S659_of_mPER2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To facilitate identification of the mPER2 priming kinase, we generated affinity-purified phosphoepitope-specific antibodies recognizing pS659 of mPER2 (Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pS659-PER2 antibody was highly selective for immobilized pS659-FASP peptide, recognizing the peptide even at a dilution of 1:32,000 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pS659-PER2 antibody also recognized pS659, but not S659A, in full-length and truncated mPER2 in immunoblots (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirming the phosphorylation dependency of the antibody, treatment of lysates with alkaline phosphatase specifically decreased binding of the pS659-PER2 antibody (SI Appendix, Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As noted by Fustin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (31), CK1 has two splice variants, CK11 and CK12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the in vitro peptide kinase ELISA, we confirmed that CK11 can phosphorylate the FASP-WT peptide at S659 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we tested whether CK11 could phosphorylate the FASP priming site of mPER2 in full-length protein (Fig 2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myc-tagged mPER2 expressed in HEK293 cells was immunoprecipitated and then incubated with recombinant full-length CK11 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Priming-site phosphorylation was assessed by SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As noted in Fig 2D, mPER2 in cells is phosphorylated on S659 to some extent by endogenous kinases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, addition of increasing amounts of recombinant CK11 protein was sufficient to increase the phosphorylation of S659 in full-length mPER2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CK1__Is_the_Priming_Kinase_in_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having established that CK11 could phosphorylate the priming site in the peptide and in the immunopurified protein, we asked whether CK11 could phosphorylate the mPER2 priming site in intact cells (Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mPER2 was expressed alone or with increasing amounts of ectopic CK11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of added CK11, mPER2 was phosphorylated on S659, and the amount of phosphorylation increased markedly with coexpression of CK11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, mPER2 with a S659A mutation (Fig 2E, last lane) was not recognized by the pS659 antibody and displayed a mobility shift in the presence of ectopic CK11, consistent with phosphorylation at the -TrCP phosphodegron and other sites (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The preceding assays demonstrate that CK11 is sufficient to phosphorylate the mPER2 priming site on peptides in vitro and in cells in the context of the full-length protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether CK1 and/or CK1 kinase is necessary for priming phosphorylation in cells, we performed knockdown and inhibitor assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of total CK1 only partially inhibited the priming-site phosphorylation (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of CK1, a kinase generally present in much lower abundance than CK1 isoforms, also gave rise to a marked decrease in priming-site phosphorylation, and knockdown of both CK1 and CK1 together eliminated priming phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirming that CK1 can phosphorylate the priming site, purified CK1 protein could phosphorylate the FASP peptide in vitro (Fig 3B), and overexpression of CK1 drove phosphorylation of the S659 site in cells (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, as an independent test, we found that the dual CK1/ inhibitor PF670462 (7) and, to a lesser extent, the pan-CK1 inhibitor D4476 also markedly reduced mPER2 priming phosphorylation (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that CK1 and CK1 are both necessary and sufficient to phosphorylate the mPER2 FASP priming and downstream sites in vitro and in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Role_of_the_CK1__Carboxyl_Terminus_in_Priming-Site_Phosphorylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fustin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (31) suggested that CK11 and CK12 have differing activities in phosphorylation of the priming site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CK12 differs from CK11 only in the last 16 amino acids due to inclusion of a penultimate exon in CK12 that alters the reading frame (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, CK12 more closely resembles CK1 at the extreme carboxyl terminus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assessed the relative priming activity of the three kinases in cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CK12 and CK1 are more active than CK11 in phosphorylating the priming site, as illustrated in the immunoblot in Fig 4B and as presented quantitatively in Fig 4C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, Fustin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (31) found that overexpression of CK12, more active on the FASP site, lengthens the circadian period in cells, whereas specific knockdown of CK11 shortens period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a previously unappreciated role for the extreme carboxyl terminus of CK1 in influencing the activity of the kinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirming this, truncation of CK11 at amino acid 400, removing the last 16 residues, increased the activity of the kinase on the priming site to that of CK12 and CK1 (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the activity of CK1/ as a priming kinase is tightly regulated by the extreme carboxyl terminus of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Revising_the_Phosphoswitch_Mathematical_Model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We previously proposed a phosphoswitch model in which the PER2 protein switches between two fates (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the -TrCP site is phosphorylated by CK1/, PER2 is rapidly degraded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on previous experimental data (32), we also proposed a priming kinase that phosphorylates the FASP site, stabilizes PER2, and allows for sequential phosphorylation of PER2 downstream from the FASP site by CK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the identification of CK1 as the priming kinase, we asked whether the phosphoswitch model was still predictive and accurate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We modified our previous phosphoswitch model by incorporating the finding that CK1/1/2 functions as the priming kinase (see SI Appendix, Materials and Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This revised model continues to accurately simulate the unusual kinetics of PER2 degradation where, during phases when PER2 accumulates in the cell, its degradation curve contains a plateau (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the model successfully reproduces the negligible period change of CK1/ mutant mice (33), the longer period of CK1/ mutant mice (18, 33), and the shorter period of FASP humans and mice (11, 13) (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CK1 phosphorylation of PER2 is temperature compensated in vitro by balancing the higher dissociation constant and higher phosphorylation rate at higher temperatures, which is proposed as a temperature compensation mechanism of circadian period (4, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this finding, when the dissociation constant of CK1 and phosphorylation rates for both the priming site and the -TrCP site of PER2 increase together, the period is nearly constant in the model (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Regulation of PER2 abundance controls circadian timing, yet understanding the phosphorylation of the key control point has been elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show by multiple approaches that CK1/ can function as the PER2 priming kinase, resolving a long-standing question in circadian biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, we find that CK11 and CK1 differ markedly in their ability to phosphorylate the priming site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CK12, which has residues at the extreme carboxyl terminus that more closely resemble CK1, displays increased priming kinase activity like CK1, suggesting that control of splicing can also regulate priming and, hence, clock timing (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies highlight the role of the CK1/ carboxyl terminus (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior studies demonstrated that while CK1 does not require its carboxyl terminus to bind to PER proteins, inclusion of the tail can significantly enhance the interaction (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because CK1/ is also regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus, this also suggests a mechanism for cellular signaling pathways to regulate PER2 priming rates (26, 3640).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, changes in phosphorylation of the CK1/ carboxyl terminus by cell cycle-dependent kinases has recently been shown to alter CK1 activity on PER2 (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other signaling pathways that impinge on CK1/ carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation, such as metabotropic glutamate and Wnt signaling, could further influence priming and, hence, alter the clock period (42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CK1/ has the additional feature of being temperature compensatedthat is, the activity of the kinase on selected substrates is relatively constant as temperature increases (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A molecular mechanism for this has recently been proposed, involving key residues adjacent to the substrate recognition motif (6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since CK1 phosphorylation of PER2 is temperature compensated in vitro and CK1 is involved in both priming and degradation, how does the time required for PER2 degradation lengthen at higher temperatures, a property we showed is essential for the temperature compensation of circadian period (5)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The answer may lie in a better understanding of how the carboxyl terminus of the CK1/ family members regulates temperature compensation on different substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regulation of a fraction of the CK1/1/2 kinase pool (in which each member has a different tail sequence and, thus, priming phosphorylation rate), may provide a mechanism for temperature-compensated regulation of circadian period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, CK1 may have different Q10 on the priming and -TrCP sites in PER2 so that temperature compensation of the circadian clock utilizes the differential phosphorylation of the priming and -TrCP sites to regulate the phosphoswitch controlling mPER2 stability (5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the data from Ueda and coworkers (4), who reported different Q10 for different forms of recombinant CK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is unfortunately challenging to study temperature compensation in vitro because of the rapid inactivating autophosphorylation of full-length CK1/ in the presence of ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in vivo, the net phosphorylation of the carboxyl terminus of CK1/ is highly dynamic, balancing active autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by other kinases with active dephosphorylation by multiple phosphatases (36, 37, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the phosphoswitch model, when the phosphorylation rate for the priming site is increased, which we now show strongly depends on the CK1 carboxyl terminus (Fig 4 B and C), the period changes dramatically (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, when the phosphorylation rates for both the priming site and the -TrCP site increase equally, the period is nearly constant (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that the CK1 phosphorylation of PER2 follows a robust yet fragile paradigm that is emerging in systems biology, where cellular systems are robustly resistant to environmental changes yet can still react to specific signaling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The differential activity of CK1 and CK1 on priming phosphorylation must also be viewed in the context of their relative protein abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockout studies have demonstrated that CK1 plays a major role in regulation of the circadian clock in vivo (17, 33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative mass spectrometry studies have recently found that CK1 protein was over 20-fold more abundant than CK1 in liver and that CK1 is more readily detectable in PER-containing macromolecular circadian complexes (16, 27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that CK1 is significantly more active than CK11 as a priming kinase, which may explain why the tau mutation of CK1 has a semidominant phenotype (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the data here and from Fustin et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (31) indicate that dynamic posttranscriptional splicing and posttranslational phosphorylation of CK1 and CK1 can regulate priming and, hence, PER2 activity, providing important flexibility to regulate clock speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
