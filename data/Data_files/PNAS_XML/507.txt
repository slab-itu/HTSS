Tet proteins influence the balance between neuroectodermal and mesodermal fate choice by inhibiting Wnt signaling  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Methylation of cytosine bases in DNA is an epigenetic modification that influences gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TET (ten-eleven translocation)-family dioxygenases catalyze conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and additional oxidized methylcytosines in DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that both Tet3- and Tet1/2/3-deficient mouse ES cells showed impaired neural conversion, with skewing toward cardiac mesoderm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide analyses showed that Tet3 mediates cell-fate decisions by inhibiting Wnt signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these findings, Wnt signaling was hyperactivated in Tet1/2/3-deficient embryos, leading to aberrant differentiation of bipotent neuromesodermal progenitors into mesoderm at the expense of neuroectoderm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate a key role for TET proteins in modulating Wnt signaling and establishing the proper balance between neural and mesoderm cell fate determination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
TET-family dioxygenases catalyze conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and oxidized methylcytosines in DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), either lacking Tet3 alone or with triple deficiency of Tet1/2/3, displayed impaired adoption of neural cell fate and concomitantly skewed toward cardiac mesodermal fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, ectopic expression of Tet3 enhanced neural differentiation and limited cardiac mesoderm specification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome-wide analyses showed that Tet3 mediates cell-fate decisions by inhibiting Wnt signaling, partly through promoter demethylation and transcriptional activation of the Wnt inhibitor secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (Sfrp4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tet1/2/3-deficient embryos (embryonic day 8.08.5) showed hyperactivated Wnt signaling, as well as aberrant differentiation of bipotent neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) into mesoderm at the expense of neuroectoderm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate a key role for TET proteins in modulating Wnt signaling and establishing the proper balance between neural and mesodermal cell fate determination in mouse embryos and ESCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Tet3_Regulates_the_Balance_Between_Neuroectoderm_and_Cardiac_Mesoderm_Differentiation_in_mESCs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the role of Tet3 during neuroectoderm differentiation, we used an efficient system for in vitro neural differentiation of mESCs: serum-free floating cultures of embryoid-body like aggregates, referred to as SFEB (29, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In SFEB cultures, mESCs undergo neuroectoderm differentiation by default, without the induction of mesodermal and endodermal differentiation (29, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our previous observation during retinoic acid-induced mESC differentiation (32), the expression levels of Tet13 displayed distinct patterns upon neural differentiation: Tet1 mRNA declined rapidly; Tet2 mRNA was initially maintained at a relatively steady level, then decreased on day 4, but recovered on day 6; and Tet3 mRNA showed a progressive increase, with  greater than 40-fold up-regulation on day 6 of SFEB culture compared with the starting mESCs (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in Tet3 transcripts was markedly reduced when the cultures were supplemented with inhibitory signals such as Bmp4 or FBS, both known to counteract neuroectoderm differentiation (28) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar pattern of Tet13 expression was observed in whole embryos during embryogenesis in vivo (Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq analysis of early embryos at E6.75 and E7.5 further corroborated the quantitative PCR (qPCR) results, showing that Tet1 and Tet2 expression decreased, whereas Tet3 expression increased, upon development in vivo (Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis of early embryos at E9.25 showed substantial Tet3 expression in the brain and optic vesicle (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These expression patterns of Tet3 in vitro and in vivo suggested that Tet3 might have a role in neuroectoderm differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine whether Tet3 is required for neuroectoderm differentiation in mESCs, we established a Tet3-deficient mESC line by Cre-mediated excision of exon 2 (Fig S1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mRNA levels of Tet1 and Tet2 were not altered, whereas Tet3 mRNA was almost undetectable, in Tet3 KO (Tet3/) mESCs (Fig S1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When WT and Tet3 KO mESCs were differentiated into embryoid bodies under serum-free conditions [SFEB (31)], neural marker genes Sox1 and Foxg1 showed a significant decrease at day 6, and the decrease was further enhanced at day 10 (Fig 1D); moreover, mRNA expression levels of the cardiac precursor marker gene Nkx25 and the mature cardiomyocyte marker genes Myh6 and Myh7 (encoding cardiac myosin heavy chains) and Tnnt2 (encoding cardiac troponin T2; cTnT) increased dramatically in Tet3 KO mESCs (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skewed gene expression pattern of Tet3 KO cells was further corroborated at the protein level by immunostaining: A large portion of Tet3 KO cells were cTnT+ under conditions where the majority of WT mESCs had undergone neural differentiation, as judged by Sox1 expression (Fig 1F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, in the absence of Tet3, the default tendency of mESCs to differentiate toward neuroectoderm was skewed toward cardiac mesoderm differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Conversely, we carried out gain-of-function experiments by stably overexpressing Tet3 in mESCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the effects of Tet3 overexpression on mESC differentiation, we used culture medium containing FBS, which promotes differentiation toward mesoderm rather than neuroectoderm (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ectopic expression of Tet3 induced substantial expression of the ectoderm marker gene Fgf5 (Fig 1G) and repressed expression of the cardiac lineage marker genes Nkx25, Myh6, Myh7, and Tnnt2 (Fig 1H), consistent with our observations of increased cardiac skewing in Tet3 KO mESCs under serum-free (SFEB) culture conditions (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect required the catalytic activity of Tet3, because expression of a catalytically inactive (HxD) mutant of Tet3, containing the amino acid substitutions H950D and Y952A (5) (Fig S1E), did not alter Fgf5 or cardiac mesoderm marker gene expression (Fig 1 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Tet3 functions as a key determinant of the selective differentiation of mESCs toward the neuroectoderm vs. the cardiac mesoderm cell fate, in a manner dependent on Tet3 catalytic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tet3-Dependent_Transcriptional_Programs_During_mESC_Differentiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the effects of Tet3 gain and loss on global gene-expression profiles during mESC differentiation, we performed whole-transcriptome RNA-seq analysis of (i) WT and Tet3 KO mESCs differentiating into neuroectoderm under SFEB culture conditions (days 6 and 10); and (ii) control and Tet3-expressing mESCs in nonpermissive neural differentiation conditions containing FBS (days 4 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We defined 940 Tet3-activated genes that showed twofold or greater increase in expression in Tet3-expressing cells on day 4 or 7 and also twofold or greater decrease in expression in Tet3 KO cells on day 6 or 10; similarly, we defined 1,355 Tet3-repressed genes that showed twofold or greater decrease in expression in Tet3-expressing cells on day 4 or 7, and also a twofold or greater increase in expression in Tet3 KO cells on day 6 or 10 (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of Tet3-activated genes revealed a strong enrichment in functional categories relevant to neural developmental processes, including neuronal differentiation and brain development (Fig 2A); conversely, Tet3-repressed genes were significantly implicated in mesoderm differentiation, including the skeletal system, vasculature, and heart development (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on GO terms, we identified 46 Tet3-activated neural genes and 127 Tet3-repressed mesoderm genes (Fig S2A and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether Tet3 directs neural differentiation by affecting extrinsic signaling pathways, we performed Ingenuity pathway analysis on genes differentially expressed in WT or Tet3 KO mESCs on days 6 and 10 of SFEB culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all time points analyzed, differentially expressed genes were highly enriched in components of Wnt/-catenin pathways (Fig S2 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the global distribution of Tet3 DNA occupancy, we performed ChIP coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in neural precursor cells (NPCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose to use NPCs for the ChIP-seq experiments because these cells display high expression of endogenous Tet3 (Fig 1A) and constitute the endpoint of mESC differentiation under SFEB conditions (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 6,121 Tet3-bound regions (ChIP-seq peaks) in NPCs (Dataset S2), most of which were enriched in gene bodies and their immediate vicinity: By comparison with the mm9 reference genome, Tet3-binding sites were enriched in promoters and exons and to some extent also in 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs), whereas peaks mapping to distal intergenic regions were substantially underrepresented (Fig 2C and Fig S2 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tet3-binding sites clustered close to transcription start sites (TSSs), with a low frequency of binding at distal regions relative to the TSSs (Fig 2D), consistent with a previous report in which Tet3 binding regions were defined by pulldown with a GST fusion of the Tet3 CXXC domain (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA motif analysis identified a CpG-rich sequence as the highest-ranked motif among Tet3-binding sites (Fig 2E), also consistent with the previous report (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Validating the results of our RNA-seq data, GO analysis of Tet3 target genes (based on the presence of a Tet3 ChIP-seq peak within 10 kb of the TSS) showed enrichment for genes related to mesoderm development and neural differentiation (Fig 2F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ingenuity pathway analysis showed that Tet3 target genes were also strongly enriched for components of the Wnt signaling pathway (Fig 2G), with the Notch signaling pathway being the second most highly enriched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tet3_Regulates_mESC_Differentiation_via_Modulation_of_the_Wnt_Signaling_Pathway  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further investigate the relation between Tet3 and the Wnt signaling pathway, we assessed the effects of Tet3 on -catenin/TCF-mediated transcription using the TOP-Flash luciferase reporter, which contains a minimal promoter adjacent to seven tandem TCF-binding sites; the FOP-Flash luciferase reporter, which contains mutated TCF binding sites, was used as a negative control (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activity of the -catenin/TCF reporter decreased to 20% of control levels in Tet3-expressing cells (Fig 3A), whereas it increased by almost twofold in Tet3 KO cells relative to WT cells (Fig 3B); again, expression of the catalytically inactive form of Tet3 (Tet3 HxD mutant) had no effect on reporter activity (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that Tet3 normally inhibits the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway and that the skewed differentiation observed in Tet3 KO mESCs could be due to defective repression of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway in the absence of Tet3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test this hypothesis, we used a well-known negative regulator of Wnt signalingDkk1, a secreted protein that acts extracellularly to inhibit Wnt-receptor interactions (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of Dkk1 to SFEB cultures reversed the skewed differentiation of Tet3 KO mESCs away from neuroectoderm and toward cardiac mesoderm, as indicated by restored expression of the neural marker genes Sox1 and Foxg1 (Fig 3C), and inhibited up-regulation of the cardiac mesoderm marker genes Nkx2-5, Myh6, Myh7, and Tnnt2 (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-transcriptome RNA-seq analysis revealed that the expression of 30 of 46 Tet3-related neural genes was restored, and the expression of 110 of 127 Tet3-related mesoderm genes was repressed, in Tet3 KO mESCs of SFEB culture in the presence of Dkk1 (Fig S3 and Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these functional data combined with our genome-wide transcriptional and ChIP-seq data suggest that Tet3 regulates mESC differentiation by repressing Wnt signaling to regulate neuroectoderm vs. cardiac mesoderm cell fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Tet3_Influences_the_Expression_and_DNA_Modification_Status_of_the_Wnt_Inhibitor_Sfrp4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Combining our RNA- and ChIP-seq data, we identified 19 Tet3 target genes related to the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway (Dataset S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, the gene encoding Sfrp4 drew our attention: Sfrp4 possesses a domain similar to one in the Wnt receptor Frizzled protein and therefore can act as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling by preventing Wnt receptor binding: Epigenetic inactivation of the Sfrp4 gene results in constitutive Wnt/-catenin signaling (35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ChIP-seq assays, Tet3 directly bound the promoter region of Sfrp4 in NPCs (Fig 4A); moreover, Sfrp4 mRNA expression was dramatically down-regulated in Tet3 KO mESCs on day 6 of SFEB culture relative to WT control cells (Fig 4B), whereas ectopic Tet3 expression induced substantial expression of Sfrp4, an effect that depended on the catalytic activity of Tet3 based on the fact that catalytically inactive (HxD mutant) Tet3 had no effect (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, stable expression of Sfrp4 in differentiating mESCs mimicked the effect of ectopic Tet3 expression: In luciferase assays using the -catenin/TCF reporter, Wnt activity was inhibited (Fig 4D), and there was substantial induction of the ectoderm marker gene Fgf5 (Fig 4E) and repression of the cardiac lineage marker genes Nkx2-5, Myh6, Myh7, and Tnnt2 (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is known that Sfrp4 expression is highly correlated to the methylation status of its promoter region (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the relation of Sfrp4 expression to Tet3 function and changes in DNA methylation, we performed bisulfite-sequencing (BS-seq) to examine whether the down-regulation of Sfrp4 transcripts in differentiating Tet3 KO cells correlated with alterations of DNA cytosine modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because BS-seq cannot distinguish 5mC and 5hmC (37), cytosines not deaminated by bisulfite treatment are designated 5mC+5hmC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Tet3 KO mESCs on day 6 of SFEB culture, the percentage of 5mC+5hmC in the promoter region of Sfrp4 increased compared with WT control cells across all of the CpGs analyzed (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data suggest that Tet3 directly binds to and alters the DNA modification status of the Sfrp4 locus and regulates Sfrp4 transcription; in turn, Sfrp4 expression results in decreased Wnt signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to Sfrp4, our ChIP-seq data also showed that Tet3 directly bound each promoter region of a gene cluster encoding the protocadherin-alpha cluster (Pcdha) in NPCs (Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Pcdha cluster contains 14 variable exons, each regulated by its own promoter, followed by three constant exons, and is highly expressed in neurons (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for Pcdha8 and Pcdhac2, expression of all genes in the Pcdha cluster was dramatically down-regulated in Tet3 KO mESCs on day 6 of SFEB culture relative to WT control cells (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcription of specific Pcdha isoforms has been shown to correlate significantly with the methylation status of the promoter and 5 region of the first exon (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Tet3 KO mESCs on day 6 of SFEB culture, the percentage of 5mC+5hmC in the promoter regions of Pcdha4, Pcdha9, Pcdha12, and Pcdhac1 increased compared with WT control cells across the majority of CpGs analyzed (Fig S4 CF), whereas the methylation status of the promoter regions of Pcdha8 and Pcdhac2the two isoforms whose mRNA expression was unalteredremained unchanged (Fig S4 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been reported that the Pcdh superfamily functions to inhibit Wnt signaling (4042).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our hands, transient expression of Pcdha4 and Pcdha7 during mESC differentiation inhibited Wnt signaling activity only moderately, based on a -catenin/TCF reporter assay (less than twofold; Fig S4I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Tet3 regulates the expression levels and the DNA modification status of the promoter regions of Sfrp4 and certain genes of the Pcdha cluster, and at least part of the ability of Tet3 to diminish Wnt signaling may be mediated through increased Tet3-mediated expression of Sfrp4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the lack of an embryonic phenotype in Sfrp4-deficient mice (43), additional factors likely contribute to the increased Wnt signaling activity in Tet3 KO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Phenotype_of_Tet3-Deficient_mESCs_Is_Exacerbated_by_Concurrent_Deficiency_of_Tet1_and_Tet2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The data from Tet3 KO mESCs prompted us to look for developmental abnormalities in Tet3-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported for 129Sv-background Tet3 KO mice (16), the C57BL/6-background Tet3-deficient pups generated in our laboratory survived until birth, but all pups showed perinatal lethality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase-contrast images of E18.5 embryos and hearts from WT and Tet3 KO mice showed no obvious developmental abnormalities of cardiac or other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, qPCR and immunostaining analysis of the whole hearts from WT and Tet3 KO embryos (E18.5) showed an increase of the cardiac progenitor marker Isl-1, a target gene of Wnt/-catenin signaling (44) in the Tet3 KO heart, especially in the right ventricle (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, deficiency of Tet3 alone does not severely block embryonic development in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We hypothesized that the lack of overt cardiac and neuronal phenotypes in Tet3-deficient mice was most likely due to functional redundancy from the other two Tet family members, Tet1 and Tet2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this potential redundancy between Tet proteins, we generated Tet1/2/3 fl/fl mice from mice bearing the individual floxed alleles (14, 18) and used them to generate Tet1/2/3 fl/fl mESCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were then transiently transfected with a Cre expression plasmid to establish a Tet1/2/3 triple-deficient mESC line (Tet1/2/3 TKO mESCs) in which Tet1, Tet2, and Tet3 mRNAs were completely undetectable (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proliferation of these Tet1/2/3 TKO mESCs was significantly slower compared with the WT controls (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a previous report (45), neuroectoderm and cardiac mesoderm markers were all decreased during differentiation of Tet1/2/3 TKO mESCs in serum-containing cultures compared with the WT controls (Fig S6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We used medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) knockout serum replacement (KSR) medium to compare WT, Tet3 KO, and Tet1/2/3 TKO mESC differentiation in serum-free conditions; this culture condition was chosen because it supported Tet1/2/3 TKO mESC survival and differentiation better than the conditions used for Fig 1D (N2B27 media; SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 7 of SFEB culture in 10% (vol/vol) KSR, Tet3 KO mESC showed a milder decrease of the neuroectodermal markers Sox1 and Foxg1 relative to WT cells than in N2B27 medium (compare Fig S6E with Fig1D); they also showed a significant increase of the mesoderm marker T (Brachyury) and a mild increase of the cardiac precursor marker Nkx25, but no change in the expression of the mature cardiomyocyte markers Myh7 and Tnnt2 (Fig S6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, compared with Tet3 KO cells, Tet1/2/3 TKO cells showed a more significant decrease of the neuroectoderm marker genes Sox1 and Foxg1 (compare Fig 5A with Fig S6E) and a more dramatic increase of the cardiac precursor marker Nkx2-5 and the mature cardiomyocyte markers Myh7 and Tnnt2 (compare Fig 5B with Fig S6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in 10% (vol/vol) KSR serum-free conditions, cell differentiation was skewed only toward early mesoderm in Tet3 KO mESCs; however, it could go further toward the cardiac mesoderm stage in Tet1/2/3 TKO ESCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The previously mentioned Tet3 target gene, Sfrp4, which encodes a Wnt inhibitor, was also decreased in Tet1/2/3 TKO mESCs after differentiation under SFEB conditions (Fig S6 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that the expression level of another Pcdh superfamily member, Pcdh8, was decreased significantly in Tet1/2/3 TKO mESCs after differentiation under SFEB conditions (Fig S6I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of a previous report showing that Pcdh8 can inhibit Wnt signaling activity (42), it is possible that down-regulation of both Sfrp4 and Pcdh8 contribute to increasing Wnt signaling in Tet1/2/3 TKO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

TET_Proteins_Control_the_Balanced_Differentiation_of_Neuromesodermal_Progenitors_During_Early_Embryogenesis_in_Vivo  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine phenotypes of embryos lacking all three TET proteins, we generated Tet1/2/3 triple-deficient progeny by crossing Zp3- and Stra8-Cre mice with Tet1/2/3 fl/fl mice to generate mice in which expression of all three Tet proteins was abrogated in oocytes and sperm respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The progeny of Tet1/2/3 fl/fl Zp3-Cre female and Tet1/2/3 fl/fl Stra8-Cre male (hereafter termed Tet1/2/3 TKO or TKO mice/embryos) lack all three TET proteins beginning at the zygotic stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos at early streak stages (E6.75), most decidua (31 of 42) were empty, and no degenerating embryos were observed, which may be due to the defects in oocytes in the absence of Tet proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, surviving embryos (11 of 42) were morphologically indistinguishable from controls (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-embryo RNA-seq of control and Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos (E6.75; four embryos from each group) showed efficient deletion of the targeted floxed exons (flanked by LoxP sites) of each Tet gene (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GO analysis of the 69 genes whose expression levels were most significantly altered in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos relative to controls (Fig S7C and Dataset S3) revealed that up-regulated genes were implicated in mesoderm formation, including skeletal system development and limb morphogenesis (Fig S7D): Cardiac progenitor marker genes (Gata4 and Fgf10) and genes related to embryonic limb and skeletal development (Six1, Six4, Alx1, Alx3, Bin1, Hoxd13, and Crabp2) were all significantly increased in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos compared with control embryos (Fig 5C and Fig S7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the neural initiator Neuronatin (Nnat), which acts as an intrinsic factor to promote neural fate in mammals and Xenopus (46), was decreased in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, triple TET deficiency promotes expression of mesoderm-related genes during early embryogenesis in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At mid-/late-streak stages (E7.257.5), we observed a developmental delay in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos: When the control embryos were at late-streak stage, the Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos appeared to be at the midstreak stage (Fig S8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos at E7.5 were morphologically indistinguishable from control embryos at E7.25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunostaining results showed that in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos at E7.5, the neural marker Sox2 was expressed in neuroectoderm (Fig S8 B, Lower), the T-box transcription factor T (Brachyury) was expressed in the PS (Fig S8 C, Lower), whereas Sox2+T+ NMPs, which give rise to both neuroectoderm and mesoderm, were detected in the PS close to the node (Fig S8 D, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These staining patterns were similar to those in WT control embryos at E7.25 (Fig S8 BD, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At head-fold stages (E8.08.25), clear morphological differences between WT and Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos were observed (Fig 5 DK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the nature of these patterning defects, we analyzed expression of characteristic lineage markers by immunocytochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT embryos, the primordial neural gene Sox1 was maintained throughout the ANP, which later differentiates into the brain, and the PNP; in contrast, in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos, Sox1 expression was significantly reduced (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in these figure panels, we observed nonspecific staining of the yolk sac [indicated by ys(NS)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In WT embryos, strong expression of Sox2 was observed in ANP and PNP (Fig 5E, Upper), whereas T (Brachyury) was expressed in the PS, ventral node (no), and notochord (NC) (Fig 5F, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sox2 and T were coexpressed in the NSB, where the dual-fated NMPs are located.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMPs have the capacity to develop into body midline tissuesPNP, somites (so), and NC (Fig 5G, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos, Sox2 expression was only observed in ANP, and was completely absent in posterior regions of the embryos (Fig 5E, Lower), whereas T (Brachyury) was readily detected in PS (Fig 5F, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, colocalization of Sox2 and T was not detected in the NSB region in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos (Fig 5G, Lower).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Activation of Wnt signaling can prevent NMPs from adopting a neural cell fate, because high Wnt3a levels in PS down-regulate Sox2 expression (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether Wnt activity was altered in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos, we analyzed expression of the active, dephosphorylated form of -catenin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunostaining results showed that, in comparison with WT control embryos, there were strong signals for the active form of -catenin in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos overlapping the T (Brachyury)-positive PS region at both midstreak (E7.257.5) and head-fold (E8.08.25) stages (Fig 5H and Fig S8E, arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In WT embryos, NMPs give rise to both neuroectoderm and paraxial mesoderm, as indicated by immunostaining for the neural marker Sox2 and the paraxial mesoderm marker Tbx6 (Fig 5 E and I, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos, in addition to loss of Sox2 expression, expression of Tbx6 was significantly reduced (Fig 5 I, Lower), suggesting an inability of NMPs to develop into paraxial mesoderm in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we examined expression of lateral mesodermal markers Isl1 and Gata4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anterior lateral mesoderm can give rise to cardiac mesoderm and further form the heart (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that both Isl1 and Gata4 were ectopically coexpressed in the caudal region of Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos, in addition to their normal expression in the heart region (Fig 5 J and K, Lower, arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in WT control embryos at this stage, Isl1 and Gata4 were coexpressed only in the cardiogenic region (Fig 5 J and K, Upper).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos of ectopic expression of cardiac mesodermal markers in the absence of neural plate is consistent with prior studies, which demonstrated that factors within neural plate signal to adjacent paraxial mesoderm to prevent its adopting a cardiac mesodermal fate (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos, the absence of PNP would lead to a lack of repressive signals from neural plate, and therefore mutant NMPs, unable to form neuroectoderm, would adopt cardiac mesodermal rather than paraxial mesodermal cell fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
At slightly later stages (E8.258.5), a striking feature of Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos was the complete absence of neural plate, somite, and NC (Fig 6 AH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos, neural markers Sox1 and Sox2 were expressed in the ANP, but the territory of expression was reduced to varying extents (Fig 6 A and B, Lower); T (Brachyury) was expressed in the PS at the caudal end of the embryo, where Wnt signaling was hyperactivated, as indicated by ectopic expression of active -catenin (Fig 6 C and E, Lower, arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos, the paraxial mesoderm marker Tbx6 was again reduced in anterior PS (Fig 6F, Lower), and the lateral mesoderm markers Gata4 and Isl1 continued to be ectopically expressed in the anterior PS region (Fig 6 G and H, Lower, arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Gata4 and Isl1 can also mark endodermal tissues in the cardiogenic region, we examined expression of the endodermal marker Foxa2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, cells ectopically expressing Gata4 and Isl1 were negative for the endoderm marker Foxa2 (Fig S8F, Lower, arrow), affirming their mesodermal identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observations demonstrated that the fate of NMPs residing in the PS was skewed toward lateral mesoderm instead of neuroectoderm and paraxial mesoderm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Together, these results indicated that, in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos, anterior patterning was severely disrupted, with deficiencies in head development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In posterior development, NMPs located in the NSB/CLE, which are normally committed to develop into both neural plate and paraxial mesoderm all along the anteriorposterior (AP) body axis, were skewed to a lateral mesodermal cell fate, likely owing to overactivation of Wnt signaling (model in Fig 6I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These in vivo observations are completely consistent with the aberrant differentiation of Tet3 KO and Tet1/2/3 TKO ESCs in serum-free conditions in vitro, in which we observed a decrease of neuroectodermal markers and an increase of cardiac mesodermal markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Tet3 KO and Tet1/2/3 TKO mouse ESCs were generated from mice (C57BL/6 background) bearing the individual floxed alleles (Fig S1C) (14, 18), followed by excision of the floxed exon by transient expression of Cre recombinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

mESC_Culture_and_Differentiation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
mESCs were maintained on mitomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs; feeders) in standard medium (61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neural differentiation in SFEB culture was performed as described (31) with a minor modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, mESCs were dissociated to single cells in 0.25% trypsinEDTA (Invitrogen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissociated ESCs (1 × 105 cells per mL) were seeded onto a nonadhesive bacterial-grade dish and cultured in Knockout DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) KSR, 2 mM glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 2, the medium was changed to N2B27 medium (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medium was changed every other day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The day on which ESCs were seeded to differentiate is defined as differentiation day 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Tet1/2/3 TKO mESCs did not differentiate well under SFEB culture in N2B27 medium, they were differentiated by using the SFEB method in 10% (vol/vol) KSR medium continuously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For nonpermissive neural differentiation, dissociated ESCs (1 × 105 cells per mL) were seeded onto an ultralow attachment culture dish (Corning) and cultured in Knockout DMEM supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, and 0.1 mM 2-ME for 4 or 7 d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Here, we show that Tet proteins, especially Tet3, are key transcriptional regulators that maintain the balance between neuroectodermal and mesodermal cell fate determination by repressing Wnt signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Tet3- and Tet1/2/3-deficient mESCs showed impaired neural conversion, with skewing toward cardiac mesoderm in serum free conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, ectopic Tet3 expression enhanced neuroectoderm differentiation and limited cardiac mesoderm specification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impaired neuroectodermal differentiation and increased cardiac mesodermal specification of Tet3-deficient mESCs was rescued by addition of the extracellular Wnt inhibitor Dkk1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate a key role for Tet3 in establishing the correct balance between neural and mesodermal cell fate through modulation of Wnt signaling in mESCs and emphasize a clear functional redundancy between TET-family enzymes in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although Tet3 KO embryos developed until birth and showed no overt cardiac and neuronal phenotypes other than an increase in Isl-1 expression in the right ventricle, Tet1/2/3-deficient embryos showed major defects in neural development, manifesting a complete absence of midline structures, including the posterior neural tube, somites, and NC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differences in single Tet3 vs. triple Tet KOs is most likely due to functional redundancy from the other two Tet family members, Tet1 and Tet2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT embryos, NMPs residing in the NSB and CLE contribute to both neural tube and paraxial mesoderm all along the AP body axis (2427) (Fig 6 I, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Timing and duration of Wnt activity are important parameters for the induction and maintenance of NMPs, which maintain self-renewal and bipotency at moderate levels of Wnt signaling: Cells exposed to a low-Wnt environment become neural, whereas cells exposed to high levels of Wnt transition to a mesodermal fate (47, 50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies of Tet1/2/3-deficient embryos and Tet3-deficient mESCs indicated that Wnt signaling was abnormally activated in the absence of TET proteins, particularly Tet3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overactivation of Wnt signaling in NMPs residing in the PS region led to their differentiation into lateral mesoderm at the expense of neuroectoderm and paraxial mesoderm fate, resulting in abrogated development of body midline structures (Fig 6 I, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A precedent for this phenotype occurring downstream of hyperactivated Wnt signaling is provided by a transgenic mouse line in which ectopic Wnt3a is driven by a Cdx2 enhancer in the posterior epiblast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Cdx2PWnt3a embryos, neuroectodermal specification is adversely affected, as evidenced by strong down-regulation of Sox2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, activation of Wnt3a does not result in overproduction of paraxial mesoderm, but, rather, resulted in ectopic lateral mesoderm expressing Wnt2 and Tbx4 (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have demonstrated that specification of lateral mesoderm at the expense of paraxial mesoderm occurs in the absence of signaling from the neural tube, offering an explanation as to why lateral mesodermal fate, rather than paraxial mesodermal fate, is observed with loss of neural specification (49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tet1/2/3-deficient embryos also displayed defects in development of ANP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, formation of anterior neural structures requires suppression of Wnt signals, because mouse embryos deficient for the Wnt antagonist Dkk1 are headless (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, defects in ANP development were not fully penetrant and therefore could be secondary: Recent studies point to a role of node derivatives such as the NC and somites in maintaining and stabilizing anterior neural specification (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Hnf3b/Foxa2 conditional mutants, which lack paraxial mesoderm, specification of the ANP occurs, but is labile (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Besides their functionally redundant roles in the generation of oxi-mC, TET-family members also display distinct roles, in part because they are expressed in different cellular locations or at different developmental stages (18, 32), and regulate oxi-mC levels at different genomic locations (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is some overlap, Tet1 primarily regulates 5hmC levels at gene promoters and TSSs, whereas Tet2 mainly regulates 5hmC levels in gene bodies (55).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Tet3 ChIP-seq data in NPCs show that Tet3-binding sites also cluster close to TSSs, with a low frequency of binding at distal regions relative to the TSS, suggesting that Tet1 and Tet3 may have similar functions, despite their distinct temporal expression patterns during mESC differentiation (Fig1A) (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain further insights into the redundant and specific functions of TET proteins during embryogenesis, we will need to develop new techniques that enable genome-wide profiling of distinct cellular lineages, ideally at a single-cell level, in TET-deficient embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A recent publication (57) showed that Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos display patterning defects in association with impaired specification of paraxial mesoderm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors suggested that hyperactive Nodal signaling contributed to the patterning defects in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data extend their findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that overactivation of Wnt signaling in NMPs leads to their differentiation into lateral mesoderm at the expense of neuroectoderm and paraxial mesoderm fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show a strong correlation between the expression levels of Wnt3 and Nodal in both control and Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos at the gastrulation stage: Expression of both Wnt3 and Nodal RNAs decreased sharply from E7.25 to E7.5 in WT control embryos, but was high in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos at day 7.5 (Fig S8G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Wnt3 was shown to activate Nodal expression directly through its proximal epiblast enhancer at the gastrulation stage (58, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xu and colleagues (57) observed that Wnt3 is strongly expressed in posterior of PS in Tet1/2/3 TKO embryos at E7.5, where we also found strong signals for the active form of -catenin (Fig S8E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is likely that Wnt and Nodal signaling pathways are both involved in Tet1/2/3-regulated embryonic patterning processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
