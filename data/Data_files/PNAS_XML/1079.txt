Saa3 is a key mediator of the protumorigenic properties of cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic tumors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most malignant human tumors for which there are no efficacious therapeutic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tumor type is characterized by an abundant desmoplastic stroma that promotes tumor progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet recent studies have shown that physical or genetic elimination of the stroma leads to more aggressive tumor development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we decided to reprogram the stromal tissue by identifying and subsequently targeting genes responsible for their protumorigenic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed several genes overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts compared with those present in normal pancreata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide genetic evidence that one of these genes, Saa3, plays a key role on the protumorigenic properties of the stroma, opening the door to the design of future therapeutic strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by the presence of abundant desmoplastic stroma primarily composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is generally accepted that CAFs stimulate tumor progression and might be implicated in drug resistance and immunosuppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have compared the transcriptional profile of PDGFR+ CAFs isolated from genetically engineered mouse PDAC tumors with that of normal pancreatic fibroblasts to identify genes potentially implicated in their protumorigenic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report that the most differentially expressed gene, Saa3, a member of the serum amyloid A (SAA) apolipoprotein family, is a key mediator of the protumorigenic activity of PDGFR+ CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas Saa3-competent CAFs stimulate the growth of tumor cells in an orthotopic model, Saa3-null CAFs inhibit tumor growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saa3 also plays a role in the cross talk between CAFs and tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ablation of Saa3 in pancreatic tumor cells makes them insensitive to the inhibitory effect of Saa3-null CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, germline ablation of Saa3 does not prevent PDAC development in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protumorigenic activity of Saa3 in CAFs is mediated by Mpp6, a member of the palmitoylated membrane protein subfamily of the peripheral membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we interrogated whether these observations could be translated to a human scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, SAA1, the ortholog of murine Saa3, is overexpressed in human CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, high levels of SAA1 in the stromal component correlate with worse survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings support the concept that selective inhibition of SAA1 in CAFs may provide potential therapeutic benefit to PDAC patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
PDGFR+_CAFs_Promote_Tumor_Growth  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the populations of CAFs present in PDAC, we used a GEM tumor model previously generated by M. Barbacid's laboratory, the K-Ras+/LSLG12Vgeo;Trp53lox/lox;Elas-tTA/tetO-Cre compound strain, in which we can selectively induce the expression of a resident K-RasG12V oncogene and disable the p53 tumor suppressor in acinar cells during late embryonic development (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we added a Rosa26LSLEYFP allele to have a color marker (EYFP) to identify those cells carrying the K-RasG12V/p53-null tumor-initiating mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice, designated as KPeCY, develop PDAC tumors with complete penetrance and an average latency of 34 mo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, they recapitulate the human disease, including the formation of a massive stromal desmoplasia made up of heterogeneous CAF populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this stromal remodeling is characterized by a chronic inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we studied the functional implications of tumor-promoting inflammation mediated by CAFs by performing a comparative expression profiling of PDGFR+ CAFs and PDGFR+ normal pancreatic fibroblasts (NPFs) as previously described (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immunofluorescence analysis of stromal tissue with antibodies elicited against -smooth muscle actin (SMA) and PDGFR revealed that, whereas most stromal cells of KPeCY tumors expressed SMA, only a subpopulation contained PDGFR (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FACS analysis of fresh tumors showed at least four distinct populations of stromal cells (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas one population only expressed SMA (39% of the total), another population representing 36% of the cells contained both markers, SMA and PDGFR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified two additional populations represented by those cells that expressed only PDGFR (9%) and those that did not express either marker or expressed them at very low levels (16%) (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we sorted PDGFR+/EYFP/CD45/CD31 stromal cells from PDAC tumors of KPeCY mice as well as from normal pancreata of control Elas-tTA/tetO-Cre;Rosa26+/LSLEYFP animals (Fig 1C and Fig S1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells represented 21% and 15% of the total cells, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultures derived from cell population retained SMA and PDGFR expression and displayed the spindle shape characteristic of fibroblasts (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fibroblastic nature of these cells was further verified by the expression of fibroblast-specific genes including FAP, Vimentin, and PDGFR as well as by the lack of immune (CD45, CD68) and tumor (CK19, EpCAM) cell markers (Fig 1C and Fig S1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the PDGFR+ stromal cells isolated from KPeCY tumors represent CAFs, whereas those obtained from normal pancreata represent NPFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter had slightly higher levels of SMA than CAFs, a property that has been proposed to represent a marker of myofibroblast activation (Fig S1C) (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, these PDGFR+ cell populations are designated simply as CAFs and NPFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether these CAFs can promote tumorigenesis, we compared their tumor-supporting capabilities with those of NPFs using in vivo assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EYFP+-sorted PDAC tumor cells (0.5 × 106) isolated from tumor-bearing KPeCY mice were s.c. inoculated alone (n = 4) or in combination with CAFs (0.5 × 106) (n = 4) or NPFs (0.5× 106) (n = 4) into the flanks of immunocompromised mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas CAFs stimulated tumor growth by as much as 76%, NPFs inhibited the proliferation of the pancreatic tumor cells by as much as 65% (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results illustrate the protumorigenic activity of the subpopulation of CAFs used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Comparative_Transcriptional_Profiles_of_CAFs_vs_NPFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To understand the genetic bases responsible for the tumor-promoting activity of CAFs, we performed a comparative study of the transcriptome profiles of freshly isolated CAFs (n = 5) with those of NPFs (n = 3) by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 2A, CAFs displayed a strong proinflammatory profile that included genes encoding competent cascade-related and acute-phase proteins (C4b, Hp, and A2m), cytokines (Il1b and Il6), chemokines (Cxcl1 and Ccl22), other interleukins (Il10), and members of the TNF family associated with the innate immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) confirmed the up-regulation of the immune cell-recruiting complement cascade [false-discovery rate (FDR)  0001], IL1R (FDR = 0.001), and the Jak-Stat (FDR = 0.025) pathways in CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis also identified cytokine/receptor signaling as one of the most significantly up-regulated pathways in CAFs compared with NPFs (Fig 2B and Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observed a high enrichment in cell-to-cell junction pathways suggesting the presence of active contact-mediated signaling in CAFs (Fig 2B and Fig S2A), a property that may have an important role in tumor promotion (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAFs also displayed up-regulation of TGF- and Hedgehog-signaling pathways as well as ECM/receptor interactions (Fig S2A), a set of transcriptional changes thought to result from their cross talk with the tumor cells (13, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Down-regulated hallmarks include oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting that CAFs have undergone metabolic reprogramming and oxidative stress (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter was further supported by the significant down-regulation of genes involved in peptide elongation, translation, and protein metabolism, hallmarks of stress responses indicating mitochondrial dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed significant reduction of P53-signalingrelated genes, suggesting cell death evasion (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results, taken together, support the concept that the CAFs used in this study possess a unique secretory-inflammatory gene signature with emphasis on the activation of the innate immune response (Fig 2) as well as impaired oxidative phosphorylation (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SAA3_Is_Overexpressed_in_CAFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The top up-regulated gene in CAFs compared with NPFs was a gene encoding the SAA3 protein, Saa3 (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were confirmed by qRT-PCR (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saa3 transcripts were also up-regulated compared with tumor cells as well as with other normal tissues such as pancreas or liver (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known regarding the putative role of Saa3 in cancer, although Hansen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (26) have suggested protumorigenic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During inflammation, Saa3 expression is induced by Il-1, Tnf, and Il-6 through NFB signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, Saa3 can also activate these cytokines (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, Il-1, Tnf, and Il-6, as well as the NFB pathway, were found to be significantly up-regulated in our dataset (Fig 2A and Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

PDAC_Development_in_Saa3-KO_Mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To interrogate the effect of ablating Saa3 expression in PDAC development, we incorporated Saa3-null alleles to the KPeCY strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously reported, germline ablation of Saa3 does not induce detectable phenotypic alterations (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Saa3-null K-Ras+/LSLG12Vgeo;Elas-tTA/tetO-Cre mice displayed the same number of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions and PDAC tumors as Saa3-competent animals (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, KPeCY mice carrying either wild-type Saa3 alleles (n = 18) or Saa3-null alleles (n = 20) developed PDAC with 100% penetrance, succumbing to pancreatic tumors before 23 wk of age with median survivals of 15 and 16 wk, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations, taken together, indicate that the absence of Saa3 expression from their germline has no significant effect on tumor development (Fig S3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
However, Saa3-null tumors had a higher proportion of EYFP+ tumor cells and displayed less dense fibrotic stroma, albeit these differences were not statistically relevant by FACS analysis (Fig S3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histological analysis revealed that Saa3-null tumor cells were more packed than in control tumors and exhibit a significant reorganization of their ECM as revealed by their reduced levels of collagen content (Fig 3A and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we did not observe a significant reduction in the PDGFR+ population, indicating that the reduced stromal content is not due to the loss of this CAF subpopulation (Fig S3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the levels of macrophage infiltration in the Saa3-null tumors (12.5% vs. 3.8% of total area) (Fig 3B and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in tumor-infiltrating macrophages was observed in both the antitumorigenic M1 and the protumorigenic M2 populations (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this increase appeared to be more pronounced in the M2 population, which has been associated with worse clinical outcome in PDAC patients (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there were no obvious differences in the amount or localization of neutrophils or T and B lymphocytes (Table 1 and Fig S3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saa3-null tumors also displayed a significantly elevated number of endothelial CD31+ cells, indicating increased vessel density (Fig 3B and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These vessels were functional as assessed by the greater perfusion observed upon injection of a contrast agent (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether increased angiogenesis was promoted by the infiltrating macrophages, as previously suggested (30), remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we interrogated whether the effect of Saa3 ablation on stroma remodeling improved the therapeutic benefit of current drug treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig S3F, Saa3-null mice exhibit a slight survival advantage when treated with either gemcitabine alone (50 mg/kg, i.p., twice weekly) or with gemcitabine in combination with clodronate, a macrophage-depleting agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained when we combined gemcitabine with B20.4.1.1, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the differences were not statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Saa3-Null_Tumor_Cells_Have_Increased_Migratory_but_Not_Homing_Properties  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tumors lacking Saa3 appeared less differentiated upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and CK19 staining (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The undifferentiated tumor phenotype has been associated with a cancer stem-like state in pancreatic cancer (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we assessed the cancer stem cell (CSC) compartment in Saa3-competent and Saa3-null tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 4B, we found a marked increase in CSC (CD133+) and metastatic CSC (CD133+/CXCR4+) populations in Saa3-competent PDAC tumors vs. those lacking Saa3 expression (0.56% vs. 4.02% CD133+ cells and 0.15% vs. 0.43% in CD133+/CXCR4+ cells, respectively) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the absence of Saa3 confers a more invasive phenotype (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Saa3-null tumors showed a higher Ki67 proliferation index (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, EYFP+ tumor cells present in the pancreas of 8-wk-old Saa3-null mice displayed a considerably higher percentage of PDGFR+ cells than those expressing Saa3 (2.43% vs. 0.21%, respectively) (Fig 4D and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since PDGFR expression is a marker for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), these results suggest that the absence of Saa3 expression might promote the appearance of a migratory phenotype (3335).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since PDAC tumor cells most frequently metastasize to the liver, we examined the presence of Saa3-competent and Saa3-null EYFP+ pancreatic tumor cells in this tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 4E and Fig S4A, we detected an unusually high number of disseminated tumor cells in the liver of KPeCY Saa3-null animals, representing as many as 15.3% of all liver cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the number of tumor cells in Saa3-competent animals represented only 0.07% of the liver cell population (Fig 4E, Table 1, and Fig S4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these disseminated Saa3-null tumor cells did not proliferate and failed to propagate after colonization (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, whereas 12 of 63 Saa3-competent mice (19%) displayed metastatic outgrowths, only 2 of 40 Saa3-null animals (5%) presented with metastatic lesions in their livers (P = 0.043) (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reduced levels of metastatic outgrowth were not due to a reduction in the inflammatory cell population, CD11b+ and F4/80+ monocyte-derived immune cells, which are known to establish the metastatic niche (Fig S4C) (36, 37), and thus suggest that the reduced metastatic potential of Saa3-null tumors is an intrinsic property of the tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, these infiltrated Saa3-null tumor cells were negative for Ki67 immunostaining, indicating that they have limited proliferative properties (Fig S4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is also possible that absence of Saa3 expression in the liver may contribute to the limited proliferative and metastatic properties of these tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been reported that Saa1 is a potent inducer of liver metastasis (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, SAA1 is among the top 50 up-regulated genes in the metastatic liver expression profile in a human PDAC dataset analyzed by Moffitt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7), suggesting that SAA1 may be relevant in liver metastasis formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we examined the levels of expression of other Saa family members in livers of Saa3-competent and Saa3-null tumor-bearing mice killed at the humane end point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig S4D, the levels of expression of Saa1 and Saa2 are high in the livers of Saa3-competent, but not in Saa3-null, tumor-bearing mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results may also contribute to explaining why the abundant pancreatic tumor cells present in the livers of Saa3-null mice have limited metastatic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To better characterize the effect of Saa3 ablation on the migratory properties of PDAC tumor cells, we generated cell lines from pancreatic tumors lacking this protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FACS analysis confirmed that the number of CD133+/CD44+ CSCs was higher in Saa3-null EYFP+ tumor cell lines (46.6 vs. 18.8%) (Fig 4F and Table 1), demonstrating a clear enrichment in this population (32, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migration assays revealed that tumor cells lacking Saa3 displayed increased migratory properties (Fig 4G and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Saa3-expressing tumor cells advanced toward the scratch as a solid layer, cells lacking Saa3 moved freely throughout the scratch as individual cells (Fig 4G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAFs lacking Saa3 expression also had increased motility and closed the gap more efficiently than those expressing the protein (61.5% in Saa3-null vs. 40.8% in wild-type CAFs in a 16 h period) (Table 1 and Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Saa3_Is_Required_for_the_Protumorigenic_Properties_of_CAFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To characterize the effect of Saa3 on the interaction between pancreatic tumor cells and CAFs, we examined the growth properties of organoids generated from PDAC tumors of KPeCY mice cocultured with CAFs expressing or lacking Saa3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 5A, Saa3-expressing CAFs significantly increased the number and size of individual organoids (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Saa3-null CAFs failed to promote tumor growth resulting in organoid cultures similar to those grown in the absence of CAFs (Fig 5A and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, NPFs effectively reduced the growth of organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly indicate that Saa3 plays a key role on the ability of CAFs to support tumor cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore the effect of Saa3 in the cross talk between tumor cells and CAFs in vivo, we orthotopically inoculated immunocompromised mice with CAFs as well as with tumor cells (0.5 × 106 each) either expressing or lacking Saa3 in (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 5C, ablation of Saa3 in tumor cells (n = 6) had no effect on their ability to induce tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, based on the results described above using in vitro assays, coinjection of Saa3-expressing tumor cells with NPFs (n = 6) reduced tumor growth whereas coinjection with Saa3-expressing CAFs (n = 8) led to a significant increase in tumor volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when these tumor cells were coinjected with CAFs lacking Saa3 (n = 8), tumor growth was significantly reduced to levels even lower than those observed with NPFs, indicating that Saa3 is essential for the ability of CAFs to stimulate tumor growth in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this effect was not observed when we coinjected Saa3-null tumor cells along with Saa3-null CAFs (n = 6) (Fig 5C and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences were observed in the proliferation (Ki67 and Phospho-HistoneH3) or apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) levels that could explain the differences in tumor volume induced by Saa3-competent vs. Saa3-null CAFs (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicate that, whereas Saa3 provides protumorigenic properties to CAFs, the antitumorigenic effect of Saa3-null CAFs requires that the corresponding tumor cells express the Saa3 protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, we also observed a protumorigenic effect when we coinjected Saa3-null tumor cells with Saa3-null CAFs, suggesting that when both cell types are deficient in Saa3 expression there is an alternative cross talk that promotes tumor progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide an explanation as to why tumor development in Saa3-null mice is not affected, since the potential tumor-inhibitory effect of Saa3 ablation in CAFs does not take place when their neighboring tumor cells also lack Saa3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Saa3_Ablation_Alters_the_Transcriptional_Profile_of_CAFs_and_Tumor_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To dissect the mechanism by which Saa3 confers tumor stimulatory properties to CAFs, we used RNAseq to compare the transcriptome of Saa3-null and Saa3-proficient CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSEA pathway analysis of Saa3-null CAFs revealed a significant enrichment in Proliferation and Angiogenesis hallmarks, as well as up-regulation of Sonic Hedgehog, TNF/NFB, and IL-6 pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we observed enrichment in genes implicated in EMT, suggesting increased plasticity of Saa3-null CAFs as well as their potential effect in inducing an undifferentiated phenotype in their neighboring tumor cells (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the Saa3-null CAFs displayed up-regulation of the apical junction pathway, a property that predicts increased physical contact between stromal and tumor cells (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most down-regulated gene sets included the oxidative phosphorylation and drug metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, loss of Saa3 expression also down-regulated other metabolic pathways such as Glycolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway is activated in Saa3-competent CAFs, possibly playing a role in providing metabolites to their neighboring tumor cells (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that loss of Saa3 might induce metabolic reprogramming of CAFs along with a reduction in the production of nutritional metabolites available to the adjacent tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also studied the transcriptomes of Saa3-competent and Saa3-null tumor cells (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed that loss of Saa3 expression in pancreatic tumor cells results in a significant enrichment of cell cycle- and metabolism-related gene sets, thus confirming the increased proliferative capacity of the Saa3-null tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these mutant tumor cells displayed up-regulation of the tight junction pathway, suggesting deregulated cell-to-cell contact properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, we observed significant down-regulation in ECM reorganization-related pathways, suggesting a decrease in the levels of extracellular collagen, a feature that might explain the higher migratory properties of Saa3-null tumor cells (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Saa3 is involved in the regulation of several inflammatory cytokines (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we examined the profile of cytokine enrichment changes by GSEA analysis utilizing a specific signature of 144 cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 6B, elimination of Saa3 down-regulated the global cytokine profile not only in CAFs but also in the tumor cell compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate that elimination of Saa3 induces proliferation, metabolic reprogramming, and cell-to-cell contact in both CAFs and tumor cell population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, lack of Saa3 reduces overall cytokine secretion with the exception of the TNF and IL-6 pathways in CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mpp6_Down-Regulation_Reverts_the_Antitumorigenic_Properties_of_Saa3-Null_CAFs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differential expression analysis of the above dataset revealed the presence of three significantly up-regulated genes in Saa3-null CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the gene encoding MPP6 (fold change = 15.8), a member of the palmitoylated membrane protein subfamily of peripheral membrane-associated MAGUK guanylate kinases (Fig 6 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other up-regulated genes included those encoding the -aminobutyric acid receptor 3 (GABRA3; fold change = 3.2) and Cbl, an E3 ubiquitinprotein ligase involved in cell signaling and protein ubiquitination (fold change = 2.3) (Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations were validated for Mpp6 using qRT-PCR analysis of Saa3-null and -competent CAFs (Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine whether Mpp6 up-regulation was functionally responsible for the antitumorigenic effect of Saa3-null CAFs, we knocked down Mpp6 expression using specific shRNAs that resulted in a significant decrease of its expression levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mpp6down-regulated Saa3-null CAFs were coinjected orthotopically with Saa3-competent PDAC tumor cells (n = 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tumor cells grew significantly faster than those coinjected with Saa3-null CAFs (n = 8), reaching proliferation levels similar to those observed with Saa3-competent CAFs (Fig 6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Down-regulation of Mpp6 also reverted the undifferentiated phenotype of tumor cells in the presence of Saa3-null CAFs (Fig 6F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations, taken together, indicate that the growth-inhibitory activity of Saa3-null CAFs on their adjacent tumor cells is mediated by the up-regulation of the tight junction protein Mpp6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Saa3 ablation did not alter the levels of expression of Mpp6 in pancreatic tumor cells (Fig 6D), indicating that Saa3 selectively controls the expression of Mpp6 in CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations open the door to future therapeutic strategies aimed at up-regulating Mpp6 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SAA1__the_Functional_Human_Ortholog_of_Saa3__Is_Up-Regulated_in_a_Subpopulation_of_Human_CAFs_Associated_with_Poor_Clinical_Outcome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The human genome contains three genes encoding highly related SAA family members (40% amino acid identity): SAA1, SAA2, and SAA4 (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also contains a nonfunctional SAA3 pseudogene (SAA3P) (41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the three SAA functional genes, SAA1 is the most similar in structure and function to murine Saa3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SAA1 protein is expressed in several stromal cell types including activated synovial fibroblasts (42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, SAA1 has been shown to control neutrophil plasticity and has anti- and protumorigenic inflammatory properties in melanoma (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SAA1 is highly expressed in a variety of tumors including PDAC [The Cancer Gene Atlas (TCGA) database].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, SAA1 is the SAA family member most highly expressed in CAFs of PDAC tumors (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm these observations, we examined the SAA1 expression levels in the PDAC RNAseq and microarray dataset recently published by Moffitt et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAseq data revealed high but variable expression of SAA1 both in tumors and in CAFs isolated from PDAC samples (Fig 7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moffitts report described two types of PDAC-associated stroma, normal and activated, based on stromal signatures considering high SMA expression or an inflammatory signature, respectively (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, SAA1 was found to be expressed primarily in tumor samples with an activated stroma signature, high levels of SAA1 expression correlated with significantly worse survival in tumor samples containing either normal or activated stroma (Fig 7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In those tumor samples that contained low amounts of stroma, high SAA1 expression correlated with a slight increase in survival, suggesting that the protumoral effect of SAA1 overexpression is primarily mediated by the stromal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, SAA1 was identified among the top 50 genes of Moffitts liver-specific metastatic signature in PDAC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of freshly isolated CAFs from tumor samples of PDAC patients (n = 7) and from adjacent normal pancreas (n = 5) revealed that SAA1 is up-regulated in the CAF samples compared with those obtained from normal pancreata (log2 fold change = 3.74; Padj less_than 0.005).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the levels of MPP6 expression were lower in CAFs than in normal pancreatic fibroblasts (Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the levels of both genes, SAA1 and MPP6, inversely correlated in both types of fibroblasts (Fig 7E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained with Moffitts dataset (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the concept that SAA1 may play a role in human PDAC similar to that described for Saa3 in GEM tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

PDAC is characterized by a rich desmoplastic stroma composed mainly of a heterogeneous population of CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A CAF subpopulation characterized by expressing PDGFR is thought to mediate an inflammatory response (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their putative protumorigenic activity has not been properly documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that PDGFR+ CAFs possess protumorigenic properties in vivo based on their ability to promote the growth of coinjected pancreatic tumor cells in immunocompromised mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This property is specific for PDGFR+ fibroblasts isolated from PDAC tumors, since the corresponding PDGFR+ fibroblasts isolated from normal pancreata inhibited tumor growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent studies have described distinct populations of CAFs (6, 8, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subpopulation designated as myCAFs is characterized by elevated expression of SMA and appears to localize immediately adjacent to the neoplastic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A distinct subpopulation, iCAFs, is located more distantly from the neoplastic cells and expresses low levels of SMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, these cells display higher levels of secreted IL-6 and other inflammatory mediators (44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CAFs isolated in our study, based on the expression of PDGFR, also have high levels of IL-6, suggesting that they may represent iCAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other similarities between these iCAFs and the PDGFR+ CAFs isolated here include significant up-regulation of cytokine/chemokine receptor-signaling pathways and JAK-STAT signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the PDGFR+ CAFs characterized in this study display significant overexpression of innate immune response-related signaling and high enrichment in cell-to-cell junction pathways, two properties not reported in iCAFs, thus, suggesting that the PDGFR+ CAFs described here might represent yet another subpopulation of inflammatory CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transcriptome analysis of the PDGFR+ CAFs studied here revealed a series of selectively up-regulated genes compared with those fibroblasts present in normal pancreata.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top-scoring gene was Saa3, a member of the gene family encoding Saa proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, SAA1 and SAA2 are secreted during the acute phase of inflammation and have been implicated in several chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, and amyloidosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another member of this gene family, SAA3, is not expressed in human cells but has been shown to be a major acute-phase reactant in other species such as rabbits and rodents (16, 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Murine Saa3 has been shown to be expressed in macrophages (46) and adipose tissue (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During inflammatory processes, Saa3 expression is effectively induced by Il-1, Tnf, and Il-6 through NFB signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these cytokines, as well as the NFB pathway, were found to be significantly up-regulated in our CAF dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a fourth member of this gene family, SAA4, appears to be expressed constitutively in the liver (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Germline elimination of Saa3 had no effect of PDAC development, as reflected by the similar number of lesions observed in Saa3-null mice and by the lack of benefit in survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Saa3-null tumors exhibit stroma remodeling, including reduced fibrosis and ECM, infiltrating macrophages, and increased vessel density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Saa3-null CAFs had an elevated angiogenesis signature as revealed by GSEA pathway analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that increased vessel density along with a reduction in fibrosis may improve the efficacy of chemotherapy treatments (23, 49, 50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not observe a significant increase in the therapeutic benefit of tumor-bearing Saa3-null mice treated with gemcitabine alone, with gemcitabine in combination with clodronate, or with an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Saa3-null tumors were also less differentiated and more invasive, as suggested by a higher proliferation index and increased numbers of pancreatic CD133+ CSCs (32, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Saa3-null tumor cells showed an enhanced migratory phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed an unexpected abundance of Saa3-null tumor cells in the liver, constituting as much as 15% of all liver cells, during the early stages of pancreatic tumor development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these migrating tumor cells did not elicit metastatic outgrowths, possibly due to their observed lack of proliferative capacity within the Saa3-null liver microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this migratory phenomenon is an intrinsic property of the Saa3-null tumor cells or is a consequence of the absence of this protein in liver tissue and/or in prometastatic macrophages remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed that the absence of Saa3 in liver tissue of tumor-bearing mice inhibits the expression of the Saa1 and Saa2 isoforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since SAA1 has been described as a potent inducer of liver metastasis (7, 26), the reduce levels of expression of Saa1/Saa2 in Saa3-null livers could explain why the abundant disseminated pancreatic tumor cells cannot form metastatic foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditional ablation of Saa3 expression in specific cell populations, including tumor cells, CAFs, macrophages, and possibly other immune cells, should help to better define the role of Saa3 during the various stages of tumor development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Saa3 is required for the protumorigenic properties of CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, orthotopic coinjection of Saa3-null CAFs with Saa3-competent tumor cells in the pancreas of nude mice significantly reduced tumor size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibitory effect of Saa3-null CAFs was even more pronounced than that induced by NPFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this inhibitory effect was not observed when we used Saa3-null tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since loss of Saa3 expression had no significant effect on the tumorigenic properties of pancreatic tumor cells, the observed lack of an antitumorigenic effect of Saa3-null CAFs on Saa3-null tumor cells must be due to defective cross talk between Saa3-null tumor cells and Saa3-null CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were also observed in vitro using tumor organoids, ruling out a putative role of a third cellular partner in this cross talk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reconstruction experiments recapitulate the results obtained with Saa3-null mice in which both CAFs and tumor cells are devoid of Saa3, thus explaining why PDAC development is unaffected in Saa3-null mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results underscore the critical role for Saa3 in mediating the interaction between CAFs and tumor cells and predict that selective elimination of Saa3 in CAFs might provide significant therapeutic benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies using conditional ablation of Saa3 should help better define the protumorigenic role of Saa3 in CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparative transcriptional profiling of tumor cells and CAFs expressing or lacking Saa3 revealed that Saa3-null cells display an increased proliferative signature and metabolic reprogramming and could suggest altered heterotypic cell-to-cell contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Saa3-deficient CAFs show reduced overall cytokine secretion, with the exception of the TNF and IL-6 pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was unexpected, since acute-phase SAA apolipoproteins have been reported to enhance the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, TNF, IL-8, and G-CSF (5153).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF induce the synthesis of these SAA proteins (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, up-regulation of TNF, NFB, and IL-6 pathways may result from an effort by the Saa3-null cells to induce the expression of Saa3, thereby generating an inflammatory loop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the reduction of glycolysis and the down-regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in Saa3-null CAFs, shown by GSEA pathway analysis, could contribute to their inhibitory activity on tumor cells observed in orthotopic coinjection experiments, by reducing nutrient transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparative analysis of Saa3-competent and Saa3-null CAFs revealed minor changes in their transcriptome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we identified three overexpressed genes in Saa3-deficient CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular interest was Mpp6, a member of the peripheral MAGUK family of proteins primarily involved in controlling epithelial cell polarity (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mpps also function in tumor suppression and receptor clustering by forming multiprotein complexes containing distinct sets of transmembrane, cytoskeletal, and cytoplasmic signaling proteins (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Mpp6 overexpression appears to be responsible for the loss of the protumorigenic effect of Saa3-null CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, knockdown of Mpp6 expression in these mutant CAFs restored their protumorigenic properties, as determined in coinjection studies with Saa3-proficient pancreatic tumor cells in nude mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the expression levels of Mpp6 were unaffected by the presence or absence of Saa3 in tumor cells, suggesting that the functional relationship between Saa3 and Mpp6 might be limited to CAFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the molecular pathways implicated in the inhibitory role of Mpp6 on the protumorigenic effect of CAFs should unveil novel therapeutic opportunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we have interrogated whether our observations in GEM PDAC tumor models could be translated to a human scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As indicated above, the SAA3 locus is a nonexpressed pseudogene (41, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the acute-phase SAA1 protein has structural and functional characteristics that closely resemble those of murine Saa3, suggesting that SAA1 and Saa3 could be ortholog proteins (59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, SAA1 is overexpressed in human CAFs compared with NPFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, high levels of SAA1 expression in the stromal component of human PDAC tumors correlate with significantly worse survival regardless of whether the tumor samples contain normal or activated stroma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, high SAA1 expression in tumor samples with low stroma content also correlate with slightly increased survival, suggesting that SAA1 may have a protumoral effect when highly expressed in stroma and a possible antitumor effect when overexpressed in tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A dual role for SAA proteins depending on cellular context has already been reported by other investigators (18, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, MPP6 levels inversely correlated with SAA1 expression in human PDAC samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our results support the concept that murine Saa3 may serve as a model to study the role of the human acute-phase SAA1 protein in pancreatic cancer and to develop novel therapeutic strategies against this potential target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since SAA1 is a secreted protein, it is conceivable that its protumorigenic properties could be dwarfed by specific monoclonal antibodies, providing that they are primarily delivered to the desmoplastic stroma, avoiding as much as possible their interaction with the tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a better understanding of the signaling pathways driven by SAA1 should provide clues about differential signaling mechanisms in stromal vs. tumor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
