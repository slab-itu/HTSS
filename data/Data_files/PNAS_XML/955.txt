Default mode contributions to automated information processing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition to dealing with variable demands of the environment in everyday life, we are continuously faced with routine, predictable challenges that require fast and effective responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an fMRI-based cognitive flexibility task, we show greater activity/connectivity centered on the default mode network during such automated decision-making under predictable environmental demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we report on a significant correlation between this network and hippocampal connectivity and individual differences in the participants ability to make automated, fast, and accurate responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest an autopilot role for this network that may have important theoretical implications for our understanding of healthy brain processing in meeting worldly demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Concurrent with mental processes that require rigorous computation and control, a series of automated decisions and actions govern our daily lives, providing efficient and adaptive responses to environmental demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a cognitive flexibility task, we show that a set of brain regions collectively known as the default mode network plays a crucial role in such autopilot behavior, i.e., when rapidly selecting appropriate responses under predictable behavioral contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While applying learned rules, the default mode network shows both greater activity and connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, functional interactions between this network and hippocampal and parahippocampal areas as well as primary visual cortex correlate with the speed of accurate responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate a memory-based autopilot role for the default mode network, which may have important implications for our current understanding of healthy and adaptive brain processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental design, behavioral, and brain activation results for the cognitive flexibility task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (A) During a single trial, in addition to four permanent reference cards, participants were presented with a target card chosen from a pool of 60 cards.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the Sort prompt, a block of 10 trials commenced for a given sorting dimension (color, shape, number, or identity) that was undisclosed to the participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each trial, they were presented with feedback indicating choice accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (B) In comparison with the control condition, the percentage of correct responses was lower, and correct response latency was longer, in the task condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further dividing these results, the participants performed worse in the acquisition in comparison with the application phases of both the task and control conditions (SI Appendix, Table S2) (**** denotes P less_than 0.0001, and the error bars represent SE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (C) The conventional contrast of task  control blocks revealed activity centered on an extensive system of brain areas encompassing regions commonly associated with the frontoparietal, dorsal attention, cingulo-opercular, salience, and visual networks (SI Appendix, Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were no significant results in the task less_than control contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported clusters are uncorrected at the voxel level (P = 0.001), and Family Wise Error (FWE)-corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level (P = 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Differential_Brain_Activity_During_Cognitive_Flexibility_Task  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In line with our expectations for the behavioral stratification of the task, participants were less accurate in the acquisition phase, with an average of 91.92% correct responses, than in the application phase, with an average of 98.94% correct responses [t(27) = 17.64, P less_than 0.0001] (Fig 1B and SI Appendix, Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the correct response latency was longer for the acquisition phase (1,252.31 ms) in comparison with the application (1,119.30 ms) phase of the task condition [t(27) = 8.28, P less_than 0.0001].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phase-specific result of a slower response was also significant in the control conditions [t(27) = 6.82, P less_than 0.0001]; however, after multiple comparison correction, no significant difference was observed in accuracy [t(27) = 2.12, P = 0.17].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the participants were less accurate and slower in finding the correct response under novel environmental demands, whereas once the rule was acquired, the responses were faster and more accurate, demonstrating context-specific, learned decision-making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having demonstrated the expected differentiation in behavioral performance, the next step was to examine the relative differences in brain activity between the acquisition and application phases of the cognitive flexibility task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the brain areas observed in effortful task performance (Fig 1C and SI Appendix, Table S3), in a given environmental context (i.e., task rule) we postulated that a greater number of regions commonly associated with controlled, effortful processing would be more active in the acquisition phase compared with the application phase (1, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would allow more perceptual information to be extracted from the environment to aid the decision-making process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, greater DMN activity would be observed during the application phase in comparison with the acquisition phase, allowing the use of memory-based information for responding to environmental demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Comparable to this hypothesis, the results revealed a highly symmetrical bilateral set of frontoparietal, insular, subcortical, and cerebellar brain regions more active in the acquisition compared with the application phase of the task (Fig 2A and SI Appendix, Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These areas, often referred to as the multiple-demand network (19), have been previously shown to engage during the WCST (20) as well as other tests of cognitive flexibility (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a large-scale brain network organization perspective, these coactivating brain regions have been largely associated with the frontoparietal, dorsal attention, cingulo-opercular, salience, and visual networks (21), which have been denoted as externally directed networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, the dorsal attention network (DAN) activity has been previously shown to anticorrelate with that of the DMN during resting state conditions (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
On the other hand, compared with the acquisition phase, the application phase displayed greater activity centered on the default mode as well as somatomotor network regions including the ventromedial (orbitofrontal) prefrontal cortex; parts of the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus; medial temporal lobe structures including the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal gyrus as well as the right amygdala, superior, and middle temporal gyri, posterior insula, Heschls gyri, and rolandic operculum; middle cingulate and paracentral lobule; postcentral and precentral gyri; parts of the left angular gyrus; and the left middle occipital gyrus (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the DMN has not been extensively studied in tasks of cognitive flexibility, emerging evidence suggests its contribution to tasks associated with this function (22, 23), i.e., our ability to apply learned rules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, Provost and colleagues have investigated the brains responses to changing or continuous application of WCST rules in an experiment in which the participants were explicitly informed about the relevant rules to be applied (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with findings from our experiment, in which the participants had to implicitly deduce the rule via trial-and-error, the continuous application of the same rule was linked to greater activity in regions commonly associated with the DMN, suggesting the potential contribution of this set of brain regions to memory-based, automated phases of goal-oriented tasks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Altered_Brain_Network_Connectivity_During_Cognitive_Flexibility_Task  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following this observed differential activity of brain regions commonly associated with controlled, effortful processing (e.g., DAN) and those belonging to the DMN in the acquisition and application phases of the WCST task, respectively, our next objective was to determine the extent of the dorsal attention and default mode networks interactions with the rest of the brain during task performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we aimed to assess any changes in the functional connectivity of these two networks, which are commonly anticorrelated at rest (17) and are purported to mediate externally and internally directed cognition, respectively (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
First, we examined DAN connectivity during the acquisition and application phases of the WCST, using a seed on the left frontal eye field (FEF) (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both phases of the task condition, the results revealed an extensive DAN that encompassed the FEF and inferior parietal lobule as has been previously discussed in the literature (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the DAN illustrated altered connectivity with the middle/superior temporal and inferior/superior parietal gyri in the acquisition phase compared with the application phase (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Tables S6S8), i.e., regions which have all been previously implicated in attentional control relevant to the task at hand (27, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Next, we investigated DMN connectivity in the two phases of the task using a seed that was placed on the left posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCUN) region, a main hub of the DMN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the acquisition and the application phases, the results revealed an extensive DMN as defined in the literature (29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the DMN showed greater connectivity to a range of areas in the application phase compared with the acquisition phase, including the PCC/PCUN, ventromedial prefrontal cortices, and left angular gyrus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, reduced connectivity was observed with the bilateral insular gyri and right presupplementary motor area as well as increased anticorrelation with regions commonly linked to the DAN (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Tables S9S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate the robust temporal correlations of these two networks throughout the two phases of the WCST, with alterations in their functional connectivity in response to the variable demands for access to external or memory-based information to be used in the decision-making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, the results indicate continuous DMN engagement in a goal-oriented task with alterations in its spatial topography in response to changing demands for access to learned information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Double_Dissociation_of_Brain_and_Behavior_Relationships  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following these results on the altered, yet continuous engagement of DAN and DMN regions during the two phases of the WCST, the final question we asked was whether the connectivity of these two networks in their respective phases would differentially relate to behavioral performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond the DMNs usual association with task-unrelated internal mentation (30), our aim was to illustrate this networks contribution to WCST performance via memory-based, automated decision-making that is differentiated from the contribution of the DAN (traditionally associated with controlled, effortful information processing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For that purpose, we first investigated the relationship between DAN connectivity and reaction time to correct responses in the acquisition and application phases of the WCST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicated that greater connectivity between FEF and somatomotor regions (precentral and postcentral gyrus and the paracentral lobule) in the acquisition phase correlated with faster reaction times and thus better performance (Fig 4A and SI Appendix, Table S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no such correlation between the FEF and any brain regions was found in the application phase (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This connectivity between the FEF and the precentral gyrus is believed to control saccades when processing visual information (28, 31), which is an important component of this task, i.e., facilitating an extensive visual search and extraction of information during rule acquisition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the DMN, greater connectivity of the PCC/PCUN with the parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampal formation, amygdala, and primary visual cortices correlated with faster reaction time to correct responses and thus better performance in the application phase of the WCST (Fig 4D and SI Appendix, Table S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, no such correlation of the PCC/PCUN with any other brain region was found in the acquisition phase (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the vast amount of literature that indicates the role of medial temporal lobe structures in context-specific, memory-based information processing (32, 33) and the visual nature of the task at hand, it is plausible that the observed correlation indicates the participants ability to access and utilize learned responses in dealing with stable environmental contexts during the application phase of the WCST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, these brain and behavioral results reveal a double dissociation in which the relative DAN and DMN connectivity in the acquisition and application phases of the WCST, respectively, correlate with enhanced behavioral performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, these results strongly suggest the DMNs task relevance in the application phase of the WCST, indicating its ongoing contribution to learned, automated, and fast responses for decision-making under a given behavioral context (or rule).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite the mounting evidence on its extensive structural and functional connections (34) and implication in a variety of neuropsychiatric as well as neurodegenerative disorders (35), the exact functional role of the DMN in human cognition remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, the major aim of this study was to provide evidence for this networks positive contribution to the performance of an externally directed, attention-demanding, goal-oriented, nonself-referential task of cognitive flexibility and to outline a general framework within which it may operate to contribute to adaptive cognition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the findings allude to the involvement of the DMN in automated information processing, i.e., when rapidly selecting appropriate responses under specific, predictable environmental demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent models of brain function suggest that our brains are wired in a way that maximizes the anticipation of external events (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The internalization of statistical regularities through worldly experiences forms the foundations of our expectations (priors or best guesses), which can then be used to interpret, predict, and act upon environmental demands (3638).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the intrinsic activity of the brain, specifically that of the DMN, which uses a considerable portion of our brain energy supplies (9), is suggested to reflect such internal models of the world that could aid in the interpretation of our surroundings (16, 3941).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although such predictive processing may constitute the common mechanism by which the brain processes information as a whole, what may distinguish the DMN is its ability to provide a common workspace for convergence of information with its extensive functional and structural connections to the rest of the brain and specifically its access to memory-based information (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This integrative capacity of the DMN (13) is thought to be a hallmark of consciousness (42), the levels of which have been previously associated with DMN integrity (43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
From this perspective, the relatively increased activity/connectivity of the DMN in the application phase of the WCST observed in this study may indicate this networks ability to integrate memory-based information (13), generating top-down associative predictions under stable environmental contexts (16) for automated, fast, and efficient decision-making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, unpredictable, novel, or salient events, beyond the scope of the DMNs memory-based processing, such as the one required in the acquisition phase of this task, may demand further external attention and perceptual information for making decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would increase the involvement of networks commonly associated with controlled, effortful processing such as the frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular, salience, and dorsal attention networks (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the anticorrelation previously reported between the DMN and DAN (17) might represent these networks differential but complementary roles in facilitating the theorized predictive processing of the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the spectrum of differential involvement of these two networks may not be based on the dichotomy of internally versus externally directed cognition, but may rather be dependent on the predictability of the environmental demands, requiring either learned (memory-based) or novel (perception-based) responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, recent evidence suggests a dynamic interplay between the DMN and DAN in the redirection of attention, potentially controlled by the salience and/or frontoparietal networks influence on determining the saliency and predictability of incoming information (4446).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Such duality in decision-making under varying levels of predictability in the environment has been extensively discussed in the scientific literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Norman and Shallice have argued for stored schemas that automatically take over processing in familiar environmental contexts, while the supervisory attentional system was postulated to play an intentional inhibitory role when the environmental rules changed (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along a similar line of thought, Kahneman and Tversky have also devised an influential two-system view of brain processing (48); one (System 1) required to carry out automated decision-making to provide fast best-guesses, and another (System 2) used to make calculated and effortful decisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Based on our results, we propose that the DMN may contribute to an autopilot mode that makes memory-based predictions to aid decision-making under established behavioral contexts, whereas control networks are involved in a manual mode that overrides the automatic system when the DMN fails to reliably predict the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This proactive framework of brain function may provide an all-important scaffold to explain not only the DMNs ongoing activity in stable rest conditions, but also its contribution to social interactions (e.g., theory of mind, intuition, and stereotyping), a conscious sense-of-self, creativity, and a variety of other cognitive domains (49) that all require the stable use of learned information for predicting the world around us.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, future studies will be required to assess the potential role that the DMN may play in the formation of habitual behavior for the neuroeconomics of decision-making and its potential breakdown in disorders such as addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or clinical depression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Ethical approval was obtained from the Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics committee in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All volunteers gave informed consent before their participation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the exclusion criteria, this right-handed, healthy control group consisted of 28 participants (2234 y old, mean = 26.8, SD = 2.8, 13/15 female to male ratio) with an average National Adult Reading Test (NART) score of 121.22 (SD = 3.17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Experimental_Paradigm_Specifications  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experimental paradigm was a variant of the WCST (50) that was modified for the scanner environment, utilizing a mixed design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stimuli were delivered, and responses were recorded, using an open source software package called PsychoPy (Version 1.83).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the task and control blocks conventionally used in this paradigm, we operationally stratified the task into acquisition and application phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full details about the experimental paradigm and procedures followed for the preprocessing and analysis of both the behavioral and imaging data are provided in the SI Appendix, SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MRI_Data_Acquisition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The participants were scanned in a Siemens MAGNETOM Tim Trio 3T scanner (32-channel head coil) at the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, Cambridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scanning session started with a high-resolution T1-weighted, magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) structural scan (TR = 2,300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, slice thickness = 1.00 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence parameters for the WCST functional data acquisition were as follows: 37 slices in each volume, 3.0 mm slice thickness, 3.0 × 3.0 × 3.0 voxel size, TR = 2,000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 78°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of 3D volumes varied according to the speed of the participants responses to the task (mean = 347 volumes, SD = 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

MRI_Data_Preprocessing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
MRI data preprocessing and statistical analyses were carried out using the SPM software package (Version 12.0), based on the MATLAB platform (Version 15a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For preprocessing, functional volumes were slice-time and motion-corrected, coregistered to the high-resolution structural image, spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space using the unified-segmentation algorithm (51), smoothed with an 8 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel, and carried forward onto statistical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
