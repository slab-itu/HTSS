Repairable cascaded slide-lock system endows bird feathers with tear-resistance and superdurability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bird feathers have aroused tremendous attention for their contributions to the unique flight capability of birds against wind and even through bushes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many studies have attempted to explore the mechanism underlying feathers superdurability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not yet clear why feathers are so superdurable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we discovered and characterized the sophisticated cascaded slide-lock system of bird feathers, which is composed of flexible hooklets, a slide rail, and spines at the end of the slide rail as terminating structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding demonstrates that the superdurability of bird feathers against tears originates from their cascaded slide-lock system, not from the hookgroove system proposed centuries ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Bird feathers have aroused tremendous attention for their superdurability against tears during long flights through wind and even bushes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although feathers may inevitably be unzipped, the separated feather vanes can be repaired easily by bill stroking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanism underlying bird feathers superdurability against tears remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we reveal that the superdurability of bird feathers arises from their repairable cascaded slide-lock system, which is composed of hooklets, a slide rail, and spines at the end of the slide rail as terminating structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microscopy with a micronano manipulating system and 3D X-ray microscopy provided high-level visibility into the 3D fine structures and the entire unzipping process of feathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hooklets can slide along the slide rail reversibly when suffering external forces, and the sliding hooklet can be locked by the spine at the ends of barbules when larger pulling forces are applied and even slide farther away due to the unzipping of the interlocking structure with large deformation of the barbules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elongation before separation of adjacent barbs can reach up to 270%, and the separation force can be maintained above 80% of the initial value even after 1,000 cycles of separating and repairing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results prove that the cascaded slide-lock system ensures the superdurability of bird feathers against tears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Structures_of_Feathers_for_the_Cascaded_Slide-Lock_System  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Considering the structural and functional similarity of different bird feathers (see the details in SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8S10), a flight feather from a goshawk was taken as a sample for observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A feather comprises a shaft (called a rachis) and two rows of side branches (called barbs) on both sides of the rachis (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The barbs are aligned in parallel, with a certain angle relative to the rachis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the barbs are composed of overlapped second-order side branches (called barbules) on both sides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adjacent barbs overlap closely, forming dense vanes (Fig 2B) where hooklets can be found to interlock with the adjacent barbs and strengthen the vanes (Fig 2 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D X-ray microscopy reconstruction image of adjacent barbs in Fig 2E shows the in situ 3D structures of a feather.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hooklets protrude from one barbule and hook into the curved margin of the adjacent barbule, which links the adjacent barbs together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, finer tooth-like spine structures can be observed (details below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further explore the fine structures, we separated a single barb from the feather for further observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The barbules on both sides of the barb shaft (called the ramus) show different structures (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The barbules close to the tip of the feather have many hooklets (four to five hooklets on one barbule) protruding from the middle on the ventral side; these structures are called hook barbules and are positioned at an angle of 53° relative to the ramus (Fig 3C; more detail can be observed in SI Appendix, Fig S1 and Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each hooklet is composed of a drooping ribbon component and a component that gradually transforms from a ribbon to a pillar with a hooked tip (Fig 3D and SI Appendix, Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The barbules projecting from the other side of the ramus at an angle of 49° (SI Appendix, Fig S1 and Table S1), called bow barbules, are laminas with dorsally curved margins, and tooth-like spine structures occur at the distal end (called dorsal spines, four to five per barbule) (Fig 3 E and F and SI Appendix, Fig S3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the dorsal spines, each lamina splits into several overlapping leaf-like structures (Fig 3F and SI Appendix, Fig S3 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hooklets of the hook barbules can hook the curved margins of the bow barbules on the adjacent barbs, which maintains the feather vane flexible and stable against wind.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the hooklets on the hook barbules and the dorsal spine, which feature a curved triangle shape, on the bow barbules completely match in size and shape (Fig 3 G and H); thus, the structures can form a terminal interlocking system to prevent the hooklets from sliding out of the curved margin under external forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the overlapped leaf-like structures can be separated from each other when pulled (SI Appendix, Fig S3D), helping unzip the interlocked hooklets and dorsal spines instead of breaking them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such elegant structures ensure a rather large force for separating adjacent barbs without causing damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest a more complex feather interlocking system than the hook-and-groove model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Cascaded_Slide-Lock_System_in_Feathers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To further explore the function of the unique structures, we used optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with a micronano manipulating system to observe the separation of two adjacent barbs when pulled (Fig 4 and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the original state, the hooklets on hook barbules drooped freely and hooked the curved margin on the adjacent bow barbules (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When external force was added, the hooklets were stretched and hooked the curved margin of the bow barbules (Fig 4B and Fig 4D, i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the increase in the pulling force, the hooklets slid along the curved margin as a slide rail accompanied by slight bending of the barbules (Fig 4D, iii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a certain force, the hooklets slid to the distal end of the bow barbules, met the dorsal spines, and formed interlocking structures (Fig 4C and Fig 4D, iiiii).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interlocking structures could stop the hooklet from sliding away from the bow barbule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a large increase in the pulling force, both the hook barbules and bow barbules were bent (Fig 4D, iiiiv, and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, when the bending degree exceeded a certain threshold (SI Appendix, Fig S4, the mechanical analysis of the separation process), the interlocking structures could be unzipped, and the hooklet moved to another dorsal spine or directly away from the bow barbules (Fig 4D, ivvi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the force analysis of the hooklet during the separation process, the factor determining whether the hooklet will slide is the angle  between the pulling force on the hooklet and the advancing direction (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When  is smaller than the threshold (arccot , where  is the friction coefficient between the hooklet and the curved margin of bow barbules), the hooklet will slide away.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dorsal spines change the advancing direction and increase ; thus, the hooklets cannot move away unless a much larger increase in the pulling force bends the barbules and decreases  to the threshold (SI Appendix, Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details related to the separation process are presented in Movie S1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the external force were removed before the hooklets moved away from the bow barbules, the hooklets would move back close to the initial position (Fig 4D, iv, and Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering these elegant structures and their function, we propose that the superdurability of feathers originates from their cascaded slide-lock system (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To help describe the feather structures and the separation process, we created an animated 3D movie showing how all of the feather features interact during the separation process: the hooklets slide along the curved margin of a bow barbule; when the hooklets meet the dorsal spine, interlocking structures form and stop the hooklet from sliding away; increasing the external force bends the barbules, and the interlocking structures are unzipped, resulting in the separation of the barbs (Movie S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also printed a simplified mechanical model based on our proposed cascaded slide-lock model of the feather; the model featured a flexible hooklet, slide rail, and sliding-terminated structures (SI Appendix, Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, a 3D printed model based on the traditional hookgroove model was also generated (SI Appendix, Fig S5A, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in SI Appendix, Fig S5B, the separation of the samples based on our proposed cascaded slide-lock model requires a much larger external force (SI Appendix, Fig S5B, Top) than that of the sample based on the hookgroove model (SI Appendix, Fig S5B, Bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate the advantage and validity of our proposed cascaded slide-lock feather model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_Self-Repairing_Capability_and_Superdurability_Against_Tears_of_the_Cascaded_Slide-Lock_System_in_Feathers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Furthermore, we measured the separation force of a feathers cascaded slide-lock system by sticking one side (6 mm wide) of two closed adjacent barbs to the pan of a balance and lifting the other side with a single-axis push-and-pull device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With an increase in the spacing of adjacent barbs, the hooklets slid along the curved margin of the bow barbule and hooked the dorsal spines at the distal end, forming interlocking structures with the bending of the barbules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding force increased almost linearly and finally reached its maximum when the interlocking structures were unzipped with large deformation, defined as the separation force (goshawk feathers, 44.4 ± 8.7 mN) (Fig 5A and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elongation at separation was 270% (the ratio of the distance at separation, 1.10 ± 0.10 mm, to the original spacing of adjacent barbs, 0.40 ± 0.02 mm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then the force curve exhibited a sharp drop, indicating that the barbs were separated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The separation force-lifting distance curves exhibit good consistency and reproducibility (SI Appendix, Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When tearing the adjacent barbs from the tip, the tearing force was concentrated on only several couples of hook barbules and bow barbules and ranged from 2 to 5 mN due to the interlocking and unzipping of the hooklets and dorsal spines (Fig 5B and SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed similar structures on the feathers from different birds (magpie, Circus cyaneus, and common buzzard) (SI Appendix, Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S8S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The separation forces of these barbs vary among birds, likely depending on the barbule density (SI Appendix, Fig S11 and Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In flight, the feathers of flapping wings may be pulled with deformation or even be separated by wind or bushes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, feathers can be self-repaired or repaired with the bill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the self-repairing capability and durability of the sample feathers cascaded slide-lock system, we measured the pulling force of two adjacent barbs at different lifting distances: 0.25, 0.4, and 0.5 mm and separated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the lifting distance was not greater than the distance at separation, the maximum pulling force, defined as the separating force, increased with the lifting distance; repair could be achieved simply by removing the external force, during which the hooklets slid reversibly along the curved margin (Movie S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process was repeated, and the maximum separating force of the repaired adjacent barbs was rather close to that of the original adjacent barbs (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when the barbs were separated with the unzipping of the interlocking structure between the hooklets and dorsal spines, the separated feather could be repaired again by stroking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The repaired barbs were separated again to measure the separation force, and this process was repeated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum separation forces were similar, which indicated that the feather was not damaged during separation (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results revealed the highly efficient self-repairing capability of the feathers cascaded slide-lock system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The feather exhibited not only an excellent self-repairing capability but also superdurability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pulling forces of the repaired feather within the distance at separation or when being separated were measured repeatedly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 5E, the separating forces and separation forces remained nearly unchanged, with only a slight decline over 1,000 cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The one-thousandth separation force of the repaired feather after separation was still 80% of the first separation force, which demonstrates the high self-repairing stability of the feathers cascaded slide-lock system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A cascaded slide-lock system has been demonstrated in feathers via 3D X-ray microscopy and microscopy with a micronano manipulating system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cascaded slide-lock system of feathers ensures their superdurability and high self-repairing capability and helps birds survive in hostile environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide insight into the design of smart textiles and flexible devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cleaning_of_the_Feathers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Before characterization, the feathers were cleaned with water and alcohol successively by an ultrasonic method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, the cleaned feathers were air-dried at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Scanning_Electron_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The samples were sputtered with a thin layer of platinum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (JSM-7500F; JEOL) was performed to investigate the morphology of feathers at an acceleration voltage of 5.0 kV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

X-Ray_Tomography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To observe the spatial site distribution of the micro/nanostructures on adjacent barbs, an X-ray microscopy (Xradia 510 Versa system, Carl Zeiss) was used (performed by Chunjie Cao at Carl Zeiss, Inc.) at a resolution of 0.8 m with an X-ray source voltage and power of 50 kV and 4 W, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Mechanical_Measurement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The separation force of adjacent barbs was measured by sticking one side (6 mm wide) of the closed two adjacent barbs to the pan of a sensitive balance (with an accuracy of 0.01 mg, Mettler Toledo XSl05 DualRange) and lifting the other side with a single-axis push-and-pull device at a pulling speed of 30 mm/min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weight loss was recorded in real time; multiplied by gravitational acceleration, the weight loss was exactly the separation force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
