Aurone synthase is a catechol oxidase with hydroxylase activity and provides insights into the mechanism of plant polyphenol oxidases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Catechol oxidases and tyrosinases belong to the family of polyphenol oxidases (PPOs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to tyrosinases, catechol oxidases were so far defined to lack hydroxylase activity toward monophenols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aurone synthase (AUS1) is a plant catechol oxidase that specializes in the conversion of chalcones to aurones (flower pigments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evidence for the first time, to our knowledge, hydroxylase activity for a catechol oxidase (AUS1) toward its natural monophenolic substrate (chalcone).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presented first crystal structure of a plant pro-PPO provides insights into its activation mechanisms, and based on biochemical and structural studies of AUS1, we propose a novel catalytic reaction mechanism for plant PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proven hydroxylase functionality of AUS1 suggests that other catechol oxidases might also be involved in the plants secondary metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tyrosinases and catechol oxidases belong to the family of polyphenol oxidases (PPOs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyrosinases catalyze the o-hydroxylation and oxidation of phenolic compounds, whereas catechol oxidases were so far defined to lack the hydroxylation activity and catalyze solely the oxidation of o-diphenolic compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aurone synthase from Coreopsis grandiflora (AUS1) is a specialized plant PPO involved in the anabolic pathway of aurones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present, to our knowledge, the first crystal structures of a latent plant PPO, its mature active and inactive form, caused by a sulfation of a copper binding histidine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the latent proenzymes interface between the shielding C-terminal domain and the main core provides insights into its activation mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As AUS1 did not accept common tyrosinase substrates (tyrosine and tyramine), the enzyme is classified as a catechol oxidase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, AUS1 showed hydroxylase activity toward its natural substrate (isoliquiritigenin), revealing that the hydroxylase activity is not correlated with the acceptance of common tyrosinase substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we propose that the hydroxylase reaction is a general functionality of PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamics simulations of docked substrateenzyme complexes were performed, and a key residue was identified that influences the plant PPOs acceptance or rejection of tyramine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the evidenced hydroxylase activity and the interactions of specific residues with the substrates during the molecular dynamics simulations, a novel catalytic reaction mechanism for plant PPOs is proposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presented results strongly suggest that the physiological role of plant catechol oxidases were previously underestimated, as they might hydroxylate theirso far unknownnatural substrates in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall_Structure_of_Active_AUS1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Mature AUS1 (41.6 kDa) crystallized in space groups P212121 and P1211, both with four monomers in the asymmetric unit, yielding crystals of comparable quality (24) (diffracting to 1.6 Å; Tables S1 and S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enzymes structure possesses a very high structural similarity to the plant catechol oxidases from Ipomoea batatas (18) [ibCO; Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1BT3; rmsd of 0.81 Å between 296 atom pairs] and Vitis vinifera (17) (vvCO; PDB ID 2P3X; rmsd of 0.79 Å between 284 atom pairs) as well as to the plant tyrosinase from J. regia (23) (jrTYR; PDB ID code 5CE9; rmsd of 0.82 Å between 287 atom pairs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mature AUS1 shares 47% sequence identity with each of the active catechol oxidases and 48% with the active tyrosinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural divergences to these PPOs are the unique features (15) of AUS1 (Fig 1A and Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  S1 and S2A): the remaining C-terminal peptide (Asp338 to Gly452)connected to the catalytically active main core by a disulfide bond (Cys206Cys445)and the insertion of four amino acids (V237ANG240) that form a cavity near the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both crystal forms possess homodimeric assemblies of their monomers [analyzed with PISA (Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies)] (25), and a portion of mature AUS1 was found in a dimeric state by size exclusion chromatography (Fig S3), evidencing that the dimer exists in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological assembly reveals a so far unknown role of the residual C-terminal peptide, as it forms a main building block of the homodimeric interface (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quaternary structure is stabilized by four hydrogen bonds, 11 bridging water molecules, and several hydrophobic interactions between the residues of the C-terminal peptide of one monomer and the -helix of the second monomer that carries the C-terminal peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions result in a buried surface area ranging from 1,523 to 2,323 Å2 and a free energy of dissociation of the dimer ranging from 2.6 to 8.9 kcal/mol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active sites of the dimeric monomers are facing opposite directions, due to their twofold rotational symmetry relation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Overall_Structure_of_Latent_AUS1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Latent AUS1 was found to be monomeric, and the overall structure of the main core of the latent proenzyme is almost identical to the overall structure of the mature enzyme (rmsd of 0.47 Å between 338 atom pairs), except for the location of one loop, which gives way for the shielding C-terminal domain (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this loop contains the characteristic insertion (V237ANG240) of the group 2 PPOs (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal domain begins with a short linker region of approximately 10 amino acids, located in the vicinity of the interdomain disulfide linkage (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal domain displays seven -strands that form a jelly roll barrel motif with the four loops being arranged in a staggered manner above the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latent enzyme displayed very low activity (toward butein) and an allosteric activation (in the presence of in situ-formed o-quinones) (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the active site of a small portion of latent enzyme molecules has to be accessible for substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A loop region of the jelly roll motif as well as the loop that carries the insertion show weak or even completely missing electron density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates the flexibility of this region possibly being an entrance for the substrates (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interface between the catalytically active main core and the shielding C-terminal domain is fairly large and composed of several hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and water bridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the interdomain interactions are concentrated at two different locations (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One area is located near the linker region and the interdomain disulfide linkage, whereas the other is located in the vicinity of the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residue Ile456 is of crucial importance, as it blocks the entrance to the active site and functions similar to a plug (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This plug residue is located outside of the active site and on top of the gate residue (Phe273).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is stabilized by its hydrophobic interactions with the gate residue, one CuB binding histidine (His252), and Thr253.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Copper_Binding_Sites_of_met-__oxy-__and_Inactive_Forms_of_AUS1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Active, latent, and recombinantly expressed latent AUS1 crystallized in the resting met-form, in which the copper ions (CuIICuII distance, 4 Å) are bridged by a hydroxide ion or a water molecule (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry of the met-form of AUS1 is fully consistent with previously published structures (18, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To generate the oxy-form, crystals of recombinantly expressed AUS1 were soaked in cryoprotectant solution containing hydrogen peroxide (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The copper ions (CuII) of the obtained crystal structure are bridged by a peroxide ion, and the CuCu distance is reduced to 3.4 Å (Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OO distance of 1.92.0 Å (not restrained during refinements) indicates a Cu2O2 geometry that lies between the bis--oxo and the -2:2-peroxo geometry, which exists in equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the complex exhibits a butterfly distortion (distortion of the CuOOCu torsion angles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CuO distances seem to slightly differ between chain A and chain B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the resolution (1.8 Å; Tables S1 and S2) of the obtained dataset is not high enough to provide an unambiguous statement about the precise CuO distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The crystal structures of mature AUS1 (Fig 3 C and D), purified from the natural source, displayed an unexpected electron density at the CuB binding His252.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was particularly the case in crystal structures from enzyme samples that exhibited a high portion of sulfation or phosphorylation (24), making it impossible to place a histidine-coordinated copper atom into the density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the density matched very well to the density of a phosphohistidine or sulfohistidine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the histidine residue was sulfated (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the sulfation, the histidine loses its ability to participate in copper coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to the loss of the CuB atom (Fig 3D) and to the loss of enzymatic activity of the modified enzyme molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reactivity_of_AUS1_and_Insights_into_the_Reaction_Mechanism_by_MD_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recently, we reported that AUS1 lacks monophenolase activity (o-hydroxylation of monophenolic compounds) and displays exclusively diphenolase activity (oxidation of diphenolic compounds to the corresponding o-quinones) (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a modification of the activity assay by adding ascorbic acid as a reducing agent revealed that AUS1 in fact possesses hydroxylase activity toward isoliquiritigenin (Fig S5 A and B) and that consecutive reactions were responsible for the previously reported false-negative statements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of a reducing agent, the highly reactive quinoid intermediates and products polymerize and are therefore undetectable by HPLC analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the reaction product sulfuretin has been reported to be a suicide substrate for AUS1 (15), for which the utilization of isoliquiritigenin strongly depended on the amount of enzymes used in the activity assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the difference spectra of isoliquiritigenin differed between AUS1 and abTYR (Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the presence of a reducing agent that traps the highly reactive quinoid intermediates, the difference spectra show identical absorption changes, which is evidence that the differences observed in the absence of a reducing agent are related not to the hydroxylation reaction but to the complex consecutive reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the enzyme showed hydroxylation activity toward kaempferol (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to tyrosinases, AUS1 did not accept tyramine and tyrosine as substrates (10 µg active AUS1; 2 mM tyramine in 1 mL total volume; recordings up to 1 h; the experiments were performed with and without the addition of hydrogen peroxide and ascorbic acid).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The chalcone isoliquiritigenin and the chalconeaurone pairs of butein and lanceoletin (corresponding aurones, sulfuretin and leptosidin) naturally occur in Coreopsis species [summarized in Molitor et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (15)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate obtained molecular docking results of butein to AUS1, two different poses were subjected to MD simulations with the met-form of AUS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the simulation of one docking pose, the reactive B-ring of the chalcone remained in the active site, whereas the A-ring was very flexible and interacted with several different residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other docking pose resulted in a stable substrate enzyme complex, where the diphenolic substrate rapidly moved deeper into the cavity, which is formed by the extended loop region (V237ANG240) (compare with Fig 1A), and remained there relatively stably during the simulation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrates oxygen atoms are almost centered between the two copper atoms (Fig 4B and Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mimic the substrate position during the electron transfer, the simulation was repeated with restrained CuOsubstrate bonds (26), resulting in a considerably reduced fluctuation of the unreactive A-ring due to its stronger interaction with protein residues of the cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Butein is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the residues Asn117, Asn239, Arg257, and Gly240 (backbone); by hydrophobic interactions with the residues Asn239, Val244, Ala249, Thr253, His256, Phe273, and Ala276; and by residue Glu248 through a water bridge (Fig 4B and the substrate binding residues are highlighted in Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The unrestraint but stable docking position of butein was then taken as a basis for the simulation of the diphenolic substrate lanceoletin and the monophenolic substrates isoliquiritigenin and tyramine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interactions of lanceoletin with AUS1 were almost identical with those of butein, but with additional stabilization of the methoxyl group by hydrogen bonds with Gly240 and hydrophobic interactions arising from Val244, Ala249, and Glu248.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the residues Gly271 and Asn271 form water bridges with the carbonyl oxygen of the chalcone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when the bridging water molecule is missing (water molecules in the simulation box were placed randomly), the highly conserved residue Glu248 is capable of directly coordinating one copper-coordinating hydroxyl group of the substrate (Fig 4C and Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This residue has been proposed to participate in the water-mediated deprotonation of substrates (17, 20, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the MD simulations indicate that it might even be directly involved in substrate deprotonation (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For the simulation of the monophenols isoliquiritigenin and tyramine, the oxy-form of the enzyme was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even without a CuOsubstrate distance restraint, isoliquiritigenin remained very stable within the cavity, with identical enzymesubstrate interactions as in the case of the diphenols butein and lanceoletin under restrained conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distances of both copper atoms to the reactive hydroxyl group ranged mainly between 3.5 and 4.5 Å (Fig 4D and Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, tyramine rapidly left the binuclear copper site of AUS1 (within 75 ps) due to attractive interactions with Arg257 (Fig 4E and Fig S6D), which is in accordance with the absence of monophenolase activity of AUS1 toward tyramine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characteristic insertion (V237ANG240) of AUS1 might additionally interact with tyramine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain more generalized information about the role of Arg257, simulations of tyramine in complex with jrTYR and with the corresponding L244R mutant of jrTYR were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tyramine remained within the active site of jrTYR, whereas it left the active site of the L244R mutant rapidly (Fig S6E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate a crucial role of the residues in this position (Fig S1) for the acceptance or refusal of tyramie as a substrate for plant PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Exemplary video files of the simulation of AUS1 in complex with butein (Movies S1S3) are available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Overall_Structures_of_Mature_AUS1_and_of_the_First_Latent_Plant_PPO  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The most relevant differences to the plant PPO homologs ibCO (17), vvCO (18), and jrTYR (23) are the characteristic four-amino-acid insertion of the group 2 PPOs and the short residual C-terminal peptide, connected to the main core by a disulfide bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insertion forms a binding pocket for the natural substrates (chalcones) of AUS1 (discussed below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disulfide linkage was proposed to stabilize the C-terminal domain in the latent proenzyme (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the crystal structures of mature AUS1 reveal that the main function of the interdomain linkage is the retention of the residual peptide, as it is a main building block of the homodimeric interface (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of the latent proenzyme exhibits two domains: the catalytically active domain and the C-terminal domain that is responsible for the latency of the proenzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dominating structural motif of the C-terminal domain is a jelly roll barrel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar motifs are also present in the shielding domains of fungal (21, 27) (C-terminal), arthropod (28) (N-terminal), and insect (29) (N-terminal) PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This taxa-spanning structural homology might indicate another, so far unknown, function of the shielding domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the interdomain disulfide linkage of the main core with the C-terminal domain, the proteolytic activation of the latent enzyme has to occur at three different sites (compare with Fig S1) to result in the active enzyme (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two proteolytic cleavage sites are exposed on the surface (1 and 2 in Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the third is covered by the C-terminal domain as well as by the main core but becomes accessible after the proteolytic cleavage at the first two cleavage sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests, and is supported by the purification of semicleaved latent forms from the natural source (15), that the proteolytic activation occurs stepwise and is targeted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The separation of the interdomain interactions into two distinct areas (Fig 2) reflects specific roles of each area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interactions close to the linker region will be responsible for the general structural integrity of the proenzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by the fact that the interdomain disulfide linkage is also part of this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of the interactions near the active site will affect the latency of the proenzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we propose that the in vitro activation (acidic activation and SDS activation) (6) as well as the allosteric activation (15) of latent plant PPOs are primarily caused by a structural rearrangement in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfer of the detailed knowledge of the interdomain interactions (Fig S1) to other plant PPO homologs will enable the targeted modulation of the kinetic properties of recombinantly expressed proenzymes (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The active site of fungal (21, 27), bacterial (31), insect (29), and arthropod (28) pro-PPOs is blocked by a substrate mimicking the placeholder residue (tyrosine or phenylalanine, originating from the shielding domain) and located within the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the presence of the bulky gate residue above the active site (phenylalanine, originating from the main core), the shielding strategy in plant PPOs has to be different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gate residue would have to swing away to make space for the placeholder residue (compare with Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As this is energetically slightly unfavorable, other stabilizing interactions would be necessary for compensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structures of the first latent plant pro-PPO reveal that plant PPOs overcome this issue by a smaller hydrophobic plug residue (Ile456 in AUS1; valine, leucine, and isoleucine in other plant PPOs) located above the gate residue and outside of the active site (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Copper_Binding_Site_of_AUS1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The reactive oxy-form of AUS1 exhibits a butterfly distortion (Fig 3B) similar to the distortion found in the oxy-form of Streptomyces castaneoglobisporus tyrosinase (scTYR) (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because no indications of a distortion were found in ligand field molecular dynamical simulations of the oxy-form of tyrosinase (32), it has been suggested that the distortion in scTYR might be caused by a hydrogen bonding interaction of the placeholder residue (tyrosine) with the oxygen atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the oxy-form of AUS1 indicates that the butterfly distortion is a general characteristic of the oxy-form of PPOs, as AUS1 does not possess a placeholder residue that might cause this distortion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Irreversible inactivation of tyrosinase from Agaricus bisporus (PPO3; abTYR) has been reported to occur by incubation with sulfite ions (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors evidenced the sulfation of a CuB-coordinating histidine and speculated that the sulfation (accompanied by the loss of the CuB atom) presumably occurred at His263 (His256 in AUS1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of AUS1, however, reveals that the sulfuryl group is transferred to the N atom of His252 (His259 in PPO3; abTYR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consistent discovery of this inactivation in both PPOs might indicate an infiltration of sulfite ions during the purification procedure of AUS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there exist several matters that evoke doubts about this:  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Other sources of this modification might be a reaction of AUS1 with sulfated compounds within the petals of C. grandiflora during the isolation and purification procedure or an in vivo modification of AUS1 by a membrane-bound sulfotransferase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter possibility is very unlikely, as a controlled in vivo PPO inactivation has not been reported so far and we do not have any hints that this occurred in petals of C. grandiflora.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, flavonoid sulfate esters are common in plants, especially in Asteraceae species (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four flavonol sulfotransferases were identified in Flaveria chloraefolia and Flaveria bidentis and catalyze sequential sulfation of quercetin to quercetin 3,7,3,4-tetrasulfate (37, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, it has been crystallographically evidenced that a direct sulfuryl group transfer from p-nitrophenylsulfate to histidine, resulting in an identical sulfohistidine as observed in AUS1, represents an intermediate stage in the reaction mechanism of a bacterial sulfotransferase (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that a direct sulfuryl transfer might also have taken place in the case of AUS1, as several flavonoids (e.g., quercetin and fisetin) (15) represent substrates for PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, the preparation of samples of crude extracts (without the use of ammonium sulfate) from petals of C. grandiflora, suitable for analysis by HPLCESIMS, failed due to the extremely high amount of pigments and polyphenols that interfere with performed SDS/PAGE analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the development of effective tyrosinase inhibitors has become increasingly important in the cosmetic, medicinal, and agricultural industries for application as antibrowning and depigmenting agents, and the inactivation of a PPO by a sulfonated substrate would have a high impact in this field of research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Reactivity__EnzymeSubstrate_Simulations__and_Reaction_Mechanism_of_Plant_PPOs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
AUS1 is a catechol oxidase type of PPO, as no reactivity toward the common tyrosinase substrates tyramine and tyrosine was detectable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, AUS1 showed monophenolase activity toward its natural substrate isoliquiritigenin (chalcone) and the flavonol kaempferol (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar reactivity has been reported for catechol oxidase from Aspergillus oryzae (aoCO4) (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fungal PPO showed activity toward aminophenol and guaiacol but not toward tyrosine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, the definition that catechol oxidases lack the hydroxylase activity was primarily based on the acceptance of common tyrosinase substrates (e.g., p-cresol, tyrosine, tyramine) and not on the hydroxylation of their natural substrates (or at least a wider range of potential substrates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the evidenced hydroxylase activity of AUS1 and aoCO4 (40), the question arises as to whether this definition is still valid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no doubt that catechol oxidases are incapable of hydroxylating tyramine or tyrosine, however AUS1 and aoCO4 reveal that they might hydroxylate various other monophenols (e.g., their potential natural substrates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the comparison of the crystal structures of plant catechol oxidases (PDB ID codes 2P3X and 1BT3) with the structure of a plant tyrosinase (PDB ID code 5CE9) did not reveal relevant structural differences except in the potential substrate binding residues (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we identified a substrate binding residue (by performing MD simulations, discussed below) that is able to stabilize or destabilize the tyrosinase substrate tyramine within the active site of plant PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This supports the presumption that no general structural limitation regarding the hydroxylase activity of plant PPOs exists, except the prerequisite of a substrate stabilization in a way that a hydroxylation reaction can occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further investigations will be necessary to prove a putative general hydroxylase activity of PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we suggest using a substantially broader range of compounds (including the class of flavonoidse.g., chalcones, flavonols, flavanols) in activity assays for plant PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we suggest varying the conditions by adding reducing agents (to avoid polymerization or enzyme inactivation) or hydrogen peroxide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is useful not only in omitting the lag phase of the hydroxylation reaction but also in detecting hydroxylase activity toward compounds that were previously reported to be tyrosinase inhibitors but in fact are hydroxylized and oxidized by tyrosinase (41) [e.g., arbutin and isoeugenol (42), phloridzin and phloretin (43)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The very specific interactions observed during the MD simulations of AUS1 with the naturally occurring chalcones strongly support the hypothesis that the crystallized enzyme represents a specialized enzyme involved in aurone biosynthesis (15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the proposed importance of the characteristic insertion of the group 2 PPOs in substrate binding (15) is confirmed (Fig 4B and Movies S1S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although the substrates are strongly stabilized, it should be mentioned that the diphenols do not have to bind within this binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PPOs accept an enormous variety of diphenolic substrates (e.g., chlorogenic acid, 4-tert-butylcatechol, 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol), suggesting that even unspecific binding to the copper center can result in product formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from the characteristic insertion of AUS1, the involvement of several residues at the copper binding sites (Fig 4B and Fig S1) in substrate coordination will be transferrable to other plant PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It has been shown that in a bacterial tyrosinase (from Bacillus megaterium; bmTYR) the substrates bind to the CuA atom, and therefore, it was concluded that the monophenols will perform a substrate rotation during the hydroxylation reaction (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors proposed that the substrates will bind to the same copper atom in plant catechol oxidases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these assumptions, it was further concluded that the hydroxylation reaction is impossible in plant catechol oxidases, as the bulky gate residue in combination with the rigidity of the CuA site (thioether bond) will hinder the substrate rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the proposed mechanism is incompatible with the hydroxylation activity of jrTYR (34, 44) as well as the observed hydroxylation activity of AUS1, as both possess a bulky gate residue and a thioether bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, no explanation for the lack of monophenolase activity of aoCO4 toward tyrosine as a substrate (40) was given.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Naturally, classical MD simulations are not suitable to obtain information about the geometry of the substratecopper binding scenario, as they do not take into account quantum mechanical effects or the JahnTeller distortion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the strong hydrophobic interactions of the substrate with the gate residue (Phe273) and His256 direct the B-ring to the active site, where the substrates o-diphenolic oxygen atoms are almost equally positioned between both copper ions (Fig 4 B and C and Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The positions of the oxygen atoms are in a way comparable with the position of the butterfly distorted oxygen atoms of the oxy-form, demonstrating the general possibility of this coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the monophenol isoliquiritigenin is stabilized in a position that allows the hydroxylation in the ortho position to the copper-coordinating hydroxyl group (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations in combination with the detected hydroxylation activity of AUS1 (Fig S5) and jrTYR (23, 34, 45) led us to propose a novel mechanism for the hydroxylation and oxidation of phenolic substrates by plant PPOs (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this mechanism, no substrate rotation is required, as the substrate is coordinated equally to both copper ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This removes the contradiction of the previously proposed mechanisms with the experimentally proven monophenolase activities of plant PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the MD simulations of tyramine in the active site of AUS1, jrTYR, and the L244R mutant of jrTYR strongly suggest that the residue at the position of Arg257 (compare with Fig S1) is one of the key residues for the acceptance of tyramine as a substrate for plant PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the interactions will be different in fungal and bacterial PPOs, as they do not possess a bulky gate residue and the substrates are bound to the CuA atom (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, during MD simulations the classical tyrosinase substrate tyramine is destabilized in the active center of plant PPOs by an arginine in this position (AUS1, L244R mutant of jrTYR), whereas it is stabilized by a leucine in this position (jrTYR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported recently that vvCO, possessing a lysine in this position, showed weak activity toward tyrosine and tyramine, and vvCO was therefore classified as a tyrosinase (46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a comparison of the kinetic data of vvCO and jrTYR indicates that tyramine will presumably not be the natural substrate of vvCO [Km(vvCO) = 7.7 mM (46); Km(jrTYR) = 0.274 mM (23)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This example demonstrates that in the long term the classification and the nomenclature of plant PPOs will have to change to avoid misunderstandings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As a consequence of the evidenced hydroxylation activity of AUS1 toward its natural substrate in combination with the consistent proposed novel reaction mechanism, another complexion is put on the function of plant PPOs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, the role of plant PPOs has primarily been assigned to enzymatic browning reactions, with only few exceptions [e.g., aureusidin synthase (12, 13) and aurone synthase (15, 16)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we demonstrated that the monophenolase activity of plant PPOs seems to depend only on whether the monophenol can be stabilized within the active site or not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no doubt that the hydroxylase activity represents the primary functionality of tyrosinases (e.g., in the hydroxylation of tyrosine in the melanin biosynthetic pathway).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If catechol oxidases also possess hydroxylase activity, it seems reasonable that the above statement is also true for this type of enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, it could be assumed that the catechol oxidases are involved in anabolic pathways by hydroxylating theirso far unknownnatural substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it can be concluded that the identification of the few plant PPOs involved in the secondary metabolism does indeed represent just the tip of the iceberg (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There is no doubt that there will be a long interdisciplinary way to go (including metabolomics and transcriptomic and proteomic analyses) until the role of plant PPOs is clarified, particularly with regard to their complex diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The substrate binding residues (compare Fig 4 and Fig S1) around the CuA and CuB binding sites differ considerably within the family of PPOs (2, 3), indicating the occurrence of individual natural substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the upcoming challenges will be to cluster the PPOs according to their substrate binding residues, to identify the potential natural substrates (or substrate scaffolds), and to validate the involvement of the corresponding PPOs in the plants secondary metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Protein_Purification__Crystallization__Data_Collection__Structure_Determination__and_Refinement  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The protein purification of active and latent AUS1 from petals of C. grandiflora is described in Molitor et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (15), and the purification of recombinantly expressed AUS1 is described in Kaintz et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystallization of the obtained enzyme samples and the data collection, using synchrotron radiation, of the obtained crystals have been described in Molitor et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding data collections of the presented crystal structures were performed using synchrotron radiation at 100 K (PDB ID code 4Z0YP14, PETRA III, EMBL, DESY;  = 1.23953 Å; PDB ID code 4Z0ZI04-1, DIAMOND;  = 0.9173 Å; PDB 4Z11ID23-1, ESRF;  = 0.972499 Å; PDB 4Z12P11, PETRA III, DESY;  = 1.0247 Å; PDB 4Z13I04-1, DIAMOND;  = 0.9173 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Automated refinements of all models (obtained as described below) were performed by phenix.refine from the PHENIX suite (47) followed by manual structure completion and correction using COOT (48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Initial phases for the active AUS1 form (space group P212121) were obtained by molecular replacement using the BALBES webserver (49), which used the crystal structure of catechol oxidase from I. batatas (PDB ID code 1BT3, sequence identity 47%) as a search model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The refined structure of AUS1 was then used as a search model for structure determination of the remaining obtained datasets by molecular replacement using PHASER (MR) from the PHENIX program suite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of the latent AUS1 form was obtained by automated model building using AUTOBUILD from the PHENIX suite, after placing the refined catalytically active main core with PHASER (MR) in the asymmetric unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Restraints for the polyoxometalate hexatungstotellurate (VI), used as a cocrystallization agent for recombinantly expressed AUS1 (24, 50), were obtained with phenix.reel and phenix.elbow as previously reported (27, 51, 52) using the crystal structure of hexatungstotellurate (VI) (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quality of the models was validated by MOLPROBITY (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All models were refined to excellent stereochemistry without any Ramachandran outliers, and the respective refinement statistics are presented in Tables S1 and S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The models were deposited in the PDB (www.rcsb.org) as ID codes 4Z0Y, 4Z0Z, 4Z11, 4Z12, and 4Z13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Protein_Digestion_and_HPLCESIMS_Measurements_of_Inactive_AUS1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The experiments were performed by the company Proteome Factory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein sample was denatured by incubation in 8 M urea for 30 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reduction, a final concentration of 5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was added, followed by incubation for 20 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 10 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After incubation for another 20 min in the dark, the samples were diluted to 0.8 M urea and subsequently digested by two endoproteases (trypsin and AspN) with an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:50 (wt/wt) according to the Proteome Factorys protein digestion standard operating procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acidified peptide populations were applied to nanoLCESIMS (LTQ-FT, Thermo Finnigan) analyses using a 60-min nanoLC gradient (Agilent 1100 nanoLC system) with solvent A [0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid in 5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile] and solvent B [0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid in 99.9% acetonitrile].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mass accuracy was better than 3 ppm for MS data and ±0.02 Da for MS2 data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MS2 data analyses were done using MASCOT (Matrix Science), whereas the MS data were analyzed using Qualbrowser (Thermo Finnigan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The induced modification carbamidomethylation (C) was allowed during MS2 data searches, along with possible modifications such as oxidation (M), deamidation (NQ), and phosphorylation/sulfation (H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precursor showing the predicted modification and a strong neutral loss signal was subject to dedicated MS3 experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_Docking_and_MD_Simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The structures of active AUS1 (PDB ID code 4Z0Y) and jrTYR (PDB ID code 5CE9) were prepared for molecular docking studies and MD simulations by the addition of missing side chain atoms using COOT and the removal of the residual C-terminal peptide of AUS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular docking of butein was performed with AutoDock VINA (55) by the use of the deoxy-form of active AUS1 and setting the gate residue PHE273 as a flexible residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The search exhaustiveness was set to the maximal value of 2,000 (default 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MD simulations of obtained enzymesubstrate complexes were performed with GROMACS (56) version 4.6.7 package applying the AMBER99SB force field (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ligand topologies were generated using the SWISSPARAM webserver (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RESP (restrained electrostatic potential) charges were obtained from the RED webserver (59) by applying the HF/631G* level of theory (Gaussian09) to calculate the electrostatic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the simulation of o-diphenols in complex with AUS1, the met-form was used and new residues were defined for the copper atoms, the copper-coordinating histidines, and the thioether forming cysteine, according to Bochot et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the simulation of monophenols in complex with AUS1, the oxy-form was used and parameters of the dinuclear copper site were adopted from Deeth and Diedrich (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteinligand complex was solvated in a dodecahedral box (10 Å edge distance) of TIP3PBOX water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge of the system was neutralized by replacing water molecules by the respective number of sodium ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy minimization was performed with the steepest step algorithm with a maximum of 3,000 steps and an energy tolerance of 1,000 kJmol1nm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After convergence, the system was equilibrated in two phases: NVT ensemble (isothermal-isochoric: constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) and NPT ensemble (isothermal-isobaric: constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature), each for 100 ps at 300 K. MD simulations were carried out by applying periodic boundary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LINCS (Linear Constraint Solver) algorithm was used to constrain all bond lengths, and the particle-mesh Ewald method was used to calculate long-range electrostatic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Berendsen coupling algorithm was used for temperature, and the ParrinelloRahman coupling algorithm was used for pressure control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the two equilibration runs, a 5-ns simulation was carried out with, unless otherwise stated, no position restraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Structural_Analysis_and_Graphical_Presentation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The quaternary structure of the obtained crystal structures was analyzed with PISA (Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies) (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein interfaces and ligand interactions were analyzed and visualized with LigPlot+ (61) and PLIP (ProteinLigand Interaction Profiler) (62).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular graphic images and movies were generated with PyMOL (www.pymol.org/) and VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) (63), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary structure features were assigned using DSSP (Dictionary of Secondary Structures of Proteins) (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
