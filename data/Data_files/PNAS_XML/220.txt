Dietary options and behavior suggested by plant biomarker evidence in an early human habitat  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Humans evolved in response to the availability of plant and water resources over space and through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their influence on our species evolution is debated, though, because archives of their spatial distribution are scarce at early human (hominin) localities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meter-scale vegetation patterns are revealed from sedimentary plant biomarkers across an archaeological horizon at Olduvai Gorge (FLK Zinj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biomarkers evince a varied local landscape with a woodland patch near a small freshwater wetland, surrounded by an open grassland landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biomarkers from the wetland indicate diverse edible plants near potable water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coexistence of butchered large animal bones and hominin remains, including juveniles, within an isolated biomarker-delineated wooded microhabitat at FLK Zinj provide support for early provisioning behaviors by our ancestors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The availability of plants and freshwater shapes the diets and social behavior of chimpanzees, our closest living relative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, limited evidence about the spatial relationships shared between ancestral human (hominin) remains, edible resources, refuge, and freshwater leaves the influence of local resources on our species evolution open to debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exceptionally well-preserved organic geochemical fossilsbiomarkerspreserved in a soil horizon resolve different plant communities at meter scales across a contiguous 25,000 m2 archaeological land surface at Olduvai Gorge from about 2 Ma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biomarkers reveal hominins had access to aquatic plants and protective woods in a patchwork landscape, which included a spring-fed wetland near a woodland that both were surrounded by open grassland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous cut-marked animal bones are located within the wooded area, and within meters of wetland vegetation delineated by biomarkers for ferns and sedges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, plant biomarkers, clustered bone debris, and hominin remains define a clear spatial pattern that places animal butchery amid the refuge of an isolated forest patch and near freshwater with diverse edible resources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

SI_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sedge_Alkylresorcinols  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Resorcinolic compounds have been isolated from plants, algae, and bacteria (47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Odd-numbered long-chained 5-n-alkylresorcinol homologs are characteristic of the monocotyledonous plant (sub)families Pooideae and Cyperaceae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In eastern Africa, extant genera of Pooideae are limited to high-altitude environments [2,000 m (48)], well above the mean elevation of Olduvai Gorge (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1,450 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, extant genera of Cyperaceae are quite cosmopolitan, occurring in wetlands and seasonal floodplains from sea level to about 2,000 m (48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tropical Africa contains around 1,400 Cyperaceae species, of which 50% occur in just two genera: Cyperus and Carex (5054).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent DNA data suggest that C4 Cyperus form a monophyletic clade nested within Cyperus sensu stricto (53, 54) and comprise nine segregate genera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with earlier descriptive studies about the resorcinolic compounds of C4 Cyperus sedges (e.g., Cyperus longus) in northern and East Africa (55, 56), our new analyses of Cyperus papyrus (Fig S2) suggest that 5-n-alkylresorcinols with saturated C19C25 side chains occur in Cyperus sections of Rotundi Clarke and Papyrus (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier studies also indicate alkylresorcinols occur in taxa of the Cyperus segregate, Pycreus sedges (51, 55, 57) across northeast Africa (58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, nR23 13C values for C. papyrus are much higher [21.5 ± 0.5 (n = 3)] than measured at FLK Zinj (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cyperus and Pycreus (54) are within the cardinal tribe Cypereae, which is one of two major clades of the subfamily Cyperoideae (Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other major clade of this subfamily possesses cardinal tribes called Cariceae and Scirpeae (50, 53), which include widespread African sedges of the genera Carex and Eriophorum (58), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found Carex trisperma contains significant nR23 with low 13C values [29.6 ± 1.1 (n = 4)], and this corroborates earlier data for cosmopolitan species of Carex and Eriophorum (38, 59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, 5-n-alkylresorcinols with saturated C19C25 side chains occur in (sub)tropical tribes of Cyperoideae that include C4 and C3 clades (53, 54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Fern_Alkyldiols  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Midchain diols derive from a variety of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial photosynthetic organisms (40, 61) and can preserve in sediments and soils over geologic timescales (39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, longer midchain diols occur as a series of even-numbered homologs with characteristic isomer distributions (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies identify terminal C30C32 diols with 20 hydroxyl positions (e.g., C32-diol) as diagnostic molecular constituents in ferns (39, 61), and we identified the same major homologs in paleosols around FLK Zinj (Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Strict C4 photosynthesis is not found in monilophytes [ferns (62)] or related lycophytes (63), but these common vascular cryptogams (64) often use alternative carbon-concentrating pathways [e.g., crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM)] that lead to similarly 13C-enriched lipids and biomass (30, 6570).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In subtropical Africa, ferns can show variable degrees of CAM (6971), and their associated bulk 13C values span at least 14, from C3 (34) to more C4-like (20) signatures (39, 7173).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other edible vascular cryptogams with CAM [e.g., Isoëtes sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (14, 65)] likewise are common in seasonal freshwater semiaquatic environments across southern and East Africa (64, 74) and have even more 13C-enriched C4-like signatures (30, 65, 70, 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Sedimentation_and_Landscape_Relief_During_Paleosol_Formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recent landscape reconstructions disagree on interpreted sediment facies and stratigraphic correlations around FLK Zinj (see refs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1821).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences largely reflect different interpretations of the origin of local topographic relief.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we adopt the approach of Uribelarrea et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (21), which links sediment facies analyses with geomorphic models (Fig S4) for stratigraphic correlations and landscape reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative model that FLK Zinj was developed by gradational fluvial incision or surface erosion (20) is not supported by this approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, cumulative evidence suggests low-energy processes dominated during sediment deposition at FLK Zinj and that a paleosol surface developed during lake regression from tuffaceous clays and was catastrophically overlain with volcanic ash [Tuff IC (21)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The exact timespan represented by paleosols around FLK Zinj is debated but constrained by high-precision radiometric ages and taphonomic data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Tuff IC lies about 100 cm above Tuff IB, they have indistinguishable argonargon ages of 1.848 ± 0.008 Ma and 1.848 ± 0.003 Ma (23), which set the maximum duration of this entire sequence at 0.011 Ma (75).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taphonomic studies indicate archaeological materials at FLK Zinj accumulated during a time window with a duration that was somewhere between several successive seasons up to a century (4, 1820, 76, 77).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These short durations are estimated from an accumulation span of 50100 y derived from the sedimentation rate (0.10.4 mmy1) during paleosol formation at FLK Zinj (75, 78), the ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50-y residence time of organic carbon in modern (sub)tropic surface soil horizons [010 cm (6, 7981)], and our average sample depth resolution (020 mm underneath Tuff IC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Prior_Constraints_on_P_boisei_Dietary_Behavior  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Nonspecific plant and animal fossils complement plant biomarker signatures to provide heuristic constraints on the local distributions and availability of food resources around FLK Zinj.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scattered leaf impressions bearing parallel longitudinal striations occur at southern FLKNN and FLKN (19, 20, 82) alongside Heterocephalus [African mole-rat (83)] fossils (18, 76) and corroborate plant biomarker signatures in suggesting that C3 graminoids [e.g., Typha (19, 82)] were locally abundant around FLK Zinj (Fig 2 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, silicified culms in sediments underlying FLK Zinj (17, 82) resemble the edible USOs (e.g., corms) of African cryptogams [e.g., Isoëtes (84, 85)], which often show lower 13C values due to C3C4 intermediate photosynthesis (30, 65, 69, 70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proximate playa lakeshore vegetation was an unlikely source for edible C4 grasses and sedges, because saline-alkaline water bodies [e.g., paleolake Olduvai (18)] are characteristically devoid of aquatic and emergent C4 macrophytes (86).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Dietary behavior in P. boisei is further informed by enamel 13C values for contemporaneous animals in eastern and southern Africa during the early Pleistocene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enamel 13C values of P. boisei are markedly high relative to modern and fossil Heterocephalus species with specialized USO-rich diets (87), suggesting limited USO consumption by P. boisei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides, most wild USOs are innutritious without extensive extraoral processing or roasting (88).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, P. boisei shows enamel 13C values intermediate between fossil Hippopotamus (hippos) and Phacochoerus (pigs) in eastern Africa (24, 89).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on combined isotopic (89) and craniodental (24) evidence from individual fossils at Olduvai Gorge, both taxa consumed tough browse-graze vegetation (90) such as ferns (9194), suggesting similar dietary and characteristics for P. boisei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant_Biomarker_Extraction_and_Isolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Freeze-dried and powdered paleosol samples (1020 g dry weight, n = 71) were extracted by accelerated solvent extraction (Dionex ASE 200 system) with 90:10 dichloromethane (DCM) to methanol by volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total lipid extracts were separated into fractions over activated silica gel by elution with hexane (apolar), DCM, and methanol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apolar fractions were further separated over silver-impregnated alumina by elution with hexane (saturated apolar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, n-alkanes were separated from saturated apolar fractions by zeolitic (5 Å) sieve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once extracted, residual paleosols were oxidized under alkaline conditions and acidified with hydrochloric acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lignin phenols were recovered by liquid extraction with diethyl ether.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional details are provided in SI Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_and_Isotopic_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Molecular signatures were characterized by GC-MS (SI Materials and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polar fractions and lignin phenols were derivatized with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoracetamide (BSTFA) in pyridine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotopic signatures were characterized by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope-ratio monitoring mass spectrometry and expressed in standard permil () notation relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB):13C=1,000(Rsample/Rstandard1),R=C13/C12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


SI_Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant_Biomarker_Extraction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Freeze-dried and powdered paleosols (2040 g) were extracted by accelerated solvent extraction (Dionex ASE 200 system) with DCM and methanol (90:10 by volume) in three cycles of 5 min at 100 °C and 1,500 psi (10.3 MPa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, extracted paleosols were oxidized under alkaline conditions with cupric oxide at 155 °C for 180 min in stainless steel pressure vessels (36) and then acidified with hydrochloric acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxidation products (lignin phenols) were recovered by extraction with diethylether (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Lipid_Biomarker_Isolation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Total lipid extracts were separated into apolar (hydrocarbon), intermediate-polarity, and polar fractions over activated silica gel by elution with hexane, DCM, and methanol, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrocarbons were separated further into saturated and unsaturated fractions over activated silver-impregnated (5% by weight) silica gel by elution with hexane and DCM, respectively (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, saturated hydrocarbons were separated further into unbranched (n-alkanes) and branched fractions via a zeolitic (5 Å) sieve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Plant biomarkers were characterized by GC-MS with a Hewlett-Packard 6890 series GC and Hewlett-Packard 5973 mass selective detector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were injected in splitless mode onto a 60-m DB5 fused-silica column (0.32 mm × 0.25 µm) via a Hewlett-Packard 7683 series autosampler.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GC temperature was programmed to 60 °C for 1 min then ramped to 320 °C at 6 °Cmin1 and held at final temperature for 20 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injector and detector temperatures were held at 320 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functionalized biomarkers were derivatized with BSTFA and detected as trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives, and 5-n-alkylresorcinols were identified based on characteristic mass spectral fragment ions at m/z 268 (base peak) and m/z 281 (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Midchain (1,20) diols were identified based on m/z 369 (base peak) and m/z 359 (39, 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Isotopic_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Isotopic signatures were characterized by gas chromatography-combustion-isotope-ratio monitoring mass spectrometry with a Varian 3400 model GC connected to a Thermo MAT 252.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were injected in splitless mode onto a 60-m DB5 fused-silica column (0.32 mm × 0.25 µm) before combustion over nickel and platinum wire with oxygen in helium at 1,000 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values were determined relative to reference gas calibrated to VPDB and expressed in permil () units:13C=1,000(Rsample/Rstandard1),R=C13/C12.Within-run precision (1) and accuracy were determined by coinjected internal standards and are equal, respectively, to 0.14 and 0.09 (n-alkanes, n = 136), to 0.49 and 0.17 (diols; n = 48), and to 0.66 and 0.21 (lignin phenols; n = 40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lignin phenol 13C values are reported for vanillic, syringic, and p-coumaric acids (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alcoholic and acidic functional groups of lignin phenols were derivatized using BSTFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotopic corrections for carbons added by BSTFA were made via measurements of the 13C of benzene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid [commonly called phthalic acid (Schimmelmann standards)] after derivatization and then correcting for the mass-balanced 13C value of derivative carbon (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Spatial_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paleosol excavations were referenced to concentric (5 m) quadrats after geometric correction (0.42°) for tectonic deformation and sediment compaction (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach accounts for uneven spatial distributions in point density (41), enabling accurate distance representations in 2D interpolations (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because plant biomarker reconstructions represent the sum of complex biogeochemical processes across space (9), we use a data-based (deterministic) spatial model based on inverse distance-weighted interpolations of all points within a fixed radius (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on combined theory (43) and modern observation (4345), we calibrate our model with a 15-m radius to account for spatial autocorrelation in standing biomass over scales of soil organic matter accumulation (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We converted spatially explicit point interpolations into probability surfaces assuming a unimodal (Gaussian) distribution (9, 41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Derivative kernel density maps accurately represent primary spatial patterns (46) and facilitate comparison between diverse datasets with dissimilar resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
