An inclusive Research Education Community (iREC): Impact of the SEA-PHAGES program on research outcomes and student learning  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The Science Education AlliancePhage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science program is an inclusive Research Education Community with centralized programmatic and scientific support, in which broad student engagement in authentic science is linked to increased accessibility to research experiences for students; increased persistence of these students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and increased scientific productivity for students and faculty alike.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Engaging undergraduate students in scientific research promises substantial benefits, but it is not accessible to all students and is rarely implemented early in college education, when it will have the greatest impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An inclusive Research Education Community (iREC) provides a centralized scientific and administrative infrastructure enabling engagement of large numbers of students at different types of institutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Science Education AlliancePhage Hunters Advancing Genomics and Evolutionary Science (SEA-PHAGES) is an iREC that promotes engagement and continued involvement in science among beginning undergraduate students.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEA-PHAGES students show strong gains correlated with persistence relative to those in traditional laboratory courses regardless of academic, ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This persistent involvement in science is reflected in key measures, including project ownership, scientific community values, science identity, and scientific networking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

SEA-PHAGES_Program_Infrastructure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The SEA-PHAGES program seeks to understand viral diversity and evolution taught as a two-term laboratory course research experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first term is focused on bacteriophage isolation, purification, and DNA purification, and the second term focuses on genome annotation and bioinformatic analyses of the isolated phages (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the phage population is vast, dynamic, old, and consequently, enormously diverse (16, 17), the probability that a student will isolate a phage with a new genome or with previously unidentified genes is high (18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When coupled with the technical simplicity of phage isolation, rapid and cheap sequencing capabilities, and powerful bioinformatic tools, SEA-PHAGES presents an accessible and discovery-rich research experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Programmatic support and scientific support are critical for success of an iREC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEA-PHAGES program elements include the development and publication of detailed experimental protocols, two 1-wk faculty training workshops in (i) phage discovery and (ii) bioinformatics, curated databases of students results, archiving of collected bacteriophages, continuous system-wide assessment, scientific exchange in online forums, and an annual symposium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the SEA-PHAGES faculty meet in a biennial faculty retreat, and faculty also participate in advanced genome annotation workshops.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Science Education Alliance faculty teams contribute to quality control of both sequence data and genome annotation (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two databases facilitate coordination of the scientific and programmatic data (phagesdb.org and https://seaphages.org, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because of the potential complexity of SEA-PHAGES, we used systems-level methods (20, 21) to construct a detailed pathway map (Fig 2 and SI Appendix, Fig S1) that relates program activities to short-, medium- and long-term outcomes in SEA-PHAGES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full model (SI Appendix, Fig S1) captures all of the program elements and how they connect to outcomes, and a modest subset illustrates the pathways linking course design with student persistence (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is helpful for facilitating program development, designing additional iRECs, and providing a framework for assessment strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SEA-PHAGES_Program_Scale_and_Costs  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The initial investment in iREC administrative and programmatic structure facilitates program growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEA-PHAGES program has grown by addition of 725 institutions each year, and over its 9-y development, it now includes over 100 institutions (Fig 3A and SI Appendix, Table S1), spanning R1 universities to community colleges (Fig 3B and SI Appendix, Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 104 schools joining in the first 8 y showed a strong propensity to continue for multiple years in the program, and the probabilities for remaining after 3, 4, or 5 y are 97, 89, and 87%, respectively; continuation rates are not significantly different for schools joining in different years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The massively parallel approach enabled inclusion of over 4,000 students in academic year 20162017 (16,300 total over 9 y) (Fig 3A), 80% of whom were in their first or second year of study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although scalability of undergraduate research programs often presents substantial challenges (1), an iREC promotes cost efficiencies, because the program administration expenditures are nearly independent of the number of students involved; thus, as the number of participating institutions increases, the cost per student decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the SEA-PHAGES program, the current administrative costs per student ($500, encompassing all of the support items in Fig 1) are 33% lower than 2 y previously, and additional program growth will extend the cost-effectiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low per student cost enables the iREC to be delivered to large numbers of students early in their undergraduate careers, thus encouraging students to explore science in a relatively low-risk gateway experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iREC can introduce the student to research at a better time and at a much lower cost than the more traditional ARE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For those students who find research to be something that they want to explore further, the iREC can provide a stepping stone to subsequent AREs and should facilitate a more productive research experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the instructional and material costs at SEA-PHAGES participating institutions are greater than for traditional laboratories but are commensurate with other CREs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SEA-PHAGES_Research_Productivity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The authenticity of the research conducted in an iREC is critically important, not only for addressing scientific questions but because it also influences the cognitive experiences of student participants (22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the SEA-PHAGES program, research productivity is reflected in the numbers of phages isolated (10,000 in total) (Fig 3C) and sequenced (1,400) (Fig 3C), representing substantial proportions of the total numbers of all phages isolated and sequenced to date (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are reported in over 70 peer-reviewed publications (Fig 3 D and E and SI Appendix, Table S2) (including 40 short Genome Announcement papers), many with student and SEA-PHAGES faculty coauthors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The availability of archived and sequenced phages for experimental manipulation by the scientific community at large provides a valuable resource for gaining insights into bacteriophage biology (24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This research productivity compares favorably with that of one to two NIH R01 grants (26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Impact_of_SEA-PHAGES_on_Student_Intention_to_Persist_in_STEM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A key iREC educational goal is for students to share the experience of the professional research scientist, including the thrill of discovery, collaboration within a community, and advancing scientific knowledge relevant to the broader community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These psychosocial elements are strongly linked to educational persistence (2831) and benefit all students, regardless of their intended area of study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the psychometric Persistence in the Sciences (PITS) assessment tool (28), we compared 2,850 students taking either SEA-PHAGES or nonresearch traditional laboratory courses at a total of 67 institutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PITS encompasses five survey components: project ownership (with content and emotion categories), self-efficacy, science identity, scientific community values, and networking, each measuring psychological components that correlate strongly with a students intention to continue in science (22, 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also collected information on academic performance, socioeconomic status, and other demographics (SI Appendix).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To separate the influence of the type of course taken from other variables, including the possibility of student self-selection of SEA-PHAGES or traditional laboratories, we used propensity score matching (32) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed large and significant differences in five of six categories (all except self-efficacy, which assesses students confidence in their abilities to function as scientists) (Fig 4A), reflecting substantial gains by SEA-PHAGES students.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the measures used, self-efficacy is the one most closely related to the primary goals of the typical nonresearch traditional laboratory, which are to develop confidence in laboratory procedures and skills.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall pattern of the PITS measures shows significant increases in multiple aspects of the research experience (project ownership, science identity, science community values, and networking) but little difference in student confidence in laboratory procedures and skills (i.e., self-efficacy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the experiments in SEA-PHAGES have greater uncertainty and are directed by the necessities of authentic science, it is reassuring that we did not observe a reduction in self-efficacy compared with traditional laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEA-PHAGES and traditional laboratories both encourage student development of procedural confidence, but SEA-PHAGES adds an authentic research experience that promotes continued engagement in science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because students were not randomly assigned at all 67 institutions, it is plausible that the SEA-PHAGES courses could be disproportionately populated with students interested in pursuing science.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we compared students declaring the highest possible intent to stay in science and observed similarly strong gains by SEA-PHAGES students (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surprisingly low scorescorrelating with poor persistence (28)from students with high intent to study science who are taking traditional nonresearch laboratory courses resonate with national concerns about science education (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple interpretation is that students keen on pursuing science interests were discouraged by their experiences in traditional laboratory courses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

iREC_Inclusion_Promotes_Broad_Student_Success  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To examine the inclusive nature of the iREC, we compared student cohorts known to have poor science persistence early in college careers (33, 34), particularly first generation college students (Fig 4C), women (Fig 4D), underrepresented minorities (Fig 4E), and underrepresented men (Fig 4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The broadly shared gains by SEA-PHAGES students strongly support the conclusion that the iREC model provides authentic research experiences (Fig 4 CE) to all students with similar advantages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that student responses are similar for different types of institutions (Fig 5A)with small additional project ownership gains at community colleges relative to other schoolsand we hypothesize that the supportive iREC programmatic structure (Fig 1) facilitates success at institutions, such as community colleges, that typically do not have robust investigator-driven research activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Students with different socioeconomic backgrounds (Fig 5B), academic performance (Fig 5C), gender (Fig 5D), and ethnicity (Fig 5E) also score similarly, reinforcing the inclusive nature of the iREC as exemplified by the SEA-PHAGES program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, to confirm that students reliably self-report their intention to persist in the sciences, we measured the average numbers of science courses taken by subsets of students in each of the three subsequent terms after their introductory laboratory course (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEA-PHAGES students enrolled in a consistently higher number of science courses than students taking traditional laboratory courses (Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We have described here the iREC model for promoting student persistence in STEM education.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The iREC, as illustrated by SEA-PHAGES, focuses on scientific discovery within a community accessible by early career undergraduate students and a centralized administrative structure that supports a broad range of institutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it enables student development regardless of demographic or academic background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the iREC concept could have a transformative impact on science education when expanded to include additional research topics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We encourage research institutions to design and implement additional iREC programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We emphasize that the authenticity of iREC research topics is important, not only for promoting student engagement through project ownership but also for program sustainability and acquiring financial support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Several important questions arise regarding SEA-PHAGES program implementation and iREC development in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the SEA-PHAGES program spans experimental approaches, including microbiology, molecular biology, imaging, and computational biology, and the contributions of each of these elements to student persistence are unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as yet, we know little of how the iREC experience influences students choices in enrolling for other STEM courses and laboratories or in pursuing other research experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also do not know how the SEA-PHAGES experience influences student career choices after graduation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because early career students succeed in SEA-PHAGES, regardless of background or experience, we predict that the benefit of experiencing the process of discoveryvs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  the unfortunately too frequent imposition of exercises for which the right answers are already knownwill be broadly accrued by all students, including those who sample science via this iREC but who choose to pursue nonscience careers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Layering iREC experiences through different levels of the undergraduate curriculum could multiply their impacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although the initial costs of establishing an iREC administrative structure can be substantial, they can be considerably less so if built on an extant independently funded research program.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After it is operational, the program structure can support rapid expansion of the numbers of institutions and student participants, thereby substantially reducing the costs/student.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defining the SEA-PHAGES programmatic structure (Fig 1), analyzing the relationships among its component elements (Fig 2), and documenting the research and educational outcomes (Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35) provide a path for future iREC development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Widespread use of this model has the potential to drive a major transformation of undergraduate science education.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Materials_and_Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The pathway model was constructed using previously described approaches (20), and detailed methods are described in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Program assessment used the PITS survey tool and comprised five existing survey tools covering project ownership, self-efficacy, science identity, scientific community values, and networking, all of which measure different psychological components of a research experience and have individually been used in a range of investigations of educational programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before usage in this data collection process, the PITS survey was evaluated for its dimensionality, validity, and internal consistency (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tool underwent psychometric evaluation and has been validated for usage in the assessment of research experiences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the survey cohorts, data, and statistical analyses are described in detail in SI Appendix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was approved and supervised by the Institutional Review Board of the Indiana University of Pennsylvania (14-302) and the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (PRO14100567 and PRO15030412).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
