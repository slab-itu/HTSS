Experimental evidence that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient charge transport in conjugated polymers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding the nature of charge transport and its limitations has guided the rational design of organic semiconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research has mainly focused on increasing the crystallinity of conjugated polymers as a strategy to improve the long-range charge transport properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that local aggregation over very few chains is a sufficient mesoscopic structure to ensure high mobility, with charge transport mainly occurring along the polymer backbones, and that extended crystallinity is not necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide an explanation for the high mobilities observed in seemingly disordered polymers and set molecular-design guidelines for next-generation conjugated polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Efficiency, current throughput, and speed of electronic devices are to a great extent dictated by charge carrier mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classic approach to impart high carrier mobility to polymeric semiconductors has often relied on the assumption that extensive order and crystallinity are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, however, this assumption has been challenged, because high mobility has been reported for semiconducting polymers that exhibit a surprisingly low degree of order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that semiconducting polymers can be confined into weakly ordered fibers within an inert polymer matrix without affecting their charge transport properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these conditions, the semiconducting polymer chains are inhibited from attaining long-range order in the -stacking or alkyl-stacking directions, as demonstrated from the absence of significant X-ray diffraction intensity corresponding to these crystallographic directions, yet still remain extended along the backbone direction and aggregate on a local length scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the polymer films maintain high mobility even at very low concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide a simple picture that clarifies the role of local order and connectivity of domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Chemical structures of (A) P(NDI2OD-T2) and (B) PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Results_and_Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To study the microstructure of the P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS thin films, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction was performed on a series of blends, composed of 0% to 100% P(NDI2OD-T2) in PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characteristic diffraction peaks corresponding to the alkyl-stacking (h00), -stacking (0k0), and chain backbone (00l) directions were observed in neat films of P(NDI2OD-T2), and two broad rings were observed in disordered PS films (Fig 1 and Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thin films composed of both polymers showed diffraction features characteristic of each component, respectively, and the crystalline texture of the P(NDI2OD-T2) remained unchanged for all blend ratios (Fig S2), results that are also consistent with a vertical phase separation (discussed below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To track the order along the various crystallographic directions as a function of the blend ratio, the integrated intensities of peaks corresponding to each direction were measured and then normalized by the exposure time and volume of P(NDI2OD-T2) in the film (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized alkyl- and -stacking intensities drop off significantly below a P(NDI2OD-T2) concentration of 40%, to finally completely disappear in films below 5% P(NDI2OD-T2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A concurrent decrease in the coherence length (Table 1) is also observed for these two stacking directions, indicating that packing between chains is perturbed as the fraction of P(NDI2OD-T2) in the film is decreased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In a remarkable contrast, normalized diffraction intensities arising from the chain backbone remain constant across all blend films, even down to concentrations as low as 1% P(NDI2OD-T2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the coherence length in the chain backbone direction does not change as a function of P(NDI2OD-T2) content (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that although long-range packing of the chains is severely disrupted when the thickness of the P(NDI2OD-T2) layer drops below 10 nm, the relatively rigid P(NDI2OD-T2) chains are still quite extended even in films containing only 1% semiconducting polymer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although X-ray results indicate that long-range intermolecular packing is severely disrupted as the P(NDI2OD-T2) content of the blends is reduced, the optical absorption spectra of P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS thin films show the clear presence of aggregation (short-range intermolecular packing) all of the way down to 1% P(NDI2OD-T2) (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P(NDI2OD-T2) has a strong tendency to preaggregate in low-polar solvents, even at low concentrations (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to what is observed in neat P(NDI2OD-T2) films, aggregation is strongly promoted also for the blends with the formation of aggregate species, exhibiting a main absorption band at 710 nm and a shoulder at 790 nm (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structured low-energy absorption represents a clear spectroscopic fingerprint of the formation of aggregate species and was attributed to the interaction of chain segments (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical characteristics of nonaggregate chains are observed only when solvent molecules with large and highly polarizable aromatic cores such as chloronaphthalene are used to dissolve the polymer, resulting in unstructured absorption centered at 620 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that here we have processed the blends from 1,2-dichlorobenzene, a solvent that is known to induce a high degree of preaggregation in the films [35% of the P(NDI2OD-T2) total mass] (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Density functional theory calculations on the optimized structures revealed that this red shift upon aggregation originates mainly from a change in the backbone conformation induced by interchain interactions (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The persistence in our X-ray measurements of the backbone 001 peaks strongly suggests that the on-chain microstructure of the aggregates is preserved and only the interchain packing is disrupted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, by comparing the intensities of the 001 and 002 diffraction peaks, it seems that the 001 peak is always more intense than the 002, suggesting that these aggregates consist mainly of chains with a segregated structure where the donor (acceptor) units stack on top of each other (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mixed structures with donor units stacking on top of acceptor units of adjacent chains would in fact exhibit a suppressed 001 diffraction (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Neher and coworkers (24) also observed a strict linear correlation between the (001) coherence length associated with the average length of straight-chain segments and the degree of aggregation originating from the planarization of the P(NDI2OD-T2) backbone upon interchain interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation exists because interchain interactions enforce a linear chain conformation, thus extending the conjugation length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we observed that diluted and neat P(NDI2OD-T2) film show the same degree of aggregation as indicated by a nearly identical low-energy vibronic progression (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In view of the fact that the low-energy band ascribed to aggregates is determined by the length of straight chain segments, the observed correlation demonstrates that the single-chain conformation of P(NDI2OD-T2) in both concentrated and dilute films is similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is also corroborated by a nearly constant backbone (001) coherence length observed in our case when going from 100% down to 1% P(NDI2OD-T2) films (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This apparent contradiction between the X-ray and optical results is reconciled by the fact that X-ray diffraction relies on constructive interference arising from multiple repeat units in a particular crystallographic direction, whereas aggregate absorption features due to intermolecular interactions can result from aggregates comprising as few as two chains (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although long-range crystallinity is disrupted in films including diluted contents of P(NDI2OD-T2), chains are still able to aggregate into local domains, such that they exhibit optical features due to aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the diluted P(NDI2OD-T2) film can exhibit the X-ray diffraction of a highly disordered material and yet retain virtually the same local aggregation characteristics of a crystalline neat conjugated polymer film, thereby demonstrating the relative importance of short- and long-range order in microstructure characterization and transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) allows for a closer view of the top layer morphology for the different P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS ratios (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although no obvious features can be observed in the height images (Fig S3), phase-separated structures composed of P(NDI2OD-T2) and PS can be clearly identified in the phase images down to 1% P(NDI2OD-T2) content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS blends spin-coated on SiO2, most of the P(NDI2OD-T2) is accumulated at the topmost part of the film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is confirmed by depth-dependent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements which show the concentrations of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur [elements found in P(NDI2OD-T2)] to be enriched near the surface of the film (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such vertical phase separation featuring a P(NDI2OD-T2)-rich top layer and a bottom interface primarily composed of PS is attributed to the different surface energies of P(NDI2OD-T2) and PS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, P(NDI2OD-T2) with a low surface energy (23.7 mJm2; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23) tends to segregate at the air/film interface, whereas PS with higher surface energy (40.2 mJm2; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27) prefers the SiO2 surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar surface-induced phase separation is typically reported for other semiconductor/insulator polymer blends (2830).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A characteristic single-phase morphology with randomly oriented crystalline grains on the order of 1030 nm is observed in neat films of P(NDI2OD-T2) (Fig 3A and Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreasing the concentration of P(NDI2OD-T2) in the blends results in extended P(NDI2OD-T2) fibers, stretching over micrometer-long distances (Fig 3 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are consistent with a similar long-range organization, with the polymer backbones extending over micrometer length-scales, which has been recently revealed for neat films of P(NDI2OD-T2) by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in agreement with the constant chain backbone coherence length observed by XRD, suggesting that P(NDI2OD-T2) chains are equally extended along the backbone/fiber direction for all blends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the exact cause of the drop in alkyl- and -stacking coherence lengths is difficult to determine, adjacent fibers that are coherent in concentrated samples may no longer be so in the dilute blends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fibers become more dispersed in lower concentration films and at a P(NDI2OD-T2) content of 1%, the AFM phase image shows poorly interconnected P(NDI2OD-T2) fibers embedded in the PS matrix (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The morphologies are isotropic over the macroscopic areas used for charge transport and XRD measurements (Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To directly assess the impact of the reported nano-/microscale morphologies on the charge transport properties of the P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS blend, we fabricated top-gate/bottom-contact OFETs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed description of the fabrication process is given in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that P(NDI2OD-T2) is a typical high-mobility n-type semiconductor with a low degree of energetic disorder (32) and both theoretical and experimental studies have shown intrinsically unbalanced electron and hole transport properties in low (i.e., diodes) and high (i.e., OFETs) charge density regimes (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when fluorinated, high-k gate polymers are used as a dielectric insulator, both electrons and holes can be accumulated in the channel, leading to balanced ambipolarity (34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dielectric used here is a 600-nm-thick poly(trifluoroethylene) (PTrFE) film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a high-k, fluorinated gate dielectric can be dissolved in solvents that are perfectly orthogonal to the underlying semiconductor/insulator polymer blend, preventing the latter from rinsing off during deposition of the dielectric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 4 shows representative transfer characteristics of a P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS OFET containing 3% P(NDI2OD-T2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transistors exhibit hysteresis-free ambipolar characteristics with a large on/off ratio of 104.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar ambipolar transfer characteristics are in fact observed for all of the P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS-based OFETs including channels of different blend ratios (Fig S6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average saturation mobility shows a maximum value for the 35% P(NDI2OD-T2) content films (average mobility 0.09 cm2V1s1 for electrons and 0.02 cm2V1s1 for holes, as extracted from the transfer characteristics at |VDS| = 60 V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured electron mobility compares favorably with previously reported P(NDI2OD-T2)-based OFETs using conventional low-k polymers as the dielectric insulator, if one takes into account the well-known lowering of charge mobility that is due to the energetic disorder induced by high-k dielectrics (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, when the low-k poly(perfluoroalkenylvinyl ether) (CYTOP) is used as the dielectric, a higher electron mobility is observed (Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that when normalized for the effective coverage of the channel, as extracted by an AFM image thresholding method, the mobility is found to be invariant regardless of the P(NDI2OD-T2) concentration (Fig 4B and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large mobility variation observed for 1% P(NDI2OD-T2) OFETs is most likely due to the poorly interconnected P(NDI2OD-T2) fibers as observed by AFM analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No charge transport was observed for 40% P(NDI2OD-T2) OFETs, most likely due to lateral phase separation of the polymer blend as observed by AFM (Fig S8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
It is noteworthy that although the X-ray results indicate that long-range intermolecular packing is severely disrupted in films of low P(NDI2OD-T2) content, the charge carrier mobility remains high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noriega et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (6) have posited that many of the newly developed donoracceptor polymers are able to maintain a high charge carrier mobility despite low levels of crystallinity, as inferred by X-ray diffraction, owing to their ability to form interconnected aggregates, which allow for efficient intermolecular charge transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the system studied here, this seems to be the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the fraction of P(NDI2OD-T2) in the film is decreased, long-range order is disrupted due to the confined nature of the semiconducting molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, P(NDI2OD-T2) chains remain extended, well connected, and are still able to locally aggregate as well as in neat films even at concentrations as low as 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these films are able to maintain a high mobility despite the lack of long-range crystallographic order.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although high-performance blends of diluted conjugated polymers with commodity polymers have been reported over the last 10 y (2830), here we make use of these blends as a tool to independently control the degree of long-range and short-range order and provide unique experimental evidence that high charge carrier mobility can be maintained despite the complete absence of long-range interchain order (i.e., well-defined XRD peaks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, our findings are in contrast with what has been previously reported for blends of insulating and semicrystalline polymers, such as for example poly(3-hexylthiophene), where a significant long-range crystallinity is still observed in the high-performing films even at low concentration of conjugated polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Having demonstrated well-balanced, high-performance ambipolar OFETs containing only 3% P(NDI2OD-T2), we fabricated complementary-like [i.e., complementary metaloxidesemiconductor (CMOS)-like] inverters as depicted in Fig S9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the inverters show an ideal switching characteristic with an inversion voltage close to half the supply voltage (VDD), that is, at  1/2VDD = 35 V, a high voltage gain of 65, and a high noise margin of 67% of the theoretical maximum value of 1/2VDD due to the balanced ambipolar transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High gains (30) are observed for inverters with just 2% P(NDI2OD-T2) in the blend (Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge these values are among the best ever reported for solution-processed organic CMOS-like inverters (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the long-range order of P(NDI2OD-T2) can be tuned without affecting the charge transport properties of this material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, we showed that when P(NDI2OD-T2) is confined within an inert polymer matrix into extremely thin layers, the long-range crystallinity (-stacking or alkyl stacking) is disrupted whereas short-range aggregation is unperturbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, P(NDI2OD-T2) chains still remain extended along the backbone direction, thus maintaining high mobilities by enabling an efficient connection between aggregates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When implemented in CMOS-like inverters, these inexpensive polymer blends yield remarkably high performances, allowing the fabrication of cheap digital logic technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide a simple picture that clarifies the role of local order and connectivity: Significantly higher carrier mobilities should be achievable through simultaneous improvements of the local aggregation and interconnectivity of domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The successful integration of these properties correlates with the remarkable transport properties of the polymer and serves as a guideline for the rational design of next-generation polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research should be shifted to the molecular level with a focus on the interchain coupling in the aggregates and/or the design of molecules that afford delocalization and minimize trapping (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Corning Eagle 2000 glass substrates were cleaned sequentially in water, acetone, and isopropanol for 10 min each, following by drying with nitrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Source-drain electrodes patterns were fabricated using a conventional evaporation procedure through metal shadow mask (channel length 30 µm, channel width 500 µm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five-nanometer-thick Ti was used as adhesion layer of the Au electrodes on glass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The semiconducting polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) (ActivInk N2200; Polyera Inc.) and PS (molecular weight 100 kDa; Aldrich) were separately dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene, both at the concentration of 8 mg/mL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS solutions were obtained by mixing the two above-mentioned solutions in volume ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before film deposition, both polymer solutions were stirred for at least 2 h to allow complete dissolution of the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After stirring, the solutions were spin-coated onto the glass substrates at 1,000 rpm for 90 s. Then, the films were thermally annealed at 120 °C under nitrogen atmosphere for 10 min and cooled down to room temperature naturally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dielectric polymer PTrFE (Solvay SA) was dissolved in acetonitrile to form a 60 mg/mL solution, then spin-coated on top of the P(NDI2OD-T2)/PS films at 2,000 rpm for 60 s. After the dielectric layers were deposited, the devices were baked at 80 °C under nitrogen atmosphere for 30 min and cooled down to room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The perfluorinated polymer CYTOP CTL-809M dielectric (Asahi Glass) was spun as received at 6,000 rpm in air, yielding a dielectric thickness of 500600 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the CYTOP deposition, the devices were annealed under nitrogen, on a hot plate, at 110 °C for 5 h. Finally, the devices were completed by evaporating a 70-nm-thick Al gate electrode through a metal shadow mask on top of the dielectric layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Thin_Film_and_OFET_Device_Characterization  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Atomic force microscopy (Nanoscope IIIa AFM; Digital Instruments) was operated in tapping mode to characterize the surface morphologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UV-absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (CARY-5000; Varian).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the OFET electrical characteristics were measured using a Keithley 4200-SCS in air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

XRD_Measurements  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All measurements were performed at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource on beamline 11-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incident X-ray beam was set at a grazing incidence (0.12°), which was chosen to be above the critical angle of the polymer film but below that of the silicon substrate, ensuring that the full thickness of the film was sampled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were kept in a helium-filled environment during the measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffraction data analysis was performed with the software WxDiff and coherence lengths were calculated using the Scherrer equation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
