Increased risk of dementia in the aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Recovery after major disaster poses potential risks of dementia for the elderly population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no previous studies have examined exposure to natural disaster and changes in risk factors as predictors of deterioration in cognitive function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prospectively examined whether housing damage and loss of relatives or friends were associated with cognitive decline in the aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, which included 3,566 survivors who are 65 y old or older, the severity of housing damage was significantly associated with cognitive decline after controlling changes of covariates and risk factors during the follow-up period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cognitive decline should be listed as a health risk of older survivors in the aftermath of natural disasters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
No previous study has been able to examine the association by taking account of risk factors for dementia before and after the disaster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prospectively examined whether experiences of a disaster were associated with cognitive decline in the aftermath of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The baseline for our natural experiment was established in a survey of older community-dwelling adults who lived 80 km west of the epicenter 7 mo before the earthquake and tsunami.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 2.5 y after the disaster, the follow-up survey gathered information about personal experiences of disaster as well as incidence of dementia from 3,594 survivors (82.1% follow-up rate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our primary outcome was dementia diagnosis ascertained by in-home assessment during the follow-up period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among our analytic sample (n = 3,566), 38.0% reported losing relatives or friends in the disaster, and 58.9% reported property damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fixed-effects regression indicated that major housing damage and home destroyed were associated with cognitive decline: regression coefficient for levels of dementia symptoms = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01 to 0.23 and coefficient = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.40, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect size of destroyed home is comparable to the impact of incident stroke (coefficient = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between housing damage and cognitive decline remained statistically significant in the instrumental variable analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Housing damage appears to be an important risk factor for cognitive decline among older survivors in natural disasters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Table 1 presents the characteristics of respondents at baseline (before the disaster) and at follow-up 2.5 y later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Females made up 56.5% of respondents, and this proportion was very close to the actual local census of older residents in Iwanuma city in October 2010 (male 42.8%, female 57.2%) (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The age distribution of our sample was close to the local census data, except for the group aged 85 y and over (respondents 6.2%, census data 13.2%) (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A somewhat higher proportion of our respondents were married (71.4%) compared with the census data (64.7%) (8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of employed individuals in our data (17.8%) was also quite close to the census data (17.2%) (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study population was less likely to be domiciled in households with four or more people compared with the census data (respondents 31.5%, census data 53.3%) (10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of individuals who were assessed to be cognitively independent was also higher in our analytic sample compared with the general older population in Iwanuma city (95.9% in our sample vs. 86.5% in the census data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences are likely a result of the fact that our sample was healthier than the general population and less likely to be living together with other caregivers (e.g., adult children).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In addition, we also compared the characteristics of our analytic sample versus nonrespondents to the follow-up survey (n = 786).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sex distribution was similar, although our analytic sample was somewhat older than the nonrespondents (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of married persons in our analytic sample (71.4%) was higher than among nonrespondents (64.9%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More respondents were likely to be used at the time of the follow-up survey (17.8%) compared with the nonrespondents (14.0%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonrespondents were also less classified as functionally independent (84.1%) compared with the analytic sample (95.9%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These comparisons support that our data almost represents whole older population in Iwanuma city (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Among the respondents, 38.0% reported losing relatives or friends in the disaster, whereas 58.9% reported personal damage to their property (see further description of property damage in Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevalence of respondents whose cognitive function was classified as nonindependent at the follow-up survey (11.5%) was three times higher than at baseline (4.1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevalence of stroke (2.8%) and hypertension (54.0%) had also increased at the follow-up survey (to 6.5% and 57.2%, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevalence of individuals who reported not interacting with their neighbors (not even greetings) nearly doubled over the 3-y follow-up (1.5 to 2.9%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of respondents with severe PTSD symptoms at follow-up was 11.4%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
As shown in Table 2, model 1 indicated that major housing damage and destroyed home was significantly associated with deterioration of dementia symptomatology: coefficient for levels of dementia symptoms (out of an eight-point scale) = 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01 to 0.23 for major damage; and coefficient = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.40, for destroyed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, loss of relatives or friends did not show a significant association with cognitive impairment (coefficient = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Model 2 added the potential mediators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of depression (coefficient = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.17) and lack of interactions with neighbors (coefficient = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.14) were significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of these mediators attenuated the relationship between levels of property damage and deterioration of dementia symptomatology (model 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most influential mediator was the new onset of depressive symptoms when we adjusted for one mediator at a time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity analyses using the result of medical examination also showed same results (Table S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Finally, we combined instrumental variable analysis with our fixed-effects approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first stage F-statistics (329.48) suggested that distance from coast is a strong instrument (Fig S1) (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual of the first-stage regression in our instrumental variable analysis is significant in the second-stage regression (P = 0.02), suggesting that housing damage is endogenous (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the inverse distance from the coast was not directly associated with cognitive decline after adjusting for all covariates (coefficient = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.17), suggesting that the exclusion restriction was met.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore used distance from the coast as a valid instrumental variable for housing damage and dementia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Table 3, our instrumental variable analysis also suggests that property damage is significantly associated with deterioration in dementia symptomatology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity analyses for medical examination were also showed same results (Table S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
This study demonstrates that experiences of disaster are associated with the deterioration of dementia symptomatology, controlling changes of covariates and risk factors in a natural experimental setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The associations remained after statistically controlling for observed and unobserved time-invariant personal traits as well as change of several risk factors for dementia before and after the disaster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of the associations between property damage and dementia symptoms appears to be statistically and clinically important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the impact on dementia symptoms following complete destruction of the housing (coefficient = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.40 in model 1 of Table 2) is comparable to the impact of incident stroke (coefficient = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the loss of housing is close to the 3-y decline in cognitive function in our sample (coefficient = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that the association between housing damage and cognitive decline was significant in sensitivity analysis that the outcome was the result of medical examination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the results of the instrumental variable analysis with the fixed-effect model also showed the significant association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the effect of housing damage on cognitive decline is a robust finding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous studies have hinted that experiences of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami are linked with heightened risk of cognitive decline (5, 6, 1315).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the United States, Cherry et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  showed that short-term and working-memory performance was adversely affected in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At an additional follow-up examination 614 mo after the disaster, the respondents working-memory performance had recovered from the prior survey (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Cherry et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (16, 17) did not specifically examine the effects of housing damage or other risk factors for cognitive decline predating the disaster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are plausible mechanisms linking property damage to cognitive function of older people, including: (i) new onset of depression and (ii) disruption of social contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our mediation analysis (model 3) indicated that depression and loss of interactions with neighbors partially mediated the relation between property damage and cognitive decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to experiences of property damage, the loss of relatives or friends was not significantly associated with cognitive decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also checked the endogeneity of loss of relatives or friends by using residence in the tsunami-inundated area as our instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of respondents who lost relatives or friends in the inundated area (60.9%) was approximately twice as high as those who lived in noninundated areas (33.9%), F-statistics = 19.97.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the instrumental variable analysis indicated that loss of relatives/friends was not significantly associated with cognitive decline (coefficient = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not inquire on the baseline survey about the frequency of social interactions between the survivors and the relatives/friends who were lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of them may have interacted with the survivors on a daily basis before the disaster, in which case their loss could have contributed to risk of cognitive decline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
A major strength of this study is the availability of information predating the disaster about levels of dementia symptomatology, as well as other health conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our design was therefore able to effectively address the problem of recall bias in most studies conducted in postdisaster settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second strength is the record linkage to medically verified dementia symptomatology obtained through home visits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Despite our attempts to control for major confounding factors, we cannot exclude the possibility that housing damage was endogenous; that is, people at risk for cognitive decline were also more likely to be living in vulnerable housing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, lower educational attainment and equivalent income were both correlated with severity of housing damage (Tables S6 and S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though we controlled for education and income, there may be other residual confounding factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it was important to demonstrate that the same association between property damage and dementia symptomatology was observed in our instrumental variable analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Selection bias might have arisen because of the 59% response rate to the baseline survey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this response rate is quite comparable to similar surveys involving community-dwelling residents (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we confirmed that the demographic profile of our participants is quite similar to the rest of Iwanuma residents aged 65 y or older (Table S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the response rate of our follow-up survey among survivors was quite high (82.1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the compulsory residential registration system in Japan, only 17 residents from the baseline sample could not be tracked (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated effects from the instrumental variable model were larger than the fixed-effects model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference may be because of the correction of measurement error associated with the assessment of housing damage that was obtained by self-report (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, we also note that the extent of housing damage was not just based on subjective perception, but based on two independent assessors dispatched to each damaged house.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our findings likely underestimated the impact of this large-scale disaster on the dementia risk of survivors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, even among survivors whose homes were not inundated or destroyed, they may still be at increased risk of cognitive decline because of other trauma experiences (e.g., depression).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrated that experiences of housing damage are associated with deterioration of dementia symptomatology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cognitive decline should be added to the list of health risks faced by older survivors of disaster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Study_Participants  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
JAGES is a nationwide cohort study established in 2010 to examine prospectively the predictors of healthy aging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 169,215 community-dwelling people aged 65 y or older in 31 municipalities were mailed a baseline questionnaire, and 112,123 individuals responded to the invitation (response rate 66.3%) (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
One of the field sites of the JAGES cohort is based in the city of Iwanuma (total population 44,187 in 2010) (7) in Miyagi Prefecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mailed questionnaires to all residents aged 65 y or older in August 2010 (n = 8,576), using the official residential register.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The survey inquired about personal characteristics as well as their health status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response rate was 59.0% (n = 5,058), which is comparable to other surveys of community-dwelling residents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The earthquake and tsunami occurred on March 11, 2011, 7 mo after the baseline survey was completed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iwanuma city is a coastal municipality located 80 km west of the earthquake epicenter, so that it was in the direct line of the tsunami that killed 180 residents, damaged 5,542 homes, and inundated 48% of the land area (Fig 1) (21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Approximately 2.5 y after the disaster (starting on October 2013), we conducted a follow-up survey of all survivors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The survey gathered information about personal experiences of disaster as well as updating their health status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Informed consent was obtained at the time of survey collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The respondents were then linked to the national LTCI registry, which includes information about dementia symptomatology based on in-home assessment by trained investigators (e.g., public health nurse).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The detailed flow-chart of the analytic sample is presented in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 4,380 eligible participants from the baseline survey, we managed to recontact 3,594 individuals (follow-up rate: 82.1%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analytic sample is 3,566 because of incompletely signed informed consent forms and lack of linkage to the national LTCI database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The survey protocol was reviewed and approved by the human subjects committee of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, as well as the human subjects committees of Tohoku University, Nihon Fukushi University, and Chiba University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, outside researchers can access the data of JAGES upon request, as per NIH data access policies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We would require the applicant to submit an analysis proposal that would be reviewed by an internal committee of JAGES investigators to avoid duplication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are not able to deposit our data for public sharing because the data are from an ongoing cohort study of community-dwelling individuals (a one in six sample of a midsize town), and we need to protect their confidentiality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Outcome_Variable  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our primary outcome is dementia symptomatology assessed by a standardized in-home assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Japanese government established a national LTCI scheme in 2000 (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the LTCI, a certification committee in each municipality dispatches a trained investigator to an applicants home to evaluate their eligibility for elderly care (e.g., home helpings).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
During the home visit, the individual is assessed with regard to their activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living status, cognitive function (e.g., short-term memory, orientation, and communication), as well as mental and behavioral disorders (e.g., delusions of persecution, confabulation, and soliloquy) using a standardized protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the assessment, the applicants are classified into one of eight levels according to the severity of their cognitive disability (Table S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The index of dementia symptomatology is strongly correlated with the Mini Mental State Examination (Spearmans rank correlation  = 0.73, P less_than 0.001) (23), and the level I of dementia symptomatology has been demonstrated to correspond with a 0.5 point rating on the Clinical Dementia Rating (specificity and sensitivity 0.88, respectively) (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial certification is valid for 6 mo, after which periodic reassessments are generally conducted every 12 mo (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The certified persons can require the reassessment before the expiration date, when their health status radically changes (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The certification committee also asks physicians to assess the cognitive disability level of applicants to refer an experts opinion when they decide the care level of the applicants (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medical examination is independent of the investigators in-home assessment, but we confirmed a high correlation between changes of dementia level of both assessment (Pearsons correlation  = 0.80, P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the medical examination in our sensitivity analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We linked JAGES cohort participants to the LTCI register in Iwanuma city for the follow-up period from April 1, 2010 to January 24, 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data includes the results of the initial assessment as well as subsequent reassessments for each individual.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Explanatory_Variables  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our primary exposure variable of interest is personal experiences of trauma in the disaster: housing damage as well as loss of relatives or friends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The question about housing damage is based on objectively established criteria for the purposes of compensation of victims.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two or more technical officers surveyed the properties and classified the extent of damage into five levels: (i) no damage, (ii) partial damage, (iii) minor, (iv) major, and (v) destroyed (Table S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Covariates_and_Mediators  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We selected as potential time-varying confounding variables: age, equivalized income (27), medical treatment for stroke, hypertension, diabetes (28), dyslipidemia (29), current smoking (30), current alcohol drinking (31), and daily walking time (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other time invariant characteristics, such as sex and educational attainment, were omitted from our fixed-effects regressions (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also controlled for length of time (in years) between the predisaster and postdisaster assessments for each subject (mean 3.69, SD 0.38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We additionally examined a set of variables as potential mediators of the relation between property damage/loss and dementia symptomatology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These variables were included: disruption to access to internal medicine and psychiatric services, incident PTSD and depression symptoms (measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale-15, GDS-15) (4), and declines in informal social interactions with friends and neighbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The informal socializing variable was measured in terms of the reported frequency of meeting with friends, ranging from four or more times a week to rarely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interactions with neighbors was asked in terms of how close the respondents felt to their neighbors, ranging from mutual consultation, lending and borrowing of daily commodities, cooperation in daily life to none, not even greeting their neighbors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Screening Questionnaire for Disaster-Related Mental Health (34), which has been previously validated in an older Japanese population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PTSD symptoms were categorized into slightly affected (03 points), moderately affected (45 points), and severely affected (69 points) (34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Age was grouped into 65 to 74 y, 74 to 84 y, and 85 y and over.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Household income was equalized by dividing the gross income by the square root of the number of household members and categorized into Under 2.0 million JPY (Japanese yen) versus 2.0 million JPY and over.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depressive symptoms were categorized into lower risk (four points and under) versus higher risk (five points and over) (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In the present study, we used a fixed-effects regression approach to examine the associations between property damage and changes in dementia symptomatology over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of two-wave panel data, the model is equivalent to a first-difference model (36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the model estimates within-individual changes in the dependent variable (Y: change in level of dementia symptomatology) regressed on changes in the independent variable (X: experiences of disaster damage), which effectively differences out the confounding influences of all observed and unobserved time-invariant factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The causal interpretation of this model can still be questioned if changes in the outcome influenced changes in the exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our natural experiment, we argue that the exposure itself (i.e., experiences of the disaster) was an exogenous shock, and that the resulting coefficients can be interpreted as causal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Property damage in a disaster is a potentially endogenous variable; that is, residents who are more susceptible to cognitive decline may be also more likely to be living in homes that are vulnerable to damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We need to reduce the estimation bias caused by the endogeneity of housing damage after adjusting observed covariates and risk factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, as a robustness check to account for residual confounding, we additionally conducted an instrumental variable analysis, using the inverse of distance from the coastline to each residents address at baseline as an instrument for housing damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A valid instrument requires that it be associated with the treatment, but not directly affect the outcome (37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the distance for each residence using geographic information systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of housing damage was strongly correlated with distance from the coast (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To address potential bias resulting from missing data, we used multiple imputation by Markov chainMonte Carlo method assuming missingness at random for explanatory variables and covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We created 50 imputed datasets and combined each result of analysis using the STATA command mi estimate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All analyses were performed using STATA v14.0 (STATA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
