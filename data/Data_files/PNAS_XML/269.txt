Heme dynamics and trafficking factors revealed by genetically encoded fluorescent heme sensors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
All heme-dependent functions require the mobilization of labile heme (LH), of which there is little understanding of its nature and dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe LH pools, we developed genetically encoded fluorescent heme sensors and deployed them in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that LH is relatively abundant in the cytosol, but exceedingly low in the mitochondria and nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we find that LH can be mobilized by signaling molecules like nitric oxide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase constitutes a major heme buffer and is responsible for regulating the activity of a heme-dependent transcription factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our work will have profound implications for understanding the mechanisms of heme utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Heme is an essential cofactor and signaling molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heme acquisition by proteins and heme signaling are ultimately reliant on the ability to mobilize labile heme (LH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the properties of LH pools, including concentration, oxidation state, distribution, speciation, and dynamics, are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we elucidate the nature and dynamics of LH using genetically encoded ratiometric fluorescent heme sensors in the unicellular eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the subcellular distribution of LH is heterogeneous; the cytosol maintains LH at 2040 nM, whereas the mitochondria and nucleus maintain it at concentrations below 2.5 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we find that the signaling molecule nitric oxide can initiate the rapid mobilization of heme in the cytosol and nucleus from certain thiol-containing factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase constitutes a major cellular heme buffer, and is responsible for maintaining the activity of the heme-dependent nuclear transcription factor heme activator protein (Hap1p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, we demonstrate that the heme sensors can be used to reveal fundamental aspects of heme trafficking and dynamics and can be used across multiple organisms, including Escherichia coli, yeast, and human cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Design_and_Characterization_of_Heme_Sensors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The first-generation heme sensor, HS1, consists of a heme-binding domain, the His/Met coordinating 4-alpha-helical bundle hemoprotein cytochrome b562 (Cyt b562) (13), fused to a pair of fluorescent proteins, EGFP and Katushka 2 (mKATE2), that are expected to exhibit heme-sensitive and -insensitive fluorescence, respectively (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Holo-Cyt b562 is a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptor for EGFP (14, 15) [excitation (ex.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 488 nm, emission (em.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 510 nm] but not mKATE2 (16) (ex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 588 nm, em.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  = 620 nm) (SI Appendix, Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, HS1 was designed as an excitation-emission ratiometric probe (17) in which the ratio of heme-sensitive EGFP fluorescence to heme-insensitive mKATE2 fluorescence provides a readout of cellular heme independent of sensor concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HS1 was adapted from a previously reported EGFP-Cyt b562 integral fusion protein, CG6, that exhibits 99% efficient FRET between EGFP and heme (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mKATE2 was appended to the N terminus of CG6 with a GlySer linker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titration of ferric and ferrous heme into an aqueous buffered solution [20 mM NaPi, 100 mM NaCl (pH 8.0)] of 0.5 M purified HS1 resulted in visible absorbance spectra indicative of heme coordination (SI Appendix, Fig S2), and quenched EGFP fluorescence (10-fold decrease in signal), with minimal perturbation to mKATE2 fluorescence (20% decrease in signal) (Fig 1 BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both oxidized and reduced heme quench the fluorescence of EGFP and mKATE2 to similar degrees and the change in fluorescence as a function of [heme] evinces a 1:1 heme/HS1 stoichiometry (Fig 1 D and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
HS1-ferric heme dissociation constants, KdIII, were determined by direct titration of hemin chloride into HS1 over a broad pH range (pH 58), and found to be 3 nM between pH 6.0 and 7.5 (SI Appendix, Fig S3 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At pH 8.0, the 10 nM KdIII value for HS1 is identical to the KdIII values previously reported for Cyt b562 (13) and CG6 (18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HS1-ferrous heme dissociation constants, KdII values, were too tight to measure by direct titration and are less than 1 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because previous estimates for the concentration of the LH pool are highly varied between nanomolar and micromolar values (12), we generated heme sensors with altered heme binding affinities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One variant, HS1-M7A, which was generated by replacing the heme axial Met7 ligand of Cyt b562 with Ala (SI Appendix, Fig S2), exhibits fluorescence properties similar to the fluorescence properties of HS1 and binds heme in a 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig 1 E and F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HS1-M7A binds ferrous heme with a KdII value of 25 nM between pH 6.0 and 7.5 (SI Appendix, Fig S3 DF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HS1-M7A KdIII values are very weak, determined to be 0.52.0 M over a pH range of 5.08.0 (SI Appendix, Fig S3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KdII value of HS1-M7A is similar in magnitude to previous estimates of the regulatory heme pool, 10100 nM (12, 19), as well as the affinities of proteins that may respond to this pool, including the heme-dependent transcription factor Rev-erb (20) and constitutive heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2) (21) (SI Appendix, Fig S3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Both HS1 and HS1-M7A are selective for ferrous heme over other metals, protoporphyrin IX, and the heme degradation products bilirubin and biliverdin (SI Appendix, Fig S4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, apo- and ferrous heme-bound HS1 and HS1-M7A exhibit pH-independent EGFP/mKATE2 fluorescence ratios between pH 6.5 and 9.0, but are markedly pH-dependent below pH 6.5 (SI Appendix, Fig S4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence ratio of HS1 and HS1-M7A is independent of protein concentration between 10 nM and 1 M, suggesting that the sensors do not aggregate over these concentrations (SI Appendix, Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ferrous heme binding to HS1 and HS1-M7A is reversible because competition with excess apo-Cyt b562 restores the fluorescence ratio to apo-sensor (SI Appendix, Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cellular_Heme_Imaging__Cytosol  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using fluorimetry (Fig 2A), flow cytometry (Fig 2B), and fluorescence microscopy (Fig 2C), we find that HS1 and HS1-M7A can be used to sense endogenous LH in a quantitative manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorimetry (Fig 2A) and fluorescence microscopy (Fig 2C) of WT yeast cells expressing cytosolic HS1 and HS1-M7A indicate an EGFP/mKATE2 ratio that is markedly reduced in comparison to heme-deficient hem1 cells, which lack 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) synthase, the first enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway (22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in HS1 and HS1-M7A fluorescence ratios in WT cells reflects their differential heme binding affinities (vida infra).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The HS1 and HS1-M7A EGFP/mKATE2 fluorescence ratios in hem1 cells decrease when heme synthesis is initiated due to supplementation with 5-ALA (Fig 2 A and C) in a dose-dependent manner (SI Appendix, Fig S6 C and D), which is consistent with increased heme binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excess 5-ALA does not reduce HS1-M7A fluorescence ratios to the same extent as HS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is because excess 5-ALA (1.5 mM) results in intracellular heme levels similar to WT cells (SI Appendix, Fig S6E); strict control of heme biosynthesis does not allow for endogenous heme levels that are sufficient to saturate the low-affinity heme sensor HS1-M7A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the HS1 and HS1-M7A EGFP/mKATE2 fluorescence ratios in WT cells increase upon supplementation with the heme biosynthesis inhibitor succinylacetone (SA) (Fig 2 AC) in a dose-dependent manner (SI Appendix, Fig S6 A and B), which is consistent with decreased heme binding (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variant of HS1 with His102 and Met7 heme-coordinating ligands mutated to Ala, HS1-M7A,H102A, and an mKATE2-EGFP fusion protein lacking the Cyt b562 domain do not exhibit heme-dependent changes in fluorescence ratio, indicating that heme iron coordination to HS1 is required for cellular heme sensing (SI Appendix, Fig S7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The heme sensor does not itself perturb heme metabolism and is a reliable reporter for endogenous LH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titration of HS1-M7A expression using weak (prADH1), medium (prTEF1), and strong (prGPD) promoters does not result in a change in the observed concentration of the bioavailable heme pool, and prGPD-HS1-M7A does not affect cell growth or heme-regulated functions like total heme, catalase activity, or respiration (SI Appendix, Fig S8 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For quantitative heme monitoring, an in situ method to calibrate the sensor was developed (19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concentration of [heme] accessible to the sensor is governed by the following expression (23):[heme]=KdÃ—RexptRminRmaxRexpt(FminmKATE2FmaxmKATE2),[1]where Kd is the heme-sensor dissociation constant, Rexpt is the EGFP/mKATE2 fluorescence ratio under any given condition, Rmin is the EGFP/mKATE2 fluorescence ratio when 0% of the sensor is bound to heme, Rmax is the EGFP/mKATE2 fluorescence ratio when 100% of the sensor is bound to heme, FminmKATE2 is the mKATE2 emission intensity when 0% of the sensor is bound to heme, and FmaxmKATE2 is the mKATE2 emission intensity when 100% of the sensor is bound to heme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determination of Rmax and FmaxmKATE2 involves recording EGFP and mKATE2 fluorescence after digitonin permeabilization of cells and incubation with 50 M heme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determination of Rmin and FminmKATE2 involves recording EGFP and mKATE2 fluorescence after cells are treated with SA or from hem1 cells cultured in parallel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the ferrous heme binding affinities are tighter than ferric affinities for both HS1 and HS1-M7A, Rmax and FmaxmKATE2 are determined in the presence of the reducing agent ascorbate (1 mM) to drive heme saturation of the sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Using fluorimetry, in situ calibration of HS1 in WT cells indicates that it is 95% saturated (Fig 2A and SI Appendix, Fig S9), which is not ideal for imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, HS1-M7A is typically 2050% bound in exponential-phase WT cells and well poised to monitor changes in heme availability (Fig 2A and SI Appendix, Fig S9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimation of the concentration of LH using Eq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 depends on assumptions made about its oxidation state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the two limiting cases of LH being 100% reduced or oxidized, cytosolic LH can be estimated to be buffered between 30 nM and 1 M, respectively, after considering the data depicted in Fig 2A and the KdII or KdIII value of 25 nM or 1 M at pH 7.0 (SI Appendix, Fig S3), which is the pH of the yeast cytosol (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the relatively reducing cellular environment, EmCytosol  320 mV vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (25), which is governed by the ratio of oxidized-to-reduced glutathione, and the reduction potential of aqueous heme, estimated to be between 50 mV and 220 mV vs. NHE (26, 27), we propose that LH is biased toward the reduced state and assume herein that LH is 100% reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the actual fraction of LH that is reduced is dependent on its speciation and the degree to which it equilibrates with the glutathione redox buffer, both of which are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI Appendix, Fig S10G outlines estimates of [LH] for a sensor that is between 20% and 50% bound because the assumption in the oxidation state deviates from being 100% reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the weak ferric heme affinities of HS1-M7A, if [LH] is less_than100 nM, HS1-M7A cannot sense oxidized LH (SI Appendix, Fig S10 AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Flow cytometry of log-phase WT cells expressing HS1-M7A reveals that there are three populations of cells with distinct concentrations of cytosolic LH; 40 nM, 20 nM, and less_than1 nM heme (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These LH concentrations correspond to 1,200, 600, and less_than30 molecules of heme, respectively, assuming a cytosolic volume (Vcyt) of 50 fL (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, total cellular heme was determined to be 1 M (SI Appendix, Fig S8D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this trimodal distribution is highly reproducible, the relative abundance of cells with these three distinct heme levels is quite variable between experiments (SI Appendix, Fig S11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that heme availability may be dynamically regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, HS1 exhibits only one population due to complete heme saturation as a result of its high heme binding affinity (Fig 2B and SI Appendix, Fig S12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cellular_Heme_Imaging__Nucleus_and_Mitochondria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To probe the subcellular distribution of heme, we targeted HS1 and HS1-M7A to the mitochondria and nucleus by appending N-terminal COX4 mitochondrial matrix or C-terminal SV40 nuclear localization sequences, respectively (25, 29) (Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localization tags do not affect heme binding to the sensors (SI Appendix, Fig S13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Fluorimetry (Fig 3B) and fluorescence microscopy (Fig 3C) indicate that nuclear and mitochondrial HS1 exhibit EGFP/mKATE2 fluorescence ratios in WT cells that are distinctly lower than in hem1 cells, indicative of heme binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, nuclear and mitochondrial HS1-M7A EGFP/mKATE2 fluorescence ratios are unaltered between hem1 and WT cells (Fig 3 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the fractional saturation of our sensors in these compartments, we developed an in situ sensor calibration method analogous to the one described for the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because digitonin cannot permeabilize nuclear or mitochondrial membranes (19), we first had to enzymatically digest the yeast cell wall with zymolyase and then incubate the resulting spheroplasts with 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 M heme, and 1 mM ascorbate to heme-saturate the sensors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3B, this in situ calibration method resulted in limiting Rmax values for HS1 and HS1-M7A that are identical within experimental error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In total, the data indicate that HS1 is 100% heme-saturated in the mitochondria and nucleus, whereas HS1-M7A is 0% heme-saturated in these organelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the HS1-M7A KdII of 25 nM, we estimate that heme is buffered at an upper limit of 2.5 nM in the mitochondria and nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concentration corresponds to fewer than six molecules in the nucleus [Vnuc  5 fL (30)] and 0.6 molecules in the mitochondria [Vmito  0.5 fL (28, 31)].  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

NO_Mobilizes_Cytosolic_and_Nuclear_Heme  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Previous work demonstrated that NO could regulate heme transfer between certain protein pairs (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Could NO also mobilize LH pools?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial targeted HS1-M7A, we found that NO derived from the small molecule NOC-7 (33) rapidly increases cytosolic (Fig 4A) and nuclear (Fig 4B) LH in WT cells, but not in the mitochondria (Fig 4C) or in heme-deficient hem1 cells (SI Appendix, Fig S14A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cytosol, LH increases from 17 nM to 40 nM within 20 min of adding 50 M NOC-7 (t1/2 = 10 min at 22 Â°C), which corresponds to an increase from 500 to 1,200 molecules of heme, assuming Vcyt  50 fL (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rapid increase is followed by the reestablishment of the initial steady-state heme levels over the course of 80 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the nucleus, there is an even more pronounced change in the HS1-M7A EGFP/mKATE2 ratio upon NOC-7 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO results in an increase in nuclear LH from less_than2.5 nM to a maximum of 218 nM, corresponding to a change from fewer than six to 650 heme molecules assuming Vnuc  5 fL (30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO-mediated heme mobilization is dose-dependent (SI Appendix, Fig S14B), and the observed changes in fluorescence ratios are not due to NO interactions within HS1-M7A because incubation of purified heme-bound HS1-M7A with NOC-7 does not alter sensor fluorescence (SI Appendix, Fig S15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Given that cellular thiols are targets of NO, we sought to determine the effect of a thiol-specific alkylating agent [e.g., iodoacetamide (IAM)] on heme mobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although IAM does not initiate the mobilization of heme, it does prevent the reestablishment of the steady-state LH pool after NO treatment (SI Appendix, Fig S14C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation suggests that IAM blocks the rebinding of heme from sites of mobilization, presumably certain thiol-containing factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To differentiate the effects of NO and general oxidative stress on heme mobilization, we probed the role of various oxidative insults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diamide, a thiol-specific oxidant; paraquat, a superoxide-generating agent; and H2O2 had no impact on LH pools, suggesting that heme mobilization is specific to NO (SI Appendix, Fig S14D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

GAPDH_Regulates_Cytosolic_Heme_Availability_and_the_Activity_of_the_Nuclear_Heme-Dependent_Transcription_Factor_Hap1p  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify genes that regulate LH, we transformed cytosolic HS1-M7A into the yeast knockout collection and screened for mutants that exhibited altered sensor fluorescence ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After partial screening, we identified TDH3, which encodes an isoform of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH, to be a determinant of LH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tdh3 cells exhibit an approximately fourfold greater concentration of labile cytosolic heme (13 nM in WT cells and 57 nM in tdh3 cells) (Fig 5A) without affecting total heme levels (SI Appendix, Fig S16B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of TDH3 homologs TDH1 and TDH2 does not affect LH pools (Fig 5A), likely because these isoforms contribute to a small fraction of total GAPDH (SI Appendix, Fig S16A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Episomal expression of TDH3 in tdh3 cells restores LH to WT levels (SI Appendix, Fig S16 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To determine the role of Tdh3p on other heme-dependent functions, we measured the activity of cytosolic heme catalase, Ctt1p, and the activity of the heme-dependent transcription factor, Hap1p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tdh3 cells have normal Ctt1p activity as determined by a native in-gel colorimetric assay for catalase (34) (SI Appendix, Fig S16C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, tdh3 cells have a defect in Hap1p activity as measured using a transcriptional reporter that employs EGFP driven by the CYC1 promoter, a Hap1p target gene (9) (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, our data indicate GAPDH is involved in buffering cytosolic heme and regulates the activity of Hap1p, presumably by acting as a source for heme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Validation_of_Sensors_in_Escherichia_coli_and_HEK293_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To broaden the utility of HS1, we tested its applicability in other cell lines, including E. coli and human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells (SI Appendix, Fig S17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In HEK293 cells, flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy demonstrate that HS1 and HS1-M7A exhibit EGFP/mKATE2 fluorescence ratios that are distinctly lower when cells are cultured in heme-replete media relative to heme-deficient (HD) media containing SA (HD + SA) (SI Appendix, Fig S17 AE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, heme sensor fluorescence ratios in E. coli exhibit heme-dependent changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A heme-deficient hemA strain lacking glutamyl-tRNA reductase, which catalyzes the first step in porphyrin synthesis, is a 5-ALA auxotroph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hemA strain showed a higher EGFP/mKATE2 fluorescence ratio after growth shift to media lacking 5-ALA (SI Appendix, Fig S17F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, HS1 can be used to probe heme physiology across multiple model organisms and cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mobilization of LH underlies all heme-dependent processes, including heme acquisition by client proteins and heme-based signal transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the properties of the LH pool are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this fundamental gap in heme cell biology, we developed genetically encoded ratiometric heme sensors and deployed them in Bakers yeast to probe key characteristics of the LH pool, including its concentration, subcellular distribution, buffering factors, and dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The cytosol has more LH (2040 nM) than the nucleus or mitochondria (less_than2.5 nM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in cytosolic heme suggests its availability may be dynamically regulated (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the subcellular distribution of heme, we propose that once heme is biosynthesized in the mitochondrial matrix, a fraction of heme transits to the cytosol and acts as a reservoir for signaling and/or a heme source for proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mitochondria, which have a very high demand for heme and are the site of heme biosynthesis, have exceptionally low quantities of LH, less than 2.5 nM or fewer than one molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, total ferrous heme in the yeast mitochondria has been estimated to be 30 M, or 9,000 molecules (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, this low amount of mitochondrial LH suggests that mitochondrial heme is tightly regulated and trafficked in a manner that limits its availability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is consistent with the identification of mitochondrial heme metabolism complexes that traffic heme via transient proteinprotein interactions, thereby circumventing the LH pool (35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The nucleus also limits LH to less than 2.5 nM or fewer than six molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This low amount of nuclear LH is not surprising, given the cytotoxicity of heme and proximity to genetic material (5, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this observation raises the question of how nuclear heme-regulated transcription factors acquire heme, given that the heme-regulatory motifs (HRMs) of many heme-dependent transcription factors, including Hap1p in yeast, exhibit micromolar affinities for heme (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Factors like Hap1p may acquire heme from transient increases in LH due to active signaling processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this concept is supported by our demonstration that signaling molecules like NO can result in a 10-fold increase in nuclear LH (Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative possibility is that the heme affinities of many HRM-containing proteins are mischaracterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, a reevaluation of the heme dissociation constants of the HRM-containing transcription factor Rev-erb found that heme binds 100-fold tighter than previously estimated, with KdIII and KdII of 20 nM vs. 26 M (20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our observation that subcellular [LH] is heterogeneous stands in striking contrast to a recent report by He and coworkers (19) that used a heme chaperone-based FRET sensor (CISDY-9) for heme in human cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that work, cytosolic, mitochondrial, and nuclear heme were all reported to be 25 nM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deviation between our two results needs to be clarified but could reflect organismal variation, difficulty in calibrating CISDY-9 in organelles, or uncertainties in LH oxidation state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that LH is dynamic and can be mobilized by signaling molecules like NO (Fig 4 and SI Appendix, Fig S14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although previous studies have indicated that H2O2 and NO can regulate heme transfer between specific protein pairs (32, 36), our results suggest that NO can mobilize cell-wide LH pools to regulate heme-dependent processes in multiple compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism of NO-mediated heme mobilization is unknown, but likely involves S-nitrosation of certain hemoproteins and heme dissociation (32, 37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NO-mediated heme mobilization provides insights into NO physiology, including NO-dependent inflammatory responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both heme and NO regulate inflammation, but through distinct mechanisms (8, 38, 39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work indicates that NO can promote inflammation via heme mobilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, previous observations in endothelial cells found that NO elevates cellular iron due to enhanced activity of the heme-degrading enzyme, HO (40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation was proposed to occur as a result of NO-induced heme release from hemoproteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our current studies are the first, to our knowledge, to provide direct support for this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Our findings that GAPDH and NO regulate heme availability and mobilization are highly reminiscent of and supported by previous studies demonstrating that GAPDH and NO cooperate to control heme insertion into nitric oxide synthase (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, it is tempting to speculate that Tdh3p is the source of NO-mobilized heme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NO-dependent heme mobilization is unaffected in tdh3 cells (SI Appendix, Fig S18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Altogether, the HS1s can be applied across prokaryotes and eukaryotes to probe heme trafficking, signaling, and dynamics in various physiological contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
