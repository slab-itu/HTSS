Female exogamy and gene pool diversification at the transition from the Final Neolithic to the Early Bronze Age in central Europe  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Paleogenetic and isotope data from human remains shed new light on residential rules revealing patrilocality and high female mobility in European prehistory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show the crucial role of this institution and its impact on the transformation of population compositions over several hundred years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence for an epoch-transgressing maternal relationship between two individuals demonstrates long-debated population continuity from the central European Neolithic to the Bronze Age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that a simple notion of migration cannot explain the complex human mobility of third millennium BCE societies in Eurasia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, it appears that part of what archaeologists understand as migration is the result of large-scale institutionalized and possibly sex- and age-related individual mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Human mobility has been vigorously debated as a key factor for the spread of bronze technology and profound changes in burial practices as well as material culture in central Europe at the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the relevance of individual residential changes and their importance among specific age and sex groups are still poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present ancient DNA analysis, stable isotope data of oxygen, and radiogenic isotope ratios of strontium for 84 radiocarbon-dated skeletons from seven archaeological sites of the Late Neolithic Bell Beaker Complex and the Early Bronze Age from the Lech River valley in southern Bavaria, Germany.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete mitochondrial genomes documented a diversification of maternal lineages over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isotope ratios disclosed the majority of the females to be nonlocal, while this is the case for only a few males and subadults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most nonlocal females arrived in the study area as adults, but we do not detect their offspring among the sampled individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The striking patterns of patrilocality and female exogamy prevailed over at least 800 y between about 2500 and 1700 BC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The persisting residential rules and even a direct kinship relation across the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age add to the archaeological evidence of continuing traditions from the Bell Beaker Complex to the Early Bronze Age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results also attest to female mobility as a driving force for regional and supraregional communication and exchange at the dawn of the European metal ages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Interdisciplinary research combining archeological, Sr and O isotope, and mtDNA analyses disclosed striking evidence for patrilocal residential rules and female exogamy persisting over at least 800 y in central Europe from about 2500 to 1700 BC, and possibly starting even earlier in the CWC (12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, the archeological record, radiocarbon dates, burial practices, mtDNA haplogroups, and isotope dataespecially of male and subadult individualssupport settlement continuity from the Late Neolithic BBC to the EBA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes indication of direct maternal kinship between a male with BBC and a female with EBA attributes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, numerous nonlocal Sr isotope ratios among the females and the diversification of the maternal lineages point to exogamy and female mobility as a driving force of regional and supraregional communication and knowledge transmission in a time of major innovations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systematic individual movements are an important factor in third millennium BCE societies in Eurasia and force us to reexamine evidence of migration that may actually be the result of large-scale institutionalized and possibly sex- and age-related individual mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Archaeological_Background  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Since the 1980s, excavations in the Lech River valley south of the city of Augsburg (Bavaria, Germany; Fig 1 and SI Appendix, Fig S1) have unearthed cemeteries of the Late Neolithic BBC and the Early and Middle Bronze Age, some of them covering multiple periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the EBA sites are associated with a hamlet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cultural attribution is based on archaeological criteria such as grave goods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct radiocarbon dating of the human remains revealed age ranges of 25002150 cal BC for the BBC burials and 21501650/1600 cal BC for the EBA burials (26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eighty-four sampled individuals derive from seven cemeteries and include all burials of combined BBC and EBA sites and a selection from larger EBA cemeteries based on chronologically significant or remarkable grave goods and a representative number of children and adults of both sexes (Dataset S1, Tables 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Ancient_DNA_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Teeth were sampled in clean room facilities at the University of Tübingen by sawing them apart transversally at the border of crown and root and removing dentine from inside the crown with a sterile dentistry drill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extraction was performed following an established protocol (45), and an aliquot of extract was used to generate double-indexed libraries (46, 47) that were sequenced before and after enrichment for mtDNA (48) on a NextSeq with 2 × 101+8+8 and a HiSeq2500 with 2 × 101+8+8 cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negative controls were included in the extraction and library preparation and taken along for all further processing steps (Dataset S1, Table 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Base call files produced by the instruments software were converted to raw sequences that were demultiplexed according to the index combinations they received during library preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A software pipeline was used (49) to clip adapter sequences, map reads to the referencehg19 for shotgun data and revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS) for mitochondrial capture datausing BurrowsWheeler Aligner (BWA) (50) with parameters -l 10000 -n 0.01, and to remove duplicate reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondrial consensus sequences were called while jointly estimating the rate of deamination damage and contamination from present-day human sources with the probabilistic iterative method applied in the software schmutzi (29) using the accompanying tool log2fasta with parameter -q 20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poly-C regions and mutational hotspots at positions 303315, 515522, and 16519 were masked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sex was assigned on the basis of the shotgun-sequencing data (51), restricted to reads that showed postmortem damage with the script pmdtools (52), parameter threshold 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondrial haplogroups were assigned manually by consulting the output of Haplofind (53) and Haplogrep2.0 (54).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haplogroup frequencies and Fst analysis were conducted on a conservative dataset, counting only once a shared haplotype that occurred within a multiple burial or between very closely located burials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pairwise Fst comparisons against other ancient populations (3) were performed with Arlequin ver3.5.2 (55) using the Tamura & Nei substitution model and gamma value 0.300 on the HVS-I region (1612616369), excluding the poly-C-stretch at 1618416195.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance level was corrected for using the BenjaminiHochberg correction to limit false positives (56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess if the different haplogroup frequencies seen in BBC and EBA can be attributed to genetic drift alone, the Test for Population Continuity (3) was applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All mtDNA sequences generated in this study are deposited in GenBank (accession numbers: MF498658MF498737).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Strontium_and_Oxygen_Isotope_Analyses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Sr and O isotope analyses on enamel samples were carried out at the Curt Engelhorn Centre for Archaeometry in Mannheim and the Department for Applied and Analytical Paleontology at the University of Mainz, Germany, following previously described methods (57, 58) (for comparison, see SI Appendix, Text S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis was carried out using WinSTAT for Excel 2007.1 and Sigma Plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All datasets used in Students t tests were tested for normality using the KolmogorovSmirnov test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
