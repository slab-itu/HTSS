In vivo photolabeling of tumor-infiltrating cells reveals highly regulated egress of T-cell subsets from tumors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Understanding the consequences of immune infiltration of solid tumors is vital to continued development of successful immune therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, little is known about the fate of tumor-experienced leukocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used in vivo photoconversion to label tumor-infiltrating cells and demonstrated specific egress and dissemination of effector T-cell subsets from tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identity and functions of tumor-egressing cells, and those retained inside tumors, are of great importance to our understanding of tumor immunity because of the crucial role tumor-infiltrating cells play in primary tumors and their potential to provide antitumor immunity at secondary tumor sites and in secondary lymphoid organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of this study will guide strategies that harness T-cell immunity for anticancer therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Immune therapy is rapidly gaining prominence in the clinic as a major weapon against cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas much attention has been focused on the infiltration of tumors by immune cells, the subsequent fate of these infiltrates remains largely unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore established a photoconversion-based model that allowed us to label tumor-infiltrating immune cells and follow their migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this system, we identified a population of tumor-experienced cells that emigrate from primary tumors to draining lymph nodes via afferent lymphatic vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the majority of tumor-infiltrating cells were myeloid, T cells made up the largest population of tumor-egressing leukocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the subset composition of tumor-egressing T cells was greatly skewed compared with those that had infiltrated the tumor and those resident in the draining lymph node.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some T-cell subsets such as CD8+ T cells emigrated more readily; others including CD4CD8 T cells were preferentially retained, suggesting that specific mechanisms guide immune cell egress from tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, tumor-egressing T cells were more activated and displayed enhanced effector function in comparison with their lymph node counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating T cells migrate to distant secondary tumors and draining lymph nodes, highlighting a mechanism whereby tumor-experienced effector T cells may mediate antitumor immunity at metastatic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results provide insights into migration and function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and the role of these cells in tumor immunity outside of primary tumor deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Immune_Cells_Leave_Primary_Tumors_and_Accumulate_in_Draining_Lymph_Nodes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Although immune infiltration of solid tumors has been extensively studied, the fate of immune cells once inside solid tumors remains unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the fate of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, we induced primary tumors by injecting widely used syngeneic Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells into the ear pinnae of C57BL/6J mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometric analysis of tumors revealed that myeloid cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (DCs), made up the majority of tumor-infiltrating cells, whereas lymphocytes made up a much smaller fraction of the immune infiltrate (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To track the migration of tumor-conditioned immune cell subsets, we established a system that allows us to label tumor-infiltrating cells without disruption to tumor integrity (Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model makes use of a reporter mouse ubiquitously expressing the coral-derived, photoconvertible, fluorescent protein Kaede (8), which can be photoconverted from green to red after exposure to UV or violet light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated by us (9, 10) and others (8), photoconvertible transgenic mice can be used to monitor cellular movement between organs and therefore represent a unique and powerful tool for labeling and tracking migratory tumor-infiltrating cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LLC cells were injected into the ear pinnae of Kaede transgenic mice, leading to growth of tumor deposits that are readily accessible, without the need for inflammation-inducing surgical procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the tumors reached 14 mm3, they were photoconverted by a brief exposure to white light from a cold light source (11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allowed us to label cells 2 mm deep into the tumor (60100% of tumor depth) (Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of tumors immediately following photoconversion showed that the majority of tumor-infiltrating cells can be photoconverted using this approach (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observed photoconversion of all major tumor-infiltrating immune subsets (Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To track the fate of tumor-infiltrating cells, tumors were photoconverted and the mice were killed 24 h later for detection of photoconverted cells in various organs by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, a substantial number of tumor-egressing photoconverted cells could be detected only in draining lymph nodes of photoconverted tumor-bearing mice and not in other organs (Fig 1E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the number of egressing cells found in the draining lymph nodes following tumor photoconversion was more than 10-fold greater than following photoconversion of resting ear skin (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To identify the route of immune cell migration from tumors to lymph nodes, we used two-photon microscopy to visualize LYVE-1labeled lymphatic vessels in the skin surrounding photoconverted tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we detected photoconverted cells migrating inside lymphatic vessels (Fig S3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when we analyzed tumor-draining lymph nodes 4 h after photoconversion, we observed that most of the photoconverted cells were in or near the subcapsular sinus (Fig S3B), where afferent lymph enters the tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate that most tumor-egressing cells enter draining lymph nodes via afferent lymphatic vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Upon detailed analysis, the majority of the photoconverted (tumor egressing) cells were found to be lymphocytes (Fig 1F), rather than the myeloid cells that made up the majority of infiltrating cells within primary tumors (Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, CD3+ T cells made up almost half (44%) of all tumor-egressing cells detected in draining lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar findings were obtained in the widely used B16F10 melanoma model where again T cells made up the main tumor-egressing population (Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for this selective egress of immune cells is unclear but could be due to relatively rapid recirculation of T cells compared with myeloid subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tumor microenvironment may also favor retention of some myeloid subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an earlier study, we noted that inflammatory signals induced during sterile inflammation (of which tumors are a subset) are less likely to promote migration of some myeloid cells such as neutrophils (9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we also observed a substantial proportion of DCs among tumor-egressing cells (Fig 1F), indicating a role for these cells in tumor antigen transport to secondary lymphoid organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Quantitation of photoconverted T cells in tumors and draining lymph nodes revealed that 24 h after photoconversion, a substantial proportion of photoconverted T cells ( greater than 20%) was found in tumor-draining lymph nodes (Fig S5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next analyzed the kinetics of photoconverted T-cell migration from tumors to draining lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of photoconverted T cells in tumors declined by 27% in the first 24 h (Fig S5B) and then decreased more gradually over the next 48 h. Furthermore, tumor-egressing T cells could be detected in draining lymph nodes as early as 4 h after photoconversion (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their proportion in draining lymph nodes increased rapidly, peaked by 24 h, and declined only slightly over the next 48 h (partly due to the influx of nonphotoconverted cells into tumors and lymph nodes as well as gradual loss of photoconverted protein at longer time points).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, photoconverted T cells rapidly egressed tumors and migrated to draining lymph nodes and most of this emigration occurred in the first 24 h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the localization of tumor-egressing cells in frozen sections of draining lymph nodes of Kaede transgenic mice harvested 24 h after photoconversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By this time, most of the photoconverted cells were located in the lymph node paracortex, consistent with their being mostly T cells and dendritic cells (Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Characterization_of_Tumor-Egressing_T_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The next step was to identify the T-cell subsets that emigrate from primary tumors to draining lymph nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of draining lymph nodes 24 h after tumor photoconversion revealed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells left the primary tumor site (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells among tumor-egressing T cells were decreased compared with CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell proportions among total lymph node T cells (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the photoconverted T-cell population also contained a large proportion of CD4CD8 [double negative (DN)] T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion of DN T cells in the tumor-egressing population was increased more than sevenfold compared with the proportion of these cells among total lymph node T cells (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we compared the proportions of T-cell subsets inside primary tumors with those that had migrated to draining lymph nodes in the 24 h following photoconversion (Fig 2B), the proportion of conventional single positive CD8+ T cells (and to a lesser extent CD4+) emigrating from tumors was increased compared with the corresponding subset within tumor deposits, whereas the inverse was true for DN T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the enrichment in DN T cells among tumor-egressing cells reflects their relative abundance in the tumor deposit, rather than preferential egress from tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our results suggest that DN T cells were retained in the tumor for longer periods of time than CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which appeared to egress from the tumor more rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in migratory capacity may relate to the ability of CD8+ T cells to recirculate between inflamed tissues and secondary lymphoid organs (12, 13) but may also be due to signals within the tumor microenvironment selectively retaining some T-cell subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results suggest that T-cell egress from tumors is selectively regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We noted earlier that the number of tumor-egressing cells in the draining lymph nodes following tumor photoconversion was more than 10-fold greater than following photoconversion of resting ear skin (Fig S2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next examined whether proportions of T-cell subsets egressing from tumors differed from those of T cells emigrating from resting skin (Fig S2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tumor-egressing T-cell population was enriched in DN T cells but had fewer CD4+ T cells compared with T-cell subsets that migrated from resting skin to draining lymph nodes in unmanipulated Kaede transgenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the tumor-egressing T-cell population has a distinct composition from T cells migrating to lymph nodes from surrounding tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Effector_T_Cells_Comprise_the_Majority_of_Tumor-Egressing_T_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To distinguish between naïve, central memory (CM), and effector memory (EM) subsets, we stained tumor-draining lymph nodes in photoconverted mice with antibodies against CD44 and CD62L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of draining lymph nodes showed that a high proportion of tumor-egressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was either of effector and/or central memory phenotype (Fig 3 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation reflects the memory phenotype of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells present within the LLC tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next examined the expression of cell surface markers indicative of T-cell activation and noted that a significantly higher proportion of tumor-egressing cells was positive for T-cell activation markers CD69 as well as CD25 (Fig 3C) compared with total lymph node T cells (consistent with the activation profile of tumor-infiltrating T cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because CD25 is also expressed by Treg cells, we used additional markers to determine whether CD25+CD4+ T cells are activated effector or Treg cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the best way to identify Treg cells is via the expression of Treg-specific transcription factor Foxp3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the staining protocol required to detect intracellular Foxp3 destroys the fluorescent signal of Kaede protein, which meant that we had to use an alternative Treg cell surface marker (FR4) to determine whether CD25+ T cells were in fact Treg cells (14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our hands, FR4 was expressed on  greater than 90% of Foxp3+ lymph node T cells (Fig S6), providing a reliable way to identify Treg cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staining for FR4 revealed that  greater than 80% of total lymph node CD4+CD25+ T cells expressed this marker, suggesting that the majority of lymph node CD4+CD25+ cells were indeed Treg cells (Fig 3D, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a much smaller proportion of tumor-egressing CD4+CD25+ T cells (34%) expressed FR4 (Fig 3D, Left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this finding, only a small proportion (11%) of tumor-egressing CD4+ T cells was FR4+CD25+ and this was similar to total lymph node CD4+ T cells (Fig 3D, Right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results suggest that the majority of tumor-conditioned T cells in draining lymph nodes have an effector rather than regulatory phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We also noted that tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and DN T cells contained a higher proportion of T cells coexpressing PD-1 and Tim-3 compared with T cells that exited the tumor (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exhaustion, characterized by hyporesponsiveness to reactivation, poor effector functions, and up-regulation of inhibitory markers such as PD-1 and Tim-3, frequently affects tumor-infiltrating T cells in solid tumors (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise phenotype that accompanies exhaustion in CD4+ T cells is not well understood, although it is thought that at least some exhausted CD4+ T cells express the same markers as exhausted CD8+ T cells (15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that PD-1+Tim-3+ CD4+ T cells were preferentially retained in tumors due to the impaired ability of exhausted cells to respond to chemotactic signals and egress from tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, CD4+ and DN T cells could down-modulate these cell surface markers upon egress from tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, PD-1 is also expressed on activated T cells and therefore may indicate selective retention of T cells that have recently undergone antigen-specific activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Molecular_Mechanism_of_T-Cell_Egress_from_Tumors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To investigate the molecular mechanisms of T-cell emigration from tumors to draining lymph nodes, we first administered pertussis toxin to block G protein-coupled receptor signaling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis revealed that egress was significantly reduced after inhibitor administration, indicating that migration from tumors is dependent on G protein-coupled receptors (Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next tested the role of chemokine receptor CCR7, which has been implicated in immune cell entry into lymph nodes (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that T-cell migration was independent of CCR7 (Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is in line with the finding that tumor-egressing T cells possess a mostly effector/memory phenotype (Fig 3B) and therefore may be less reliant on CCR7 for lymph node entry than naïve T cells (17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that other chemokine receptors expressed on effector T cells, such as CXCR3, CXCR4, and CCR6, guide migration from tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

_T_Cells_Are_Enriched_Among_Tumor-Egressing_Cells_in_Lymph_Nodes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Closer examination of the tumor-egressing DN subset revealed that more than half expressed  T-cell receptors (TCRs) (Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly,  T cells were enriched 11-fold among tumor-egressing T cells compared with the proportion present among total lymph node T cells (Fig 4B), suggesting that  T cells may play a unique function in tumor immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enrichment in  T cells compared with  T cells may be due to the location of the tumor near the  T-cellrich environment of the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is still unclear how much influence the resident immune population of the tissue where the primary tumor is located has on the make up of tumor-egressing immune subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To explore the phenotype of tumor-egressing  T cells, we analyzed them for expression of V1, V4, and V5 chains (according to nomenclature in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18) known to be present on  T-cell subsets in skin and/or lymph nodes (1921).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on TCR use, the V4 subset was the predominant population among tumor-egressing  T cells (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is in contrast to V expression among tumor-infiltrating cells where the V1 subset predominated, suggesting that, consistent with previous reports (22), V4+  cells have a greater migratory potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The V4 subset among tumor-egressing  T cells was also significantly enriched relative to lymph node  T-cell subsets (Fig 4C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We then investigated expression of the costimulatory molecule CD27, which can enhance T-cell expression of IFN- and suppress IL-17 production (23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor-egressing  T cells had a lower proportion of CD27+  T cells compared with their lymph node counterparts (Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD27 can also down-modulate the chemokine receptor CCR6, which is expressed by IL-17producing T-cell subsets, including  T cells (24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with decreased proportions of CD27+ cells, we found that CCR6 expression was enhanced on tumor-egressing  T cells compared with total lymph node  T cells (Fig 4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we observed increased expression of E integrin CD103 on tumor-egressing  T cells (Fig 4F), a molecule previously associated with IL-17producing  T-cell subsets (25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, tumor-egressing  T cells possess a phenotype consistent with IL-17 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Dissemination_and_Function_of_Tumor-Egressing_T_Cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The phenotype of tumor-egressing T cells suggests that they may possess enhanced effector functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore first examined whether the expression IFN-, which plays a critical role in antitumor defense (5, 26), is augmented in any of the tumor-egressing T-cell subsets (Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intracellular staining protocol commonly used to examine cytokine production leads to a decrease in fluorescence of photoconverted cells, making them difficult to detect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To circumvent this possibility, we sorted photoconverted and nonphotoconverted cells and conducted assays on sorted populations to detect cytokines secreted into the culture media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photoconverted CD4+ and especially CD8+ T cells showed enhanced IFN- production in comparison with nonphotoconverted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there was a decrease in IFN- levels in tumor-egressing (Fig 5A) as well as in tumor-infiltrating (Fig S8)  T cells compared with nonphotoconverted lymph node  T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next assessed the expression of IL-17 by tumor-egressing T cells, because this cytokine has also been implicated in tumor immunity (27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of IL-17 showed that tumor-egressing  T cells preferentially expressed IL-17A compared with total lymph node  T cells (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with an increase in the proportion of CD27 and CCR6+ subsets among the tumor-egressing  T cells (Fig 4 D and E), both of which have been linked with IL-17 production (28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor-egressing  T cells also showed enhanced expression of IL-17 compared with lymph node T cells, although relatively few of them produced IL-17 in comparison with  T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, -derived IL-17 can enhance recruitment of CD8+ T-cell subsets (29) but can also promote tumor angiogenesis and recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (30) as well as tumor metastasis (31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
To test whether cytotoxic function is augmented in tumor-egressing T cells, we analyzed cell surface expression of CD107a, a marker of degranulation and cytotoxicity (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that photoconverted tumor-egressing T cells had significantly higher expression of CD107a compared with nonphotoconverted T cells in the draining lymph node (Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was true for both subsets of  T cells but not for  T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results indicate that tumor-egressing T cells are a heterogeneous population of antigen-experienced cells that are primed for effector functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas tumor-egressing  T cells appear to have antitumor functions characterized by the expression of IFN- and CD107a, the role of tumor-egressing  T cells is less clear, as they have been implicated in pro- and antitumor responses (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the relative enrichment of this subset among tumor-egressing T cells together with their capacity for rapid cytokine production make  T cells an attractive target for immune-based cancer therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tumor-infiltrating T cells play a crucial role in primary tumors but also have the potential to provide antitumor immunity at secondary tumor sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we examined intratumoral T-cell dissemination in the presence of a secondary tumor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photoconvertible transgenic mice were inoculated with LLC tumor cells in both ears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once tumors developed on both sides, we photoconverted one of the tumors and examined whether tumor-egressing T cells can migrate to distal lymph nodes and tumor deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of draining, semidraining, nondraining, and contralateral draining lymph nodes (draining the nonphotoconverted tumor) over a period of 72 h, showed that, as expected, tumor-draining lymph nodes contained the highest number of tumor-egressing T cells (Fig 5D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, contralateral tumor-draining lymph nodes contained the next highest number of tumor-egressing T cells, and this number was significantly higher than the number of photoconverted T cells in all other lymph nodes (Fig 5E), suggesting that tumor-experienced effector T cells are selectively recruited to this site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in the number of photoconverted T cells in contralateral nonphotoconverted tumors 72 h after photoconversion (Fig 5F), indicating that intratumoral T cells can disseminate to distant tumors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migration of tumor-experienced cells to these sites could be a part of an immune surveillance program that allows antitumor effector T cells to patrol sites of metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, radiation of a single tumor enhances the activity of tumor-infiltrating T cells and can also lead to eradication of distal tumors potentially via migration of tumor-experienced effector T cells (33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our findings could have important implications for the development of novel approaches to treat metastases that rely on abscopal effects of localized tumor cell killing by radiation in combination with systemic activation of antitumor immunity by checkpoint inhibitors (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, enhanced emigration of tumor-experienced effector T cells from primary tumors could promote more effective systemic immunity and antitumor responses at secondary tumor sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In summary, here we identified tumor-experienced immune cells that can egress primary tumors as well as cells that are retained inside tumor deposits, highlighting selective regulation of dissemination of tumor-conditioned immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work sheds light on the roles of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in tumor immunity outside primary tumors and may provide additional therapeutic opportunities for controlling immune responses at distal sites such as secondary metastatic tumors and in draining lymph nodes where antitumor responses are initiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To assess dissemination of tumor-egressing T cells, photoconvertible transgenic mice were inoculated with LLC cells in both ears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once tumors developed on both sides, one of the tumors was photoconverted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were killed immediately after and 4, 24, 48, and 72 h following photoconversion and tumors, draining (dorsal cervical), semidraining (ventral cervical), nondraining (inguinal), and contralateral draining lymph nodes (dorsal cervical lymph nodes draining the nonphotoconverted tumor) were digested and analyzed using flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To block GPCR signaling, tumor-bearing Kaede mice were injected i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with 400 ng per mouse of pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories) or PBS immediately before photoconversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were then killed 24 h later and photoconverted T cells were quantified in tumor-draining lymph nodes by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Intracellular_Staining  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Analysis of cytokine expression in tumor deposits was performed using intracellular staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, cells were isolated from lymph node and tumor samples, as described before, and stimulated for 4 h at 37 °C with PMA 5 ng/mL + ionomycin 500 ng/mL in 2 mL of 10% FBS RPMI supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 g/mL streptomycin, in the presence of 1 g/mL Golgi Plug (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Following stimulation, cells were washed in FACS buffer and stained for surface markers as previously described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were then fixed for 20 min at 48 °C with BD Biosciences Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer and, subsequently, washed once in BD Biosciences Perm/Wash buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Afterward, cells were stained for 20 min at 48 °C with anti IFN-PECy7 and IL-17AAF647 (BD Biosciences) diluted in BD Biosciences Perm/Wash.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, cells were washed twice in BD Biosciences Perm/Wash buffer and twice in FACS buffer and subsequently data were acquired on an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
For Foxp3 intracellular staining, a Foxp3 buffer set (BD Biosciences) was used and cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for Foxp3-AF647 (BD Biosciences) as described for IFN- and IL-17A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Cytokine_Secretion_Assay  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Cytokine secretion in photoconverted T cells was analyzed using the mouse IFN-/IL-17A FluoroSpot kit from Mabtech as per manufacturers instructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, FluoroSpot IPFL plates were pretreated with 35% ethanol, washed and coated overnight with antiIL-17A (IL17-I) and antiIFN- (AN18) antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coated plates were blocked for at least 30 min with 10% FBS RPMI medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Draining lymph nodes from tumor-bearing Kaede mice were harvested 24 h after tumor photoconversion and Kaede lymph node cells were sorted using a FACSAria (BD Biosciences) into CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, and CD3+CD4CD8TCR+ Kaede red and total Kaede T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 103 T cells were seeded in triplicate in precoated plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C 5% CO2 in the presence of PMA 5 ng/mL + ionomycin 500 ng/mL in 10% FBS RPMI supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine, 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 g/mL streptomycin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the incubation, T cells were removed and plates were incubated with antiIL-17A (MT2270) and antiIFN- (R4-6A2-BAM) antibodies for 2 h at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following washing, plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark with detection antibodies SA-550 and antiBAM-490.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, plates were washed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark with Fluorescence Enhancer-II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dried plates were then analyzed using the AID iSPOT Elispot reader.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Two-Photon_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two-photon imaging was performed using an upright Zeiss 7MP two-photon microscope (Carl Zeiss) with a W Plan-Apochromat 20×/1.0 DIC (UV) Visible-IR water immersion objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four external nondescanned detectors were used to detect blue (short pass 485), green [band pass (BP) 500550], red (BP 565610), and far red (BP 640710).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High repetition rate femtosecond-pulsed excitation was provided by a Chameleon Vision II Ti:Sa laser (Coherent Scientific) with a 690- to 1,064-nm tuning range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acquired 3-m z steps at 512 × 512 pixels and resolution 0.83 m per pixel at a frame rate of 10 fps and dwell time of 1.27 s per pixel using bidirectional scanning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Two-photon microscopy of photoconverted cells was based on a previously described method (9, 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kaede tumors were harvested from photoconverted and nonphotoconverted mice immediately after photoconversion, cut in half using a surgical scalpel, immobilized on a Petri dish, and visualized using two-photon microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To visualize lymphatic vessels, antiLYVE-1 (clone 223322, purchased from R&D Systems) labeled in house with AF647 was injected s.c. into the skin surrounding photoconverted tumors immediately after photoconversion, and the ear skin adjacent to the tumor was imaged 1 h later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumor-draining lymph nodes were visualized 4 h postphotoconversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw image files were processed using Imaris (Bitplane) software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Gaussian filter was applied to reduce background noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Immunohistochemistry_and_Confocal_Microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Tumor-draining lymph nodes were harvested from Kaede mice 24 h after photoconversion and fixed for 4590 min in the dark at room temperature in fixing buffer (1× PBS, 4% formalin, and 10% sucrose).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, lymph nodes were incubated with 10, 20, and 30% sucrose in 1× PBS for 8 h each, in the dark at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lymph nodes were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek) and frozen at 80 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cryosections of lymph nodes 100 m thick were cut and fixed in 10% formalin for 1015 min at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following fixation, sections were washed in 1× PBS, blocked with 1% BSA + 5% rat serum in 1× PBS, and immunostained with rat monoclonal antibody CD3-Alexa Fluor 647 (clone 145-2C11), purchased from University of California, San Francisco monoclonal antibody core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were acquired using a Leica DMI 6000 SP8 confocal microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Statistical_Analysis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The statistical distribution of experimental data was determined using a DAgostinoPearson omnibus normality test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical significance of experimental data for comparisons of two groups was determined using either an unpaired MannWhitney test or a Wilcoxon-matched pairs signed rank test when distribution was not normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical significance of experimental data for comparisons of three groups was determined using an unmatched ordinary one-way ANOVA test or a matched repeated measures (RM) one-way ANOVA test with Tukeys correction when distribution was normal, and either an unmatched KruskalWallis test or a matched Friedman test with Dunns correction when distribution was not normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0g and 7.0c (GraphPad Software).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
