SHPRH regulates rRNA transcription by recognizing the histone code in an mTOR-dependent manner  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Significance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which composes the ribosome with other proteins, is tightly regulated to maintain the right number of ribosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many DNA repair proteins have functions in addition to their role in DNA repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide evidence that SHPRH functioning in DNA repair at stalled DNA replication forks recognizes epigenetic histone codes of rDNA through its plant homeodomain (PHD) and modulates 47S rRNA transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH bound to rDNA promoters and promoted RNA polymerase I recruitment for rRNA transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH localization to the rDNA promoter was inhibited by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4, which is a mark of the rDNA promoter at poised status on starvation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, we suggest a mechanism controlling 47S rRNA transcription by SHPRH in a histone methylation-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Many DNA repair proteins have additional functions other than their roles in DNA repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to catalyzing PCNA polyubiquitylation in response to the stalling of DNA replication, SHPRH has the additional function of facilitating rRNA transcription by localizing to the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) promoter in the nucleoli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH was recruited to the rDNA promoter using its plant homeodomain (PHD), which interacts with histone H3 when the fourth lysine of H3 is not trimethylated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH enrichment at the rDNA promoter was inhibited by cell starvation, by treatment with actinomycin D or rapamycin, or by depletion of CHD4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH also physically interacted with the RNA polymerase I complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, we provide evidence that SHPRH functions in rRNA transcription through its interaction with histone H3 in a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

SHPRH_Forms_Starvation-Induced_Foci_in_the_Nucleoli_in_an_mTOR-Dependent_Manner  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SHPRH and HLTF, homologs of yeast Rad5, were previously identified as E3 ubiquitin ligases that catalyze the polyubiquitylation of PCNA and participate in methyl methane sulfonate (MMS)-induced DNA damage repair (2628).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to yeast in which Rad5-deficiency causes high sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, silencing expression of SHPRH or HLTF in human cells or knockouts of SHPRH and HLTF in mice showed mild or no severe sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, respectively (2931) (Fig S1 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we hypothesized that SHPRH would have a function other than DNA damage repair in mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore alternative functions, we first determined cellular localization of SHPRH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH was detected in the nucleus, as well as in the chromatin-bound fraction, when stained with an antibody (3F8) that specifically detects SHPRH (Fig 1A and Fig S2 AC and S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When cells were cultured for several days without changing media, SHPRH formed nucleolar foci, as judged by colocalization with a nucleolar protein, Fibrillarin, and these foci were not detected in fresh growth media (Fig 1 AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
If SHPRH foci were formed as a result of DNA damage in long culture condition, they should colocalize with other DNA damage-induced foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found no evidence that SHPRH colocalized with DNA damage response proteins, including phospho-RPA32, H2AX, pol , pol , PCNA, phospho-CHK1, 53BP1, XPA, and BRCA1 (Fig S4 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there were no SHPRH foci after treatment of cells with 60 J/m2 UV irradiation or 0.01% MMS treatment unless cells were cultured for several days before treatment (Fig S4 C and D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HP1 is a major heterochromatin protein associated with nucleolar regions (32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of nucleolar SHPRH foci did not overlap with HP1 (Fig S4E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
SHPRH foci became more distinct in cells cultured for several days without changing growth media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that cells experiencing nutrient restriction would generate SHPRH foci in the nucleolus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our hypothesis, when cells were starved by incubating in HBSS, or treated with 2.5 g/mL rapamycin that blocks the mTOR pathway and mimics starvation conditions (17, 18, 33), SHPRH foci were clearly detected in the nucleoli (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starvation in HBSS did not increase DNA damage responses, including phosphorylation of RPA32 and CHK1; thus, the nucleolar SHPRH foci were not induced by DNA damage responses in starved condition (Fig S4F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starvation or rapamycin treatment did not change SHPRH level, suggesting SHPRH foci formation on starvation was not a result of the induction of SHPRH protein level (Fig S4 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then investigated kinetics of nucleolar foci formation on starvation condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH began forming nucleolar foci 2 h after cells were incubated in HBSS media (Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When HBSS media was replaced with normal growth media, the number of nucleolar SHPRH foci decreased in a time-dependent manner (Fig 1E and Fig S4I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, SHPRH forms nucleolar foci in response to inhibition of the mTOR pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SHPRH_Interacts_with_the_Ribosomal_DNA_Promoter_in_an_mTOR-Dependent_Manner  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The mTOR-dependent pathway promotes ribosomal biogenesis and inhibits autophagy (17, 18, 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple repeated ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clusters are localized in the nucleoli, and some of them are actively transcribed (Fig 2A) (2, 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because SHPRH was found in the chromatin-bound fraction and localized in the nucleoli (Fig 1A and Fig S3), we investigated whether SHPRH would bind to specific regions of ribosomal DNA (Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When SHPRH was cross-linked with chromatin and immunoprecipitated, a ribosomal DNA promoter (H42.9) was enriched in precipitates (Fig 2B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not detect the enrichment of the H42.9 region in precipitates of cells whose SHPRH expression was silenced by shRNA, suggesting the enrichment of SHPRH was specific (Fig 2B and Fig S2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments with two different human cell lines, K562 and HEK293, showed enrichment of SHPRH on the rDNA promoter (Fig S5 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because starvation or rapamycin treatment induced the formation of nucleolar SHPRH foci (Fig 1 B and C), we next investigated whether enrichment of SHPRH at the rDNA promoter is also affected by starvation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH enrichment at the promoter of rDNA was reduced on starvation (Fig 2C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, starvation as well as rapamycin treatment caused SHPRH enrichment at different locations in rDNA, including H8 (Fig S5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneously, a modified chromatin marker, H3 K4me2, was increased at rDNA H8 and decreased at rDNA H42.9 (Fig S5 CE), suggesting SHPRH is redistributed from the rDNA promoter to a different region in the rDNA cluster and forms foci structures when cells were starved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we compared the location of SHPRH foci with UBF, which binds to active rDNA (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although fewer nucleolar proteins and foci of SHPRH were found compared with those of UBF, which is an essential factor for rDNA transcription (36), SHPRH foci were partially colocalized with or outside the UBF positive regions (Fig S5 FH and Movie S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative occupancies of UBF in the rRNA transcribed region (H1H13) were decreased in starved cells where SHPRH was redistributed from the rDNA promoter (Fig S5I).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, starvation induces relocalization of SHPRH to other regions from the active rDNA promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH also interacted with other promoters that are not related to rDNA transcription, although no significant change in their mRNA level by SHPRH depletion was detected (Fig S5 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, when the mTOR pathway is inhibited by starvation or rapamycin, SHPRH is released from the rDNA promoter and forms nucleolar foci at a different location in the nucleoli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

The_PHD_of_SHPRH_Interacts_with_Histone_H3_When_Lysine_4_of_H3_Is_Not_Trimethylated  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In contrast to yeast Rad5 or human HLTF, SHPRH has a PHD (22, 28), which is generally known to interact with specifically modified histone H3 (Fig 3A) (3739).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine specificity of the interaction between SHPRH and histones, individually purified histone proteins were incubated with purified SHPRH (Fig S6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to other proteins containing a PHD, only histone H3 was coprecipitated with a full-length SHPRH (Fig 3B and Fig S6B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the interaction between SHPRH and histone H3 in more detail, interactions between GST-conjugated SHPRH PHD (GST-PHD) and differentially methylated histone H3 peptides were monitored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike GST protein, which did not bind to any H3 peptide, GST-PHD interacted with various histone H3 peptides except the lysine 4 trimethylated H3 (H3 K4me3) peptide (Fig 3C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trimethylation of lysine enhances the hydrophobicity of lysine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that the hydrophilic lysine 4 of H3 would be important for the interaction with SHPRH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, mutant H3 peptides (H3 K4A and H3 K9A) lacking hydrophilicity in their lysine residue were used to study in vitro interactions (Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the interaction between H3 K9me3 and H3 K9A peptides with GST-PHD, both H3 K4me3 and H3 K4A did not interact with GST-PHD, suggesting that trimethylation at K4 with a high hydrophobicity inhibited the interaction between H3 and SHPRH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
There are two major classes of PHDs (38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first class of PHD found in BPTF and ING2 interacts with histone H3 carrying K4me3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second class of PHD found in CHD4 and PHF21A interacts with unmodified, K4me, or K4me2 H3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Negatively charged amino acids such as glutamate or aspartate in the PHD are critical for its interaction with histones (40, 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine whether this requirement for a negatively charged amino acid in the PHD is conserved in SHPRH, we aligned the SHPRH PHD with other PHDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a critical amino acid, a glutamate at amino acid residue 660 (E660) in SHPRH, aligned with negatively charged amino acids of PHDs that interact with unmodified, K4me, or K4me2 H3 (Fig 3E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When E660 of SHPRH was mutated to a neutral amino acid, alanine (A) or tyrosine (Y), the mutant SHPRH PHDs no longer interacted with histone H3 in vitro (Fig 3F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the exogenously expressed SHPRH PHD mutant protein (E660A) showed less interaction with H3 K4me2 (Fig S6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the in vitro interactions between H3 and SHPRH, in vivo immunoprecipitation with crosslinking by a histone H3 K4me2 antibody coprecipitated SHPRH, but not with a H3 K4me3 antibody (Fig 3G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
We next investigated whether the SHPRH PHD is important for the enrichment of SHPRH at the promoter of rDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localization of ectopically expressed wild-type and mutant SHPRH (E660A) proteins at the rDNA promoter was monitored by ChIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, although the ectopically expressed wild-type SHPRH protein was enriched at the rDNA promoter, the E660A SHPRH mutant was not (Fig 4A and Fig S6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Unlike most promoters where H3 K4me3 represents an active state, H3 K4me3 at the rDNA promoter denotes a poised state, whereas H3 K4me2 with acetylated H4 represents the active state (16, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH is enriched at the rDNA promoter and released from it on starvation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesized that SHPRH depletion or starvation would change the status of methylation in H3 from K4me2 to K4me3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H3 K4me3 at the rDNA promoter was increased and H3 K4me2 decreased after depletion of SHPRH, or on starvation (Fig 4 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our data, it has been reported that the occupancy of H3 K4me3 at the rDNA promoter is increased by serum deprivation (16, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that the PHD of SHPRH is important for the enrichment of SHPRH at the rDNA promoter by recognizing histone codes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SHPRH_Up-Regulates_47S_rRNA_Transcription  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Because SHPRH is recruited to the rDNA promoter, we hypothesized that SHPRH would affect the level of pre-rRNA transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, depletion of SHPRH with two individual siRNAs that target the 3 UTR of SHPRH reduced 47S pre-rRNA levels (Fig 5A and Fig S7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, SHPRH overexpression increased 47S pre-rRNA levels (Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibition of the mTOR pathway by starvation or by the treatment with rapamycin similarly reduced 47S pre-rRNA levels, and there was no additive or synergistic reduction of pre-rRNA levels by SHPRH depletion (Fig 5C and Fig S7B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, SHPRH enhances the level of 47S pre-rRNA in an mTOR-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two possible ways that SHPRH could increase 47S pre-rRNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One is to enhance pre-rRNA transcription, so as to produce newly synthesized rRNA, and the other is to increase the stability of existing pre-rRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which process is promoted by SHPRH, we measured newly transcribed nascent rRNA by pulse-labeling cells with BrUTP that were detected in situ (44) after SHPRH knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that depletion of SHPRH reduced the level of newly transcribed rRNA in situ (Fig 5D and Fig S7C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, starved cells showed low levels of newly transcribed nascent rRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no obvious synergistic or additive effect on the level of pre-rRNA or newly transcribed nascent rRNA on starvation and depletion of SHPRH (Fig 5 C and D and Fig S7 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our observations indicate that SHPRH promotes pre-rRNA transcription and is directly inhibited by starvation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

SHPRH_Interacts_with_and_Regulates_RNA_Polymerase_I_Complex  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
RNA polymerase I transcribes 47S pre-rRNA (13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rRNA transcription is directly controlled by transcription factors, as well as indirectly controlled by epigenetic factors (3, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because SHPRH interacted with the active rDNA promoter and increased rRNA transcription, it is possible that SHPRH could directly control rRNA transcription through an interaction with the RNA polymerase I complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore examined an interaction between SHPRH and the RNA polymerase I complex by coimmunoprecipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH-myc-His was induced in a cell line containing a stable doxycycline-inducible SHPRH construct and was immunoprecipitated with anti-6xHis antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RNA polymerase I subunit, RPA194, UBF that functions to activate RNA polymerase I (13, 45) and histone H3, but not Fibrillarin, was specifically coprecipitated with SHPRH (Fig 6A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Serial deletion mutant analysis of SHPRH revealed that amino acids between 784 and 1,288 amino acids were responsible for the interaction with RNA polymerase I (Fig S8 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, SHPRH without this region could not induce pre-rRNA transcription (Fig S8C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH harboring a point mutation in the PHD or really interesting new gene (RING) domain could not induce pre-rRNA transcription, although they still interacted with RNA polymerase I (Fig S8 B, D, and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ChIP experiment showed that RNA polymerase I recruitment to rDNA promoter was down-regulated by SHPRH depletion or starvation (Fig 6 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, SHPRH overexpression increased the recruitment of RNA polymerase I to the rDNA promoter (H42.9) and the level of pre-rRNA, which was not observed with the SHPRH PHD mutant (E660A) or RING mutant (C1432A; Fig 6D and Fig S8 D and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes of SHPRH PHD mutant or RING mutant's localization would be a result of defects of these mutant proteins localizing to the rDNA promoter (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under starved condition, the interaction between SHPRH and RNA polymerase I was decreased (Fig 6E and Fig S8 F and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the PHD and RING domains of SHPRH and its potential cooperation with RNA polymerase I are important for rRNA transcription by recognizing the status of rDNA promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

CHD4_Mediates_the_Relocalization_of_SHPRH_at_the_rDNA_Promoter  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
CHD4/NuRD establishes a poised status of rDNA that pauses rDNA transcription by specific histone modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In starved cells, the amount of CHD4-occupied and poised rDNA marked by H3 K4me3 is increased and RNA polymerase I binding on the rDNA is reduced (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of CHD4 expression decreases the level of H3 K4me3 and increases the CpG-methylation in the rDNA promoter, which results in the inactivation of rDNA (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When CHD4 expression was silenced, targeting of SHPRH to the rDNA promoter was also diminished, which is consistent with the involvement of SHPRH at the active rDNA promoter (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was an increase of H3 K4me2 at H8 rDNA and decrease of H3 K4me2 at H42.9 rDNA when CHD4 was depleted, which would facilitate SHPRH relocalization (Fig S9 A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simultaneous knockdown of SHPRH and CHD4 did not further decrease pre-rRNA transcription (Fig 7B), supporting the cooperation of pre-rRNA transcription by SHPRH and CHD4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether blocking rRNA transcription alone would be enough to dissociate SHPRH from the rDNA promoter, SHPRH was monitored after cells were treated with the rRNA transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D. Although SHPRH did not significantly accumulate at the H8 region, SHPRH dissociated from rDNA promoter H42.9 by inhibition of rRNA transcription (Fig S9C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, epigenetic changes in rDNA, as well as inhibition of rRNA transcription, appear to affect the relocalization of SHPRH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, we concluded that CHD4 changes the status of the rDNA promoter to control rDNA transcription and the influences on SHPRH for rRNA transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
In this study, we present an unexpected role for SHPRH in rRNA transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH was enriched at the rDNA promoter in the nucleoli, where SHPRH promoted pre-rRNA transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhanced pre-rRNA transcription by SHPRH depends on the nutrient state of the cell and CHD4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH accumulates at the active rDNA promoters to assist the recruitment of RNA polymerase I for pre-rRNA transcription, whereas SHPRH is displaced from the rDNA promoter when histone H3 is trimethylated at K4 and relocalized to other rDNA sites including the H8 region of rDNA (Fig S10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
The majority of DNA damage repair proteins were identified and studied in depth after cells were challenged with DNA-damaging agents (46, 47).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After DNA damage, many DNA repair proteins are redistributed in cells in response to posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and acetylation, or their level is increased (48, 49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some repair proteins are nevertheless expressed at high levels in the absence of DNA damage, suggesting they may be required for other cellular functions in the absence of DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the nonhomologous end joining DNA repair pathway functions during the development of lymphocytes (50) and variable, diversity and joining gene segments recombination that is required to produce antibody and T-cell receptor diversity (51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, nucleotide excision repair proteins participate in transcriptional activation in the absence of DNA damage (52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Embryonic lethality through the inactivation of many DNA repair proteins suggests those proteins are important for rapid proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, knockout of the Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene leads to early embryonic lethality in mice (53).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although human ATAD5 regulates the level of ubiquitylated PCNA in response to DNA damage (54), ATAD5 also regulates the lifespan of DNA replication factories by modulating the level of PCNA on chromatin (55, 56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH is also expressed in most tissues regardless of exogenous DNA damage (57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although SHPRH and HLTF catalyze the ubiquitylation of PCNA, which is important for DNA damage bypass, disruption of SHPRH and HLTF genes in mice did not cause a significant cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our current study suggests that the regulation of pre-rRNA transcription by SHPRH would be an alternative function of SHPRH in addition to the DNA damage response and repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this function of SHPRH, a ubiquitylating activity is also required, as the RING domain mutation of SHPRH no longer recruited RNA polymerase I to the rDNA promoter, although the RING domain itself was not required for interaction (Fig 6D and Fig S8 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the regulation of pre-rRNA transcription by SHPRH requires proteinprotein interaction, as well as ubiquitylation activity of SHPRH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Histone codes, also known as epigenetic codes, have begun to emerge as an additional important signature affecting gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loci of rDNA are also modified with diverse histone methylations and acetylation (45, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regulation of pre-rRNA transcription by SHPRH through the interaction between the PHD of SHPRH and the histone codes suggests rRNA expression is also tightly regulated via different histone codes and their interacting proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lysine 4 trimethylation of histone H3, which is typically coded for active transcription by RNA polymerase II, is differently recognized in rRNA transcription as a poised epigenetic marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CHD4/NuRD is associated with such poised rRNA genes and protects the methylation-dependent inactivation of rDNA (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NuRD complex also has activities of ATP-dependent nucleosome disruption and histone deacetylation activities that usually result in the deactivation of transcriptional activity (59, 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starvation turns off rRNA transcription by dissociating SHPRH together with the RNA polymerase I complex from the rDNA promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, when cells are differentiated or in serum depletion, the level of H3 K4me3 in rDNA is increased (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CHD4 establishes the poised rDNA, a depletion of CHD4 causes the up-regulation of H4 acetylation and rDNA methylation, which result in the down-regulation of rDNA transcription (16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, CHD4 depletion might make rDNA devoid of rRNA transcription machinery despite histone acetylation, which leads to the dissociation of SHPRH from the rDNA promoter (Fig 7A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in CHD4-depleted cells, the H3K4me2 was increased at a nonpromoter rDNA region, including H8, and decreased at rDNA promoter H42.9 (Fig S9 A and B), which can drive the redistribution of SHPRH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the role of SHPRH at the rDNA promoter for rRNA transcription can be suppressed through the establishment of constitutive heterochromatins in association with CHD4 depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
NuRD complexes and CHD4 are important during embryonic development, carcinogenesis, and starvation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, theses complexes are recruited to damaged DNA and appear to regulate DNA damage responses (6163).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of such diverse effects of the CHD4 and NuRD complexes in modulating histone signatures, it is possible that the methylation-dependent localization of SHPRH would not be restricted to rRNA gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHPRH might affect gene regulation in DNA that has differential histone signatures caused by DNA damage, gene silencing, development, or differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, SHPRH is widely distributed in the nucleus, and most of the SHPRH was detected in the chromatin bound fraction (Fig 1A and Fig S3) and localized at the promoters of several genes, although the significance of such localization is not understood at the present time (Fig S5 J and K).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Starvation or rapamycin treatment induced nucleolar SHPRH foci (Fig 1 B and C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The foci represent SHPRH relocalization and accumulation outside of the rDNA promoter because SHPRH dissociates from the rDNA promoter either on starvation or on treatment of rapamycin without changing the level of SHPRH protein (Fig 2C and Fig S4 G and H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of SHPRH increased the frequency of MMS-induced chromosomal breaks (22, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In yeast, the number of rDNA repeats is regulated during aging (64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that accumulation of SHPRH on starvation could suppress genomic instability in repeated rDNA through recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is not clear whether the number of rDNA repeats in mammals are changed during aging, it is possible that starvation-induced SHPRH foci could reflect a structure of antirecombination in the nucleoli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is an intriguing idea, as such regulatory mechanisms could indirectly connect to the longevity regulation of the mTOR pathway (65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, starvation-induced SHPRH foci could be a simple reservoir of unnecessary proteins before its degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, during starvation or autophagy, nonessential proteins lose their activity and are degraded (66).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this notion, on 24 h-starvation, the level of SHPRH protein was slightly decreased, suggesting it is being degraded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
An abnormality of ribosome biogenesis is linked with many genetic diseases, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia and 5q syndrome (8, 67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins would directly affect ribosomal functions in protein translation and could result in anemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the causative mutations of a large portion of these anemic diseases have not been identified (68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is possible that mutations in genes regulating rRNA transcription or expression of ribosomal protein would be causative mutations affecting the remaining anemic patients whose mutations have not been identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there was no clear anemic phenotype in Shprh/ mice under normal growing conditions, it is possible that stress or nutrient challenge could induce an anemic condition or nonanemic diseases in Shprh/ mice; for example, Treacher Collins syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hematopoietic system, differential methylation on H3 lysine 4 also marks active or poised hematopoietic genes and determines the lineage of hematopoietic development (69).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that SHPRH could function in hematopoietic systems as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
Taken together, we demonstrate a regulatory function of SHPRH in 47S ribosomal RNA transcription through the specific recognition of histone codes in the rDNA promoter, with the cooperation of the chromosomal remodeler, CHD4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#
