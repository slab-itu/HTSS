A RuBisCO-mediated carbon metabolic pathway in methanogenic archaea  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Two enzymes are considered to be unique to the photosynthetic CalvinBenson cycle: ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), responsible for CO2 fixation, and phosphoribulokinase (PRK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some archaea possess bona fide RuBisCOs, despite not being photosynthetic organisms, but are thought to lack PRK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate the existence in methanogenic archaea of a carbon metabolic pathway involving RuBisCO and PRK, which we term reductive hexulose-phosphate (RHP) pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These archaea possess both RuBisCO and a catalytically active PRK whose crystal structure resembles that of photosynthetic bacterial PRK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometric analysis of metabolites reveals that the RHP pathway, which differs from the CalvinBenson cycle only in a few steps, is active in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work highlights evolutionary and functional links between RuBisCO-mediated carbon metabolic pathways in methanogenic archaea and photosynthetic organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the RHP pathway allows for autotrophy (that is, growth exclusively with CO2 as carbon source) remains unknown.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'To date, six mechanisms have been identified for carbon fixation1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, members of Archaea are believed to be able to use three, namely dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate cycle, hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutyrate cycle, and reductive acetyl-CoA pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reductive acetyl-CoA pathway has been discussed as a model of the primordial CO2-fixing mechanism1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CalvinBenson cycle is the predominant photosynthetic CO2-fixing pathway2; however, it is considered to be an evolutionary late innovation and has not been reported in Archaea1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CalvinBenson cycle consists of three phases: carbon fixation, carbon reduction, and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this cycle, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) fixes CO2 with RuBP to yield 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), from which RuBP is regenerated3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phosphoribulokinase (PRK) synthesizes RuBP from ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) in the final step in RuBP regeneration3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RuBisCO and PRK are representative and unique enzymes of the photosynthetic CalvinBenson cycle5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, approximately half of the members of archaea that have currently been sequenced have a conserved gene for bona fide RuBisCO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, PRK genes and PRK activity have not been detected in Archaea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative pathway distinct from the CalvinBenson cycle may thus be present in Archaea to synthesize RuBP from either 5-phospho-D-ribose-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) or nucleoside 5-monophosphate (NMP) via common ribose-1,5-bisphosphate6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pathways are not cyclic and cannot regenerate RuBP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pentose bisphosphate pathway to generate RuBP as substrate for RuBisCO from nucleosides or NMP has been especially well characterized in Thermococcus kodakarensis and is thought to be involved in nucleoside assimilation and degradation7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we report a carbon metabolic pathway involving RuBisCO and PRK that can regenerate RuBP in methanogenic archaea.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'The results of our in vitro and in vivo experiments support the idea that RuBisCO and PRK function in the RHP pathway to fix CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that this pathway was the major mode of CO2 fixation in M. hungatei under our experimental heterotrophic conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, the 13C-atom labelling rate was much lower and the pool size of 3-PGA much smaller compared with observations in photosynthetic organisms39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that investment of energy in the RHP pathway is much smaller compared with that invested by plants and cyanobacteria in the CalvinBenson cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methanogenic archaea carry out methanogenesis with a low energy output compared with photosystems in photosynthesis, which is consistent with the observation that M. hungatei RuBisCO and PRK activities were much lower than those of photosynthetic organisms (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the regeneration of RuBP during the RHP pathway, carbon is fixed as formaldehyde; one molecule of CO2 is reduced to one molecule of formaldehyde using three molecules of ATP and two molecules of NAD(P)H (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that methanogenic archaea thrive under extreme energy limitation, RuBP regeneration may incur a high energy cost for these species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy yield of methanogenesis under standard conditions is estimated to be 131 kJ mol1 of methane produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under ecological conditions of 110 Pa H2, the energy yield is lower at 1535 kJ mol1 and this is insufficient for the synthesis of 1 mol of ATP per 1 mol of methane produced41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methanogenesis coupled with ATP synthesis depends on substrate H2 concentrations42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, RuBP regeneration can probably work under conditions where methanogenesis is sufficiently active to produce enough energy for the RHP pathway and other pathways essential for growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our experimental conditions included high hydrogen and CO2 concentrations, which should sustain active methanogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a heterotrophic medium containing formate, acetate, yeast extract and trypticase peptone was used for culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although M. hungatei can grow under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions43, a heterotrophic medium has been established for a suitable pure culture of M. hungatei in laboratories and enables to grow with higher rate than autotrophic medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These heterotrophic conditions might also provide energy for the RHP pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether the RHP pathway allows for autotrophy, that is, growth exclusively with CO2 as carbon source, is unknown at present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CEMS analysis showed that a large proportion of the carbon fixed by RuBisCO flowed to gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, and that a small fraction of this carbon was released as formaldehyde in RuBP regeneration (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the metabolic flux of RuBP regeneration in the RHP pathway was small and required relatively low energy, which can be sustained by energy obtained from methanogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the energetics of the RHP pathway in methanogenic archaea under ecological conditions remains to be addressed further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The RHP pathway supplies fixed carbon to other important metabolic pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CEMS analysis showed that the RHP pathway provides a large proportion of fixed carbon to gluconeogenesis and glycolysis via F6P and 3-PGA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RHP pathway also provides Ru5P, which is isomerized to ribose-5-phosphate before use, for nucleotide biosynthesis (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Production of Ru5P is likely to be completely dependent on the RHP pathway (Fig 4) because M. hungatei, like most members of the Archaea, does not contain the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effluxes of intermediates from the RHP pathway necessitate their replenishment by anaplerotic reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is replenishment of 3-PGA from acetyl-CoA, and M. hungatei possesses genes for enzymes to catalyse metabolic steps from acetyl-CoA to 3-PGA, including pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (Mhun0450,  subunit; Mhun0451,  subunit; Mhun0452,  subunit; and Mhun0453,  subunit), phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (Mhun2610), phosphopyruvate hydratase (Mhun1018, Mhun1101 and Mhun2893), and phosphoglycerate mutase (Mhun0447 and Mhun2324).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CEMS data suggested that this metabolic flow had little or no contribution to replenishment of 3-PGA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  M. hungatei possesses conserved genes for the pentose bisphosphate pathway to synthesize RuBP from nucleosides or NMP (Supplementary Table 1), suggesting that RuBP may be provided by both the RHP pathway and the pentose bisphosphate pathway (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterotrophic medium used in our experiments provides nucleosides and NMP for the anaplerotic pentose bisphosphate pathway, to supply RuBP to the RHP pathway, as previously reported in Thermococcus kodakaraensis9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the pentose bisphosphate pathway may act as an anaplerotic pathway for the RHP pathway under our experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Formaldehyde released from the RHP pathway can be condensed by Fae with tetrahydromethanopterin to form methylene tetrahydromethanopterin, an intermediate in both the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway and methanogenesis for energy production, another pathway for CO2 fixation (Fig 4)1,41,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The M. hungatei HPS is fused to Fae, which might immediately capture formaldehyde35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Archaea that have genes for the RHP pathway (except Aciduliprofundum boonei) either possess homologous genes for HPS and Fae (for example, in Ferroglobus placidus, Methanosaeta harundinacea, M. concilii and M. marisnigri) or have a gene that encodes a fused HSP/Fae protein (in other 10 species), similar to M. hungatei (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Almost all archaea harbouring the RHP pathway possess a conserved Fae/HPS fusion protein (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that HPS and Fae are fused indicates that Fae might recover formaldehyde released from the RHP pathway and supply it to the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway and methanogenesis (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fusion of HPS and Fae might minimize carbon loss and supply reduced carbon to the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway and methanogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CEMS data showed that acetyl-CoA was not converted to 3-PGA via pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase, phosphoenolpyruvate synthase, phosphopyruvate hydratase, and phosphoglycerate mutase (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is expected that formaldehyde is incorporated into acetyl-CoA in the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway and then converted to lipid via the mevalonate pathway, which is the archaeal isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the metabolomic analysis used in our study could not follow carbon from formaldehyde to methane and acetyl-CoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clarify these issues, a metabolomic analysis system specific for metabolites produced by these pathways will need to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Many methanogenic archaea contain conserved genes for enzymes in the RHP pathway, including RuBisCO and PRK, and for the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pathways are thus expected to be widely distributed in methanogenic archaea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyperthermophilic archaea of the genera Archaeoglobus and Ferroglobus also contain genes for RHP pathway enzymes (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These archaea also have conserved genes for methanogenesis; they can produce trace amounts of methane46 and have a reductive acetyl-CoA pathway1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that a metabolic link exists between the RHP pathway and the methanogenesis/reductive acetyl-CoA pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Evolutionary acquisition of the photosynthetic CalvinBenson cycle has had a major impact on the global carbon cycle47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RHP pathway and the CalvinBenson cycle only differ in a few steps, namely from F6P to Ru5P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results shed light on evolutionary and functional links between carbon metabolic pathways involving RuBisCO in methanogenic archaea and photosynthetic organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the photosynthetic CalvinBenson cycle may have originated from a primitive carbon metabolic pathway utilizing RuBisCO, such as the archaeal RHP pathway, by replacement of some steps without release of carbon.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
