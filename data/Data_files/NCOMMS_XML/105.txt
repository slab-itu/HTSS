Sea-level feedback lowers projections of future Antarctic Ice-Sheet mass loss  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The stability of marine sectors of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) in a warming climate has been identified as the largest source of uncertainty in projections of future sea-level rise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sea-level fall near the grounding line of a retreating marine ice sheet has a stabilizing influence on the ice sheets, and previous studies have established the importance of this feedback on ice age AIS evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a coupled ice sheetsea-level model to investigate the impact of the feedback mechanism on future AIS retreat over centennial and millennial timescales for a range of emission scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the combination of bedrock uplift and sea-surface drop associated with ice-sheet retreat significantly reduces AIS mass loss relative to a simulation without these effects included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitivity analyses show that the stabilization tends to be greatest for lower emission scenarios and Earth models characterized by a thin elastic lithosphere and low-viscosity upper mantle, as is the case for West Antarctica.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) has the potential to make a significant contribution to future sea-level rise1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-scale collapse of some marine sectors of the AIS may already be underway2,3,4,5, but the timing and extent of future retreat is uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marine-based sectors of the AIS gain most of their mass through precipitation and lose mass by ice outflux at the grounding line6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ice-sheet mass loss leads to a sea-level (that is, water depth) fall at the grounding line, both because of post-glacial rebound of the unloaded crust and a drop in sea surface height as water migrates away from the ice sheet because of reduced gravitational attraction7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ice flux is highly sensitive to ice thickness at the grounding line of a marine ice sheet6, which is in turn proportional to the depth of water there.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the aforementioned sea-level fall reduces the ice outflux at the grounding line and acts as a stabilizing influence on the ice sheet9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies of the effect have focused on the long-term, ice age evolution of the AIS (and other ice sheets) using coupled ice sheetsea-level models of varying complexity (for example, see refs 10, 11, 12, 13 for details), and all have verified the universality of the self-stabilizing mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we apply the most advanced type of these models11,14 to explore, for the first time, the impact of the sea-level feedback on projections of AIS collapse under a wide range of future emission scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also adopt several models of the Earths viscoelastic structure in the sea-level modelling to capture the range of gravitational, rotational and bedrock deformational responses to the ice-ocean mass redistribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that long timescale, large spatial scale ice-sheet modelling studies include treatments of bedrock deformation (for example, see refs 14, 15, 16, 17 for details), but recent regional studies of future AIS retreat over up to hundreds of years have kept the bedrock elevation fixed (for example, see refs 2, 5 for details), and none of these studies have included gravitational effects on sea level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that sea-level changes associated with gravitational effects and deformation of the solid Earth may impact future Antarctic ice-sheet evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the adopted viscoelastic Earth structure influences the size and timing of the impact of the sea-level feedback.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

emissions scenario is characterized by a loss of 2.8 × 106 km3 of ice by the end of the simulation, which corresponds to a global average sea-level equivalent (GSLE; which we define at a given time as the globally averaged sea-level rise after all solid surface depressions, that is, negative topography, left behind by marine sectors freed of ice at that time in the model simulation, are filled with melt water) of 3.8 m (Fig 1a, black line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About half of this GSLE rise (1.9 m) is reached after just 1 kyr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the sea-level feedback is incorporated into the simulation, the sea-level rise is reduced by 50% after 200 years, 500 years and 1 kyr, and by 20%, to 3.1 m, after 5 kyr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the case of the 4 × CO2 emission scenario, over the first kyr, the coupled model (Fig 1bsolid red line) predicts that nearly all of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) collapses (Fig 1e) with some additional peripheral retreat of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) relative to the 2 × CO2 case (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incorporation of the sea-level feedback lowers the AIS contribution to predicted future sea-level rise by 30% after 200 and 500 years, 25% after 1 kyr, and by 50%, from 7.8 to 3.7 m GSLE, after 5 kyr (Fig 1b, black versus solid red lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These trends continue when considering the 8 × CO2 simulations, in which complete collapse of the WAIS, and extensive areas of the EAIS, occurs (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the GSLE rise is 9 m after 1 kyr and 13.9 m after 5 kyr using the HV Earth model (Fig 1c); these represent reductions of 0 and 25% relative to the sea-level rise computed in the control run.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that local sea-level (bedrock and sea surface height) changes associated with ice-sheet collapse will have a significant impact on future AIS retreat in a warmer world on both centennial and millennial timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In performing the above simulations, we noted interesting behaviour in the 2 × CO2 scenario for runs with the HV Earth model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the system reached an unsteady equilibrium state at 1.3 kyr whereby small changes to the ice-sheet model set up (for example, adopting time stepping in the ice-sheet model of between 0.075 and 0.25 years, which has negligible impact on other simulations) led to changes in timing of significant retreat in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (Fig 1a; see also Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This retreat, equivalent to 1.5 m GLSE, occurred in all simulations with the 2 × CO2 emission scenario and the HV Earth model, but the onset of the retreat varied considerably (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results, which were not apparent for other emission scenarios or Earth models that we considered, imply that bedrock elevation and its evolution via sea-level change may be critical to grounding line migration in this region, and this suggests the need for future, high-resolution regional modelling and better constraints on bedrock conditions and elevation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Ice-sheet retreat and bedrock elevation changes in simulations including

underlain by a stable, thick craton, and in contrast, a large continental rift system and thin lithosphere lie below the WAIS20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, seismic tomography indicates strongly variable and anomalously slow wave speeds in the shallow mantle below WAIS, suggesting a hot, low-viscosity asthenosphere20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It follows that the HV model, derived from a global distribution of ice age data sets, may not be appropriate to simulations of AIS stability, in particular in West Antarctica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore this issue, we repeated our simulations using an Earth model (henceforth LVZ for low-viscosity zone) that is characterized by an elastic lithosphere of 50 km thickness, a zone of relatively low viscosity (1019 Pa s) from the base of the lithosphere to 200 km depth, and viscosities of 2 × 1020 and 3 × 1021 Pa s in the rest of the upper mantle and in the lower mantle, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Supplementary Fig1 for results using a suite of different Earth models of which the HV and LVZ models are end members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  )', 'Adopting the LVZ model increases the sea-level stabilization and reduces the predicted rise in GSLE for all emission scenarios as compared with the HV model, as viscous uplift takes place faster and deformation is more localized to the grounding line (compare the dashed and solid red lines in Fig 1ac, and ice distribution differences in Fig 1gi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 5 kyr, the LVZ simulations show a GSLE rise that is 1.52.5 m less for the 2 × CO2 emission scenario (where the upper bound of this range reflects the retreat of ice from the Amundsen Sea Embayment in the HV Earth model run but not in the LVZ run), 1 m less for the 4 × CO2 scenario and 4.3 m less for the 8 × CO2 scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate the origin of these differences, we compare changes in bedrock elevation predicted using the HV and LVZ Earth models in the first 0.9 kyr of the 2 × CO2 simulation (Fig 2b,c, respectively, see also Supplementary Fig 2), just before the ice cover in the two simulations (and the rise in GSLE) begins to significantly diverge (green star in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ice thickness after 0.9 kyr in the HV Earth model run (which is nearly identical to the thickness in the LVZ run) is shown in Fig 2a (left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the similarity in ice cover, the change in elevation of the bedrock relative to the sea surface in the ice-sheet model (or equivalently, the negative of the change in sea level) is markedly different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulation adopting the thin lithosphere, low asthenospheric viscosity Earth model LVZ has experienced larger and more localized bedrock uplift (contributing to sea-level fall) in the vicinity of the grounding line than the simulation based on model HV (compare Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the bedrock elevation near the grounding line in the latter simulation is up to 80 m lower than in the former.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A thicker lithosphere acts to dampen and smooth the peak uplift in areas of ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the presence of a low-viscosity zone localizes deformation, and decreases the decay time of the uplift so that significantly more viscous deformation occurs in the first 0.9 kyr of the simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the sea-level stabilization associated with the LVZ model is more pronounced and the associated changes in GSLE in the two simulations begin to diverge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the uplift of the bedrock near the grounding line in the LVZ case is sufficient to initiate an advance of the ice sheet, and a drop in GSLE beginning 1.5 kyr into that simulation (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Re-advance also occurs 2 kyr into the 4 × CO2 scenario for both Earth models (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the 8 × CO2 emission scenario, the ice-sheet evolution in the HV and LVZ model simulations begin to diverge after 0.6 kyr (Fig 2df, see also Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the 2 × CO2 case, the bedrock uplift (sea-level fall) is higher in amplitude and more localized near the grounding line in the LVZ model simulation relative to the HV case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in this case, the climate forcing is sufficiently strong that the ice volume plateaus after 1.5 kyr for both the LVZ and HV simulations rather than increasing (or, equivalently, the GSLE stays constant rather than falling beyond this point in the simulation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in this high-emission scenario, significant retreat occurs in marine sectors of the EAIS, where the HV model may represent the Earth structure better than the LVZ model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show the contributions from East and West Antarctica to the total Antarctic ice loss plotted in Fig 1a,c in Supplementary Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Impact of self-gravity on future ice loss', 'The glacial isostatic adjustment model predicts changes in sea level associated with rotational, gravitational and Earth deformational effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-gravitation in the (ice plus ocean) surface mass load and crustal deformation dominate the sea-level signal in the vicinity of an evolving ice sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These signals are coupled as self-gravitation influences the ocean load, which in turn drives crustal deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the importance of self-gravitation in our simulations, in Fig 3, we compare results generated using the coupled ice sheetsea-level model in a case where the solid Earth is rigid (that is, deformational effects are ignored; dashed black line) to earlier simulations in which the solid surface and sea surface are fixed (solid black line) or the full sea-level model that accounts for viscoelastic earth deformation is adopted (solid red line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the loss of gravitational attraction between the melting ice sheet and ocean (and the associated subsidence of the sea surface near the grounding line) contributes significantly to the stabilizing influence of the sea-level feedback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3:

self-gravitation in these coupled ice sheetsea-level simulations will depend on many factors, including the strength of the climate warming (for example, compare Fig 3a and b), viscoelastic Earth structure, bedrock configuration, and rate and spatial pattern of ice loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we note that the response of the system may depend strongly on initial conditions adopted in the simulations5,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any event, it is clear that gravitational effects on ocean mass redistribution should, in general, be considered in projections of ice-sheet stability.

of the linear increase in the forcing was set to 1 kyr (blue lines, Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the instantaneous warming scenario (red lines in Fig 1ac), most of the ice-sheet retreat takes place within the first 0.5 kyr (Fig 1c) to 1 kyr (Fig 1a) of the simulations, and this collapse is followed by a more gradual ongoing evolution of ice mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the greenhouse forcing is increased more gradually, over 1 kyr, the majority of the ice loss is delayed by 1 kyr, but the duration of the collapse phase is largely unaltered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (The phase of ice growth preceding the retreat in the 1 kyr climate ramp up (blue lines, Fig 1ac) is due to increased snowfall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  )', 'There are two timescales of importance to the ice-sheet collapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is the timescale for the break up of ice shelves that are buttressing the grounded portion of the ice sheet; this timescale is a strong function of temperature, and therefore, the greenhouse emission scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second is the timescale of ice-sheet collapse; this collapse is driven by the marine ice-sheet instability mechanism25,26, which depends primarily on geometry of the bed at the grounding line, and it is less sensitive to the level of climate and ocean warming3,6,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extend this analysis further, we performed a large suite of simulations in which the CO2 ramp-up time ranged from instantaneous to 3 kyr for each emission scenario and Earth model (Fig 4 and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, a larger climate forcing results in more ice loss, but the time over which the forcing is applied does not have a strong influence on the total ice loss at the end of the simulation (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sea-level feedback has greater impact on the amount of ice loss for larger climate forcing and to a lesser degree, for longer forcing timescales (Fig 4c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, as mentioned in

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The fate of the polar ice sheets in a progressively warming world is a focus of climate research and a concern for policy makers and the general public.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a coupled sea levelthree-dimensional ice-sheet model, we have demonstrated that sea-level changes associated with uplift of the solid Earth in response to reduced ice and ocean loading, and draw down of the sea surface because of gravitational effects discussed previously in the context of the last ice age11,12,13, may have a significant impact on future AIS mass loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in the predicted rise in GSLE will be a function of the climate forcing, with higher forcing associated with a smaller percentage drop in the GSLE rise (but a higher absolute decrease in GSLE) relative to simulations in which the stabilization is not included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the impact of the sea-level stabilization is also sensitive to the Earth model adopted to compute the load-induced deformation component of sea-level changes in the Antarctic region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, Earth models that are consistent with geological and seismological evidence for a thin lithosphere and low-viscosity zone beneath the WAIS predict less ice loss than Earth models that have been derived from analyses of globally distributed ice age data sets and are more representative of the structure beneath the EAIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future modelling developments to incorporate the strong lateral variations in viscoelastic structure beneath Antarctica and explore the impact of nonlinear Earth rheologies are clearly warranted28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations also show that bedrock elevation changes may be particularly critical to the future stability of grounded, marine-based sectors of ice in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, which are often identified as the strongest contenders for large-scale collapse in the coming centuries2,3,5,29, motivating the development of regional, high-resolution studies of ice sheetsea levelsolid Earth interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, we recommend that future ice model intercomparison studies in Antarctica (for example, ISMIP6 and MISOMIP ) should include a consideration of the impact of gravitational effects and variations in Earth structure.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
