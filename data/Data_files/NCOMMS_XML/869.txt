Ancient hybridization fuels rapid cichlid fish adaptive radiations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding why some evolutionary lineages generate exceptionally high species diversity is an important goal in evolutionary biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haplochromine cichlid fishes of Africas Lake Victoria region encompass  greater than 700 diverse species that all evolved in the last 150,000 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How this Lake Victoria Region Superflock could evolve on such rapid timescales is an enduring question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that hybridization between two divergent lineages facilitated this process by providing genetic variation that subsequently became recombined and sorted into many new species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the hybridization event generated exceptional allelic variation at an opsin gene known to be involved in adaptation and speciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, differentiation between new species is accentuated around variants that were fixed differences between the parental lineages, and that now appear in many new combinations in the radiation species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that hybridization between divergent lineages, when coincident with ecological opportunity, may facilitate rapid and extensive adaptive radiation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Heterogeneity in diversification rates among lineages is a major factor shaping biodiversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, biological and environmental factors underlying this variation are incompletely understood1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adaptive radiations are prime study systems to learn about these factors as they are characterized by a rapid origin of many species showing a diversity of ecological adaptations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process requires high levels of heritable variation in traits related to ecological and reproductive isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, adaptive radiations are often too rapid for the emergence of new relevant mutations between successive speciation events2 and are thus more likely to stem from standing variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hybridization between species can instantaneously boost genetic variation, which may facilitate speciation and adaptive radiation3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hybridization among members of an adaptive radiation, has been suggested to potentially facilitate speciation events, an idea known as the syngameon hypothesis3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Introgression of traits involved in adaptation or reproductive isolation has been demonstrated among members of several adaptive radiations (for example, traits related to host shift in Rhagoletis fruit flies10, wing patterns in Heliconius butterflies11,12 or beak shape in Darwins finches13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other radiations, the hybrid ancestry of some species has been inferred, but a direct link between introgressed traits and speciation awaits further testing (for example, cichlid fishes of Lakes Tanganyika14,15,16, Malawi17, Victoria18,19 and Barombi Mbo20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another hypothesis for a perhaps more fundamental role of hybridization in adaptive radiation, distinct from the syngameon hypothesis, is the idea that hybridization between distinct lineages may seed the onset of an entire adaptive radiation3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such hybridization can be common when allopatric lineages come into secondary contact4, and selection against hybrids may be weak during colonization of new environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this situation, the formation of a hybrid swarm, if coincident with ecological opportunity, may accelerate adaptive radiation by (i) providing functional genetic variation that can recombine into novel trait combinations favoured by selection and mate choice, and (ii) breaking genetic correlations that constrained the evolvability of parental lineages3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, hybridization may facilitate speciation when multiple fixed differences that confer reproductive isolation between the two parental species decouple and segregate in a hybrid swarm, such that selection against incompatible gene combinations can generate more than two new reproductively isolated species21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This hybrid swarm origin of adaptive radiation hypothesis has been more challenging to test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far the only adaptive radiation for which a hybrid origin has been robustly demonstrated is the Hawaiian silverswords, which have radiated from an allopolyploid hybrid population between two North American tarweed species24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because gene and genome duplication are also proposed to facilitate adaptive radiation25, it is difficult to distinguish between effects of hybridization per se and those of gene or genome duplication in this case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence consistent with a hybrid swarm origin of entire radiations has also been found in Alpine whitefish26, the mbuna group of the Lake Malawi cichlid fish radiation27, and allopolyploid Hawaiian endemic mints28,29 and possibly other polyploid plant radiations on Hawaii30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remains to be tested if, in these systems, hybridization occurred before or after the radiation had started, and if hybridization-derived polymorphisms played a role in speciation and adaptive diversification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Lake Victoria Region Superflock of cichlid fish (LVRS) is a group of 700 haplochromine cichlid species endemic to the region around Lake Victoria and nearby western rift lakes in East Africa that started diversifying about 100200 thousand years ago31,32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It includes several adaptive radiations, one in each of the major lakes of the region (Lakes Victoria, Edward, Albert and Kivu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest of them is in Lake Victoria, which has at least 500 endemic species that evolved in the past 15,000 years34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each radiation comprises enormous diversity in habitat occupation, trophic ecology, colouration and behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high diversification rate but also the high nuclear genomic variation in the LVRS despite its young age34,37 suggest that large amounts of standing genetic variation must have been present at the onset of the radiation2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work showing cytonuclear discordance in phylogenetic reconstructions between LVRS and several riverine cichlid species raised the possibility of ancient hybridization between divergent species at the base of the radiation but could not demonstrate it37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hybridization on secondary contact is not unlikely, as allopatric cichlid species, divergent by even millions of years, readily produce fertile offspring in the lab38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using genomic data from riverine haplochromine cichlids sampled from all major African drainage systems, and representative species from all lineages within the Lake Victoria region, we demonstrate here that the LVRS evolved from a hybrid swarm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All lake radiations show very similar proportions of mixed ancestry derived from two distantly related haplochromine lineages that had evolved in isolation from one another in different river systems for more than a million years before hybridizing in the Lake Victoria region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find evidence that this hybridization event facilitated subsequent adaptive radiation by providing genetic variation that has been recombined and sorted into many new species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants that were fixed between the parental lineages show accentuated differentiation between young Lake Victoria species, but appear in many new combinations in the different species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, each of the two major allele classes of an opsin gene involved in adaptation and speciation among Lake Victoria cichlids39,40 is likely derived from one of the two parental lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that a major part of the variation at this gene segregating in the LVRS stems from hybridization between these lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that hybridization between relatively distantly related species, when coincident with ecological opportunity, may facilitate rapid adaptive radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, hybridization, even in the distant past, may have important implications for understanding variation in extant species richness between lineages as well as variation in recent rates of diversification.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Identifying the closest relatives of the LVRS', 'To identify the closest relatives of the LVRS, we use comprehensive sampling of haplochromine cichlids from the LVRS and from all major river systems harbouring haplochromines (Fig 1, Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed from 3.15 Mb of concatenated restriction site associated DNA (RAD) sequences (436,166 SNPs, 8.1% missing data, Supplementary Data 2), and from two mitochondrial markers (1,897 bp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the nuclear phylogeny, the entire LVRS forms a well-supported clade that also includes cichlids from the lower Nile in Egypt (Haplochromis spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Egypt) and Haplochromis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nyangara from the Rusizi River, the outflow of Lake Kivu and an inflow to Lake Tanganyika (orange labels in Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 1, Supplementary Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Astatotilapia stappersi from the Kalambo River (an inflow to Lake Tanganyika, Congo drainage, referred to as Haplochromis sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chipwa in Meyer et al.41), and an undescribed Astatotilapia species from the middle Congo (A. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yaekama, DRC), together hereafter called the Congolese lineage (red labels), form the superflocks closest relatives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sister group to the LVRS plus the Congolese lineage taxa is a clade including lineages in endorheic (that is, closed) drainage systems of the Eastern Rift and in Indian Ocean drainage systems, east of the Lake Victoria region (Eastern taxa, dark blue), as well as Haplochromis gracilior from Lake Kivu and Thoracochromis pharyngalis from Lake Edward (light blue, Supplementary Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the latter two species are sympatric with LVRS members, they are clearly not part of the radiations themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to H. gracilior and T. pharyngalis as the Upper Nile lineage because all known members are confined to the region that was historically the uppermost Nile drainage37,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous publications33,43, we estimate the split of this lineage from the Congolese lineage to date to 1.65.8 million years ago, coincident with the uplift of the flanks of the Western branch of the East African Rift truncating the paleo-river network and isolating the LVR (the new Upper Nile) from the Congo (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Phylogenetic context of the Lake Victoria Region cichlid radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Maximum likelihood phylogeny built from

radiations within the LVRS (Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radiations in Lake Victoria (including its major tributary, the Kagera River), in Crater Lake Saka and associated Mpanga River, and in Lake Albert, each form monophyletic clades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the Lake Edward members of the LVRS are a paraphyletic group that includes taxa basal to the radiations of Lakes Victoria and Saka, and others that form a clade together with species from Lake Kivu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with the hypothesis34 that Lake Edward constitutes the oldest extant radiation within the LVRS, from which the radiations in the others lakes are derived, and that connections between Lakes Edward and Kivu existed until recently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tests of hybridization', 'Phylogenetic reconstruction based on concatenated sequence data assumes a single history across the genome, although recombination, incomplete lineage sorting, and introgressive hybridisation can cause extensive genome-wide variation in genealogy44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for such genealogical variation, we reconstructed a SNP based species tree45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting tree supports the sister relationship of the LVRS with the Congolese taxa, but reveals incongruence between this group and the Eastern clades and Upper Nile clade (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test for genetic admixture, we computed Pattersons D statistics (ABBA-BABA test)46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that all LVRS radiations show strong signals of admixture with the two Upper Nile species, H. gracilior and T. pharyngalis (Fig 2, Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excess allele sharing between the LVRS and either species is equally strong (Supplementary Table 3, rows 2.1-2.4, Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, neither H. gracilior nor T. pharyngalis show greater admixture with the LVRS species with which they live in sympatry than with allopatric members of the LVRS from other lakes that have been geographically isolated for many thousands of years (Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2:

errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive D values indicate gene flow between P1 (LVR lake radiation) and P3 (Eastern or Upper Nile taxon), whereas negative D values indicate gene flow between P2 (A.

directionality of gene flow, we applied an extended version of the partitioned D statistic47 (5 population test, Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find evidence for gene flow from H. gracilior (g in Fig 2b) and from T. pharyngalis (t in Fig 2b) into each LVRS lake radiation, but no evidence for gene flow in the opposite direction (Supplementary Table 3, rows 1.11.4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using F4-ratio tests48, we estimated the Upper Nile ancestry proportion to be 20% in all LVRS radiations (Supplementary Fig 6 and Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole-genome sequencing of Lake Victoria and Lake Kivu radiation species, and A. stappersi, T. pharyngalis and H. gracilior, confirms excess allele sharing between LVRS members and the Upper Nile lineage, and reveals ancestry blocks of 3 kb, consistent with evidence that the admixture event occurred many thousands of generations ago in the common ancestor of all superflock radiations in the different lakes (Fig 3a, Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genome-wide signatures of admixture are correlated among different species from Lake Victoria and Lake Kivu (Fig 3b), in line with a shared admixture event at the onset of the LVRS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Congo-Nilotic ancestry blocks in LVRS genomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The size distribution of putative ancestry blocks shows mostly small ancestry blocks and slightly larger Congolese (red) than Upper Nile blocks (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plot shows the counts of ancestry blocks in different size categories summed up for five LVRS radiation species across all scaffolds calculated with 3 kb windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As most blocks do not span multiple windows of 3 kb and many blocks cannot be clearly allocated to Congolese or Upper Nile ancestry (grey) (Supplementary Fig 8), the average ancestry block size is likely 3 kb or smaller, consistent with hybridization many thousands of years ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Correlation of ancestry blocks between whole-genome sequenced LVRS members is high overall but decreases with phylogenetic distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The boxplots show correlation of fd (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  78) in 10 kb windows between single individuals of conspecifics (Pundamilia individuals of the same species), sister species (Pu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pundamilia versus Pu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nyererei), more distantly related Lake Victoria (LVi) species (Paralabidochromis flavus versus Pu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pundamilia and Pu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  nyererei), Lake Kivu (LKi) species (Pa. paucidens versus Harpagochromis vittatus) and Lake Victoria against Lake Kivu species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that all radiation member species share the same hybridization event in their ancient history but vary in how long after that event they remained part of the same recombining population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also suggests that some of the admixture variation still segregates within individual species (indicated by the deviation from an fd correlation of 1 among conspecifics).Full size image', 'Importance of the ancient hybridization event', 'Many phenotypic traits known to contribute to ecological adaptation and reproductive isolation have diverged in multiple speciation events in each of the LVRS radiations (for example, tooth shapes, male nuptial colouration, opsin alleles)39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these traits are also divergent between the Congolese Astatotilapia and Upper Nile Thoracochromis species37,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intrinsic incompatibilities have also been found in experimental hybrid crosses of similarly divergent Astatotilapia species38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, some of the allelic variation in the lake radiations has been shown to predate the origin of the LVRS (refs 49, 50), perhaps most notably that of the long-wavelength sensitive (LWS) opsin gene, one of the best-studied genes in Lake Victoria cichlids51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gene codes for the protein moiety of red-sensitive visual pigments in retinal cones and is exceptionally diverse in Lake Victoria Region cichlids51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It plays a crucial role in adaptation on the steep ambient light gradients associated with water depth and turbidity gradients that are characteristic for the lakes in the Lake Victoria region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More red-shifted LWS opsin variants are beneficial in deep and murky water where the light spectrum is relatively more red-shifted because of particulate matter absorbing and scattering light of shorter wave lengths39,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opsin gene likely also plays a role in behavioural reproductive isolation because divergence in colour perception between species with different LWS opsin genotypes53 is often associated with divergent male breeding colouration39,49,54, which is an important mate choice cue55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The LWS opsin gene is highly diverse in the LVRS with two deeply divergent haplotype clades, often referred to as haplotype classes because the alleles within each clade are functionally similar to each other51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A substitution at amino acid position 177 in the cichlid LWS gene shifts peak absorbance towards longer wavelength (red) in haplotype class I relative to class II by 7 nm (refs 49, 51) and also other substitutions influence spectral sensitivity (Supplementary Discussion, Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two haplotype classes are often associated with different light environments, class I with shallow and clear water, and class II with deep and turbid water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, rocky shore algae scrapers of the genera Neochromis and Mbipia and mud bottom detritivores of the genus Enterochromis, likely representing an early divergence event in the Lake Victoria radiation, occupy the opposite ends of the light spectrum in Lake Victoria: clear and shallow versus murky and deep.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All 438 LWS haplotypes previously sequenced from Neochromis and Mbipia algae scrapers39,49 are part of the haplotype class I, whereas 11 of the 12 Enterochromis LWS haplotypes belong to class II (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within ecologically variable lineages, young sister species occupying shallow versus deep or clear versus turbid waters, often have different frequencies of these two LWS haplotype classes or recombinants between them, and LWS variation is consistently associated with divergence in male nuptial coloration (Fig 4, Supplementary Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sequenced the LWS opsin gene in Congolese and Upper Nile taxa, and found that the two haplotype classes51 in the LVRS are each shared exclusively with just one of these parental lineages (Fig 4, Supplementary Fig 7, Supplementary Data 3, Supplementary Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All haplotypes in individuals from the Congolese lineage take basal positions in the class I clade, whereas the Upper Nile lineage haplotypes take basal positions in the class II clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: High LWS opsin diversity likely because of the ancient hybridization event.The two major LWS opsin haplotype classes, I and II, in the LVRS (orange) are each shared exclusively with either the Congolese (A. stappersi and A. sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yaekama, red) or the Upper Nile lineage (H. gracilior and T. pharyngalis, blue), respectively (details in Supplementary Fig 7; Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LWS haplotype class I is generally associated with cichlids living in shallow and clear water habitats, whereas class II is associated with deeper and more turbid habitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Speciation by divergence in habitat type seems to have been accompanied by fixation of alternative LWS haplotypes both at early and at late stages of the adaptive radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is exemplified by near fixation of alternative haplotype classes between ecologically divergent genera such as shallow water rocky shore algae scrapers of Neochromis and Mbipia versus mud bottom detritivores of the genus Enterochromis, and by the young incipient species pair of Pundamilia macrocephala blue (living very shallow) and yellow (living deeper) which have predominantly alleles of haplotype class I and II, respectively (Photo credits: Ole Seehausen, Adrian Indermaur, Teleos, Oliver Selz, Uli Schliewen).Full size image', 'To see if similar patterns of sorting of admixture variation could be detected elsewhere in the genomes, we tested if genomic SNPs that are highly differentiated among

insectivore Pundamilia pundamilia, the insectivore/zooplanktivore P. nyererei, the algae grazer Neochromis omnicaeruleus, the paedophage Lipochromis melanopterus, the insectivore Paralabidochromis

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here, we demonstrate that multiple large animal adaptive radiations arose from a hybrid swarm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest ancient admixture between two lineages of haplochromines, one from the Upper Congo and one from the Upper Nile drainage, at the origin of the entire Lake Victoria Region Superflock of cichlid fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contemporary Upper Nile lineage introgression or earlier independent introgression events into each lake radiation are unlikely given (i) the highly supported genomic monophyly of the entire Lake Victoria Region Superflock (Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 1), (ii) similar Congo and Upper Nile lineage ancestry proportions in all lake radiations (Supplementary Fig 6) and (iii) highly correlated Congolese and Upper Nile lineage ancestry tracts (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the fact that neither H. gracilior (Lake Kivu) nor T. pharyngalis (Lake Edward) show greater admixture into LVRS species that are sympatric with them than with allopatric members of the LVRS from other lakes (Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 5) speaks against recent introgression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radiations in Lakes Albert, Saka and Victoria have been geographically separated from Lakes Edward and Kivu, and hence from T. pharyngalis and H. gracilior, for between 4,000 (Saka) and 100,000 (Victoria) years31,33,34 and show similar ancestry proportions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Highly similar amounts of allele sharing between the LVRS species and both H. gracilior and T. pharyngalis (Supplementary Table 3, rows 2.12.4, Supplementary Fig 3) suggests that the taxon that hybridized with the Congolese ancestor of the LVRS was a close relative of both Upper Nile species, or their ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that the Congolese lineage colonized the Lake Victoria region through capture of Malagarasi (Congo) tributaries during a humid phase (for example, 145,000120,000 years ago, Supplementary Fig 3) and encountered representatives of the Upper Nile lineage that would by then have occupied the Lake Victoria region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of large lakes in the Lake Victoria region at that time is likely to have provided ecological opportunity for diversification, which could be exploited by a genetically diverse hybrid swarm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The finding that the two LWS opsin haplotype classes of the LVRS are each shared uniquely with one of the parental lineages (Fig 4, Supplementary Fig 7) suggests that the ancient Congo-Nilotic admixture event was the source of the high functional variation among LVRS cichlids at the LWS opsin gene39,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombination between the ancestral haplotypes within the admixed populations further enhanced the functional variation of LWS haplotypes available for the LVRS radiation (Supplementary Discussion, Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gene is particularly important for adaptation to the red-shifted end of ambient aquatic light spectra that characterize the waters of Lake Victoria39,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bringing together the Congolese and Upper Nile opsin haplotypes thus appears to have facilitated adaptation to an extreme range of light conditions and visual ecologies, with many transitions between them at both early as well as late stages of the radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Divergence into major ecologically differentiated clades

locus (Supplementary Discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data suggest a much more general impact of the ancient admixture event on evolution in this set of young adaptive radiations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental crosses of cichlids have shown that intrinsic incompatibilities38,56 and phenotypic novelty57 both increase with genetic distance between the crossed species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both kinds of variation could be important in speciation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The divergence time of the Congolese and Upper Nile lineage taxa, interpreted in the context of this previous experimental work, lets us predict that a hybrid swarm between these lineages would contain both intrinsic incompatibilities and transgressive trait variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this prediction, we found that genomic sites with alternative alleles fixed in the two parental lineages are enriched for outlier loci likely involved in divergent adaptation and species differentiation in Lake Victoria (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that speciation has commonly been associated with sorting of alleles brought together in the radiation ancestor by the admixture event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sites showing negative epistatic interactions (Bateson Dobzhansky Muller (BDM) incompatibilities) would be expected to be fixed for alternative alleles in the parental lineages and thus fall in ancestry category 4 in Figure 5a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong enrichment of LV outliers in this category is in line with differential sorting of BDM incompatibilities among species that emerged from the hybrid swarm21,22,23, which may have facilitated reproductive isolation among the members of the adaptive radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the correlation of Congo-Nilotic ancestry block patterns decreases between species with increasing phylogenetic distance within the LVRS (Fig 3b), it is likely that Congolese and Upper Nile lineage alleles have been segregating in the LVRS for a long time and that they were progressively sorted among the radiation members during species diversification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The combined evidence from the LWS opsin gene and the genome-wide patterns of sorting of ancestral variation is consistent with an important role of the ancestral hybridization for the evolution of the Lake Victoria Region Superflock.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting large genetic variation may help to explain how multiple adaptive radiations in the Lake Victoria Region, together forming 700 species, could arise in just 100200 thousand years31,32, including 500+ genetically and phenotypically well-differentiated species endemic to Lake Victoria which evolved in probably just 15,000 years32,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our data provide evidence for the hypothesis3 that hybridization between divergent lineages, when coincident with novel ecological opportunity such as colonisation of newly formed lakes, may facilitate rapid adaptive radiation through recombination and sorting of admixture-derived polymorphisms by natural and sexual selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'That hybridization may fuel entire adaptive radiations has been hypothesized for several systems, but robust evidence has so far been confined to the allopolyploid Hawaiian silverswords24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report strong evidence that hybrid ancestry fuelled diversification in several large animal adaptive radiations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thanks to the advent of high-throughput sequencing, our power to test for ancient hybridization and to study its impact on subsequent evolution has increased enormously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will reveal if hybridization in the ancestry of major adaptive radiations is widespread, and whether its occurrence may explain some of the

five populations it allows one to infer the directionality of gene flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The five taxa with the topology ((P1,P2), (P3a,P3b)),O include the potential source of gene flow (for example,

would not expect that a close relative (P2) of the receiver of gene flow, P1, would show excess allele sharing with P3a and P3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the genomic data, this would be seen as an excess number of BABBA patterns, where P1 shares a derived allele (B) with both P3a and P3b, whereas P2 has the outgroup allele (A), as compared with the number of ABBBA patterns (P2 shares a derived allele

sharing with P3a because of ancestrally shared alleles between P1 and P2 that introgressed into P3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, gene flow from P1 into P3a would not affect the relative frequencies of

#@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated fd in non-overlapping sliding windows of 10 kb along the A. burtoni scaffolds using the Python script by Martin et al.78.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Windows with less than five total ABBA and BABA patterns were excluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As only positive fd values are indicative of excess allele sharing between Upper Nile and LVRS, and are correctly standardized, values with negative D scores were set to 0 as in Martin et al.78.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pearsons product-moment correlations of fd values between different individuals were calculated with the stats R-package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Putative Congolese or Upper Nile ancestry was assessed by comparing the frequency of ABBA sites (LVRS shares the derived allele exclusively with Upper Nile taxa) with the frequency of BBAA sites (LVRS shares the derived allele exclusively with the Congolese lineage representative A. stappersi) in non-overlapping sliding windows of 3 kb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scaffolds with  less_than 100 kb data were removed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for the fd statistic, ABBA and BBAA pattern counts were calculated using allele frequencies by weighting each segregating site according to its fit to the ABBA or BBAA pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only windows with a total ABBA and BBAA pattern count exceeding one were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Windows with a minimum ABBA proportion ((ABBA/(ABBA+BBAA)) of 0.7 were defined as candidate windows of Upper Nile lineage ancestry and are coloured in blue, whereas genomic regions with an ABBA proportion of 0.3 or less were defined as putative Congolese lineage derived windows and are highlighted in red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ancestry tracts were defined as consecutive sliding windows of the same colour (red or blue) ignoring single sliding windows without data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expected ancestry block sizes were calculated using a formula from Racimo et al.79.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming 50,000100,000 generations since admixture, a recombination rate of 2.5 × 108 and an Upper Nile proportion of 20%, the expected mean length of the admixture tracts is (0.8 × 2.5 × 108 × (50,000 to 100,000)1))1=500 bp to 1 kb (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The breakup of ancestry blocks may have slowed as the original hybrid population began to undergo genomic stabilization, speciated and formed geographically isolated radiations in separate lakes each of which underwent further stabilization independent of each other, likely associated with differential sorting of the ancestral variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'Mitochondrial and LWS
