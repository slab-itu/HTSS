A volumetric three-dimensional digital light photoactivatable dye display  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Volumetric three-dimensional displays offer spatially accurate representations of images with a 360° view, but have been difficult to implement due to complex fabrication requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, a chemically enabled volumetric 3D digital light photoactivatable dye display (3D Light PAD) is reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The operating principle relies on photoactivatable dyes that become reversibly fluorescent upon illumination with ultraviolet light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proper tuning of kinetics and emission wavelengths enables the generation of a spatial pattern of fluorescent emission at the intersection of two structured light beams.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first-generation 3D Light PAD was fabricated using the photoactivatable dye N-phenyl spirolactam rhodamine B, a commercial picoprojector, an ultraviolet projector and a custom quartz imaging chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system displays a minimum voxel size of 0.68 mm3, 200 m resolution and good stability over repeated on-off cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A range of high-resolution 3D images and animations can be projected, setting the foundation for widely accessible volumetric 3D displays.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Advanced imaging techniques can now acquire high-resolution biological imaging data in three dimensions1,2,3, but digital methods to display this data are largely restricted to two dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional (3D) stereoscopic movies are ubiquitous in the entertainment industry, but find limited use in other sectors because they are actually two-dimensional (2D) images that rely on binocular disparity to trick the brain into seeing a 3D image4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volumetric 3D displays are spatially accurate and truly 3D platforms that have expanded utility for medical imaging, engineering and architecture, education, and military applications5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classical 2D representation of 3D images was originally optimized by renaissance artists/mathematicians6 and relies on psychological depth cues, including linear perspective, occlusion, shading and texture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, volumetric 3D displays truly structure light in a 3D space and fully integrate physical depth cues, including accommodation (differences in eye muscle tension when focusing at different distances), convergence (angle of the eyes focus at different distances), motion parallax (closer objects appear to move faster) and binocular disparity (differences in the images seen by the left eye and right eye)4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volumetric 3D displays can be characterized into swept-volume displays that include high-speed image projection onto moving screens7,8,9 and rotating light-emitting diodes (LEDs)10, and static volume displays that include active matrix display units11 and beam-addressable static volume displays12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beam-addressable static volume displays typically use beams of high-powered light to induce a specialized static volume to emit light at spatially defined points in 3D space called voxels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These systems are attractive from a manufacturing viewpoint due to the lack of moving parts and drastic simplification in the arrangement of voxels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beam-addressable systems can employ upconversion processes10,11 or plasma generation12, but these techniques require expensive high-energy beams that pose non-trivial safety risks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photochromic holography15,16,17,18,19 has been explored and a photochromic 3D display was disclosed by the Battelle Development Corporation in the late 1960s (refs 20, 21), but a successful system was never commercialized to the best of our knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The need for complex fabrication, moving parts, high-speed projectors or high laser powers has posed a significant obstacle to widespread dissemination of volumetric 3D display technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Herein, we report a 3D Light PAD that uses a special class of photoactivatable molecules and digital light processing (DLP) technology to generate structured light in three dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photoactivatable molecules22,23,24,25,26 are central components of groundbreaking advances in super-resolution microscopy27,28,29,30,31, data storage32,33, molecular motors34,35,36,37 and photopharmacology38,39,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several classes of photoactivatable molecules have been described, including diarylethenes43,44, diarylazo compounds33,45, spiropyran/merocyanines46, oxazines2,26, photocaged compounds25,35,37,47,48,49, BF2-azo complexes50,51 and spirolactam rhodamines23,24,52,53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These molecules undergo a photochemical reaction to toggle between at least two different molecular states that can vary in shape, colour, fluorescence and other molecular properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If this reaction is reversible, then these compounds are referred to as photoswitches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular scaffolds and chemical systems have been developed and optimized in efforts to tune the rates of photoactivating reactions55, reversibility kinetics56, absorption/emission wavelengths40 and repeatability cycles57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The operating principle of a 3D Light PAD rests on using small photoactivatable molecules with a particular set of optical properties: a non-fluorescent off state, a fluorescent or visible absorbing on state that can be accessed by illuminating at a wavelength outside of the visible absorbance spectrum, a fast rate of photoactivation and a fast deactivation to the off state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In photoactivated localization microscopy58,59 and 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy60, small subsets of fluorophores are sequentially activated and located by point spread function analysis to construct a 3D data set from a large series of images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a 3D Light PAD simultaneously activates and excites fluorophores in a spatial pattern defined by DLP to generate a viewable and spatially accurate volumetric 3D image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N-substituted spirolactam rhodamines are a class of photoactivatable compounds that can be switched from a non-fluorescent to a fluorescent isomer using ultraviolet light23,24,47,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This photochemical reaction is thermally reversible, and the fluorescent isomers have absorption and emission in the visible region of the spectrum47,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We envisioned that under the appropriate conditions a 3D voxel could be generated by illumination of these photoactivatable dyes dispersed in a low-scattering solvent or matrix with two different wavelengths of light.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Characterization of N-phenyl spirolactam rhodamine B', 'N-phenyl spirolactam rhodamine B 1 was synthesized by POCl3-mediated formation of the acid chloride followed by acyl substitution with aniline (Fig 1a, Supplementary Figs 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purification by silica column chromatography and recrystallization from 3:1 hexane:ethyl acetate provided pure white crystals needed for low background fluorescence and optimal performance in a 3D Light PAD device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before illumination, the absorbance spectrum of 1 shows peaks at 240, 274 and 314 nm, with no observable absorbance above 400 nm (Fig 1b, blue trace), and very weak background fluorescence when excited at 556 nm (Fig 1c, blue trace).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a strong peak in the absorbance spectrum appears at 556 nm after illumination of 1 in a quartz cuvette for 5 min with 254 nm light, as well as other peaks at 240, 274, 308, 353 and 404 nm (Fig 1b, red trace).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in absorbance shows a linear dependence on illumination time (Supplementary Fig 4) and is greater when using higher frequency illumination (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exciting at 556 nm with the dye in its on state provided a strong emission centred at 586 nm (Fig 1c, red trace).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acquiring emission spectra of the on and off states of 1 under identical settings revealed 415-fold increase in emission intensity for the post-ultraviolet-illuminated samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of the thermal fading reaction was examined by monitoring the decrease in the absorbance at 556 nm after cessation of illumination (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decay was fit to a single exponential and a kobs=0.0041, s1 was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having spectroscopically confirmed the photoswitching properties, a preliminary demonstration of voxel generation was performed using a 5 mM solution of 1 in dichloromethane in a vial (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 532 nm laser pointer (5 mW) and a 405 nm laser pointer (5 mW) were aimed to intersect in the vial, revealing an illuminated point of light with increased brightness at the intersection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This preliminary demonstration motivated work towards the optimization and prototyping of a first-generation 3D Light PAD device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Spectroscopic properties of N-phenyl spirolactam rhodamine B 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Reaction scheme for photoactivatable fluorescence of 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Absorbance spectrum of 50 M 1 in CH2Cl2 before (blue trace) and after (red trace) irradiating with 0.26 mW cm2 254 nm light for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Emission spectrum of 50 M 1 in CH2Cl2 before (blue trace) and after (red trace) irradiating with 0.26 mW cm2 254 nm light for 5 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ex=556 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Thermal fading kinetics of the absorption at 556 nm of 5 mM 1 in CH2Cl2 after irradiating with 1.0 mW cm2 315 nm light for 90 s.

Miroir 720p picoprojector, and a Pro4500 projector equipped with a 385 nm ultraviolet LED and a 525 nm green LED.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial imaging experiments were performed in a small glass jar or vial, but higher-quality images were acquired using a custom-built quartz imaging chamber (50 mm × 50 mm × 50 mm) with a transparent lid that could be screwed closed and sealed with a Gortex gasket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pressure-release vent was incorporated into the lid that could be capped or connected to a balloon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical filters were mounted onto an optical breadboard between the ultraviolet projector and the quartz chamber, and between the quartz chamber and a camera for acquiring photographs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimenters wore goggles that blocked ultraviolet and blue light as both a safety precaution and as an optical filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of the filters on image quality was investigated using 515, 550 and 590 nm longpass filters between the quartz chamber

and repeatability of on-off cycles were characterized (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smallest observable voxel was determined by systematically generating rectangular prisms and cubes of varying volumes (Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A selection of voxel sizes (Fig 5a) revealed a minimum observable voxel volume to be between 0.25 and 0.68 mm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the voxel volume increases, the brightness increases (Supplementary Fig 16a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast also increases as the size of the ultraviolet projection increases, but reaches a maximum as the size of the green projection increases, eventually declining due to increased background (Supplementary Fig 16c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resolution was estimated by projecting horizontal and vertical bars and determining the minimum separation needed to differentiate the two bars (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these images, we determined a resolution between 100 and 200 m in both the horizontal and vertical direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of the imaging depth on image brightness was evaluated with respect to both the Pro4500 ultraviolet projector (Supplementary Fig 17a) and the Miroir 720p projector (Supplementary Fig 17b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No clear difference in brightness was observed at different depths (Supplementary Fig 17c,d), indicating that effects from absorption of the medium are minimal, given the current solvent composition and dimensions of the imaging chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the images in this study were generated using 90° angles between the beams of the two projections, but the tolerance of smaller angles was also examined, with angles as low as 20° being physically tolerated in a typical set-up (Supplementary Fig 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The repeatability of the photoswitching was examined over 250 cycles, and generally shows excellent reproducibility of the MPI in photographs of both the on image and off image (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This repeatability was also examined with different concentrations of triethylamine (Supplementary Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While differences in minimum and maximum brightness were observed, the concentration of triethylamine had little effect on the repeatability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we examined the reusability of a single solution over multiple days by generating an image continuously for 1 h each day and evaluating the brightness and contrast at the end of each imaging session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over this time frame, the contrast was consistent, with a slight increase in brightness over the 11-day period (Supplementary Fig 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, the same solutions can effectively be used for image generation for weeks to months, with this gradual increase in brightness accumulating over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Characterization of the first-generation 3D Light PAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Images of voxels of increasing volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b)

projecting a green bar as a screen of fluorescent activation (Fig 6ad and Supplementary Figs 2124).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this method, the SMU Mustang mascot (Fig 6a), easily readable text (Fig 6b), photographic images (Fig 6c) and molecular structures (Fig 6d) can be generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to display more complex, spatially defined 3D images, the green Miroir 720p projector can be used to project a 2D visible light pattern to interact with a 2D ultraviolet pattern projected from the Pro4500 (Fig 6eg and Supplementary Figs 2529).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 6e, a triangle is projected from both the green projector (Supplementary Fig 25a) and the ultraviolet projector (Supplementary Fig 25b) to generate a pyramid at the intersection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar strategy was used to generate images of a cube (Fig 6f) and a cylinder (Fig 6g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  N-phenyl spirolactam rhodamine B 1 in the closed isomeric form adopts a perpendicular conformation at the spirolactam bond connection between the two rings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is difficult to accurately portray this 3D molecular structure in a traditional 2D display, this is easily rendered using a 3D Light PAD (Fig 6h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Appropriate patterning can also be used to generate images of household objects such as a chair (Fig 6i) or a table (Fig 6j), providing a proof of principle for the utility of 3D Light PADs for computer-aided design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An outstanding challenge for beam-addressable 3D displays is the appearance of ghost voxels caused by inevitable intersections of beams in undesired spaces5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a preliminary strategy to address this issue, we introduce an approach where ultraviolet patterns are projected onto slices of green light to provide arbitrary 3D images without the excitation of ghost voxels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy gains resolution in the vertical dimension at the expense of resolution in one of the horizontal dimensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, arbitrary 3D patterns including stacked circles (Fig 6k and Supplementary Fig 30) and stacks of different-shaped objects (Fig 6l and Supplementary Fig 31) can be

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This study describes the design, optimization, characterization and image generation using a 3D Light PAD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The display is enabled by fast photoactivation, an 415-fold increase in fluorescence emission upon photoactivation, the discovery of base-tunable thermal fading kinetics, and innovative use of DLP projector technology and optical filters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The display is inexpensive with a fabrication cost for this first-generation prototype of under $5,000, not including the cost of the two PCs used to control the projectors, which could conceivably be replaced by a single device (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current display attains a minimum viewable voxel volume of less than 0.68 mm3 and a resolution of 200 m, with excellent repeatability in on-off cycles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution images can be projected at defined points in 3D space, and a wide range of 3D objects can be easily rendered, including a 3D molecular structure of the N-phenyl spirolactam rhodamine B 1 used in the display.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An optical slicing strategy has been introduced as a method to overcome the problem of ghost voxels and it is anticipated that improvements in photoactivatable dyes and DLP projector technologies will increase the impact of this strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3D animations were constructed with a high refresh rate when projecting a dynamic green light projection onto a static ultraviolet photoactivated pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system has no moving parts, uses low-power light sources, and is inexpensive and easy to implement, all important advantages over existing volumetric 3D displays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3D Light PAD can address a larger number of voxels with a smaller voxel size in comparison to other recently developed static volume volumetric 3D displays (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also compares favourably with regards to voxel size versus the leading swept-volume rotating screen displays developed by Favalora8 and Geng9, and we anticipate that future development will scale the system to larger volumes and a higher number of voxels without the need for high-speed projectors or moving parts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Outstanding challenges for this type of display include generation of a photoactivatable red-blue-green (RGB) dye set for a true-colour 3D display, overcoming the challenge of ghost voxels, optimization of optical slicing or photoswitch kinetics for versatile real-time 3D animations, and implementation into a solid-state device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anticipate that this 3D Light PAD strategy will be applied to the ever-growing family of photoactivatable molecules and DLP chip sets, providing exciting new opportunities for academic and industrial development of readily accessible volumetric 3D displays.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
