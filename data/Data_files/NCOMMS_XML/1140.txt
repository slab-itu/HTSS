Physical limits to biomechanical sensing in disordered fibre networks  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cells actively probe and respond to the stiffness of their surroundings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since mechanosensory cells in connective tissue are surrounded by a disordered network of biopolymers, their in vivo mechanical environment can be extremely heterogeneous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigate how this heterogeneity impacts mechanosensing by modelling the cell as an idealized local stiffness sensor inside a disordered fibre network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all types of networks we study, including experimentally-imaged collagen and fibrin architectures, we find that measurements applied at different points yield a strikingly broad range of local stiffnesses, spanning roughly two decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verify via simulations and scaling arguments that this broad range of local stiffnesses is a generic property of disordered fibre networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that to obtain optimal, reliable estimates of global tissue stiffness, a cell must adjust its size, shape, and position to integrate multiple stiffness measurements over extended regions of space.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mechanical cues can govern cellular behaviour in decisive ways2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elastic properties of a cells substrate have been shown to guide cell migration4,5 and determine cell fate6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eukaryotic cells, including fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells and cancer cells, attach to substrates via transmembrane protein complexes called focal adhesions, allowing the cell to sense stiffness3,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown studies have established that this mechanosensing contributes both to motility and to the regulation of cell shape in three-dimensional in vitro systems that closely resemble in vivo cellular environments11,12,13,14,15,16,17, where cells are surrounded by a loosely connected, disordered network of protein fibres, such as collagen or fibrin18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These biopolymers form a major structural component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which serves as the physical scaffolding within which cells live and move.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is clear that cells actively probe these extracellular networks, it remains unclear how ECM micromechanical properties impact mechanosensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Both in vitro experiments19,20,21,22,23 and theory24,25,26,27,28 have demonstrated that biopolymer networks exhibit rich macroscopic mechanical behaviour, depending sensitively on network connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because the size of a typical cell is comparable to the pore size of the ECM29, any mechanical information must be inferred by locally probing an extremely heterogeneous material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a few studies have begun to characterize this microscopic response30,31, a theoretical understanding of how local mechanics are determined by the surrounding heterogeneous structure is still lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'How does the intrinsic heterogeneity of the ECM limit a cells ability to learn about its global environment from purely local mechanical measurements?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the case of chemical sensing, consideration of the fundamental physical limits dates back to Berg and Purcells consideration of noise due to the random arrival of diffusing particles32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we take a similar approach to explore the fundamental limits of mechanosensing, where, in contrast to chemical signals, the cues are static in time but distributed nonuniformly in space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To quantify the physical limits of mechanosensing imposed by a cells disordered environment, we investigate a simple model consisting of two components: the ECM as an elastic network that deforms in response to external forces, and the cell as an idealized measurement device that probes the stiffness of its surroundings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that experimentally-imaged collagen and fibrin networks and randomly-generated networks all yield a very broad range of modelled local stiffness responses, spanning roughly two decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the broad distribution of local stiffnesses collapses onto a universal form for different fibre concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We trace the origin of this universally broad range of stiffnesses to two intrinsic features of disordered networks: first, the local stiffness depends primarily on a small number of local fibres with consequently large variations, and second, these proximal fibres contribute to stiffness in a highly cooperative manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we find that the local mechanics of the experimental networks are dominated by fibre bending, we show that pre-existing strain in the network can induce a transition to a stretching-dominated regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we argue that to obtain accurate estimates of global ECM stiffness, cells must integrate multiple stiffness measurements over extended regions of space.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

including the mesh size and the fibre length distribution, were consistent with a simple size rescaling of the network (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results suggest that the width of the local stiffness distribution depends on the length scale over which the network is probed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this hypothesis, we varied the length of the cellular stiffness probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, we find that loc also decreases with increasing probe length for all concentrations of fibrin networks studied (inset of Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The observed narrowing of the local stiffness distribution with monomer concentration or with probe length suggests that the stiffness distribution is controlled by the ratio of the probe length to an intrinsic length scale of the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, upon rescaling the probe length d by the mesh size , we find that the geometric s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  loc for networks of different monomer concentration collapse onto a single universal curve (inset of Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possible explanation for this decrease in loc as a function of the ratio  is that longer force dipoles effectively probe a larger region of the network, which may result in self-averaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For long probes, however, loc begins to approach a constant value (inset of Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This asymptotic saturation occurs because for very long probes, the measured deformation is simply the sum of the deformations of two independent monopole probes that are still sensitive to network disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Random graph captures experimental networks stiffness range', 'To investigate the physical origins of the universally broad local stiffness distributions described above, we turned to idealized model networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One way to generate model disordered networks consists of arranging vertices to lie on a regular lattice, such as a simple-cubic lattice or face-centred-cubic lattice (FCC) in three dimensions26 (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Connecting these vertices randomly with a fixed probability results in a disordered lattice network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such lattice networks have provided a useful starting point for characterizing the mechanical response of fibre networks in two dimensions31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, although three-dimensional simple-cubic lattice and FCC networks also yield a broad range of local stiffnesses (Supplementary Figs 11f and 5b), the geometric s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of these distributions (loc=0.29 and 0.37 at , respectively) are considerably smaller than those of the experimental networks at the same value of  (Fig 2c; Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the entire local stiffness distribution has almost no dependence on probe length (Supplementary Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible reason for these discrepancies is that the disordered lattice networks fail to capture important structural features of real networks at the scale of the cell, such as the fibre length distribution and the random positions of the vertices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To generate a model network that better matches the structural features of the experimental networks, we begin by distributing vertices randomly throughout a volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density of these vertices (which determines the mesh size ) is set roughly equal to those of the experimental networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pairs of vertices are then connected according to a probability function that depends on the intervertex distance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose the probability function to be the simplest form that results in network features consistent with those of the experimental architectures (see Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting modelled networks are referred to as random geometric graphs (RGGs; Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We computed the local stiffness distribution for the RGG network and found that the geometric s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is loc=0.56 at  (Fig 2d), which is approximately equal to those of the experimental networks (Fig 2c; Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we find that both the experimental and RGG networks display an anomalously sensitive dependence of the geometric mean of local stiffness on probe length (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in contrast to the lattice networks, the RGG network appears to quantitatively capture important local mechanical properties of the experimental networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Experimental networks are in a bending-dominated regime', 'What network features produce the broad width of the universal local stiffness distributions?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intuitively, more fibre-dense regions should be stiffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a fixed density of vertices, the fibre density is roughly proportional to the network connectivity, defined as the average coordination number z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We briefly review how the overall connectivity of a network affects its macroscopic mechanical properties24,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For high values of z, the bulk elastic moduli of fibre networks are dominated by the stretching of fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As z is lowered, the macroscopic response eventually undergoes a crossover to a bending-dominated response, as the network can be deformed without stretching fibres but not without bending them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As z is further lowered, another elastic transition occurs when the network ultimately loses macroscopic rigidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the whole range, the macroscopic response depends strongly and nonlinearly on the network connectivity, with the strongest dependence near the two elastic transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine how the rapid scaling of the macroscopic response with connectivity manifests locally, we varied the average coordination number z of modelled networks for a fixed ratio of the bending modulus  to the stretching modulus  (with , Fig 4a, Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At high connectivities, the entire local stiffness response is dominated by stretching interactions and scales with .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the connectivity is lowered, the entire local stiffness distribution shifts to lower values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the median stiffness decreases rapidly and nonlinearly with the average coordination z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Near the stretchingbending crossover, the local stiffness distribution becomes bimodal with the emergence of a subset of probes for which the measured stiffness scales with the bending modulus .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below the stretchingbending crossover, the number of stretch-dominated probes becomes negligible, and the local stiffness response enters a bending-dominated regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this regime, the median stiffness resumes rapid decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, as the connectivity is brought below the rigidity transition, an increasing fraction of measurements yields zero stiffness as portions of the network become floppy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus find that the elastic transitions of the macroscopic response manifest locally as crossovers between stretch-dominated, bending-dominated, and zero-stiffness measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At these crossovers, the median stiffness decreases most rapidly, and the local stiffness distribution becomes bimodal, yielding a maximum in the geometric s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Collective effect of network structure on local stiffness.

this, we systematically varied the ratio of the bending modulus to the stretching modulus for these networks (Supplementary Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the local stiffness measured by each individual probe scales with the bending modulus, confirming that we can account for the overall stiffening of the fibrin networks with concentration by rescaling local stiffness by the bending modulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, upon plotting the distribution of rescaled local stiffnesses  for a fixed ratio of the probe length d to the mesh size , we find that the local stiffness distributions from all three fibrin networks collapse onto a single curve (Fig 3b, Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all types of experimental networks we studied, no local stiffness measurements yielded zero stiffness or a finite stiffness that scales with the stretching modulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of such probes suggests that the experimental networks are far from both elastic crossovers, implicating a different source for the broad local stiffness distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Local stiffness depends only on proximal network structure', 'A very broad distribution of local stiffnesses appears to be a generic feature of disordered fibre networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What is the origin of this large variance in local stiffness measurements?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate how a local stiffness measurement depends on the surrounding network structure, we calculated the stiffness loss  upon removing a single fibre (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intuitively, removal of fibres that are more proximal to the stiffness probe should have a greater effect on kloc, which suggests that, on average, the stiffness loss should decay as a function of the distance R from the probe centre to the centre of the removed fibre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, for all types of networks we studied, we found that the average stiffness loss is consistent with 1/R6 decay (insets of Fig 2c,d, Supplementary Figs 1b and 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This apparent universality of the scaling of the stiffness loss suggests that the 1/R6 power-law decay should be calculable within continuum elasticity theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore calculated the effect of removing a single fibre in the vicinity of a local stiffness probe for the case of a uniform lattice network (see Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The defect created by removing a fibre at a distance R from the probe perturbs the dipole strain field induced by the probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can treat this perturbation as an additional dipole strain field originating from the defect, with a magnitude proportional to the initial strain in the removed fibre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since both this initial strain and the consequent additional strain reflected back to the probe decay as the strain field of a force dipole, that is, as 1/RD (where D is the dimension), the combined effect is an increase in the strain at the location of the probe 1/R2D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The rapid 1/R6 decay of the stiffness loss due to fibre removal in three dimensions suggests that the local stiffness is largely determined by the network structure in the immediate vicinity of the probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this small local region, all quantities are subject to large fluctuations; for example, since a small region typically contains a small number of fibres, the variance of fibre density will be large.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The universal, rapid 1/R2D decay implies that the mechanically relevant local structure will always be very local, with consequently large fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Broad stiffness range arises from local density fluctuations', 'To quantify the dependence of local stiffness on the surrounding network structure, we considered the number of local fibres NF, defined as the sum of fibres each weighted by a 1/R6-decaying function of its distance R from the probe centre (see above and Supplementary Figs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that kloc and NF are well correlated for all types of networks studied, as shown in Fig 4b,c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, kloc has a strong, nonlinear dependence on NF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the centre of the marginal distribution of local stiffnesses at fixed NF increases more rapidly than linearly with NF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that local fibres influence local stiffness in a highly cooperative manner, that is, combining multiple fibres typically results in much larger than additive changes to local stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To estimate the geometric s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of local stiffness, we must account for these cooperative effects among fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first note that the scaling of the median local stiffness with NF is consistent with that of the macroscopic shear modulus for all types of networks we studied (insets of Supplementary Figs 11df and 12df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that much of the broad width of the stiffness distribution can be accounted for by the large variations in the local fibre density taken together with the strong, nonlinear dependence of the macroscopic shear modulus on overall fibre density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this notion, we estimated the distribution of local stiffnesses by taking NF transformed by the functional dependence of the macroscopic shear modulus, G(NF), where the modulus G is that of a macroscopic network with an average number of local fibres given by .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon accounting for the strong collective effects of fibre density in this manner, we found that the geometric s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of G(NF) provides a very good estimate for the actual, observed geometric s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of local stiffness (Fig 2c,d; Supplementary Figs 1b, 5b, 11df and 12df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the estimator correctly predicts the relative differences in the geometric s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for the different types of networks, including the observation that the stiffness distributions for the experimental and RGG networks are much broader than for the disordered lattice networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our prediction of the width of stiffness distributions is not sensitive to the particular form of the weighting function, provided the decay is rapid enough.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, a hard cutoff at twice the mesh size captures a majority of the broad width for the FCC network (Supplementary Fig 11e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a less rapidly decaying estimator includes a larger number of fibres in the local structure, and consequently the variance in fibre density is smaller.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, by comparison, an estimator with weights that decay as 1/R3 yields a smaller, much poorer estimate of the width of the stiffness distribution (Fig 2c,d; Supplementary Figs 1b, 5b, 11df and 12df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pre-existing network strain can induce an elastic transition', 'Throughout our analysis, we have focussed on the local stiffness response of networks in an initially unstressed reference state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cells in vivo often encounter networks that are already in a deformed or stressed state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the fibrillar proteins of the ECM are surrounded by proteoglycans (PGs), which form a hydrated, gel-like substance18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This PG gel has been observed to maintain an osmotic pressure that can swell embedded fibre networks and stabilize them in a stressed state38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative source of stress is cells themselves, which actively contract and transmit forces throughout the network8,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of such pre-existing stress, or prestress, is known to impact the mechanical response of fibre networks40,41, even at modest macroscopic strains .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine how prestress could impact local stiffness, we considered the local stiffness for the experimental collagen network and the modelled RGG network under fixed initial prestrain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, we did not include PGs or contractile cells but rather induced prestrain by imposing a macrosopically uniform dilation (see Supplementary Figs and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As before, we define the local stiffness as the linear response of two vertices to a contractile dipole force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These local stiffnesses are again computed by numerically solving the equations of force balance, obtained from the derivative of the Hamiltonian evaluated at the prestrained state (see Supplementary Figs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For small prestrains, the distribution does not appear to change significantly, aside from a slight upward shift (Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for larger prestrains around 0.1, the distribution becomes bimodal with a second, considerably stiffer peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emergence of this second peak occurs at prestrains consistent with the onset of nonlinear stiffening observed in previous studies of the macroscopic bulk modulus of fibre networks40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the width of the stiffer peak is broad, spanning roughly two decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, compared to the local stiffness distribution for zero prestrain, the geometric s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of this peak is lower by about a factor of two, similar to the value we observed for unstrained networks above the bendingstretching crossover (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that the entire local stiffness distribution is dominated by stretching interactions by systematically varying the ratio of the bending modulus to the stretching modulus for the collagen network at a fixed strain of =0.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, for this value of strain, the entire distribution scales with the stretching modulus (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that prestress can induce an elastic transition in the local stiffness distribution, analogous to the crossover we observed upon varying connectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus we expect the results and analysis we performed for the unstrained networks to describe prestrained networks, although with the bendingstretching crossover shifted to lower values of connectivity with increasing prestrain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Effect of network prestress on local stiffness.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mechanical cues can guide cell motility and differentiation4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, cells are observed to reliably distinguish among two-dimensional homogeneous substrates with bulk stiffnesses similar to brain (1 kPa), muscle (10 kPa) and bone (100 kPa)6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the three-dimensional in vivo mechanical environment at the cellular scale can be extremely heterogeneous18,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we asked how this intrinsic heterogeneity impacts mechanosensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that, within macroscopically homogeneous but locally disordered collagen and fibrin networks, local probes yield a very broad range of stiffnesses, spanning roughly two decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This range is similar to the relative difference in the bulk stiffness of brain and bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the average measured stiffness is anomalously sensitive to probe length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantitatively captured these striking features of the experimental networks with modelled networks, which enabled us to elucidate their physical origins using a combination of simulations and scaling arguments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first established that the very broad range of local stiffnesses is a universal feature across network types and spans a wide range of connectivities, including multiple elastic regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then traced the origin of this pervasive broad distribution to variations in local structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, stiffness probes are primarily sensitive to a very small region of local fibres, and these privileged fibres contribute to the measured response in a highly cooperative manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we found that the distribution of stiffnesses can be further broadened by tuning specific network features, including proximity to elastic transitions and geometrical disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our results indicate that the experimental networks are poised squarely in a regime where the response is dominated by fibre bending, these networks include strong geometrical disorder, including randomly oriented fibre junctions and a polydisperse fibre length distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structural features explain why the range of stiffnesses is larger for the experimental and RGG networks than for lattice-based networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The fibre concentrations we considered are typical for in vitro experiments performed on cell migration11,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values of concentration are chosen to be lower than the values in vivo because sparser networks allow for accurate imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation of the universality of the local stiffness distribution provides a theoretical justification for these lower fibre concentration in vitro networks as models for in vivo networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our ideal-mechanosensor model does not address the internal mechanics of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any internal noise in sensing or downstream signalling can only increase overall measurement uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is evidence that cells can fix and thus regulate the relative uncertainty in measured stiffness by linearly modulating their applied stress to maintain a constant deformation9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding, we have shown that, even if cells sense nearly optimally, any single stiffness measurement is poorly informative of global tissue properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that cells can benefit more from integrating the results of multiple stiffness measurements than from optimizing individual measurements, which may explain why some cells display more than a hundred focal adhesions38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet even this strategy has diminishing returns, because nearby stiffness measurements probe the same underlying local structure and are therefore correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extract useful information, cells must spread their measurements over extended regions of space, either by moving or by extending their shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The benefits of an elongated shape are twofold, since measurements on larger scales are both more accurate and less correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological relevance of this strategy is supported by the observation of highly polarized cells over five times longer than wide, including fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, and cancer cells6,14,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To better elucidate the physical origin of mechanical heterogeneity in fibre networks, we focussed on simple models that capture the essential features of the response of biological ECM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These models set a lower bound on the heterogeneity of the local mechanical response arising from intrinsic structural disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biological ECM may contain additional sources of heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simplified models approximate the thicknesses of fibres and crosslinking of fibres at junctions as uniform throughout the network and treat fibre deformations as purely elastic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate these simplifications, we tested alternative mechanical models that incorporate the most likely sources of additional heterogeneity: a distribution of bending moduli, different types of interactions at junctions, and plastic deformations (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all these variations, we observed no significant difference in modelled stiffnesses on a case-by-case basis, which suggests that the large heterogeneity we observed from intrinsic structural disorder dominates over the most likely additional sources of heterogeneity and thereby provides a relevant estimate for the total heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Various other components are expected to contribute to the mechanical response that cells feel in vivo, including PGs and other cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray scattering suggests that PGs coat the fibres44, effectively increasing their stiffness, while cells adhering to fibres serve as an additional elastic component in parallel with the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since biological networks are well below the stretching transition, we do not expect these passive stiffening effects to significantly alter the modelled response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in addition to their intrinsic stiffness, both PGs and cells can stabilize networks in a prestrained state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model indicates that this prestrain may induce an elastic transition and slightly narrow the local stiffness distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This occurs for macroscopic network strains larger than roughly 10%, which would be achievable for networks containing a dense population of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus cells may exploit prestrain to increase the accuracy of mechanical inference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have not considered the dynamics of the ECM, which may be influenced by the intrinsic viscosity of PGs on a short time scale of seconds45 or matrix remodelling on scales of hours to days46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, cells have been observed to perform static measurements of stiffness that can take minutes to hours to develop stress2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, such short timescale and long timescale dynamics can be safely ignored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, certain types of cellular protrusions have also been observed to oscillate with a constant period on the order of tens of seconds47, which suggests that the dynamics of local stiffness are a promising direction for future study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, while we have only considered isotropic networks, tissues can have aligned fibres due to remodelling and prestrain13,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results for isotropic prestrain suggest that aligned networks should yield a narrower stiffness distribution when probed along a fixed direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may explain why the alignment of the ECM has been observed to coordinate with cell polarization to promote migration49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, probing stiffness beyond linear response could provide cells with additional information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How hard would a cell need to pull to access the nonlinear regime?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonlinear effects will certainly become significant when fibres begin to buckle39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a single fibre equal in length to the mesh size, the Euler buckling thresholds are between 0.01 and 10 nN using the bending moduli we inferred for the collagen and fibrin networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forces of several nanonewtons are achievable by stronger cells, as well as by colonies that migrate collectively50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the nonlinear regime is also an interesting direction for future study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, the disorder inherent in biological fibre networks places severe physical limits on the accuracy of cellular mechanosensing, suggesting that organisms must have evolved cellular-scale strategies to cope with this uncertainty in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Going forward, high-throughput gene deletion and mutation studies in conjunction with realistic patterned substrates51 can help reveal the full array of internal components and pathways required for accurate mechanosensation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Polymerization of collagen and fibrin networks', 'We study network architectures obtained from experiment by analysing images of reconstituted fibre networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collagen networks were prepared and imaged as described previously52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, a sample of c=0.2 mg ml1 protein in 1 × DMEM with 25 mM HEPES was prepared from a solution of collagen type-I monomers with a small fraction of fluorescently labelled monomers at 4 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fraction of monomers are labelled to avoid issues with fibre formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these monomers are well mixed before the network is formed, which results in all fibres containing a sufficient portion of labelled monomers to allow for imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our technique allows us to accurately image all fibres down to 200500 nm resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Network formation was induced by neutralizing the samples pH with 1 M NaOH and incubating it at room temperature for 4 h.
