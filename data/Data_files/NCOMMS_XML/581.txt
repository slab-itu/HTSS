Laser recrystallization and inscription of compositional microstructures in crystalline SiGe-core fibres  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Glass fibres with silicon cores have emerged as a versatile platform for all-optical processing, sensing and microscale optoelectronic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using SiGe in the core extends the accessible wavelength range and potential optical functionality because the bandgap and optical properties can be tuned by changing the composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, silicon and germanium segregate unevenly during non-equilibrium solidification, presenting new fabrication challenges, and requiring detailed studies of the alloy crystallization dynamics in the fibre geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report the fabrication of SiGe-core optical fibres, and the use of CO2 laser irradiation to heat the glass cladding and recrystallize the core, improving optical transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe the ramifications of the classic models of solidification at the microscale, and demonstrate suppression of constitutional undercooling at high solidification velocities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tailoring the recrystallization conditions allows formation of long single crystals with uniform composition, as well as fabrication of compositional microstructures, such as gratings, within the fibre core.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Optical fibre research has expanded tremendously in recent decades, due to the incorporation of non-traditional materials, such as chalcogenides1,2 and fluorides3, and novel designs, such as photonic crystal fibres4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These advances have extended the accessible wavelength range and increased the number of potential applications, particularly in the infrared7 region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increases in functionality are also enabled by the combination of optical and electrical phenomena in a single fibre, approached either from the use of hybrid structures8, or core materials such as semiconductors9,10, which respond to both inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Semiconductors also have very large non-linear optical coefficients11, important for all-optical processing, and are transparent through large parts of the infrared and terahertz spectral regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fibres with elemental semiconductor core materials were first reported in 2006 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12), initially fabricated by using a high-pressure chemical vapour deposition method to fill the internal channels of glass capillaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soon afterwards a more conventional fibre-tower drawing method was demonstrated13, which has since been widely adopted by the community14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both methods have been adapted to incorporate a range of materials within the core, and silicon, germanium and compound semiconductor fibres have been fabricated17,18,19,20 for use in applications from sensing to electro-optic modulation and photovoltaic conversion9,21,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, the silica glass cladding can also serve as a microcrucible for modifying the core material, either during or after fabrication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As examples, reactive formation of silicon fibres from aluminium cores15 and production of minute silicon spheres by heat treatment26 has been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Typically, the cores of as-drawn fibres are polycrystalline, with grain sizes that decrease in size with decreasing core diameter27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transverse grain boundaries, which accumulate deleterious impurities and reduce light transmission, represent a particular challenge for the micrometre-core fibres typically required for optical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, in an alloy system, non-uniform composition could lead to excess scattering due to the refractive index variations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid thermal annealing and related techniques28 have been used to crystallize insulator-encapsulated alloy thin29,30 and thick31 films, and similar processing has been shown to improve overall crystallinity of semiconductor core fibres32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laser processing, for which the fibre geometry is particularly well suited, as established in the case of conventional glass fibres33,34,35, combines a small heat zone and large thermal gradients with fine motion and temperature control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cylindrical geometry, with a large surface to volume ratio, allows efficient convective cooling and optical access to a small heating volume, essential for establishing controlled, extreme thermal gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct, selective heating of the core using a tightly focused visible laser beam (to which the glass cladding is transparent) has been shown to both crystallize and alter the local stress and related properties of an elemental silicon fibre core after fabrication36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infrared laser treatment, in which the glass absorbs the energy, has recently been used to recrystallize silicon fibres and reduce their optical loss37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'SiGe alloy cores offer an extended range of optoelectronic functionalities, since their bandgap and index of refraction can be tailored by changing the composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alloy can form a single-phase solid solution, crystallizing over the temperature range 9381,414 °C, depending on the Si:Ge ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the equilibrium phase diagram, (Fig 1a; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38) has a large separation between the solidus and liquidus, and when the material solidifies at finite rates, the initial precipitate is silicon-rich relative to the melt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffusion is too slow in the solid state to allow equilibration, and the composition of the solid acquires spatial gradients, as illustrated in Fig 1b for the case of multiple nucleation sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These stochastic variations are beneficial for some applications, and can also reveal the thermal history of the solidification process39,40, as the last regions that solidify will be Ge-rich.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ordered variations in the composition of SiGe, particularly in thin film form, have been used for strain engineering41, quantum cascade lasers42 and infrared filters43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Compositional segregation of SiGe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The phase diagram of SiGe, with (b) a schematic illustration of non-equilibrium cooling in fibre cross-sections resulting in residual Ge-rich regions (green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Compositional variation along the growth axis during directional recrystallization of a thin rod.Full size image', 'For optical transmission, compositional homogeneity is preferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More uniform samples, as illustrated in Fig 1c can be made by the traveling liquid-zone method44,45, where a dynamic equilibrium is established between the silicon provided by the supply end of the rod and that deposited in the growing crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even in directional recrystallization, constitutional undercooling can lead to formation of dendrites and locally non-uniform composition if the temperature gradients are small or the solidification velocity is above a critical value46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report on the fabrication of silica-clad fibres with a SiGe-core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CO2 laser treatment, during which the silica cladding is heated using strongly absorbed infrared radiation and the core is melted by thermal conduction, is used to recrystallize the fibre cores, while softening the glass to avoid inducing large strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The softening of the glass also allows shaping or tapering of the fibre during recrystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As-drawn fibres of SiGe manifest the effects described by the classic Tiller model46 of undercooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that, using laser treatment, both compositionally uniform and structured semiconductor alloy optical fibre cores can be made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discuss the recrystallization processes in the light of classical solidification theories and the steep thermal profile present during the laser heat treatment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'As-drawn fibres', 'We used the fibre draw method illustrated in Fig 2a to fabricate glass-clad SiGe-core fibres with a core diameter of 130 m and a composition of 6 at% Ge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some fibres were subsequently annealed using the procedure illustrated in Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical large-core fibre is shown in Fig 2c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional fibres with germanium concentrations of 2540 at% were made using the procedure described by Nordstrand47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smaller-core fibres of all compositions were made by redrawing larger diameter fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After fibre fabrication, the crystal structure and germanium distribution were examined to infer the non-equilibrium nature of the crystallization process during drawing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

variation in the average composition over macroscopic lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the constant average composition in the fibres, significant local variations in composition were observed in the as-drawn material consistent with compositional undercooling and the breakdown of a planar solidliquid growth interface (as described by Tiller and others48,49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These variations indicated that the drawing process took place above the critical growth velocity, but below the velocity for partitionless solidification50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3 shows experimental results from the fabrication of 25 at% (Fig 3ac) and 6 at% (Fig 3df) Ge fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used large-core fibres for the materials characterization so that scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction and tomography could all be performed on the same fibre samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a,d shows the compositional variations for as-drawn fibres of two average compositions, imaged non-destructively using X-ray computed tomography (XCT), and Fig 3b,e shows cut and polished cross-sections imaged using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and backscattered electron (BSE) techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the (contrast-inverted) XCT and BSE images, Ge-rich areas appear brighter, due to the higher absorption and higher atomic number, Z, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EDX images (Fig 3b,e; coloured images) provide identification of the components, and quantitative analysis indicates that the oxygen content is less than 3 at%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As fibres were drawn in an air ambient, the oxygen likely originates from the atmosphere or possibly from reaction of germanium with the CaO interface modifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter would release atomic oxygen that would then be free to diffuse through the core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Composition and structure of SiGe-core fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) 25 at% Ge fibre (a) XCT image of dendritic

'With 25 at% Ge, the constitutional undercooling is severe, and dendritic silicon-rich structures are developed, as seen in Fig 3a and Supplementary Movie 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grain boundaries (indicated by red arrows in Fig 3a) are clearly delineated by abrupt orientation changes in the dendrites and regions of high-germanium content that solidify at the termination of each grain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter are similar to the Ge-rich terminal caps in nanowires51 and microencapsulated SiGe films30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of an unusually long dendrite can be seen to vary several degrees over a length of 1 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dendritic structures are not desired for most optical applications, but may be favourable for thermoelectric52 or photovoltaic53 uses, where enhanced phonon and light scattering could be an advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray diffraction of these Ge-rich fibres, performed with a 0.2 mm probe, revealed complex patterns consistent with multiple crystal orientations within the scattering volume at most axial positions (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the 6 at% Ge fibres, initial precipitation of the silicon-rich material occurs along the outer regions, and Ge-rich features develop in the last-to-solidify regions in a classic example of coring, as illustrated in Fig 3d,e and shown in Supplementary Movie 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of germanium and the axial features in Fig 3d,e suggest that the solidification proceeds smoothly, primarily from the cladding interface towards the centre, with little undercooling until the remaining liquid has a high enough germanium content to destabilize the growth front.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the large compositional variations (335 at% Ge) observed within the 6 at% (average composition) Ge fibres, crystalline grains extend through the entire fibre diameter, as demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) of cross-sections confirmed the absence of transverse grain boundaries (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All as-drawn fibres were polycrystalline, with grain sizes 0.21 mm in length as shown by X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig 3c,f), acquired at different positions for a fixed projection angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray diffraction data for rotation of fibres at a fixed axial position (Supplementary Fig 1) revealed multiple crystals within the cross-section of the high-Ge fibres and a single grain for the low germanium fibres in most of the 0.2 mm analysis windows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recrystallization and compositional homogenization', 'For optical and electrical applications, controlled (and usually, uniform) composition is desired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One approach to achieve this is to use laser-induced recrystallization to alter the core structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the energy in visible-wavelength laser processing was deposited directly into the core after traversing the transparent glass cladding36, in this work the silica glass was heated and softened using radio frequency modulated quasi-continuous wave infrared radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorption depth in the silica is 20 m at the incident wavelength54, so melting of the core is via thermal conduction from the surface-heated glass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emissivity of the core far exceeds that of the glass in the visible-wavelength range, allowing real-time observation of the melting and resolidification process through the transparent cladding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission collected by the camera originates in the near-surface region of the fibre core, due to the large absorption coefficient of the semiconductor at visible wavelengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The initial inhomogeneity of the fibre, with inclusions of high-germanium content, leads to an interesting phenomenon on initial melting of the fibre core, as shown in Fig 4a and in Supplementary Movie 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the laser power is increased, the germanium-rich regions melt first.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silicon is more soluble in this liquid at the higher temperatures close to the melt zone, and this provides a mechanism for germanium-rich liquid to move toward the beam centre, dissolving silicon at the hot side of the droplet, and precipitating it at the lower temperature side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The movie shows germanium-rich liquid streaming towards the high temperature region and being incorporated into the melt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The melt zone gathers a higher concentration of germanium than the average composition in the fibre through this mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Laser recrystallization of 6 at% Ge fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Frames from CCD video showing

entire core, as shown in Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emission intensity profiles were recorded as shown in Fig 4c, where a large drop in emissivity of the liquid compared to the solid, as reported for pure silicon55, can be seen, and from which the extent of the melt zone can be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changing the focus and power of the laser allowed control of the width of the melt zone from 100 to 1,000 m. Images taken through two narrowband filtres allowed the temperature gradient to be estimated in the vicinity of the solidification front (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs 3 and 4), yielding 12 × 104 K cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a factor of 103 higher than gradients typical for bulk crystallization, but much lower than those in pulsed laser film recrystallization experiments56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Critical velocity', 'The small molten volume makes the fibres an ideal testbed for measurement of the critical growth velocity46 in reduced dimensions, as well as for investigations of the stabilizing effect of capillarity proposed by Mullins and Sekerka48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter model includes prediction of a higher critical velocity for small core diameters, in addition to the thermal gradient and concentration effects included in the Tiller criterion46:', '', 'where vc is the critical velocity, D is the diffusion coefficient in the liquid, k is the segregation coefficient,  is the temperature gradient in the liquid, mL is the slope of the liquidus and x is the germanium composition in the liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The growth (solidification) velocity was controlled by the translation rate of the CO2 laser (11,000 m s1), and two different compositions (6 at%, 40 at% Ge) were investigated, with different core diameter (130250 m, and 15 m) fibres for both compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 6 at% Ge fibres had critical velocities of 200 m s1 for large-core diameters, which compares well with the 165 m s1 value calculated (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Figs 5 and 6) on the basis of our temperature gradient estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the Tiller model, higher germanium concentrations resulted in lower critical velocities (10 m s1 for the 250 m cores), and the fluctuating deviations from a planar growth front could be seen (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibres of both concentrations with 15 m cores had critical velocities that were an order of magnitude higher, suggesting the stabilizing role of small core dimensions48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the diameter for absolute stability was not reached, as evidenced by the inhomogeneity of as-drawn small-core fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the critical velocity experiments and data analysis can be found in Supplementary Note 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Single-crystal formation', 'The fibre shown in Fig 4d,e (130 m core 6 at% Ge) was recrystallized at 100 m s1, below the critical velocity, and was studied in detail using X-ray diffraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis showed a single crystal with almost constant orientation over the entire analysed length of 7 mm (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Figs 811).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapid translation of the melt zone and the large temperature gradients in the core clearly suppress nucleation and crystallization at locations other than the advancing solidification front.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a fibre annealed at 10 m s1 had many qualitatively different diffraction patterns over a similar length, as would be expected for multiple grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velocity dependence of grain size is not anticipated by any of the models, as they do not consider nucleation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a general picture of the effect of the translation velocity can be formed by considering the competition between formation and growth of nuclei on defects at the core-cladding interface and extension of the growth of the existing crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In detailed experiments on both seeded and unseeded crystallization of water, Heneghan et al.57 showed that the fraction of samples still in the liquid state after time t goes as ekt, where k is a parameterized function of the degree of undercooling and material properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They further demonstrated that this temporal behaviour holds true for a wide variety of systems, including metallic alloys.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we consider sequential portions of the fibre to be equivalent to a series of samples, the likelihood of a nucleus forming before the passage of the existing crystal phase front depends on the time available, and hence on the velocity of the heat zone through the fibre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At high velocities, the chances of a stable nucleus forming are reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, any nuclei that are formed need time to grow inward from the core-cladding interface if they are to compete with the existing crystal in the core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high velocity also minimizes the time for growth, and favours the formation of large single-crystal regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, any interfacial roughening or compound formation driven by the laser treatment would result in a higher density of heterogeneous nucleation sites at lower scan velocities, and thus a tendency toward smaller grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The recrystallization process did not alter the oxygen content of the cores as determined by EDX, within experimental error.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the absorption of atomic oxygen in silicon occurs primarily at wavelengths 6 m, microscopic oxygen-related clusters of impurities may lead to scattering and thus a degradation of the optical properties of the material, even when a SiGe crystalline core is formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High-quality crystals are a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for good optical properties and preliminary measurements of the transmission losses of several large-core recrystallized fibres with 6 at% Ge were therefore made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before the laser treatment, losses were in excess of 20 dB cm1, as would be expected from the XCT results, which imply large refractive index inhomogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of any optimization of the interface layer, the fibre cores are continuous, but annealed large-core fibres show some oxygen inclusion, and large scattering features at the interface due to chemical interactions (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in the presence of these imperfections, the losses (12 dB cm1 at 1,550 nm and 9.7 dB cm1 at 2,000 nm) measured for a fibre with a 130 m core, suggest that with attention to optimizing the bulk material and interface defects, these fibres have a promising future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Microarchitecture control', 'The tendency of the elements to segregate can be overcome, as shown above, but it can also be utilized to make gradient composition structures by design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By establishing a melt zone that penetrated the full width of the fibre, followed by slow defocusing of the laser to reduce power density, localized and highly asymmetric high-germanium concentration features could be formed in the core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5a,b shows XCT of a 100 m spot written onto the side of a 6 at% Ge fibre by this method.

changing the solidification velocity, and the fibres are an ideal system to test and exploit this effect for the fabrication of compositional gratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two different modulations were performed: (a) interrupting the CO2 laser beam momentarily, which caused a reduction in the volume of the melt and an acceleration of the solidification front (Supplementary Movie 4); and (b)

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have demonstrated that localized laser thermal annealing for heat treatment of SiGe alloy core fibres is a powerful technique for modifying the composition and crystal structure of the core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fibre geometry allows for control and simultaneous observation of the crystallization process in addition to a range of post-processing analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small heated volume, efficient convective cooling and the quasi one-dimensional geometry of the fibres made unusually large temperature gradients (104 K cm1) at the solidification interface possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, combined with the large diffusion coefficient associated with the high peak temperatures attained, could be used to promote uniform composition in the recrystallized core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Planar solidification fronts were observed at growth velocities that are 13 orders of magnitude larger than those reported for bulk samples, but still 100 times smaller than would be needed for in-line processing of fibre given the core diameters and temperature gradients studied so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical velocity was observed to be greater for the fibres with smaller (10 m) cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This diameter is less than the facet lengths observed in two-dimensional recrystallization of SiGe31, and this suggests that the planar growth front may be stabilized by capillarity effects48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the large and small diameter fibres, increasing the germanium content in the fibres from 6 at% to 40 at% with a fixed temperature gradient resulted in a significant decrease in the critical growth velocity, consistent with the Tiller formulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fabrication of sub-micron-core fibres, where capillarity effects and larger thermal gradients are possible may permit the recrystallization of fibres in line during the drawing process by increasing the critical velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limiting factor is likely to be the heat removal process required to maintain suitable temperature gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If sufficient cooling is possible, partitionless solidification67,68,69,70 may be observed, avoiding the compositional undercooling problems entirely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to the processing desired for applications requiring a homogeneous composition, the laser treatment and the segregation tendency can be used to create non-uniform concentration profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method was used for the direct inscription of microscopic compositional features in optoelectronic fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fine spatial control over the growth velocity and melt zone geometry can be used to create rewritable periodic structures in the fibre, suggesting that waveguide dispersion modification and Bragg grating mirrors are possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As an example, silicon is a well-known material for terahertz waveguiding, and fibres with cores sizes of 130 m and a grating period of 45 m could be used for filtres and splitters in this important spectral region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small concentrations of germanium are adequate to make strong Bragg gratings (for example, the 3% germanium variation observed here would lead to n0.018).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Modification of the dispersion characteristics can also occur far from the Bragg wavelength, suggesting potential non-linear infrared applications such as mode coupling and supercontinuum generation71,72,73,74.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with planar waveguides, the fibre geometry would permit easier coupling of these sources to optical measurement systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It should be noted that the 40 m grating features demonstrated here are significantly smaller than both the laser beam waist (160 m) and the width of the melt zone (500 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the deposited composition is primarily a function of the local velocity at the solidification front and the diffusion properties in the interface region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are needed to determine the shortest period grating that can be written.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, scanned CO2 laser systems have been introduced recently for localized diffusion treatments of silicon circuits, and our results suggest that this equipment could be employed for controlled crystallization of encapsulated amorphous SiGe films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would permit direct integration of high-mobility circuit elements30 with minimal germanium concentration gradients and reduced heating of the wafer, in a two-dimensional equivalent of our process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This work introduces SiGe-core fibres and demonstrates the potential for laser heat treatment of semiconductor alloy optical fibres, both for fundamental materials studies and for direct formation of microscale compositional features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unstable growth at high solidification velocity (for example, during the drawing process), an increase in the critical velocity with reduced dimensions, and suppression of nucleation at velocities approaching the critical value have all been observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The technique employed here is generally applicable to additional materials and geometries.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Fibre fabrication', 'The majority of the experiments were performed on fibres with a core composition of Si0.94Ge0.06 and a silica glass cladding made in a single-fibre-drawing operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibres were fabricated by placing silicon and germanium pieces into a thick-walled silica tube (preform) closed at one end, and heating the assembly to 1,950 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The semiconductor alloy melted, and when the glass softened and was drawn downwards, a coaxial fibre was formed with the alloy in the centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid diffusion within the small volume of the semiconductor liquid assured complete mixing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the drawing process, many metres of fibre were produced as the diameter of the preform was reduced from 30 to 1 mm and the core reduced from 4 mm to 130 m diameter;
