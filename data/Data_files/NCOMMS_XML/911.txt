Meta-analysis identifies novel risk loci and yields systematic insights into the biology of male-pattern baldness  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Male-pattern baldness (MPB) is a common and highly heritable trait characterized by androgen-dependent, progressive hair loss from the scalp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we carry out the largest GWAS meta-analysis of MPB to date, comprising 10,846 early-onset cases and 11,672 controls from eight independent cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify 63 MPB-associated loci (P less_than 5 × 108, METAL) of which 23 have not been reported previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 63 loci explain 39% of the phenotypic variance in MPB and highlight several plausible candidate genes (FGF5, IRF4, DKK2) and pathways (melatonin signalling, adipogenesis) that are likely to be implicated in the key-pathophysiological features of MPB and may represent promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data provide molecular evidence that rather than being an isolated trait, MPB shares a substantial biological basis with numerous other human phenotypes and may deserve evaluation as an early prognostic marker, for example, for prostate cancer, sudden cardiac arrest and neurodegenerative disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Male-pattern baldness (MPB) has a lifetime prevalence of 80% in European men and is characterized by a characteristic pattern of progressive hair loss in distinct populations of androgen-dependent scalp hair follicles1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early-onset MPB in particular can exert profound negative effects on quality of life2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the pathobiology of MPB remains incompletely understood4,5 and no causal therapy is available, current MBP treatments are of limited efficacy in many patients and even can have severe adverse effects6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, studies that clarify the biological underpinnings of key-pathophysiological features of MPB and enable the identification of novel molecular targets for more effective therapeutic intervention are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, molecular genetic studies that enable the identification of early causal events and allow differentiation between disease cause and consequence7, hold great potential and have already proven to be successful in the identification of contributing risk factors8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for the majority of the identified loci, few data are available concerning the manner on how these genetic variants contribute to (i) the strict androgen-dependency of the phenotype; (ii) the restriction of pathophysiological changes to hair follicles in the frontal and vertex scalp regions; (iii) characteristic changes in hair follicle cycling (anagen-shortening/premature catagen entry); and (iv) the gradual (mini-)organ transformation of pigmented terminal hair into unpigmented vellus hair follicles4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the high heritability of MPB (h280%; refs 13, 14), and the fact that a significant fraction of the overall heritable risk for MPB still awaits identification, large-scale genetic studies are an important tool to elucidate the molecular basis of MPB and to gain systematic insights into the underlying pathobiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we report the results of the largest genome-wide association studies (GWAS) meta-analysis of MPB to date, that comprised a total of 22,518 individuals from eight independent GWAS samples of European descent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis identifies 63 genome-wide significant loci that explain 39% of the phenotypic variance in MPB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than one-third of these loci (N=23) have not been reported previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data highlight highly plausible candidate genes and pathways that are likely to contribute to key-pathophysiological characteristics of MPB such as the deregulation of anagen-to-catagen transition (FGF5, EBF1, DKK2, adipogenesis); increased androgen sensitivity (SRD5A2, melatonin signalling); and the transformation of pigmented terminal hair into unpigmented vellus hair (IRF4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of these genes and pathways may represent promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our data provide molecular evidence that MPB shares a substantial biological basis with numerous other human phenotypes, which may have major implications in terms of the evaluation of MPB as an early prognostic marker for different phenotypes such as prostate cancer, sudden cardiac arrest or neurodegenerative disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Meta-analysis', 'Our meta-analysis of eight independent GWAS samples of European descent (10,846 early-onset MPB cases, 11,672 controls; Supplementary Note 1; Supplementary Table 1) identified a total of 63 genome-wide significant MPB-risk loci (P less_than 5 × 108, METAL), which account for 39% of the phenotypic variance in MPB (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include 40 previously reported and 23 novel MPB-risk loci (Table 1; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding the genomic context of the 63 genome-wide significant risk loci, the majority of the association peaks (N=45, 71%) mapped to intergenic regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 60 (95%) of the association peaks were located within 500 kb of a protein coding gene, and a total of 18 (29%) association peaks mapped to intronic or coding regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, six of the MPB-risk loci are located on the X-chromosome, and may thus contribute to the anecdotal similarity in hair status observed between men and their maternal grandfathers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them are the well-established AR/EDA2R-locus on Xq12, a locus near FAM9A and FAM9B on Xp22.31 and two loci near KLF8 and TRS2 on Xp11.21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 57 loci are located on the autosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heritability estimates on the liability scale were 0.14 (±0.03) for the X-chromosome, and 0.34 (±0.12) for the autosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Risk score analysis', 'To evaluate the potential value of these association findings for the prediction of MPB risk, a weighted genotype-risk score for MPB was constructed from the lead SNPs of the 63 risk loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting score was divided into quartiles, and the risk for MPB was tested in each quartile, using the lowest quartile as a reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Table 2, an increased risk for MPB was observed across all quartiles, with a substantially increased risk for MPB in quartile four (odds ratio (OR)=4.16, 95% confidence interval (CI)=(2.038.55)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was even stronger after adjustment for age (OR=5.14, 95% CI=(2.4410.86)), which underlines the strong age-dependency of the trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integration with mRNA and miRNA expression data', 'To enable biological interpretation of the association findings and to pinpoint plausible candidate genes, the genetic data were integrated with own unpublished data on hair follicle mRNA-, and micro(mi) RNA-expression, an unpublished expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) dataset from hair follicle (for details see Supplementary Materials and Methods) and two published eQTL data sets from skin and blood15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison with eQTL data sets revealed a colocalization of MPB-risk variants with known regulatory variants (r2 greater than 0.5 between eQTL single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and MPB lead SNP) in 25 loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 10 of these 25 loci, previous studies have found an association between the MPB lead SNP itself and gene expression for example, of CRHR1, which encodes for a receptor for corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), a known hair growth inhibitor and catagen inductor17, FAM53B a positive regulator of WNT/beta-catenin-signalling18 and other genes, for example, ANXA2, SUCNR1, WARS2 that have not yet been associated with hair biology (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed functional follow-up studies are now warranted to confirm these regulatory interactions, and to investigate the contribution of these candidate genes to the development of key MPB pathophysiological signs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 19 association peaks (30%) were located within 500 kb of a miRNA gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eighteen of these 34 miRNA-genes were expressed in human scalp hair follicles, and were predicted to target numerous mRNA genes at MPB-risk loci (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since miRNAs have been implicated in various aspects of hair biology, such as the control of hair follicle cycling, keratinocyte differentiation/proliferation and melanogenesis19, these miRNA-genes and their target genes may constitute plausible candidate genes at these MPB-associated loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DEPICT analysis and enhancer enrichment', 'The DEPICT analysis (Supplementary Tables 46) and literature search identified highly plausible candidate genes, such as FGF5 at 4q21.21 (rs982804; P=2.2 × 109, METAL) and DKK2 at 4q25 (rs145945174; P=1.3 × 1013, METAL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FGF5 plays an important role in the regulation of anagen-to-catagen transition and the control of human hair length20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DKK2 encodes for a member of the family of dickkopf WNT-signalling inhibitors, which are reported to be secreted by dermal papilla cells Fig f1 Fig 2(DPCs) in response to androgens and to promote androgen-induced (premature) anagen-to-catagen transition23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, our data indicated a nominally significant enrichment (P less_than 0.05, 1 million permutations) of credible MPB SNPs in enhancer regions from DPCs (treated with dihydrotestosterone, DHT), which further supports the hypothesis that DPCs are involved in MPB aetiology25 (Fig 2; Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An interesting focus for future research will be to map androgen receptor (AR) binding sites in DPCs and other hair-related cell types to test for enrichment of MPB-risk variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Manhattan plot of association results from the genome-wide meta-analysis.Manhattan plot showing the results of the genome-wide association meta-analysis in 10,846 early-onset MPB cases and 11,672 controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The x axis shows the chromosomal position, and the y axis shows the log10 (P-value) (METAL) of the association analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously reported genome-wide significant loci are depicted in blue;

prostate hyperplasia and cancer49,50,51; Parkinsons disease10; and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore investigated a possible genetic overlap between MPB and other phenotypes, and compared our data to reported GWAS signals from the NHGRI GWAS catalogue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are summarized in Supplementary Data 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 124 GWAS catalogue entries mapped to MPB-risk loci (r20.3 and/or D greater than 0.8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These included the above mentioned associations with hormone-dependent traits and a reduced pigmentation of facial skin, scalp hair and eyes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As regards to the well-established associations between MPB and CVD and prostate cancer, a total of seven overlapping associations were identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These were found between MPB and: (i) blood pressure (N=3); (ii) QT-interval length (N=1); (iii) atrial fibrillation (N=1); (iv) sudden cardiac arrest (N=1); (v) and prostate cancer (N=1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, our analysis confirmed the positive epidemiological association between prostate cancer and MPB at Xq12 (AR/EDA2R-locus), pointing towards a shared pathophysiological mechanism that may involve EDA2R-signalling and AR-transactivation53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, for the majority of CVD GWAS SNPs, the direction of effect for MPB and CVD differed, thus opposing the reported positive association between MPB and CVD at an epidemiological level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was not the case for the positive associations between MPB and diastolic blood pressure at 4q21.21, and sudden cardiac arrest at 12q13.12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, further analyses are warranted to elucidate the exact underlying genes and biological pathways, and how they relate to the epidemiological findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, while the 4q21.21 locus pointed towards a positive association between MPB and diastolic blood pressure levels, opposite effect direction were observed for a second overlapping association between these traits on 5q33.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the effect direction of the genetic correlation between two complex traits may differ between individual loci or pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding highlights the need for systematic studies to assess not only the quantitative genetic overlap but also individual overlapping genetic factors and the underlying genes and pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, associations with four loci were found for MPB and lower body height, which may be driven by an accelerated progression of puberty and premature induction of epiphyseal closure54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MPB-risk alleles at 17q21.31 and 6q22.32 were associated with increased bone mineral density, which may be a consequence of optimized UVR-induced vitamin D synthesis in subjects with MPB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the observation that MPB-associated alleles confer a reduced risk for immune related phenotypes, such as type 1 diabetes; multiple sclerosis (MS); and rheumatoid arthritis (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increased incidence of these diseases has been reported in subjects with poor vitamin D intake and low serum vitamin D levels55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a recent Mendelian-randomization study by Mokry et al.56, found an association between genetically lowered 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and increased susceptibility to MS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our data indicate shared genetic determinants for MPB and a reduced risk for ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and chronic lymphatic leukaemia, as well as overlapping associations with progressive supranuclear palsy and decreased intracranial volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indispensability of sex hormones for the MPB phenotype is supported by the identification of overlapping genetic association between MPB and other hormone-dependent traits, such as an earlier age-at-onset of menarche in females and earlier sexual maturation and higher serum androgen levels in males (6q22.32, 16p13.12, Xp22.31)12,57,58,59,60.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The present genome-wide meta-analysis identified 63 risk loci for MPB, and highlights highly plausible candidate genes that are likely to be implicated in the key-pathophysiological features of MPB, such as deregulation of anagen-to-catagen transition (FGF5, EBF1, DKK2, adipogenesis); increased androgen sensitivity (SRD5A2, melatonin signalling); and transformation of pigmented terminal hair into unpigmented vellus hair (IRF4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated for SRD5A2, the GWAS approach is a valuable tool for drug target identification and the newly identified candidate genes and pathways, perhaps most notably FGF5 and melatonin signalling are promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic options for MPB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to confirming the involvement of well-established pathways that control hormonal status (androgen metabolism, oestrogen signalling) and hair follicle cycling (WNT-signalling, EGF-signalling), our data support the importance of less-well studied biological contexts, such as the involvement of perifollicular macrophages and adipocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Moreover, our data provide molecular evidence that rather than being an isolated trait, MPB shares a substantial biological basis with numerous other human phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may have major implications in terms of the evaluation of MPB as an early prognostic marker for different phenotypes such as prostate cancer, sudden cardiac arrest or neurodegenerative disorders, and for the repurposing of existing drugs for use in MPB therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter is illustrated by the fact that the efficacy of the two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs, minoxidilTable 1 Table 2 and finasteride in MPB, was a serendipitous finding in patients administered these medications for hypertension and prostate hyperplasia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, these novel insights into the genetic basis of MPB and its association with other traits may help to elucidate the evolutionary forces responsible for the relatively high prevalence of MPB in the European population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Summary results for the lead SNPs for the 63 genome-wide significant MPB-risk loci.Full size table', 'Table 2 Association between the weighted genotype-risk score and MPB.Full size table'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

TwinsUK (163 cases; 210 controls).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed description of the studies and their phenotype definitions is provided in Supplementary Note 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All eight studies were

of the eight studies fulfillment of the following two criteria was required: (i) a minor allele frequency (MAF) of  greater than 1%; and (ii) a call rate of  greater than 98%, a variance ratio of 0.3 (MACH) or a proper info statistic of 0.4 (IMPUTE2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imputed data were analysed using logistic regression and the dosage data options of either PLINK or SNPTEST.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Meta-analysis', 'The present meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the GWAS meta-analysis standards outlined in de Bakker et al.61 A fixed effects model was used to combine the logistic regression effect estimates of individual studies into a joint estimate, as implemented in METAL62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results were cross-validated using the respective implementations in METAINTER and YAMAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cochrans Q statistics and the I2 measurement were used to test for cross-study heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-values for the test of heterogeneity were calculated according to Higgins et al.63 The meta-analysis included a total of N=8,004,650 SNPs that were available in the 23andMe cohort and (i) at least four additional studies for non-X-chromosomal SNPs, and (ii) three additional studies for X-chromosomal SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QQ-plot of the meta-analysis and a plot of the across-study homogeneity are shown in Supplementary Figs 2 and 3.

(PHet) of  less_than 0.01.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNPs separated by a distances of 100 kb on the autosomes and 500 kb on the X-chromosome were assigned to the same genomic region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loci were

considered to be independent if the lead SNPs of the regions showed an LD of r2 less_than 0.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Test for polygenicity', 'For the meta-analysis overall, an inflation factor of =1.303

inflation decreased to =1.16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that a relevant proportion of the observed inflation is driven by genome-wide significant associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume from this finding that the remaining inflation is driven primarily by true genetic association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with previous reports of a polygenetic contribution to MPB, and with observations from meta-analyses of other complex genetic traits in which large numbers of common risk factors were identified64,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the inflation was attributable to polygenicity or to confounding factors, the LD score regression method66 was applied using LD Score v1.0.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis confirmed that most of the observed inflation is because of polygenicity (63.5%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual genomic inflation is GC=1.09, indicating that the observed association findings are not due to population stratification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To estimate the proportion of potentially-false positive findings, association P-values (logistic regression) and effect directions for the 63 lead SNPs were compared between the 23andMe cohort (23andMe) and a meta-analysis of the remaining seven cohorts (MAwo23andMe) (Supplementary Table 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 62 of the 63 loci (98%) the analysis revealed a consistency of effect directions between 23andMe and MAwo23andMe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these loci, 76% (47/62) showed at least nominal significant association to MPB in the MAwo23andMe study

the self-report based phenotyping used in the 23andMe cohort, phenotyping in the Bonn sample (BN) was based on clinical assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus for true positive association findings, stronger effect sizes would be expected on average in the BN sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was indeed the case: for 52 out of 61 lead SNPs available in the BN sample (85%) which would be highly unlikely if these loci included a relevant proportion of false positives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these results, no correction was made for the residual inflation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of significance of the 63 MPB lead SNPs after double GC correction with the residual inflation factors from the LD score regression analyses is however indicated in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Definition of credible sets of SNPs', 'For each risk locus, a credible set of SNPs was defined, as reported in Ripke et al.65 (Supplementary Table 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, here the connection between the deviance and the single-variant test statistics is used to calculate the probability that a specific variant is associated with MPB for the given set of data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These probabilities are used to determine sets of variants within the risk locithat is, credible sets of SNPswhich contain the causal variant 99% of the time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Estimation of heritability', 'The Bonn cohort was used to estimate the heritability of MPB, since individual genotypes were available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All imputed variants with an imputation info score of  greater than 0.6 were extracted, and the corresponding genotypes were called using a probability threshold of 0.9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting dataset comprised 997 male individuals and 8,271,786 SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants with a MAF of  greater than 0.01 and a genotype SNP-call rate of  greater than 95% were then filtered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only SNPs with a P-value of  greater than 5% for the corresponding test of differences in missingness between cases and controls were retained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After outlier detection with EIGENSTRAT based on autosomal data and the exclusion of individuals based on a genetic similarity of  greater than 0.05, calculated by GCTA, we obtained the Genetic Relationship Matrix (GRM) for the autosomes and the X-chromosome with respect to 991 male individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With these two GRMs and 10 eigenvectors from the EIGENSTRAT step above, the heritability components were estimated using GCTA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated heritability on the observed scale was 0.666 (0.234) for the autosomes and 0.277 (0.054) for the X-chromosome (standard errors in brackets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain the estimated heritability on the liability scale, as described in Lee et al.67, a straightforward extension of this transformation was used to account for the extreme case and extreme control sampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Table 2 in Hamilton68 was
