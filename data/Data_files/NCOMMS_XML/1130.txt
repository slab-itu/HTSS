Meniscus-assisted solution printing of large-grained perovskite films for high-efficiency solar cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Control over morphology and crystallinity of metal halide perovskite films is of key importance to enable high-performance optoelectronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this remains particularly challenging for solution-printed devices due to the complex crystallization kinetics of semiconductor materials within dynamic flow of inks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a simple yet effective meniscus-assisted solution printing (MASP) strategy to yield large-grained dense perovskite film with good crystallization and preferred orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the outward convective flow triggered by fast solvent evaporation at the edge of the meniscus ink imparts the transport of perovskite solutes, thus facilitating the growth of micrometre-scale perovskite grains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth kinetics of perovskite crystals is scrutinized by in situ optical microscopy tracking to understand the crystallization mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The perovskite films produced by MASP exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties with efficiencies approaching 20% in planar perovskite solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This robust MASP strategy may in principle be easily extended to craft other solution-printed perovskite-based optoelectronics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Solution printing is widely recognized as an attractive route to cost-effective, high-throughput and large-area thin film optoelectronics1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this technique, the ink solution containing semiconductor precursors or nanoparticles can be readily deposited on a variety of desirable substrates, offering precise control over stoichiometry and rendering ubiquitous adaptability and compatibility with patterned and flexible substrates4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As state-of-the-art direct bandgap semiconductors, metal halide perovskites capitalize on superior optoelectronic characteristics such as intense broadband absorption, large ambipolar mobility, long charge carrier lifetime, and low processing cost compared with inorganic counterparts (e.g., silicon, CIGS and CdTe)5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed metal halide perovskite solar cells has rapidly leapfrogged from 3.8% to 22.1% over the past several years7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, top-performing perovskite solar cells have recently been advanced largely by optimizing the crystal morphology of methylammonium lead halides (MAPbX3, X=I, Br and Cl), formamidinium lead halides (FAPbX3), and their combinations9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the requirement of morphology control has posed a great challenge for solution-printed perovskite films due to the limited understanding of crystallization in dynamic flow of perovskite inks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is important to note that photoluminescence spectroscopy has revealed that the trap-assisted non-radiative charge recombination dominates the efficiency loss in perovskite solar cells12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of charge traps is strongly associated with the disorder of crystals caused by ionized impurities, lattice vacancies and interstices and grain-boundary defects within perovskite film14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through improving the crystallization, charge traps inside high-crystallinity perovskites exist at shallow states, yet deep traps are still massively present near the grain boundary region15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, several solution-processed routes to micrometre-sized perovskite grains by crafting films at high temperatures (for example, spin coating at 180 °C for MAPbI3(1x)Cl3x and doctor-blading at 145 °C for FAxMA1xPbI3, 0x1) have been successfully implemented to reduce the areas of grain boundary and minimize the trap-induced energy loss16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One notion behind these effective approaches is that the grain-boundary motion depends strongly on the temperature, and a high temperature can stimulate solute atoms more easily to overcome the diffusion energy barrier, thus resulting in fast grain growth rate18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, solution printing may not be amenable to high-temperature preparative conditions that are close to the boiling point, Tbp, of typical solvents used for dissolving perovskites (for example, dimethylformamide (DMF), Tbp, DMF=152 °C; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Tbp, DMSO=189 °C), as the ink solution is too volatile to render the control over the crystal morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to increased energy consumption, high-temperature treatment is also likely to cause thermal degradation and thermo-mechanical fatigue of perovskite and electrode materials, especially for flexible electrodes such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, a low-temperature strategy for morphological control of solution-printed perovskite films is highly desirable, which has yet to be explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report on a versatile meniscus-assisted solution printing (MASP) strategy to create highly crystallized perovskite films with micrometre-scale grains and preferred crystal orientations at low temperatures for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, a meniscus is formed due to capillary action by constraining the perovskite ink between a lower substrate and an upper plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fast solvent evaporation at the edge (that is, the air/perovskite ink/lower substrate three-phase contact line) of the meniscus triggers an outward convective flow to replenish the evaporative loss of solvent and meanwhile transports the perovskite solutes toward the contact line due to the coffee ring effect21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yields a perovskite supersaturated phase containing continually aggregated solutes, promoting the nucleation and growth of perovskite crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through placing the lower substrate on a programmed translational stage, the receding meniscus can be slowly and progressively swept across the entire lower substrate, thereby printing a continuous perovskite film on the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the MASP deposition is inspired by solution-coating techniques in the field of organic semiconductor processing24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For solution-based coating of metal halide perovskite materials, doctor-blade coating has been widely employed to deposit perovskite thin films or microwires for optoelectronic applications28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the deposition of perovskite solutes by doctor-blade coating with which the solvent evaporation is driven by applying high temperatures28,29,30, MASP promotes the perovskite crystallization by accelerating the solvent evaporation through the meniscus effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystallization mechanism of perovskite films crafted by MASP is revealed by in-situ optical microscopy investigation into the crystal growth kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, it provides insights into the precise control over the crystal morphology and crystallinity of perovskite films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The produced perovskite films possess preferred crystal orientations and enhanced optoelectronic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high PCE approaching 20% is achieved in the planar perovskite solar cells assembled using the MASP-enabled perovskite films as the photoactive layers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Outward convective flow within meniscus perovskite ink', 'A complex stoichiometry of FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 containing two mixed organic cations (that is, FA0.85MA0.15) and two mixed halides (that is, I2.55Br0.45) is selected as the perovskite material because of its enhanced efficiency and stability as compared to MAPbI3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, FAPbI3 has a lower bandgap than that of MAPbI3 and thus is beneficial for increasing light harvesting, and MAPbBr3 improves the stability of the FAPbI3 perovskite phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A scheme of crafting large perovskite crystal grains by MASP is illustrated in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The metal halide perovskite ink FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 in DMSO was loaded in a two-nearly-parallel-plate geometry where the lower flat substrate can be moved against the upper stationary plate in a programmable manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The separation distance between these two plates was fixed at 300 m to form a concave meniscus held by capillary force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important signature of capillary action is the presence of a meniscus at the edge of the confined ink.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b shows a representative side-view optical micrograph of confined meniscus ink, where the velocity of outward convective flow v induced by solvent evaporation can be described by Navier-Stokes equation with the lubrication approximation (Supplementary Note 1)22,32:', 'Figure 1: Meniscus-assisted solution printing of FA0.85 greater than MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite crystal films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic illustration of the meniscus-assisted solution printing (MASP) of large-grained perovskite films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Optical micrograph of the side-view meniscus ink confined between a lower flat, movable substrate and an upper stationary plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Optical micrograph of the microstructural evolution of FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite grain as a function of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the perovskite film crafted by MASP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A representative selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of the perovskite film is shown as an inset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the perovskite film crafted by MASP (upper) and the reference sample prepared by spin coating (lower).Full size image', '', 'where Je is the evaporative flux of solvent, t is time,  is the density of solution, r is the horizontal distance of the meniscus surface away from the bulk ink, and h is the height of the meniscus at r. As the volume of loaded ink is sufficient for completing the printing process, the shape of the meniscus remains relatively unchanged with time, and thus the  h/  t term can be neglected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equation (1) can then be simplified as:', '', 'We fitted the experimentally measured outline of the meniscus with a parabolic equation h=a·(Rr)b, where h is dependent on the moving speed of the lower substrate (that is, the coating speed of perovskite).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The theoretical fit agreed well the experimental meniscus outline (that is, the red dashed curve in Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evaporative flux Je can be described by the non-equilibrium one-sided (NEOS) model (Supplementary Note 1)33:', '', 'where K is the non-equilibrium parameter34, W is the thermal effect given by  (k is the liquid thermal conductivity, ks is the thermal conductivity of substrate, d0 is the liquid thickness and ds is the thickness of substrate).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining Equation (3) with Equation (2), the outward flow velocity v as a function of the distance r away from the bulk ink can be obtained:', '', 'According to Equations (3) and (4), we can derive that the outward convective flow increases sharply at the meniscus edge (Supplementary Fig 1), as the solvent evaporation is faster toward the edge of the meniscus ink, correspondingly transporting the solutes to the meniscus front and leading to the perovskite supersaturated phase at the edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Process of meniscus-assisted solution printing', 'As a result, FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 solutes gradually precipitate out from the supersaturated phase and grow into large crystals as the outward flow continuously transport more solutes to the edge of the meniscus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A real-time tracking of the perovskite crystal growth by optical microscopy is shown in Fig 1c, depicting the evolution of a perovskite nucleus into a large-grained microstructure (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At time t0, a relatively small perovskite grain (marked with the white arrow) appeared in the front of meniscus ink with an effective diameter of 4 m. As time progressed (that is, from t0+1 s, t0+4 s, to t0+7 s), the grain underwent a two-dimensional (2D) growth to a large crystal island (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eventually, the grain growth slowed down when it was connected with other adjacent grains (that is, t0+12 s), accompanied by the coalescence of neighbouring grains (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the perovskite grain growth is expected to initially follow a normal three-dimensional (3D) mode before its size becomes comparable to the film thickness (that is, 900 nm, Supplementary Fig 3)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the grain size at the initial stage was too small to be accurately seen and tracked by optical microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the grain size exceeded the film thickness, the perpendicular growth was suppressed due to the specimen thickness effect in thin films35, resulting in the observed 2D growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The lower substrate mounted on the translational stage was moved at a constant speed of 12 m s1 in the direction opposite to the receding meniscus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the evaporative front progressively swept across the entire substrate to print a continuous film composed of large perovskite grains (Supplementary Movie 2), and no stick-slip motion was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1d shows a representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the perovskite film crafted by MASP, revealing that FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite grains with a size of 2080 m were densely packed together without observable voids at grain boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A low-magnification SEM image in Supplementary Fig 4a further displays a uniform morphology over a few millimetres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that a uniform morphology can only be achieved when the coating speed vc (that is, vc=12 m s1) was close to the receding speed of the meniscus edge due to solvent evaporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the coating speed (for example, vc=2 m s1) was slower than the meniscus receding speed, the meniscus edge was found to quickly reach the edge of the upper plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the perovskite crystals bridged the upper plate and the lower substrate (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, when the coating speed (for example, vc=50 m s1) was faster than the meniscus receding speed, a liquid layer rather than a solid film was coated on the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The liquid layer then dried to form discontinuous perovskite crystals as shown in Supplementary Fig 4c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a physical model has been built to predict the optimal window for the coating speed by estimating the equilibrium front evaporation speed vefe in the evaporation regime of meniscus coating36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employ this model to further analyse the influence of the substrate temperature, the boiling point of solvent, the solvent density, and the meniscus geometrical factor in the MASP process on the front evaporation speed of DMSO (Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated vefe of DMSO at 60 °C is 4 m s1 (Supplementary Fig 5a) and the optimized coating speed vc we used in MASP was 12 m s1, thus the normalized coating speed =vc/vefe=3, suggesting that this model may be able to predict the optimal window of the coating speed via estimating the front solvent evaporation rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that there was also an optimal substrate temperature (that is, T=60±10 °C) for depositing uniform FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite films by MASP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following this optimal operation window (that is, vc=12 m s1 and T=60 °C), the two-nearly-parallel-plate geometry, the substrate temperature, and the coating speed were thus fixed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can adjust the film thickness by simply varying the perovskite precursor solution concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 5b shows the thickness of MASP-deposited FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite film as a function of the solution concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also characterized the morphology of the spin-coated FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite film as reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEM image showed that the spin-coated perovskite film comprised the nanoscale grains with a size of 50300 nm (Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-sectional SEM image revealed a typical film thickness of 780±20 nm (Supplementary Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elemental mapping of the spin-coated FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite film was measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), verifying that the spin-coated film had a uniform composition dispersion (that is, Pb, Br and I) (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The presence of high-quality micrometre-sized grains within these large FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite grains was corroborated by the well-defined selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (that is, selected area size=2 m, Supplementary Fig 8) shown as an inset in Fig 1d, which can be attributed to a trigonal perovskite crystal with the (110) plane preferentially parallel to the substrate (Supplementary Method 1; Supplementary Fig 9)37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the spin-coated FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite film showed ring-type SAED patterns (Supplementary Fig 10), implying that there was no preferred crystal orientation and the film had a polycrystalline structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite film prepared by MASP and the reference sample prepared by spin coating are shown in Fig 1e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All diffraction peak positions of these two films agreed well with the simulated XRD profile of a trigonal perovskite crystal with the space group P3m1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the relative intensity ratio of (40)/(024) to (11) was increased for the film prepared by MASP, implying that the MASP film possessed the preferred crystal orientation along the  less_than 20 greater than / less_than 012 greater than  direction (Supplementary Method 2; Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the  less_than 012 greater than -oriented FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 trigonal crystal forms a corner-sharing lead halide octahedral network with a long-range order (Supplementary Fig 9d), which is an ideal structure for effective charge transport across the perovskite film38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that the high-purity trigonal perovskite crystals were directly formed at a relatively low temperature (that is, 60 °C) by MASP (Supplementary Fig 12), thereby dispensing with the need for high-temperature treatment in the spin-coated films in order to convert the DMSO-incorporated intermediate to perovskite phase (Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that the diffraction peak positions of the FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite film prepared by MASP were not completely the same as those prepared by spin coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, there is a small right shift of 2=0.26o for the () peak in the spin-coated film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in the diffraction peak positions suggested that the stoichiometry of the perovskite films prepared by MASP and spin coating may be slightly different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to identify the chemical composition of perovskite films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, the perovskite film prepared by MASP had the real chemical composition of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.14 (Supplementary Fig 13), which was almost consistent with the stoichiometry of the perovskite precursors in the ink.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for the spin-coated perovskite film, the real chemical composition was found to be (FAPbI3)0.82(MAPbBr3)0.13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MASP technique not only entail a relatively low-temperature deposition of FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite films with high crystallinity, but also facilitate the formation of micrometer-scale perovskite grains with preferred crystal orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceivably, the resulting perovskite films may demonstrate advantageous optoelectronic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Growth kinetics of perovskite crystals', 'To further understand the crystallization mechanism of perovskites crafted by MASP, we turn our attention to scrutinize the growth kinetics of FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 crystals by real-time optical microscopy measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a depicts the area of the tracked FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 crystal island as a function of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A two-stage crystal growth is observed, namely, a quadratic increase of crystal area with time at the early stage of growth and a linear increase of crystal area with time at the late stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that this growth pattern is analogous to the vacuum deposition of organic crystals on substrate39,40, except that the atom transferring medium in MASP is a liquid flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, we examine the perovskite crystal growth kinetics according to the scaling capture zone model41,42, in which the crystal growth is essentially governed by the accessible collection area for solutes and the solute diffusion length41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accessible collection area of the FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 crystal island can be estimated by its Voronoi cell that included all solutes closer to this specific island than to any others43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central point of each island (that is, red dots in Fig 2b,c) is labelled as the nucleation centre to diagram the Voronoi cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The good agreement between the Voronoi cell topographies and the obtained perovskite island shapes suggests a strong correlation between the crystal growth and the accessible collection area40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the early growth stage of the FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite island with its centre labelled as P (Fig 2b), the effective radius Reff of the island was relatively small (that is, Reff,t0 =4 m at time t0), the Voronoi cell radius RVor of the island at time t0 was very large (that is, RVor,t0 greater than 100 m) as it was isolated far from other neighbouring crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Reff+ less_than RVor, the crystal growth rate was mainly determined by the solute diffusion length  toward the island, and thus a quadratic crystal growth emerged and can be described by dA/dt=kq(2 Reff+2), where A= is the island area, and kq is the rate constant39,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of  was then derived by fitting the measured island size to the quadratic growth equation, yielding =4 m. We note that the EDS measurement showed a uniform elemental mapping of the FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite island (Supplementary Fig 14), suggesting that the diffusion lengths of various solutes (that is, FA, MA, Pb, I and Br) were possibly comparable and did not generate obvious composition segregation in perovskite crystals during MASP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evaporation-induced outward convective flow is expected to facilitate the solute diffusion and promote the crystal growth rate at this stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relationship Reff+ less_than RVor changed to Reff+ greater than RVor, as the FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite island grew larger (that is, Reff,t9=51 m at time t0+9 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile more new adjacent crystals emerged as evidenced in Fig 2c, the tracked island had to compete with the neighbours for collecting the perovskite solutes, leading to smaller RVor (that is, RVor,t9=48 m at time t0+9 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the crystal growth rate was largely determined by the accessible collection area of the island, giving rise to a linear crystal growth (dA/dt=klAVor, where AVor is the area of the Voronoi cell, and kl is the rate constant)39,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Growth kinetics of FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite crystals during meniscus-assisted solution printing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Plot of the area of the tracked FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite crystal island as a function of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tracked island centre is marked with P in b and c.

two-stage growth kinetics (Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to further verify the reliability of the observed crystal growth kinetics, we analyse the growth rates of a number of FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 crystal islands (that is, a total of 18 islands shown in Fig 2d) in a single real-time tracking by optical microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the islands were isolated far from each other at the early stage, only the growth rates at the late stage were monitored, that is, the crystal growth followed the condition of Reff +  greater than RVor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average crystal growth rate and the corresponding Voronoi cell area of each island from time  to +3 s were calculated (Supplementary Fig 16; Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linear relationship dA/dt=klAVor was indeed also observed for these islands with varied sizes and growth rates (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of the linear crystal growth is that the solute density varies slowly in the crystallization regime when the solute diffusion rate is comparable with the solute crystallization rate, and the crystallization regime can be approximated as a steady state, thereby enabling the statistics studies of the diffusion equation with appropriate boundary conditions for simple island configuration42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of this crystal growth kinetics, it is suggested that the final size of the perovskite crystals yielded by MASP depends strongly on the nucleation density, and a lower nucleation density facilitates the growth of large crystals due to a fewer competitors for solutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the nucleation density relies on the evaporation-driven outward convective flow (that is, faster outward flow leading to higher nucleation density) within the meniscus ink, which can be tuned by adjusting the meniscus height, the solvent density, the substrate temperature, and the substrate moving speed36,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Optoelectronic performances of perovskites films', 'Intrigued by the attractive features of micrometer-sized grains and preferred crystal orientations, we set out to investigate the photophysical properties of MASP-enabled perovskite films.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a compares the ultraviolet-visible (UVVis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite film crafted by MASP and the film prepared by spin coating (Supplementary Method 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PL peak of the MASP film exhibited a 20 meV red-shift compared to that of the spin-coated film (Supplementary Fig 17a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the Stokes shifts for both films were almost negligible (that is, 5 meV), accordingly, a red-shift of the absorption onset edge was seen (Supplementary Fig 17b and 17c), implying that the MASP film had a slightly lower bandgap than that of the spin-coated film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the PL spectrum was narrowed by 26 meV for the MASP film, suggesting that the MASP film contained fewer crystalline defects16,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low Urbach energy (that is, 19 meV, Fig 3b) further confirmed the presence of reduced localization disordering within the MASP-enabled FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite film47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge carrier lifetime was measured by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge carrier lifetimes in the MASP perovskite film (that is, 1=70±5 ns and 2=1,104±251 ns) were much longer than the spin-coated film (that is, ref1=41±1 ns and ref2=268±28 ns), indicating a lower trap density within the MASP film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, the longer lifetime 2 of the MASP film exceeded 1,000 ns, signifying that the trap-induced carrier recombination was appreciably reduced due to the formation of high-quality and large-sized FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite grains by MASP48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge trap densities within the perovskite films were actually measured from the space charge-limited current (SCLC) devices (Supplementary Method 4)46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The charge trap density within the MASP

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The stability of FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite solar cells with the device architecture of FTO/compact-TiO2/Perovskite/PTAA/Ag fabricated by MASP and spin coating, respectively, is also investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The devices are continuously exposed to AM1.5G solar illumination in ambient environment (temperature=25±2 °C and relative humidity=30±8%) without encapsulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photovoltaic efficiency is measured at an interval of 12 h. Figure 5 compares the photovoltaic parameters as a function of time for both MASP-deposited and spin-coated devices (the JV curves were shown in Supplementary Fig 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spin-coated device started to experience the efficiency drop after 12-h continuous illumination and lost 50% of its initial efficiency in 60 h. In contrast, the MASP-deposited device maintained nearly 90% of its initial efficiency after 60-h continuous illumination in air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency was then rapidly decreased after 84 h and reached 35% of its initial efficiency in 108 h. The enhanced stability of perovskite films prepared by MASP can be ascribed to the incorporation of FA+ and Br- components which are beneficial for improving the perovskite stability31, as the unsealed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cells usually lose 70% of their initial efficiencies within 48 h under continuous illumination in air49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it is also highly correlated with the high-quality large perovskite grains produced by MASP which are more resistant to light- and moisture-induced degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our ongoing work on further improving the device stability involves the incorporation of Cs+ in the perovskite composition51 and the encapsulation of devices to isolate them from moisture and UV light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results will be reported elsewhere in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Device stability under continuous working condition.Stability plots of (a) PCE, (b) Voc, (c) Jsc and (d) FF as a function of time (left axis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized values are also included for better comparisons (right axis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The device stability was measured under continuous AM1.5G solar illumination in ambient environment without encapsulation.Full size image', 'We also explore the manufacturing of large-area perovskite solar cells by MASP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large-area device is fabricated with the architecture of FTO/compact-TiO2/perovskite/PTAA/Ag and the active-layer area of 1.00±0.02 cm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A showdow mask with the aperture area of 0.980 cm2 is used to measure the JV curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest PCE of 18.02% in a backward scanning was obtained (Supplementary Fig 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hysteresis phenomenon was obvious compared to the standard-area devices (that is, photoactive area=0.10 cm2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is notable that the MASP process is more complicated for depositing large-area perovskite films, as the crystallization rate tends to change and become unstable at the late printing stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such instability is likely to be caued by the change of the mensicus shape during the MASP process as the perovskite ink is consumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the MASP apparatus will need to be modified to enable a continuous supply of perovksite ink for maintaining the meniscus shape for large-area printing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the deposition of uniform electron-transport layer and hole-trasnport layer by MASP over large areas is also important in further improving the device efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we develop a robust and convenient MASP strategy to effectively deposit large-grained dense FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite films with enhanced optoelectronic properties for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Central to this strategy is the solvent evaporation-triggered outward convective flow that transported the perovskite solutes to the edge of the meniscus, promoting the formation of solution-printed micrometre-scale perovskite grains with preferred crystal orientations at low temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insight into the crystal growth kinetics of FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite is revealed through the real-time optical microscopy study, from which a two-stage, namely, quadratical followed by linear growth of perovskite crystallization is identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High photovoltaic PCEs approaching 20% are achieved in planar FA0.85MA0.15PbI2.55Br0.45 perovskite solar cells, which can be ascribed to low trap-state density and long carrier lifetimes in large-grained perovskite films crafted by MASP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films are closely related to film quality, the ability of the MASP strategy to yield dense and uniform films may open up new avenues for low-cost production of large-area flexible solution-printed perovskite-based materials and devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
