Membrane cholesterol access into a G-protein-coupled receptor  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cholesterol is a key component of cell membranes with a proven modulatory role on the function and ligand-binding properties of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal structures of prototypical GPCRs such as the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) have confirmed that cholesterol finds stable binding sites at the receptor surface suggesting an allosteric role of this lipid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we combine experimental and computational approaches to show that cholesterol can spontaneously enter the A2AR-binding pocket from the membrane milieu using the same portal gate previously suggested for opsin ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirm the presence of cholesterol inside the receptor by chemical modification of the A2AR interior in a biotinylation assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we show that cholesterols impact on A2AR-binding affinity goes beyond pure allosteric modulation and unveils a new interaction mode between cholesterol and the A2AR that could potentially apply to other GPCRs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are complex signalling machines that are embedded in the cell membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are able to respond to extracellular signalling stimulus by triggering diverse intracellular pathways of high relevance for human biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite tremendous advances in characterizing GPCR structure and activation mechanisms, relatively little is known about the role of the membrane environment or of specific membrane lipid composition in receptor function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent work shows that membrane phospholipids can allosterically modulate the activity1 and oligomerization2 of GPCRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, membrane cholesterol significantly modulates the stability, ligand-binding properties and function of several GPCRs (reviewed in refs 3, 4, 5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the presence of cholesterol in cell membranes can either enhance7,8,9,10,11 (that is, positively modulate) or decrease12,13,14,15 (that is, negative modulation) ligand binding and/or functional properties of different GPCRs (see Supplementary Table 1 for a comprehensive summary).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A well-known example of this modulation is observed in rod outer segments for the prototypical receptor rhodopsin, where higher cholesterol concentrations in newly formed basal disks are used by these cells to stabilize the structure of metarhodopsin I (MI), thus hampering the formation of the active intermediate metarhodopsin II (MII)16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whether this modulation is exerted through indirect effects20,21 (that is, changes in membrane properties), direct interactions22,23,24,25 between cholesterol and GPCRs, or both, has for long been a matter of intense debate (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6 for a recent review on this topic).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific cholesterol-binding sites have been identified at the surface of different GPCRs26, suggesting a potential allosteric role of cholesterol in modulating GPCR function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, other studies postulate that closely related cholesterol derivatives can even modulate the function of certain class-A GPCRs from the orthosteric binding pocket thus acting like conventional class-A GPCR ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, oxysterol is thought to follow this binding mode at the EpsteinBarr virus-induced G-protein coupled receptor 2 (GPR183)27 or the chemokine receptor CXCR2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, oxysterol derivatives are known allosteric modulators of the oncoprotein Smoothened29 (SMO), a class F GPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A very recent crystal structure of SMO shows one cholesterol molecule in the binding site of the extracellular domain of this receptor30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The adenosine A2AR receptor (A2AR) is a class-A GPCR that plays a major role in the heart and brain by regulating oxygen consumption and blood flow31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, in the central nervous system (CNS)32, the A2AR constitutes a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer and Parkinsons disease33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cholesterol binding to the A2AR at allosteric sites has been previously demonstrated by a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure (PDB ID 3EML)24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computational work has further quantified allosteric cholesterol binding to the receptor surface35,36 and suggested a stabilizing effect on the apo-form of the A2AR35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the ability of cholesterol to impact ligand-binding properties at the A2AR remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For this purpose, in the present study we analysed the influence of cholesterol depletion on ligand binding and studied the dynamics of cholesterolA2AR interaction by extensive long-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulation data reveals an unexpected mechanism of cholesterol action on ligand binding consisting on the entry of a cholesterol molecule into the receptor transmembrane bundle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different lipophilic ligands that bind to the orthosteric site of class A GPCRs are suggested to access the protein from the membrane milieu (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in recent crystal structures of rhodopsin37,38, a molecule of a commonly used detergent (that is, n-octyl -D-glucopyranoside) replaced retinal from the ligand-binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, as recently discussed by Gimpl6, it would seem plausible that cholesterol can access the interior of class A GPCRs like the A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate this mechanism of action, we used a specifically tailored experimental approach to assess cholesterol impact on chemical modification of the A2AR interior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our combined long-scale MD simulation and experimental results show that cholesterol can compete with orthosteric ligands by entering the receptor interior from the membrane side.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Effect of cholesterol depletion on A2AR ligand binding', 'To investigate the effect of membrane cholesterol on A2AR-binding properties, we removed cholesterol from the membrane and monitored the specific binding of the radioligand 3HZM241385 (Fig 1), a selective antagonist of this receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We depleted membrane cholesterol by treating C6 glioma cells with methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD), a specific cholesterol-sequestering agent, for time lengths between 0 and 50 min (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that MCD is able to deplete around 7080% of membrane cholesterol after 30 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accurately assess the level of cholesterol depletion, we carried out targeted lipidomics in plasma membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, 40 min treatment with 5 mM MCD according to the described protocol in the method section depletes up to 61% of cholesterol from the membrane (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, further radioligand binding assays using the former membrane preparations (Supplementary Fig 2) confirm the effect we describe in Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 3 using intact cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: A2AR-specific binding and

treatments affected cell viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here it is worth to highlight that cells remain viable despite the depletion of more than 60% of their membrane cholesterol using the MCD treatment detailed in the Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, protein content did not significantly change after 20, 40 and 60 min incubation with either MCD or WSC (Supplementary Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, cells did not display any significant change in number (Supplementary Fig 5a), morphology (Supplementary Fig 5b and Supplementary Movie 1), or division processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Remarkably, the lack of cholesterol increases the specific binding of 3HZM241385 to the A2AR by more than 100% (30 min) when compared to non-treated cells (0 min) (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer incubation times with MCD (that is, 240 min) did not result in higher levels of A2AR specific binding (469.7±13.7 fmol per mg protein, n=2), likely due to a compensatory mechanism to maintain cholesterol homeostasis in treated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saturation binding experiments using a wide range of radioligand concentrations confirm this inhibitory effect (see Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the reversibility of this effect, we replenished membranes with cholesterol using water-soluble cholesterol (WSC) (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Effect of MCD

intact cells and plasma membrane fractions by filipin fluorescence staining (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7) and targeted lipidomic analysis (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, addition of cholesterol significantly decreases 3HZM241385 binding in cell membranes either untreated (Fig 3, columns 1, 3 and 4) or previously depleted from cholesterol using MCD (Fig 3, columns 2, 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clearly suggests that cholesterol has an inhibitory effect on 3HZM241385 binding to the A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was confirmed in membranes from control cells by competitive binding experiments in the presence of increasing WSC concentrations (see Fig 4 and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rule out that the former effect is the result of a higher number of A2ARs available due to an inhibition of receptor internalization by MCD, we performed new binding assays in the presence of different inhibitors of endocytosis (see details in Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 8, inhibiting endocytosis does not significantly modulate A2AR specific binding, hence demonstrating that receptor internalization is not involved in the cholesterol-mediated modulation of A2AR-specific binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While cholesteryl hemisuccinate, a cholesterol derivative, enhances the stability and activity of detergent-solubilized A2ARs39, our data clearly shows that naturally occurring cholesterol has an inhibitory effect on 3HZM241385 binding to the A2AR in more physiological environments (that is, intact cells and cell membrane preparations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings go along with previous experimental evidence in several class A GPCRs reporting a negative cholesterol-mediated modulation of

samples analysed in duplicate.Full size image', 'All-atom MD simulations of cholesterol interaction sites', 'To shed light on the structural basis of the observed cholesterol modulation, we carried out a complete set of atomistic MD simulations of the A2AR (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described in the Methods section, we used a comprehensive set of lipids of different chains, nature and length to model a native-like lipid bilayer rich in cholesterol (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structure of the A2AR40 was embedded in the former membrane and the system was solvated, neutralized, adjusted to an ionic strength of 150 mM Na+Cl and equilibrated following standard protocols (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we simulated a set of 4 × 1 s replicas to study the frequency and stability of the interaction between cholesterol and the A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of the accumulated 4 s shows that in average 12 cholesterol molecules are in contact (below 2.9 Å) with the A2AR throughout the simulation (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is in agreement with the number of cholesterol molecules required for an ideal conformational stability of the A2AR experimentally observed in cholesterol-rich micelles39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While our simulations show several transient cholesterolA2AR interactions (light grey bars, Fig 5 right), certain cholesterol molecules establish permanent binding interactions to the receptor over nearly 100% of the simulation time (dark grey bars, Fig 5 right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To spot preferred cholesterol interaction sites at the A2AR surface, we used a 3D volumetric map to depict the density of cholesterol molecules in the simulation (Fig 5 left and Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with Lee et al.36 our data show that transmembrane helices 2 and 3 (TM23), TM3-4-5 and TM7-1 are preferred interaction areas of cholesterol at the A2AR surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, one of the predicted interaction sites, namely TM23, overlaps with one of the cholesterol binding sites shown in the experimental high-resolution structure of A2AR in complex with ZM241385 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24; Fig 5 left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36, cholesterol does not seem to significantly occupy the upper TM56 region, where another binding site was observed in the crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Cholesterol volumetric maps and contact frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Volumetric maps of cholesterol density

stable or transient when the normalized contact frequency is above (dark grey bars) or below (light grey bars) 95%, respectively.Full size image', 'Cholesterol accesses the A2AR interior in MD simulations', 'Strikingly, the volumetric analysis also shows high cholesterol density inside the transmembrane bundle of the A2AR (Fig 5, left) indicating that cholesterol entered the A2AR from the membrane milieu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A visual inspection of the individual trajectories shows that one cholesterol molecule spontaneously accesses the interior of the protein from the extracellular leaflet through helices TM56 occupying a key area of the orthosteric binding pocket (see replica 1 in Fig 5 and Supplementary Movies 2 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although cholesterol has been shown to occupy deeply buried sites in other membrane proteins41, this is the first dynamic view of membrane cholesterol spontaneously invading the orthosteric binding pocket of a GPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To exclude simulation artefacts and better explore the cholesterol entry pathway, we performed new simulations and studied the tendency of cholesterol to access the A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we selected four representative snapshots from the original cholesterol entrance trajectory (that is, replica 1) prior to the complete invasion of the receptor (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, each starting point was used to re-spawn 10 new trajectories of 100 ns each (that is, 10 × 4 × 100).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify cholesterol progression towards the interior of the protein, we monitored the distance between cholesterol and residue E1.39 (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most of these short trajectories, cholesterol does not back away from the receptor but it stays bound or progresses towards the interior of the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 6 and Supplementary Table 4, cholesterol progression is much faster once cholesterol slightly tilts down (Fig 6a,b) adopting a favored position to enter the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inclusion of intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) do not have a significant effect (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data clearly suggest that cholesterol can spontaneously access the A2AR through a portal gate between TM5 and 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Short simulation replicas of cholesterol entrance.Boxplots display the distance between the centre of mass of cholesterol and residue E1.39 for a set of 40 replicate simulations of 100 ns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four different starting positions (ad) re-spawned from the original cholesterol entrance trajectory were used to run each 10 replicates (that is, 110, 1120, 2130, 3140).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance at the beginning of the simulation as measured from the snapshot used to re-spawn each set of 10 trajectories (that is, ad) is represented as one single red horizontal line in each of the graphs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average distance for each set of replicates

clarity.Full size image', 'The nature of the membrane environment could be one of the driving forces behind the spontaneous cholesterol entrance into the A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Movie 3, an unsaturated phospholipid (in yellow) along with a cluster of four cholesterol molecules seem to influence cholesterol entrance by preventing it from diffusing back to the membrane bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the impact of membrane composition, we substituted the compact membrane environment used so far by a pure 1-palmitoyl-2-oleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayer (see Methods) leaving intact both the target cholesterol and the A2AR (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in the absence of a more compact and thicker membrane (Supplementary Fig 12), cholesterol progression towards the interior of the protein is significantly diminished after 100 ns (see Supplementary Fig 13 and Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our simulations suggest that the ability of cholesterol to access the interior of the A2AR can be modulated by the nature of the membrane environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The sequence of events during cholesterol entrance is depicted in Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, cholesterol is interacting with other membrane lipids (not shown) and water molecules (Fig 7a) until it leaves this preferred position plunging its polar head into the hydrophobic core of the membrane (Fig 7a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, cholesterol descends along TM56 guided by the formation of a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Y5.411 side chain (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, TM5 and TM6 are tightly packed involving an aromatic cluster of staggered residues F5.45, F4.44, H6.52 and W6.48 (red arrows, Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, cholesterol tilts 90° and pushes aside the aromatic side chains of residues F5.45 and F5.44 (Fig 7c,d) attracted by water molecules and residue E169 at the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) (Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This creates a protein gateway between TM5 and TM6 that cholesterol uses to make its way into the A2AR to interact with E169 both directly and indirectly through contact with water molecules (dashed red lines in Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, cholesterol completely enters the receptor attracted by E1.39 at TM1 (Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this stage, the polar head engages into a hydrogen bonding network formed by Y7.36, E1.39 and water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the entrance of cholesterol, the communication between protein residues in the aromatic network is partially disrupted (F5.45F4.44 and F4.44H6.52, see red crosses in Fig 7c,d), thus likely hampering the reverse progression of cholesterol towards the membrane bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cholesterol intercalation between helices TM5 and 6 does not involve marked protein rearrangements (Supplementary Movies 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Cholesterol

better characterize the behaviour of cholesterol inside the receptor, we extended three of the original 100 ns replicas (namely replicas 1, 35 and 38 in Fig 6) up to 10 s (3 × 10 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once inside the receptor, cholesterol molecules explore the interior of the protein by establishing transient interactions rather than adopting a stable binding pose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our simulations show that cholesterol highly populates a specific area of the A2AR binding pocket (yellow surface, Fig 8a and Supplementary Movie 4) that highly overlaps with the classical orthosteric binding site and the position of the ZM241385 ligand bound to the A2AR crystal structure (PDB:3EML) (red sticks, Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, our data indicate that, if cholesterol reaches the interior of the protein, it will likely hamper the binding of A2AR ligands such as ZM241385 to the orthosteric binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding represents one plausible mechanism behind

experimental evidence pointing towards cholesterol ability to occupy the interior of this receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, in an attempt to provide experimental evidence supporting our computational findings, we adapted a biochemical assay originally used in GPCRs by Javitch et al.42 for scanning residues exposed to the binding-site crevice in the dopamine D2 receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assay takes advantage of the fact that thiol groups of cysteine residues facing the binding-site crevice of a GPCR will selectively react with hydrophilic and sulfhydryl-specific reagents such as derivatives of methanethiosulfonate (MTS) (detailed in Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown by the A2AR crystal structure (PDB: 3EML)24 (see Supplementary Fig 14 and Supplementary Table 5), water-accessible cysteine residues with a free sulfhydryl group are only found in the interior of the receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, we chemically modified by biotinylation these water-exposed cysteines using N-biotinylaminoethylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSEA-B), a positively charged MTS derivative similar in size and molecular weight to the ZM241385 ligand

entry/exit pathways', 'Our data strongly suggest that a cholesterol molecule can penetrate the A2AR from the membrane side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, membrane access of molecules to class-A GPCRs has been reported for few other cases such as the lipid receptor S1P1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43), the cannabinoid CB2 receptor44 and the opsin receptor45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, retinal uptake into the opsin receptor is probably the best-studied case where two potential gateways for ligand uptake or release have been described45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger opening (gateway 1) between helices 5

However, due to the large hydrophobic moiety of the cholesterol molecule, it is not likely that cholesterol abandoning the A2AR-binding pocket via the extracellular aqueous phase is energetically favoured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the energetic cost of such exit route, we carried out a set of biased simulations (see Methods) where we computed the free energy profile (PMF) of extracting cholesterol from the binding site into the extracellular water phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These simulations confirm that the energetic cost of a complete cholesterol exit from its observed binding site to the water phase is as high as 120 kJ·mol1 (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is more likely that cholesterol leaves the A2AR via the transmembrane helices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the present work, we have studied the effect of membrane cholesterol on the ligand-binding properties of the A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro experiments demonstrate that cholesterol significantly decreases the binding of the antagonist 3HZM241385 to the A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular insights obtained in this and other studies point to numerous allosteric binding sites at the A2AR surface that could potentially be involved in reducing ZM241385 binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our work reveals an additional and unexpected mode of cholesterol action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have observed that cholesterol modulates orthosteric ligand binding at the A2AR after entering from the membrane side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results have been validated combining both computational and specifically tailored experimental approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study suggests that the gateway that cholesterol uses to enter the A2AR is evolutionarily conserved and identical to the retinal gateway present in the opsin receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since molecules of a similar size and amphipathic nature have been shown to access the retinal-binding pocket37, it is reasonable to speculate that the negative modulation exerted by cholesterol on rhodopsin function16,17,18,19 could be partly mediated by the new mechanism proposed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken all together, cholesterol is likely to modulate A2AR ligand-binding properties through a mixed mode of action, namely both orthosteric- and allosterically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, further research shall be aimed to unveil the exact contribution of each mode of cholesterol-mediated modulation at this or other GPCRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All in all, our results provide an important advance in the understanding of the interplay between cholesterol and the A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, our work highlights the importance of considering the influence of different levels of membrane cholesterol in GPCR function and stresses the importance of accounting for these particular cholesterol effects in the study of cardiovascular and CNS disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a broader perspective, our work opens the door to new studies on the effects of cholesterol and other endogenous lipids in GPCRs modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This knowledge paves new roads for exploring potential therapeutic uses of membrane sterols or sterol-mimetic molecules in GPCR drug discovery.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

The reaction coordinate was monitored every 10 fs within each window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last frame of the 200 ns simulation of the previous window was used as the starting configuration of the next one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this protocol cannot be used to simulate all windows in parallel, it drastically improves the equilibration time for each window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first window corresponds to the cholesterol deeply buried in the ligand cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the last windows, cholesterol moves freely in the water solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the g_wham tool distributed with gromacs v5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  73) to compute the PMF (Supplementary Fig 16) disregarding the first 50 ns of each trajectory to avoid sampling potential non-equilibrium configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autocorrelation time of the data was used to minimize correlation effects and to select the appropriated gathering frequency in the PMF curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bootstrapping of 1,000 samples was used to estimate the standard deviation of the PMF results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tunnel pathway calculations', 'Tunnel pathways were computed using the Caver software49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The starting point coordinates were set to centre of the binding pocket of opsin and A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computations were carried out using a shell radius 3 Å, shell depth 4 Å, a probe radius of 1.1 Å for the opsin receptor and 1.4 Å for the A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Obtained results were plotted using the VMD software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The authors declare that all data necessary to support the findings of this study are available within the paper and its Supplementary Information Files.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional data that were omitted from the paper are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal structure coordinates from the Protein Data Bank (3EML, 3PWH, 4EIY) were used in this study.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
