Human serum-derived protein removes the need for coating in defined human pluripotent stem cell culture  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reliable, scalable and time-efficient culture methods are required to fully realize the clinical and industrial applications of human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a completely defined, xeno-free medium that supports long-term propagation of hPS cells on uncoated tissue culture plastic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The medium consists of the Essential 8 (E8) formulation supplemented with inter--inhibitor (II), a human serum-derived protein, recently demonstrated to activate key pluripotency pathways in mouse PS cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  II efficiently induces attachment and long-term growth of both embryonic and induced hPS cell lines when added as a soluble protein to the medium at seeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  II supplementation efficiently supports adaptation of feeder-dependent hPS cells to xeno-free conditions, clonal growth as well as single-cell survival in the absence of Rho-associated kinase inhibitor (ROCKi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This time-efficient and simplified culture method paves the way for large-scale, high-throughput hPS cell culture, and will be valuable for both basic research and commercial applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells, including human embryonic stem cells (hES cells) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS cells), can self-renew indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into any somatic cell type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They therefore have great potential in various applications including basic developmental research, drug/toxicity screening and cell-based therapeutics1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex matrix requirements of hPS cells, which make up the hPS cell niche, are well documented and traditionally hPS cell expansion has necessitated culture on feeder cells and serum-containing media2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, incompatibility of these complex, ill-defined conditions with pharmacological and medical applications has driven the development of alternative strategies combining defined media with improved surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solutions typically include surface immobilization of cell-binding motifs, such as integrin-binding proteins3,4, short peptides derived from vitronectin (VN), laminin (LN)5,6, glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding peptides6,7 and synthetic polymers8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current novel approaches use high-throughput combinatorial arrays to discover fully synthetic alternatives10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to date, these methods have not been widely implemented, being either too expensive or lacking the required reproducibility, leaving feeder cells or Matrigel11 in widespread use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, many hPS cell lines have also proven resistant to successful adaptation to feeder-free conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are many hPS cell-specific issues that need to be addressed for optimal culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Routine culture usually involves passage in small aggregates or clumps to avoid a loss of viability associated with dissociation (anoikis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of ROCKi (Y-27632) to the hPS cell medium increases survival after single-cell passaging, but it is costly, particularly at scale12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent years have seen considerable efforts made to simplify and refine medium formulations, and the fully defined E8 medium is an important step forward in this regard5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Containing only eight components, all of them produced recombinantly, E8 is typically used together with a recombinant VN peptide which is pre-applied to the tissue culture (TC) plastic as a coating for optimal cell attachment and survival (the one used in this study is Vitronectin-XF (VN-XF), distributed by Primorigen and StemCell Technologies).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of E8 and VN-XF has the benefits of being xeno-free and defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as shown in the present study, this method does not robustly support cloning and single-cell passaging unless cells are pre-treated for several hours with ROCKi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large-scale and automated systems of the future will require affordable reagents available in large quantities, and simplified methodologies that can support efficient and reliable single-cell passaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The II protein family members are present at high concentrations (0.61.2 mg ml1) in human serum13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inter--inhibitor (II), which is the most common family member, consists of two heavy chains (HC1 and HC2) and a bikunin (Bk) domain linked together by chondroitin sulphate13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The II complex has been associated to inflammation processes, hepatitis, cancer and even kidney diseases15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Traditionally, II has been described as an extracellular matrix (ECM) component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HCs are the only proteins known to covalently bind the ECM GAG hyaluronan (HA), while Bk when released from the HCs acts as a serine protease inhibitor14,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent reports demonstrate that the HC domains can additionally induce cell signalling20,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we recently showed that II (specifically its HC2 domain) activates the Yes/Yes-associated protein (YAP)/TEAD transcription factor pathway and induces expression of Oct4 and Nanog in mouse ES (mES) cells24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study we demonstrate, for the first time, that II and its HC2 domain promote attachment and survival of hPS cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we describe a new, simplified and time-efficient cell culture method based on the E8 medium supplemented with soluble II (herein called E8:II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method requires no surface coating and supports long-term propagation of hPS cells, clonal expansion and single-cell passaging even in the absence of ROCKi.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'II and its HC2 domain induce hPS cell attachment', 'To study whether II could support stem cell attachment, K2C hiPS cells were seeded onto standard TC-treated plastic in E8 medium supplemented with 50 g ml1 II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purity of the isolated II protein solution was thoroughly validated through silver staining and mass spectrometry analysis (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell attachment was assessed 4 h after seeding using crystal violet staining, and VN-XF coated plates (E8:VN) were used as positive control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1a shows how II supplementation induces similar cell attachment levels as VN-XF coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The separate Bk and HC1 II domains were unable to support attachment when added in solution to the medium (Supplementary Fig 2; Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when HC2 (but not HC1) was pre-coated onto standard TC-treated plastic, similar attachment levels, as with II supplementation, were achieved 4 h after seeding (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells seeded in II or on HC2-coated plates exhibited similar colony morphology and cellcell contacts (defined by E-cadherin arrangement) as cells seeded on VN-XF (Fig 1b; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the role of the different II domains in the hPS cell attachment we added antibodies against each of the three II domains at the seeding step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the use of the separate II domains showed HC2 to be responsible for the hPS cell attachment, all three antibodies inhibited II-induced attachment regardless of which domain was being targeted, suggesting that antibody binding hinders II-mediated attachment when used in solution (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: II and II domain HC2 can support attachment and survival of hPS cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Quantification of cell attachment by crystal violet staining 4 h after seeding of hiPS cell line K2C added to plates with 10 g ml1 VN-XF coating, 50 g ml1 II medium supplementation, 50 g ml1 HC1 coating or 50 g ml1 HC2 coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Immunofluorescence of hES cell line HUES1 on VN-XF coating or II supplement showing E-cadherin (left panel) and Oct4 (right panel), scale bar shows 100 m.

cell-number quantification experiments were performed in triplicate over three separate experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bars show mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and statistical analysis over the three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analysis indicates significant differences with *P0.05, **P0.001 and ***P0.001 determined by One-way ANOVA and Dunnetts post-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific comparisons were done with paired t-test and are shown by a connective line between the two sets of samples.Full size image', 'Serum albumin inhibits II-mediated attachment', 'When an alternative stem cell culture medium, mTeSR1 (which contains a high concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1% w/w) and -Mercaptoethanol, was used as basal medium for II, significantly lower cell attachment was achieved as compared with using E8 medium (determined by paired t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hypothesized that BSA may bind and sequester II, reducing its effective concentration in the medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, II-mediated attachment of the hES cell line HUES1 and the hiPS cell line K2C was measured in E8 medium, E8 medium supplemented with 5% w/v BSA or mTeSR1 medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of BSA to the E8 medium significantly reduced II-mediated attachment (determined by paired t-test) to similar levels as those observed when using mTeSR1 (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Albumin is commonly used to block non-specific binding to plastic or other surfaces because of its rapid and wide-ranging binding capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that the inhibition of II-mediated attachment observed in the presence of albumin was not due to a competition for surface coating, we pre-coated the surface with 50 g ml1 II for 1 h at room temperature (RT) before seeding hPS cells in either E8 medium or mTeSR1 medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, the attachment was lower in mTeSR1 as compared with the E8 medium, further confirming that albumin can indeed reduce the ability of II to promote cell attachment, possibly by binding to it directly and thereby blocking its effect (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integrins are involved in II-mediated attachment', 'The HCs contain a von Willebrand type A (vWA) domain, which has been reported to bind proteins such as VN via RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) motifs25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess if the observed effect of II supplementation was mediated by integrin engagement of RGD-motifs, a panel of RGD-blocking peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit II-mediated attachment (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear RGD peptide H1830 did not have an effect, but the cyclic RGD-based, v3- and v5-blocking peptides (c(RGDfV), H-2574 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26)) and (c(RGDfC), H-7226 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27)) significantly reduced attachment as compared with their controls c(RADfV) and c(RADfC) (H-4088 and H-7232, respectively) (determined by paired t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These peptides block attachment to VN and LN, which have been shown to support hPS cell attachment and survival4,5,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GRGDsP (H-3164)-blocking peptide, which reduces attachment to fibronectin but does not interfere with VN-mediated binding, did not reduce II-induced attachment (all peptides were from Bachem and are described in Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To confirm the results obtained with the RGD-blocking peptides, we used blocking antibodies against VN and LN-binding integrins together with the E8:II method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibodies were added at the seeding step and cell survival and growth was assessed after 4 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blocking the v and 1 integrin domains and the v5 integrin drastically affected attachment, while the v3-blocking antibody reduced the attachment to a lesser extent (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1 integrin domain has been shown to be the main integrin domain responsible for hPS cell binding to LN3,4, while v has been described as VN binding in hPS cells when present in v1, v3 and v5 complexes28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results point towards the involvement of multiple integrin subunits in II-mediated attachment, in contrast to the limited number of subunits involved in binding to simple ECM-derived fragment coatings3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HA is involved in II-mediated attachment', 'HA is a non-sulphated GAG found in many matrices throughout the body where it affects multiple functions including cell migration and proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HA hydrogels have also proven useful for hPS cell culture and delivery29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HCs of II are the only proteins yet described to bind covalently to HA, and we therefore investigated if HA was involved in the II-mediated attachment of hPS cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD44 is a common HA-receptor and has been linked to cancer cell attachment and transformation following HA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed no inhibition of II-induced attachment in the presence of a CD44-blocking antibody (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The involvement of GAGs in II-mediated attachment was further studied using a chemical inhibitor of GAG synthesis, 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU)30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hES cell line HUES1 was treated with 0.6 mM of 4-MU for 24 h before passaging and seeded onto VN-coated plates or E8:II, with 0.6 mM 4-MU supplementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 4, 4-MU treatment significantly reduced II-mediated attachment to 75% of the control samples, and this reduction was not observed for VN-mediated attachment (determined by one-way ANOVA analysis and Dunnetts post-test against negative control E8:VN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst it is noted that a reduction in GAG synthesis may impact multiple aspects of cell behaviour, attachment of 4-MU-treated cells could be fully recovered by adding exogenous high molecular weight HA (HMW-HA, 2,0002,400 KDa) therefore suggesting that HA may be involved in E8:II-mediated attachment, however via a non-CD44-related mechanism (determined by one-way ANOVA analysis and Dunnetts post-test against negative control E8:VN, and paired t-test against 4-MU-treated E8:II sample).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Live monitoring of the hES cell line HUES1 shows how II induces cell attachment and spreading over a similar timeframe and in a similar manner as the VN-XF coating (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, II appears to exert a direct effect on cell attachment, similar to VN-XF coating, with attachment and spreading as concurrent events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The above data therefore point towards a complex attachment process, likely to involve several membrane receptors and extracellular ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'II efficiently supports single-cell passaging of hPS cells', 'To further evaluate II-induced hPS cell attachment and growth; HUES1 and K2C hPS cells were dissociated into small aggregates using a gentle enzyme-free reagent (Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (GCDR, Stem Cell Technologies)), or into single cells using TrypLE (a recombinant cell-dissociation enzyme, ThermoFisher) with ROCKi supplementation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were then seeded using E8:VN or E8 with different II concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 g ml1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 4, cell density was assessed using crystal violet staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 5, 40100 g ml1 of II was able to support attachment, characteristic colony morphology and positive alkaline phosphatase staining; 50 g ml1 II was therefore selected for all subsequent experiments (and is denoted as E8:II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was also confirmed that II addition is only required during seeding and the initial attachment process, and is not required in subsequent medium exchanges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: II attachment is concentration dependent.Doseresponse curve of hPS cell lines HUES1 and K2C seeded as (a) small clumps (GCDR) or (b) single cells with ROCKi (TrypLE+10 M ROCKi after seeding, no ROCKi pre-treatment) using increasing concentrations of II in E8 medium, compared with VN-XF

sub-culturing in small aggregates, 50 g ml1 of II supplementation at the seeding step supported similar viability as VN-XF coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when performing single-cell splitting, almost no cells had survived after 4 days on VN-XF coating even with the addition of 10 M ROCKi to the culture during the first 24 h after seeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, under these conditions, II supplementation supported very high cell survival, with cells reaching a monolayer after 4 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis showed that II was also able to support survival and colony formation of dissociated single cells in the absence of ROCKi, although the survival rate was lower than with ROCKi (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live monitoring of hES cells (HUES1) cultured in the absence of ROCKi showed that although the cells initially attach and spread as single cells on VN-XF coating, they eventually lift off the plate and die, while HUES1 cells seeded in the presence of II exhibit decreased motility after seeding but stronger cell-to-cell contact formation, and grow as adherent colonies until they are ready to be passaged (Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

VN-XF coating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 1-h pre-treatment with ROCKi is usually recommended for single-cell splitting of hPS cells to increase cell survival12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in our hands, 1-h pre-treatment resulted in inconclusive results when using the E8:VN method, even at high seeding densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prevent this, the ROCKi pre-treatment step was increased to 5 h. This longer pre-treatment improved the survival in E8:VN, but not to the level seen with E8:II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, as shown in Supplementary Fig 6a, there was a consistent higher cell density after 4 days in E8:II cultures when compared with VN-XF coating, from very low cell-seeding densities (25 cells per cm2) up to typical seeding densities (103 cells per cm2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'II protects from residual protease remaining after passage', 'II has been reported to act as protease inhibitor through its bikunin domain32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E8 is a low-protein medium and therefore, small traces of protease remaining in the culture medium after splitting could result in cell damage and subsequent death due to the lack of protease inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TrypLE is a recombinant protease that has been reported to be more gentle on the cell surface, and is therefore recommended for stem cell culture33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate if the reduced cell survival observed using VN coating together with single-cell splitting is caused by remaining traces of TrypLE in the medium, we used a 5-h ROCKi pre-treatment followed by TrypLE passaging with a dilution and centrifugation step to remove all TrypLE remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were then seeded with and without the addition of 1% (V/V) of TrypLE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 6b shows that while E8:II could support 100% survival of hES cell line HUES1 in 1% TrypLE, VN coating was unable to support cell survival in 1% TrypLE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that II is able to partially protect against residual TrypLE in the medium after passaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'VN in solution does not support single-cell seeding', 'According to the manufacturers recommendations, the VN peptide should be used as a coating agent in combination with E8 medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether VN could be added in solution, similar to II, cells were pre-treated with ROCKi for 5 h and single cells were then seeded on either VN-coated plates or on uncoated plates in E8 medium supplemented with 10 g ml1 VN or 50 g ml1 II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 6c, VN added in solution could not support attachment and survival to the same extent as II added in solution or coated VN, demonstrating that II-induced cell attachment is not only a result of rapid coating of the tissue culture plastic and that VN is only able to support attachment when used as a coating agent (Supplementary Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'II increases clonal survival of hPS cells', 'Live imaging of NCL1 hES cells seeded in E8:II with ROCKi after single-cell splitting revealed a colony forming from one single cell, suggesting that II can support clonal growth (Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assessed the cloning success rate for six different hPS cell lines (K2C, HUES1, H207, H181, NCL1 and K8F) cultured in E8:II or E8:VN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High cloning rates of up to 18% were achieved with E8:II, and the cloning efficiency was consistently higher using the E8:II protocol as compared with E8:VN protocol in all five hPS cell lines tested, despite using a 5 h pre-treatment with ROCKi (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 II increases cloning efficiency of hPS cells.Full size table', 'Easy adaptation of hPS cell lines to E8:II', 'To ensure that the E8:II protocol can

different laboratories, were adapted to E8:II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All hPS cell lines exhibited normal morphology in E8:II medium (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E8:II protocol showed better adaptation efficiency of the hES cell line OXF2 from feeder-cell culture as compared with E8:VN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through a simple step-wise adaptation protocol, combining E8:II and single-cell

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The last few years have seen a marked refinement of hPS cell culture methods, enabling the use of better defined culture conditions as well as simplified handling protocols, essential for the widespread use of hPS cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The potential of hPS cells as renewable cell sources for drug toxicity screening, human cell therapy and regenerative medicine has rendered traditional cell culture methods, based on ill-defined components, unsuitable39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, several defined surfaces have been developed to improve hPS cell derivation and expansion40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, none of the currently available methods fulfil all requirements for simple, robust, cost-efficient and safe production of hPS cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of E8 medium with VN-XF5 coating is both defined and animal-component free, and has been proven to successfully support long-term culture of hPS cells when passaged as small clumps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this method requires a surface pre-coating step and, as shown in the present work, is inefficient when hPS cells are passaged as single cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this paper we present II as a protein able to induce attachment of hPS cells onto plastic without the need for a pre-coating step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first time that II has been reported to induce attachment in in vitro culture, particularly remarkable considering the extensive and numerous efforts to identify substrates for hPS cell culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this study we discovered that high concentrations of albumin in culture medium reduce II-induced attachment to 50%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that albumin binds II and reduces its ability to induce cell attachment, both when present as a soluble factor and a pre-coated agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is possibly the reason why this is the first study linking II to cell attachment, as the majority of traditional cell culture media contain high concentrations of albumin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'II is a relatively large protein that consists of three distinct globular domains: Bk, HC1 and HC2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that antibodies targeted against any of the II domains could block II-induced attachment of hPS cells when II was used in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the only domain that could support hPS cell growth on its own was HC2, and only when HC2 was used as a coating agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results concur with our previous report showing that the HC2 domain of II, but not the HC1 domain, can activate pluripotency-related transcription in mES cells24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has also been reported that transfer of the HC domains to HA requires the HC2 domain to be present, as part of the II molecule or as a separate domain (for example, HC2-Bk)20,23, confirming the distinct biological activity of the HCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While HC1 and HC2 share functional domains (a vault protein inter--trypsin (VIT) domain and a vWA domain), outside of these regions there is considerable heterogeneity, and overall, human HC1 and HC2 only share 39% amino acid identity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While little is known about the function of the VIT domain, the vWA domain has been reported to bind many proteins via RGD domains, including VN25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to assess if the II-induced attachment was integrin mediated, we used RGD-blocking peptides as well as integrin-blocking antibodies and found that multiple integrin subunits were likely to be involved in the process, pointing to a more complex interaction than the traditional integrin-binding protein attachment of VN- and LN-based coatings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the HCs of II are the only proteins reported to bind covalently to HA, we also investigated the potential role for HA in II-mediated attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blocking the HA receptor CD44 did not have any effect on II-induced attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, reducing GAG synthesis using an inhibitor decreased II-mediated attachment, indicating that HA may play a role II-mediated attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our results point to II-induced attachment being the result of a synergistic combination of several extracellular molecules and surface receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, II has been reported to interact with several extracellular molecules, including HA20, integrin-binding proteins such as VN25, and the complement system42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, many different processes have been linked to II, including the cumulus formation of the oocyte43, fibrosis and angiogenesis22, tissue repair25, amniotic membrane formation44,45, arthritis46 and others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  II is proving to be a very versatile protein with a wide variety of functions, which most likely depend on the different partners it can interact with in each situation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, further study will be needed to completely unravel the mechanism underpinning II-mediated attachment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study we present the first hPS cell culture protocol that overcomes the need for specialized surface coating or functionalization, while still being defined and animal-component free.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method is highly time efficient, as coating is a time-consuming step in hPS cell culture methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that E8:II improves single-cell passaging and cloning efficiency, without the need for a lengthy ROCKi pre-treatment, and can protect from residual protease, thus making automated handling simpler and enabling cell-number control and high-throughput experimental design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term propagation and characterization of four different hPS cell lines and successful adaptation of a total of eight different hPS cells lines prove that this culture method is reliable and robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we have shown that II can support a directed differentiation protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E8:II can also support freeze-thaw cycles in the same manner as commercially available methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The II used in this study was derived from a side fraction of human plasma used for commercial factor IX production, with purity above 95%, as described previously14,21,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  II has a long shelf-life and can potentially be purified and prepared in large quantities from human plasma at GMP grade and at a reasonable cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future development will also investigate on the possibility of using recombinant II, or parts thereof.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, this simple method offers a reliable and cost-efficient solution to the current need for defined hPS cell culture conditions and has great potential to transform research, pharmacological and clinical application of hPS cells and their derivatives.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

colonies was assayed visually and through MTT assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) tetrazolium was dissolved in E8 medium at a final concentration of 0.5 mg ml1, the solution was filtered and added to the wells from the clonal assay and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 h. After confirming the staining of the existing colonies, the MTT solution was removed and 20% SDS was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plates were incubated O/N and the absorbance was read at 570 and 630 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a measure for viable cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wells with more than one colony were removed from the final result summary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mass spectrometry analysis', 'Two samples of II working solution (purified separately) were mixed with -mercaptoethanol and run through a 12% acrylamide SDSPAGE denaturating gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Band development was done through silver staining as described previously53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were in-gel digested with trypsin according to a standard protocol and analysed by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap MS/MS) at the MS Facility, SciLifeLab, Uppsala University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteins were reduced, alkylated and in-gel digested by trypsin according to a standard operating procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter the samples were dried and resolved in 15 l 0.1% FA (formic acid).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peptides were separated in reversed-phase on a C18-column and electrosprayed on-line to an LTQ Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tandem mass spectrometry was performed applying CID.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The database searches were performed using the Sequest algorithm, embedded in Proteome Discoverer 2.1 (ThermoFisher), against human proteins in the Swissprot database (2015).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The search criteria for protein identification were set to at least two matching peptides of 95% confidence level per protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Live imaging of hPS cell growth', 'Human PS cell lines were seeded onto 6-well plates either as small clumps with GCDR or as single cells with TrypLE and 10 M Y-27632 (no pre-treatment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imaging was performed with the oCelloscope 04C5 (Unisensor), placed inside a standard normoxic incubator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pictures were taken from the seeding point and then every 15 min for up to 4 or 5 days (specified for each video file).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The imaging was performed using the Uniexplorer 3.2.0.3621 CRL3 software (Unisensor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exported avi files were further edited using the VideoPad Video Editor (Freeware).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical analysis', "Experiments were performed in at least three independent experiments and in triplicate for each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data is presented as mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the crystal violet cell analysis data multiple statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post-test, when applicable and stated in the figure legends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paired t-test was used to compare two specific samples within groups, and the result is shown over a line connecting the two samples within the graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Human Stem Cell Pluripotency Taqman Array data was analysed using Two-way ANOVA and Sidaks Multiple comparisons test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism version 5.00d for Mac (GraphPad Software), and the data presented shows *P0.05, **P0.001 and ***P0.001 unless otherwise specified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the copy-number analysis a Wilcoxon rank-sum-test in the statistical software R v3 was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Data availability', 'Data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its Supplementary Information files and from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNP-array genotyping data have been deposited in the NCBI-based Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under the accession code GSE82103.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
