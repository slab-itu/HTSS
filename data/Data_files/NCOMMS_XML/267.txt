ssODN-mediated knock-in with CRISPR-Cas for large genomic regions in zygotes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The CRISPR-Cas system is a powerful tool for generating genetically modified animals; however, targeted knock-in (KI) via homologous recombination remains difficult in zygotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show efficient gene KI in rats by combining CRISPR-Cas with single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a 1-kb ssODN co-injected with guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 messenger RNA produce GFP-KI at the rat Thy1 locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, two gRNAs with two 80-bp ssODNs direct efficient integration of a 5.5-kb CAG-GFP vector into the Rosa26 locus via ssODN-mediated end joining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protocol also achieves KI of a 200-kb BAC containing the human SIRPA locus, concomitantly knocking out the rat Sirpa gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, three gRNAs and two ssODNs replace 58-kb of the rat Cyp2d cluster with a 6.2-kb human CYP2D6 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ssODN-mediated KI protocols can be applied to any target site with any donor vector without the need to construct homology arms, thus simplifying genome engineering in living organisms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genetically modified (GM) animals play an important role in the study of gene functions and for understanding the mechanisms of human diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zinc finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) nucleases are efficient genome engineering tools for generating GM animals via microinjection into fertilized eggs1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injected nucleases recognize long stretches of DNA sequence and introduce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are generally repaired via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), a process that introduces small insertions or deletions (indels) at the repair junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process allows efficient generation of animals with knockout (KO) alleles at targeted sequences7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeted knock-in (KI) can be also engineered via homologous recombination (HR) by co-injection of donor plasmids, including large DNA fragments such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassettes, with any of the above mentioned nucleases10,11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was traditionally achieved by constructing targeting vectors with two homology arms of 0.51 kb on either side of the insert DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, HR-mediated KI is less efficient than NHEJ-mediated KO, because the canonical HR pathway for DSB repair in mammalian cells or embryos is less effective than the NHEJ pathway16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (ssODNs) have been used as donor templates in combination with the engineered nucleases for efficient targeted insertion of small DNA fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ssODN-mediated KI in mammalian cells occurs via homology-directed repair (HDR) and is more efficient than using double-stranded donor plasmids18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, targeted KI with ssODN donors and engineered nucleases has been reported to be highly efficient22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also shown the efficient generation of ssODN-mediated KI in rats by recovering three recessive coat-colour phenotypes26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, ssODNs in combination with methodical CRISPR-Cas fine tuning are employed to KI and replace large genomic regions of the rat genome with human genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first append polyadenine tails (poly(A)) to plasmids expressing Cas9 mRNA, to increase the efficacy of genome editing with the CRISPR-CasCRISPR-Cas system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using Cas9-poly(A), we employ two approaches to conduct targeted KI with relatively long DNA fragments, such as the GFP sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first use long ssODNs (lsODNs) as a targeting donor, which are newly synthesized by a method using nicking endonucleases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second involve co-injection of two guide RNAs (gRNAs) to act as scissors, to cut target sites in genomic DNA and the donor plasmid DNA, and two short ssODNs to act as paste, to ligate the ends of the cut sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method enable efficient KI of plasmid DNAs including a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) of 200 kb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significant technical advantage of this ssODN-mediated end joining approach is its simplicity, as there is no need to construct homology arms in the donor vector, which is especially difficult to perform in larger BACs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

vitro-transcribed Cas9 mRNA (100 ng l1) into rat male pronuclei of fertilized eggs (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three hours after injection, eggs treated with Cas9-GFP-poly(A) (n=23) showed significantly higher fluorescence intensity compared with eggs injected with Cas9-GFP without poly(A) (n=20) (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher expression in the Cas9-GFP-poly(A)-injected eggs persisted at the two-cell stage 24 h after injection (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, eggs injected with Cas9-GFP-poly(A) did not show any significant abnormal features or delayed development compared with

'Plasmids consisting of homology arms, the targeting cassette and antibiotic selection markers are generally used for targeted KI via HR in mammalian cells, including embryonic stem and induced pluripotent stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent combination of this approach with site-specific endonucleases, such as CRISPR-Cas, drastically increased targeting efficiency in these cultured cells33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In zygotes, targeted KI with plasmids via classical HR has also been reported by several groups13,14,15,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the efficiency is still not ideal, because selection markers are not available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we have shown two new approaches that use the CRISPR-Cas system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first used a synthetic long ssODN containing a GFP cassette and successfully knocked in GFP at the 3-end of the rat Thy1 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second approach, 2H2OP, used two short ssODNs for the integration of a longer plasmid, which allowed the efficient integration of a CAG-GFP vector into the rat Rosa26 locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, 2H2OP allowed KI of a 200-kb BAC containing the human SIRPA gene at the rat Sirpa locus and also achieved replacement of the rat Cyp2d cluster genes with the human CYP2D6 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the targeted KI of such a long BAC fragment and the replacement of a large genomic region containing a cluster of genes by a single injection of unmodified donor DNA, ssODNs and CRISPR-Cas into rodent embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent studies showed the high efficiency of CRISPR-Cas-mediated KI in zebrafish by concurrent cleavage of donor plasmid DNA and genomic DNA using an NHEJ-dependent DNA repair system36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, microhomology-mediated end-joining-dependent targeted KI of donor plasmid DNA by TALEN or CRISPR-Cas was reported as TALEN-mediated precise integration into target chromosome system (PITCh) or CRISPR-mediated PITCh methods respectively, in human cells and frogs38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These KI technologies are both achieved by the concurrent cleavage of genomic DNA and donor plasmids without using ssODN, but have not been used in mouse and rat zygotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Table 1, we injected Platinum TALENs39 into rat zygotes targeting the Rosa26 locus with a TALEN-mediated-PITCh vector containing CAG-GFP sequences, resulting in several TALEN-mediated KO pups (9/32), but no pups with GFP KI alleles (0/32) at the Rosa26 locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparent difference in KI efficiency between fishfrogs and rodents might reflect the different dependence on the DNA repair system between species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the 2H2OP method in this study provided several pups with GFP KI alleles (3/17) at the same Rosa26 locus, suggesting that co-injected ssODNs can support the ligation of CRISPR-Cas-mediated DSBs of the template into genomic target DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased ligation efficiency via ssODN-mediated end joining was also observed in our previous studies26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several groups have reported HR-dependent KI in rats using targeting vectors and zinc finger nuclease10, TALEN13,40 and CRISPR14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency of HR-mediated KI is strongly dependent on the gene being targeted, but technical conditions are also a factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ma et al.14 reported  greater than 50% KI efficiency (6/11 pups) at the rat Cck locus; however, most other studies have reported a lower efficiency (130%) or failure of KI at certain genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiments, co-injection of Cas9-polyA, gRNA targeting Rosa26 and a donor plasmid comprising CAG-GFP sequences flanking 515 and 645-bp homology arms into rat zygotes resulted in no pups with KI alleles (0/25; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homology arms are usually cloned into targeting vectors for HR-based experiments, whereas no homology arms are required in existing plasmids in 2H2OP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The notable advantage of 2H2OP is the targeted KI of much larger DNA fragments, such as BAC clones, or the replacement of large gene clusters, illustrated in Figs 4 and 5, respectively, without the need to modify the donor vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the overall efficiency of this BAC KI or cluster gene replacement was low, at 6.7% and 4.3%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our injection of the same BAC clone into rat zygotes to produce conventional transgenic animals resulted in a 9.2% efficiency (6/65 pups), where the BAC was randomly integrated (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a low efficiency of BAC transgenesis has been reported by other groups (14%)41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency for the integration or deletion of large regions by 2H2OP may depend on the size of the targeted region as previously reported43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The disadvantage of 2H2OP is the high rate of indel mutations at ssODN-mediated conjunction sites (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lsODN approach could circumvent this problem for precise KI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the experiment using lsODN targeting the start codon of the Thy1 locus, many deletion mutations were observed on the 5-side of the integrated lsODN sequences (Fig 2d), probably because of the 53 exonuclease activity of the DSB repair system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations provide some clues about the underlying mechanism for repairing CRISPR-mediated DSBs with single-stranded ODNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that this repair system is the synthesis-dependent strand annealing pathway, which is one of the major HR pathways for repairing DSBs45,46 (Supplementary Fig 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the synthesis-dependent strand annealing pathway, after resection of the 5-strand of the DSB, the 3-strand of the ssODN anneals to the homologous sequences on the 3-strand of the DSB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, DNA synthesis occurs from the 3-end of the DSB, to copy the remaining 5-strand of the ssODN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second annealing occurs with the other 3-end of the DSB after removal of the ssODN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, gap filling and ligation complete the repair event18,19,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 5-degradation of ssODNs by exonuclease activity or the removal of the ssODN by helicase activity might concurrently occur with DNA synthesis, which causes incomplete repair, such as indel mutations (Supplementary Fig 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this process, microhomology sequences between the 3-strand of the DSB and the newly synthesized 3-strand of the ssODN may also cause indel mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, extension of the 5-side of the homology arms up to 300-bp drastically ameliorated the deletion mutations on the 5-side of the lsODN sequences, providing the precise 2A-GFP KI at the end of the Thy1 locus (Fig 2f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limitation of the lsODN approach is the maximal length of the synthetic lsODN, which is currently limited to 3 kb (Nagahora et al., unpublished data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we also demonstrated that poly(A) tail elongation enhances the translation efficiency of Cas9 mRNA in zygotes, thereby increasing the efficiency of CRISPR-mediated genome editing (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Poly(A) tails generally play an important role in the stability and translation of most eukaryotic mRNAs27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vertebrate oocytes, maternal mRNAs are mostly dormant with relatively short poly(A) tails, usually fewer than 20 nucleotides27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the length of the poly(A) tail is strongly associated with translational efficiency47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this association is observed only in oocytes or early-stage embryos, but not in somatic cells or tissues, which suggests that a translational control switch exists in early embryos47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also reported that attaching synthetic tails or increasing the length of an mRNA increases its translation in Xenopus48, Drosophila49 and mouse oocytes50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previously published papers51, our study confirms that increased levels of Cas9 in embryos produced neither severe toxicity nor off-target effects in other chromosomal regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have established new ssODN-mediated KI approaches with the CRISPR-Cas system, which are applicable to any target site, any species and with any donor vector without the need of attaching homology arms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These technologies facilitate easy and flexible genome engineering in living organisms, such as the production of rainbow animals with colourful reporter genes or cross-species GM (for example, humanized) animals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
