Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'One-dimensional conductive particle assembly holds promise for a variety of practical applications, in particular for a new generation of electronic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, synthesis of such chains with programmable shapes outside a liquid environment has proven difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a route to simply pull flexible granular and colloidal chains out of a dispersion by combining field-directed assembly and capillary effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These chains are automatically stabilized by liquid bridges formed between adjacent particles, without the need for continuous energy input or special particle functionalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They can further be deposited onto any surface and form desired conductive patterns, potentially applicable to the manufacturing of simple electronic circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various aspects of our route, including the role of particle size and the voltages needed, are studied in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Looking towards practical applications, we also present the possibility of two-dimensional writing, rapid solidification of chains and methods to scale up chain production.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fabrication of one-dimensional (1D) granular and colloidal materials is of considerable interest, as they offer opportunities for a variety of electronic applications, including granular conductors1, flexible electronics for wearable devices2 and electromagnetic energy transport3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 1D patterns can be assembled either from particle groups5,6,7,8 or from individual particles9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter can also be employed in mechanical contexts, for example, as flexible artificial flagella or cilia14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to other methodologies such as lithography2,17, cluster-assisted assembly18 and colloidal polymerization19, field-directed assembly in electro- or magneto-rheological fluids20,21 provides a simple, efficient22 and controllable approach for particle chain formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it suffers from two major limitations that hinder its application, for example, in electronic-device manufacturing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the assembly typically takes place in bulk liquid, which limits the control over positioning of the chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, maintaining the formed structures normally requires a continuous energy supply; once the external field is turned off, the structures disintegrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Avoidance of this limitation requires special functionalization of the particle surfaces, such as grafting of DNA23,24,25 or polymeric crosslinkers22,26,27 and designing charge groups10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we propose a route to overcome both of these limitations, making it possible to easily fabricate self-sustained, printable granular and colloidal chains outside of a dispersion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central idea is to combine field-directed assembly with capillary effects, as illustrated in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conductive particles of radius a are initially dispersed in a leaky dielectric liquid that only gives rise to weak screening effects, for example, natural or synthetic oil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To initiate chain formation, we bring a needle-shaped electrode to the liquid surface, and apply an electric field through it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The external field polarizes nearby conductive particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through dielectrophoresis (DEP), these conductive particles are attracted along the field gradient, that is, towards the tip of the electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the electrode rises, it pulls the particles out of the liquid to form a particle chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along the chain, any two adjacent particles are connected by a spheresphere liquid bridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the combined capillary effects of these bridges make it possible to maintain a stable particle chain even after the external field is turned off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematics of chain formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Particles are pulled out of a dispersion to form a pearl necklace, by applying an electric field through a needle-shaped electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) A particle at the airliquid interface experiences an upward dielectrophoretic force Fe and a downward capillary force Fsp stemming from the sphereplane liquid bridge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Once the particle is pulled out, it automatically forms a spheresphere bridge with the particle below it, and pulls that particle upwards with force Fss.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Force analysis', 'The viability of this approach can be estimated from direct force calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stability of the particle chain in the absence of an external electric field requires the capillary force Fss2a ( the surface tension of the liquid) to exceed the gravitational force acting on an entire chain Fg=4Nga3/3 (N the number of particles,  the particle density and g the gravitational acceleration).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the shortest chain (two particles) an upper limit to the particle size is amax=(3/2g)1/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given oil0.01 N m1, 1 g cm3 and g10 m s2, we estimate amax1 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For particles with radii up to several microns, their weight is negligible, as Fg=(a/amax)2Fss104 Fss, and thus a long chain composed of hundreds or thousands of particles is stable in the absence of an electric field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To achieve a chain formation by sequentially pulling each individual micron-sized particle out of the liquid, the only requirement is that the DEP force Fe exerted on it must overcome the downward capillary force Fsp, such that the sphereplane liquid bridge can be extended and broken.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sphere directly above it is connected to the electrode and stays at voltage U with respect to the grounded container.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it carries a charge Q=4oilaU (oil the relative permittivity of the medium and  the vacuum permittivity) and thus generates a radially decaying electric field E=Q/(4oilr2)=aU/r2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the conventional formula28 for the DEP force Fe=2oila3(E2), its action on the sphere beneath it is Fe=8oila5U2/d5, where d is the centre-to-centre distance between the two spheres, and  the ClausiusMossotti factor, which approaches unity for highly conductive particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the limit that the two spheres are at contact, d2a, we obtain Fe=oilU2/4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the applied voltage U should be at least Umin=(4Fsp/oil)1/2=(8a/oil)1/2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that 1 and oil1, the minimum voltage required for a particle of radius a10 m to be removed from the bulk liquid interface is on the order of hundreds of volts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Experimental realization', 'To realize this approach in experiment, we employ a dispersion of silver-coated hollow silica microspheres (a30 m, 0.17 g cm3) in silicone oil (viscosity =100 mPa s, mass density oil0.96 g cm3, surface tension 0.03 N m1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After dipping the electrode into the dispersion, we apply an electric voltage of magnitude U=600 V between the electrode and the bottom of the container.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate any unwanted DC effects, such as contact charge electrophoresis29, we employ a high-frequency AC field (f=20 kHz, square wave).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrode is elevated at an average speed of around 1 mm s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated in Fig 2, in less than a minute, a nearly 3-cm-long chain comprised of around 500 particles is easily formed and stays in place even after the field is turned off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Experimental realization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Pulling a conductive chain out of a container filled with a dispersion of Ag-coated hollow silica spheres (radius 30 m, density 0.17 g cm3) in silicone oil (viscosity=100 mPa s, density0.96 g cm3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrode is first dipped into the dispersion and then an AC electric voltage (600 V, f=20 kHz) is applied (t0 s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the electrode is raised, a conductive chain is pulled out of the dispersion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) A nearly 3-cm-long chain comprising hundreds of particles can be formed within a minute (ruler in centimeters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar experiment is presented in Supplementary Movie 1.Full size image', 'Moreover, as illustrated in Fig 3af, our approach works for a wide range of particle diameters, spanning from 100 nm to 200 m.

See also Supplementary Movie 2.Full size image', 'Requirements on the applied field', 'Since this experimental realization confirms the viability of the concept, we further explore the underlying mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we find that voltages significantly lower than the predicted threshold are sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, for spheres of radius 30 m, the observed threshold is 100 V, far lower than Umin=570 V (the value obtained using the conventional DEP model).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be understood from a significant underestimation of the force Fe in the conventional DEP model when d2a, which arises from omission of the influence of the polarized sphere on the electric field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality, when two spheres are nearly touching (surface separation s0), the electric field is strongly altered, reaching a magnitude of the order of U/s, far exceeding the assumption aU/d2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the induced surface charges heavily concentrate at the facing poles of both spheres, rendering the conventional DEP model invalid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for this we perform a finite-element analysis (FEA, see Methods), in which we apply a voltage U on one sphere and obtain the DEP force on the other by computing the induced surface charges and directly summing the electrostatic forces exerted on them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As illustrated in Fig 4, the electric field generated by the sphere at voltage U is strongly distorted by the nearby polarized sphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, at small separations s, the resultant DEP force follows the exact asymptotic solution Fe1/s(ln s)2 (refs 30, 31), exceeding the conventional DEP model by more than an order of magnitude when s0.1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains the experimental observation that voltages as low as 100 V are sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: DEP forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Electric field generated by a spherical electrode at U=100 V and a polarized metal sphere right beneath it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two spheres (solid circles) have radius a=30 m and are separated by s=3 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we have presented a convenient route for fabricating one-dimensional conductive micron-sized structures, combining field-induced assembly and capillary effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assembled structure remains stable outside a liquid environment and even without continuous energy supply, making this method different from most conventional approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the particles are connected through liquid bridges, the chain exhibits a certain flexibility and can be utilized in 2D direct-writing processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solidification then permits fixation of the chain in such a designed shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entire process takes less than a minute for generating a long chain composed of thousands of particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated that this approach works for a wide range of particle sizes and can be scaled up (Supplementary Fig 2).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
