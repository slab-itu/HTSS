The Notch and Wnt pathways regulate stemness and differentiation in human fallopian tube organoids  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The epithelial lining of the fallopian tube is of critical importance for human reproduction and has been implicated as a site of origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on the establishment of long-term, stable 3D organoid cultures from human fallopian tubes, indicative of the presence of adult stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that single epithelial stem cells in vitro can give rise to differentiated organoids containing ciliated and secretory cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuous growth and differentiation of organoids depend on both Wnt and Notch paracrine signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microarray analysis reveals that inhibition of Notch signalling causes downregulation of stem cell-associated genes in parallel with decreased proliferation and increased numbers of ciliated cells and that organoids also respond to oestradiol and progesterone treatment in a physiological manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our organoid model provides a much-needed basis for future investigations of signalling routes involved in health and disease of the fallopian tube.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Adult stem cells of the human mucosa have been described in several tissues; however, the molecular mechanisms of renewal and differentiation remain obscure in many cases, including the fallopian tube, a central organ of human reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is lined by simple columnar epithelium containing secretory and ciliated cells, which produce tubular fluid and facilitate transport of gametes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the fimbriumthe distal part that is in close contact with the ovarythis epithelium is organized into extensively branched mucosal folds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since it is exposed to cyclical hormonal changes, mechanisms to ensure its long-term renewal and integrity are of critical importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of stem cell-like cells has previously been postulated based on sphere-forming capacity and differentiation in vitro1 and evidence for the presence of label-retaining cells in the distal fallopian tube2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate the existence of adult stem cells in the human fallopian tube epithelium, which gives rise to a monolayer of differentiated epithelial cells in a complex 3D organoid in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They faithfully recapitulate the native tissue architecture, show robust growth and can be maintained long term in culture ( greater than 16 months so far).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the intestinal tract, skin, liver and ovary3,4,5,6, stemness is maintained by active Wnt signalling and is centred on a subfamily of leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptors Lgr4, 5 and 6 (refs 7, 8, 9), which are themselves Wnt target genes, and have the capacity to strongly amplify Wnt signals, while the R-spondin family of proteins act as Lgr receptor agonists10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In congruence, the expansion capacity of organoids is modulated by Wnt3A and R-spondin-1 (RSPO1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Notch is responsible for the regulation of known stem cell factor genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data reveal a significant overlap between Notch-dependent genes in the fallopian epithelium and the defined stem cell signature of the mouse intestine, suggesting the existence of a conserved pathway that regulates tissue renewal and directly controls cell fate specification and differentiation in the organoid by inhibiting cilliogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Therefore, this new organoid model closely mimics the normal physiology and anatomy of the human fallopian tube epithelium and provides a starting point for future investigations into the regulatory mechanisms involved in its cellular renewal and pathology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Adult fallopian tube organoids can be maintained long term', 'To obtain insight into the renewal activity of the human fallopian tube mucosa, we carried out immunofluorescence analysis of healthy samples from gynaecological tissue specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ki-67-positive cells were distributed along the epithelial folds, without restriction to a particular region with occasional clustering (Fig 1a, asterisk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proportion was higher in the distal compared with the proximal region (5.0±0.3% versus 2.3±1.3%, respectively) in line with previous reports11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

acetylated tubulin, a marker of ciliated cells (red), the proliferation marker Ki67 (green) and DNA (DRAQ5, blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ki67-positive nuclei are dispersed along epithelial folds, with occasional clustering (asterisk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Phase contrast images of spheroid formation and growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small spheres are already visible 1 day after seeding and expand to reach

cultures at different time points labelled for b-Cat (red) and ac tubulin (green), revealing that cilia develop after 2 weeks in 3D culture.Full size image', 'To test whether these presumed stem cells can be maintained in vitro if given the appropriate paracrine environment, we isolated and seeded epithelial cells from patient samples in two-dimensional (2D) culture, followed by transfer to a three-dimensional (3D) Matrigel matrix, supplemented with a cocktail of growth factors to modulate Wnt, Notch, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)- signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small round clusters of cells were visible after 24 h (Fig 1b) and by 3 days post seeding developed into rapidly expanding spheres of a round, cystic phenotype, reaching up to 2.5 mm in diameter within 2 weeks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each Matrigel drop seeded with 20,000 cells yielded an average of 700 spheroids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of folds, invaginations of the epithelium, as a hallmark of mature organoid culture is detected during the second week of 3D growth (Fig 1c, arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall growth rates during long-term culture remained constant, with passaging at a 1:3 ratio required every 23 weeks (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The doubling time of cells in organoid cultures, quantified based on the number of progeny from a defined number of seeded sells over 2 weeks of cultivation, was 3.55 days (Supplementary Fig 1a), and Hoechst 33342 labelling to visualize proliferation revealed several mitotic cleavage planes within a small region of the organoid surface (Supplementary Fig 1b), suggestive of rapid growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between passages individual organoids greatly increased in diameter (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live cell imaging of fragmented pieces immediately after passage 13 (10 months) showed that they re-organized within 46 h, followed by rapid invagination of epithelial folds and spherical expansion (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, this method has yielded expandable, stable organoid cultures in all healthy tissue samples from 52 donors tested so far, with only minor variations in sphere formation capacity and expansion rate between donors or between distal and proximal tubal regions (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Freshly seeded epithelial isolates followed over 72 h using live cell imaging demonstrated that spheres do not form through the aggregation of cells but rather through the expansion of a subpopulation of individual cells (asterisks, Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether organoid formation is a monoclonal process, we labelled epithelial cells with either GFP- or mCherry-expressing lentiviruses, and seeded them in Matrigel at equal ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting organoids were almost exclusively either red or green (Fig 1d), with less than 1% dual-colour organoids (from non-clonal origin).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also performed clonogenic assays by seeding FACS-isolated epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)+ cells at a ratio of one cell per 10 l Matrigel drop in a 96-well format.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monoclonal organoids developed with a frequency of 0.51% (Fig 1e), could be expanded long term ( greater than 3 months) and consisted of both secretory and ciliated cells, demonstrating the bipotency of the initiating progenitor cell (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These stem cells are likely to be non-ciliated, since cilia were not seen in developing organoids until 2 weeks after initial cell seeding (Fig 1g), despite the presence of ciliated cells in the initial cell isolate (Supplementary Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we conclude that organoid formation is vastly monoclonal and is driven by bipotent EpCAM+ stem cells of the fallopian tube, which maintain long-term potency in our system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Organoids faithfully recapitulate the mucosal fold architecture', 'Detailed characterization of the organoid epithelium using confocal microscopy revealed highly polarized columnar cells, exhibiting precisely aligned nuclei, a restricted location of the main epithelial adhesion molecule E-Cadherin (Cdh-1) to the lateral membrane, and an orientation of the apical pole to the luminal side (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mature organoids contained Pax8-positive secretory cells as well as Pax8-negative, acetylated tubulin-positive ciliated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Occasional Pax8-positive ciliated cells (Fig 2c), which were also observed in tissue sections (Supplementary Fig 2a), suggest that loss of Pax8 represents a late event during differentiation to a ciliated phenotype, in line with our observation that both cell types derive from bipotent unciliated stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Organoids match the in vivo epithelium in structure and distribution of markers.Confocal images of organoid sections show that epithelium contains both ciliated cells positive for detyrosinated tubulin (green (a)) and secretory cells positive for PAX8 (green (b)) confirming differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Terminally differentiated ciliated cells are PAX8-negative (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Epithelial cells form tight junctions visible by labelling for occludin (green, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Organoids also contain occasional domains of epithelial cells ubiquitously expressing CA125 (green, middle) as well as basolateral vimentin (green, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Electron transmission microscopy images of the fallopian

complexes, which ensure separation of the apical from basolateral side (arrow, lower panel, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apical surface is covered by abundant microvilli (*) and fully developed cilia (***).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ruffling of the apical membrane on the non-ciliated cells (left panel) is highly suggestive of active release and secretion into the lumen (double arrow).Full size image', 'We further observed subapical localization of occludin in a nodal pattern, indicative of functional tight junctions (Fig 2d, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, organoids contained clusters of cells expressing high levels of Ca125 protein (MUC16, Fig 2d, centre), very similar to those observed in the tissue (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously shown for epithelial cells of the fallopian tube12, organoids also exhibited basolateral accumulation of vimentin (Fig 2d, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmission electron microscopy analysis (Fig 2e) confirmed the high degree of overall similarity to fallopian tube tissue, including fully developed junctions between the cells consisting of desmosomes, zonula adherens and tight junctions (arrow, right panel), as well as fully assembled cilia (asterisks, right panel) and active secretion (double arrow, left panel), all of which indicate mature functional differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Organoids also recapitulate the higher-order epithelial tissue architecture, as evidenced by frequent folding of epithelial sheets initially observed in phase-contrast images, is also prominent in confocal images of organoid sections, resembling the extensive folds seen in the authentic tissue (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Comparative analysis of phenotypes at 1 and 4 months of culture showed long-term stability with no apparent changes in the epithelial structure and polarity over time, as organoids undergo a new cycle of growth after each passage (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the stable time window between passages, the percentage of actively proliferating cells also remained constant over time (Fig 3b) as did the number of ciliated cells (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that, in contrast to other organoid models13, the presence of Wnt3A and RSPO1 in the organoid culture medium maintains a subpopulation of stem cells long term, while at the same time allowing for full differentiation of the complete fallopian tube phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Organoid morphology and phenotype remains stable during long-term culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Comparative

has previously been described for gastrointestinal organoid models13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the presumptive conservation of core renewal mechanisms, fallopian tube organoids were supplemented with EGF, FGF10 and factors that modulate paracrine Wnt signalling (Wnt3a and RSPO1), suppress TGF- receptor kinase (ALK4/5) and BMP signalling (Noggin) and inhibit anoikis (ROCK inhibitor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Organoids did form in basic medium but their number doubled in the presence of EGF, while addition of RSPO1 increased their size (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGF and Wnt

3a), they exhibited slowdown of expansion and finally growth arrest by four to six passages (34 months).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of TGF- RK inhibitor, on the other hand, quasi-indefinite expansion ( greater than 1 year) was seen routinely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To demonstrate conclusively that Wnt signalling is active in fallopian tube organoids, we introduced the 7 × Tcf-eGFP reporter by lentiviral transduction, which contains an oligomerized TCF4-binding-site sequence, ensuring that expression is limited to cells in which this classical Wnt transcriptional response is initiated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal live cell imaging over 40 h showed abundant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells (Fig 4c), confirming activation of the canonical Wnt pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, we detected several GFP-positive cells that were actively dividing (Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, we independently confirmed transmission of the Wnt signal to the nuclei of early organoids with the lentiviral reporter T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) DsRed (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the importance of exogenous Wnt pathway stimulation, we used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to assess the effects of Wnt3A and RSPO1 on the expression of hTERT, a direct target of Wnt signalling14 reported to be highly expressed in intestinal stem cells15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both Wnt ligands triggered strong upregulation of hTERT (Fig 4d) and increased proliferation (Ki67), suggesting that this pathway is involved in maintaining fallopian tube stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the Wnt target genes Axin2 and cMYC were upregulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we investigated whether there is interdependency between Wnt3A and RSPO1, and how this contributes to sphere formation and regulation of stemness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt3A is the ligand of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway, which interacts with the LRP6/Frizzled receptor complex16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RSPO1 potentiates the cellular response to Wnts through a unique mode of action that involves binding to members of the LGR subfamily (LGR4, 5 and 6), without direct interaction with the Wnt receptor LRP6 (refs 6, 17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this interdependency, we measured expression of several stem cell genes using qPCR in the presence of RSPO1 alone or in combination with Wnt3A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in the presence of RSPO1, Wnt3A addition strongly increased expression levels of hTERT, Olfactomedin4 and Notch1 (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without RSPO1, sphere formation capacity over 7 days was also very low even in the presence of Wnt3A (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with other models showing that RSPO1 is an amplifier of Wnt3A signalling10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that RSPO1 plays a crucial role in formation and stem cell maintenance of fallopian tube organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, induction of Olfactomedin4, a highly specific marker of the intestinal stem cell compartment19, might indicate a common organizing principle in these different niches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, Notch1 induction by Wnt ligands indicates interactions between the Wnt and Notch signalling pathways in the fallopian tube organoids and the concerted action of these two morphogens in stemness regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notch signalling sustains expression of stem cell genes', 'As the Notch signalling pathway is known to play a pivotal role in regulation of the adult intestinal stem cell niche20, we investigated whether growth of organoids and cell fate determination towards secretory or ciliated phenotypes is affected by inhibition of Notch by adding the -secretase inhibitor DBZ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase contrast imaging indicated increased folding within the organoids after 7 days of treatment (Fig 5a, asterisk), and microarray analysis on the Agilent platform (44 k array) showed that DBZ caused a strong shift in the global gene expression pattern, affecting nearly 4,000 genes (cutoff at  greater than 1.5-fold regulation; see data deposited under the accession number GSE60919).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the downregulated genes we identified several associated with the maintenance of stemness (AXIN2, LGR6 and Olfactomedin4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was validated using qPCR in samples from three independent patients (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effectiveness of DBZ treatment was confirmed by downregulation of the Notch signalling target HES1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

observed downregulation of LGR6, the orphan transmembrane receptor belonging to the Wnt pathway, provides further evidence of the interplay between Wnt and Notch in the regulation of organoid growth

which is not expressed in either the fallopian tube tissue or the organoids, as indicated by the microarray data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence labelling revealed a randomly distributed population of LGR6-positive cells in both tissue and organ sections (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the organoids these cells were often, but not exclusively, found in regions enriched in Ki67 (Supplementary Fig 4a, asterisks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of the hypothesis that the Notch pathway plays a role in the maintenance of the fallopian stem cell niche, we used systematic Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to test whether the downregulated genes are part of a larger molecular programme related to stemness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we used the human homologues of a set of 274 previously described adult mouse intestinal crypt stem cell signature genes21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the similarity of the paracrine signalling pathways involved, we wanted to examine whether the underlying conserved molecular mechanisms could be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GSEA revealed that the set of downregulated genes in DBZ-treated organoids is significantly enriched (GSEA permutation test, P less_than 0.001) for the intestinal stem cell signature genes (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 274 genes, 78 were significantly downregulated (log ratio error, P less_than 0.05) after Notch inhibition (Fig 5d) including Eph4A, RNF43, SMO and the frizzled receptors FZD2 and FZD7 (Supplementary Table 1), all of which are known to play important roles in preservation of stemness22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, conserved molecular mechanisms regulating adult stem cell niches are active in the fallopian tube, and expression of stemness-related genes in the epithelium is supported by active Notch signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Regulation of differentiated cells in the organoid', 'Downregulation of stemness-promoting genes should be accompanied by reduced proliferation as well as increased differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain a systematic, unbiased overview, we used the online GOrilla platform25,26 to perform gene ontology enrichment analysis of the list of genes regulated by Notch that were identified with microarray.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The programme identified cilia and accessory microtubuli as highly enriched primary cellular components (Supplementary Fig 5), suggesting that the Notch pathway promotes a secretory cell phenotype and that inhibition triggers differentiation into ciliated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the microarray data, the expression levels of several genes indispensable for ciliogenesis and/or cilia function were analysed using qPCR: ARMC4, DNAI1, FOXJ1 and LRRC6 (refs 27, 28, 29, 30).

gene expression pattern analysis by microarray identified more than 1,500, and 450 genes regulated in response to oestradiol and progesterone treatments, respectively (Fig 6e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of these are known to be inversely regulated during different phases of the menstrual cycle, such as progesterone receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a strong oestradiol-induced upregulation of oviductal glycoprotein 1 (OVGP1) thought to play an important role during fertilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of genes significantly regulated across three donors reveals clustering for both types of treatment (oestradiol or progesterone) and direction of regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our model should be valuable for studies on the role of hormones in the regulation of the fallopian tube

'Here we report the establishment of human fallopian tube organoids that faithfully recapitulate the phenotype of in vivo tissue and can be stably expanded for more than a year without apparent changes in phenotype, essentially demonstrating the existence of fallopian tube stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are single bi-potent stem cells that give rise to whole organoids through long-term proliferation and differentiation into secretory and ciliated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful cultivation depends on supplementation with appropriate growth factors that support paracrine signalling pathways, in particular Wnt and Notch, to preserve the stem cell niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of these supplements is a likely reason for previous failures in expanding fallopian tube cells in vitro and their incomplete polarization, resulting in abundant multilayering and the absence of a central cavity12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The effects of Notch inhibition strongly support a central role of the Wnt and Notch pathways in the regulation of stemness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overlap between Notch-dependent genes in the human fallopian tube and the stem cell signature network of the mouse intestine21 points to similar regulatory mechanisms in these two niches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LGR5-positive intestinal stem cells are known to exhibit high telomerase activity in vitro15, which rapidly decreases in transit amplifying and differentiating cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is likely that the increase in expression of hTERT, Ki67, Olfactomedin4 and Notch1 that we observed when active Wnt signalling is maintained by RSPO1 and Wnt3A reflects an increase in the number of stem cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The requirement for RSPO1 further indicates a decisive role of its receptors for epithelial tissue renewal in the fallopian tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our microarray data reveal an insignificant expression of LGR5, the main receptor for RSPO1 in gastrointestinal tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, a recent report also showed only very limited expression in the human fimbrium and none in the adult mouse fallopian tube6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we detected strong expression of its homologue LGR6 in tissue sections as well as organoids, suggesting that it could be a functional RSPO1 receptor, and potentially also a stem cell marker in the fallopian tube.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings have considerable implications for the understanding of fallopian epithelial renewal in vivo and its role in disease development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While cellular transformation of the ovarian surface epithelium is still a possibility32, it is the epithelium of the fimbrium that is now widely considered as the most frequent tissue of origin of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, while intestine and uterus are likely to be additional tissues contributing to the aetiology of this peritoneal malignancy33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the exact contribution of each of these organs to this highly complex disease is yet to be determined, there is clearly a need for a better understanding of the biology of fallopian tube epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, our organoid model from patient material, exhibiting the polarized epithelium that readily responds to hormonal stimulation opens up exciting new possibilities for studying the aetiology of ovarian cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deregulation of Notch signalling has been identified as one of the most frequent and significant changes in ovarian cancer patients35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our finding that Notch is an important regulator of stemness and differentiation in the healthy fallopian tube provides important insight for the cellular mechanism that maintains homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of PAX8+/acTub+ ciliated cells in both tissue and organoids strongly suggests that the secretory phenotype preceeds development of cilia and could prove to be crucial for understanding early transformation events in the fallopian tube, which have been defined as outgrowths of secretory cells31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The described fallopian tube organoid model thus promises to be a valuable tool for future investigations on the biology and pathology of this relatively inaccessible organ, particularly with regard to tumour biology, as well as reproductive medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed long-term stability and expansion potential of the human fallopian tube tissue provides substantial advantages over existing primary cell models enabling numerous downstream experimental applications, such as the generation of mutant organoids and the advancement of screening technology36.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
