Unified model for singlet fission within a non-conjugated covalent pentacene dimer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'When molecular dimers, crystalline films or molecular aggregates absorb a photon to produce a singlet exciton, spin-allowed singlet fission may produce two triplet excitons that can be used to generate two electronhole pairs, leading to a predicted 50% enhancement in maximum solar cell performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The singlet fission mechanism is still not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on the use of time-resolved optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to probe singlet fission in a pentacene dimer linked by a non-conjugated spacer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe the key intermediates in the singlet fission process, including the formation and decay of a quintet state that precedes formation of the pentacene triplet excitons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these combined data, we develop a single kinetic model that describes the data over seven temporal orders of magnitude both at room and cryogenic temperatures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Innovative strategies are necessary to overcome the ShockleyQueisser limit1, which places the maximum solar conversion efficiency for a single pn junction at 33%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such strategy is singlet fission (SF), in which a high-energy, photogenerated singlet exciton (S1) in an organic material is rapidly down-converted into two low-energy, triplet excitons (T1+T1) in a spin-allowed process, provided that the state energies fulfil the requirement: E(S1)2E(T1) (refs 2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SF rate depends on the free energy of the process and the electronic coupling matrix elements between the chromophores for the particular states involved in this process2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several families of molecular building blocks have been identified that fulfil the energetic requirements for efficient SF, including polyacenes4,5,6,7,8,9, diphenylisobenzofurans10, carotenoids11,12, rylenes13 and other chromophores14, although the scope of SF molecules still remains rather limited, as discussed in reviews by Smith and Michl2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'SF can occur by two general mechanisms: one that directly couples the photogenerated initial 1(S1S0) state to a multi-exciton 1(T1T1) state by a two-electron process, and the other, in which the conversion of 1(S1S0) into 1(T1T1) is facilitated by coupling to higher-lying charge transfer (CT) states2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that the 1(T1T1) state can undergo spin evolution to yield the 5(T1T1) quintet state, which upon spin decoherence can produce two non-interacting triplet states (T1+T1)15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it has recently been suggested that the two separated T1 states can be populated directly from the 1(S1S0) state without participation of any intermediate electronic states12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the number of states potentially involved in SF and their relationships to one another, pentacene dimers have emerged as an important model for exploring SF8,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They offer the opportunity to fine-tune the electronic coupling between neighbouring pentacenes by means of distance and effective -conjugation between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, intramolecular SF rates vary from 2.5 × 1012 s1 in dimers with orthogonal pentacenes to 1.8 × 109 s1 in bent dimers21,22, while the SF rates in polycrystalline pentacenes are generally  greater than 1012 s1 (refs 4, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it has been hypothesized that the electronic coupling between the pentacenes is critical to render CT-state-mediated SF energetically accessible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While no evidence for CT-mediated SF was observed in pentacene dimers linked directly or using p-phenylene oligomers24,25, work on -conjugated and cross-conjugated pentacene dimers26,27 has shown that effective -conjugation enables fast, CT-state-mediated SF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To date, all reported pentacene dimers have been designed with conjugated spacers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report here a pentacene dimer linked by a rigid, non-conjugated 1,3-diethynyladamantyl spacer (NC, Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pentacenes in NC are coupled just strongly enough to allow efficient SF before any other excited state processes occur, but weakly enough that the 1(T1T1) state formed by SF can undergo spin-mixing to form the 5(T1T1) on a timescale sufficiently slow to allow time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TREPR) spectroscopy to observe both its formation and decay into independent triplet states (T1+T1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with recent observations of quintet states formed by SF in tetracene films and conjugated pentacene dimers15,16, and allows us to use complementary time-resolved optical and TREPR spectroscopy to observe the intermediates and kinetics for the entire 1(S1S0)  1(T1T1)  5(T1T1)(T1+T1) sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these combined data, we develop a single kinetic model that describes the data over seven temporal orders of magnitude both at room and cryogenic temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Molecular and solid-state structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Chemical structures of the pentacene monomer (TIBS) and dimer (NC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) X-ray crystallographic structure of NC illustrating the arrangement and proximity of the two pentacenes.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Synthesis', 'Non-conjugated, rigid pentacene dimer NC was synthesized by the stepwise desymmetrization of 6,13-pentacenequinone 1Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lithiated tri-isobutylsilylacetylene was added to a suspension of 1 in THF at low temperature, and after reaction for 5 h, the reaction was quenched by the addition of MeI to afford ketone 2 in 75% yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1,3-Diethynyladamantane was lithiated by a reaction with LiHMDS in THF at low temperature to provide 3, and ketone 2 was then added to the solution of 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After quenching of the reaction by the addition of water, the resulting intermediate was isolated and carried on directly to Sn(II)-mediated reductive aromatization to give pentacene product NC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crude material was purified by column chromatography to give analytically pure NC in 40% yield over the two steps from 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a solid, the dimer NC is stable to air and moisture under normal laboratory conditions and shows a decomposition point of 364 °C (onset 282 °C, peak 364 °C) as measured by differential scanning calorimetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimer has good solubility in typical organic solvents (4 mg ml1) such as THF, CH2Cl2, CHCl3 and toluene, but NC slowly decomposes over several days in solutions under exposure to air and light (Supplementary Methods 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The known pentacene monomer 6,13-bis(tri-isobutylsilylethynyl)pentacene (TIBS) served as a reference28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Synthesis of NC.Detailed steps for the preparation of NC.Full size image', 'Time-resolved optical spectroscopy', 'Femtosecond and nanosecond transient absorption (fsTA and nsTA) measurements were used to probe the initial SF events in NC by irradiating into the low-energy absorption features in the range of 590656 nm (Supplementary Figs 8 and 9), and were analysed by both multi-wavelength and global analysis using the kinetic model illustrated in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model was established using the rate constants obtained from fsTA, nsTA and TREPR spectroscopy on NC in butyronitrile at 105 K.

experiments give no indication for the presence of a sufficiently long-lived charge-separated radical ion pair state in NC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, SF occurs, and the TREPR spectra suggest a

state S1 is of multiexcitonic character, that is, featuring large |1(T1T1) contributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This state is 0.04 eV more stable than the absorbing states, S2 and S3, which are essentially local excitations seen in pentacene monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They exhibit, in good agreement with experiments, vertical excitation energies of 1.94 eV (Supplementary Figs 8 and 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two dark CT states, S5 and S6, in which a charge is transferred from one pentacene to the other, lay 0.4 eV higher in energy than S2 and S3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using Truhlars fourfold-way diabatization procedure33, we have obtained the diabatic electronic states and the electronic couplings relevant for the characterization of the mechanism of the first step of SF (Supplementary Methods 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are the singlet ground state |S0S0, the correlated triplet pair (or multi-exciton) state |1(T1T1), the locally excited singlet states |1(S1S0) and |1(S0S1) and the CT states |1(CA) and |1(AC) (refs 2, 3, 26, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the relevance of the different SF mechanisms, we have calculated the effective coupling, Veff, of |1(S1S0) to |1(T1T1) (or |1(S0S1) to |1(T1T1))35,36:', '', 'In this expression, E(i) are the energies of the corresponding diabatic states and Vi,j are the couplings between the states i and j.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is assumed that the mixing of the CT states with |1(T1T1) and |1(S1S0)(|1(S0S1)) can be described perturbatively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expression allows dissecting the contributions of the direct and mediated (via CT states) SF channels, represented by the first and second term on the right hand side of equation (5), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results (Supplementary Table 4) show that while |1(T1T1) couples significantly to |1(CA) and |1(AC) (101 and 99 meV, respectively), couplings to |1(S1S0) and |1(S0S1) are an order of magnitude smaller (5 and 11 meV, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated Veff values for both |1(S1S0) and |1(S0S1) (Supplementary Table 6) show that the two states couple similarly to |1(T1T1), but differ in the relative contributions based on the direct and mediated terms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For |1(S1S0), the effective coupling is dominated by the mediated term, while for |1(S0S1) the direct term is most important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking the SF quantum yields into account, these results suggest a mediated superexchange-like mechanism involving high-lying CT states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been corroborated using semiempirical (AM1) configuration-interaction (full CI) calculations with 8 (4+4) active orbitals and using a polarized continuum model with benzonitrile as model solvent37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show a 0.7 eV preferential energy lowering for the |1(CA), |1(AC), |3(CA) and |3(AC) states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This brings the CT states within 0.6 eV of |1(T1T1) and |5(T1T1), rendering the superexchange channel even more likely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, the experimental data show the involvement of a quintet spin triplet pair in the mechanism of SF as a precursor to the formation of the uncorrelated pair of triplet excited states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To substantiate this hypothesis further, we have calculated the energies of the lowest-lying quintet and triplet states of NC (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show that the lowest-lying quintet state |5(T1T1) is nearly degenerate with the two lowest-lying bright states and with |1(T1T1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, population of |5(T1T1) through spin-mixing is possible (Supplementary Methods 4)2,8, eventually leading to the formation of the uncorrelated triplet pair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated state energies are fully compatible with the kinetic model in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further computational modelling will be required to understand more fully the role of spinspin interactions and electronic coupling between the relevant states in the SF mechanism.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The energy splitting between the 1(T1T1) and 5(T1T1) states depends on the exchange interaction (JSQ) between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If two pentacenes interact strongly in a -stacked geometry, as may occur in a polycrystalline solid, JSQ is large, so that the initially formed 1(T1T1) does not mix with 5(T1T1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the rate at which the two triplets within 1(T1T1) diffuse apart in the material is faster than singlet-quintet spin-mixing, a process that usually takes place in nanoseconds, then the direct formation of (T1+T1) from 1(T1T1) may occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if the triplet excitons separate on a timescale comparable to spin-mixing, the exponential decrease in JSQ as the distance between the two spin-correlated triplet states increases will result in singlet-quintet mixing40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, if two pentacenes are covalently linked, JSQ is controlled by the electronic structure of the linkage between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the non-conjugated spacer in NC ensures that JSQ is small enough that singlet-quintet spin-mixing occurs on a timescale that can be directly observed by TREPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent formation of two independent triplet states, which each carry spin polarization indicative of the quintet state from which they are derived, is followed by spin relaxation and subsequent triplet decay to the ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The value of JSQ is independent of the magnetic field; however, the ISC rates between 1(T1T1) and 5(T1T1) may depend on the magnetic field because the field causes Zeeman splitting of the magnetic sublevels of 5(T1T1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TREPR data show that ISC between 1(T1T1) and 5(T1T1) occurs primarily via the ms=0 sublevel in the presence of a magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the ms=0 sublevel energy is field invariant, this implies that at the 350 mT applied field, the value of JSQ is large enough that the ms=±1 and ms=±2 sublevels of 5(T1T1) are sufficiently far removed energetically from 1(T1T1) to prevent significant mixing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in the absence of a magnetic field with no Zeeman splitting, the magnetic sublevels of 5(T1T1) are nearly degenerate and are split only by the weak dipolar interaction between the two adjacent triplet states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mixing between 1(T1T1) and three of the five 5(T1T1) sublevels having appropriate symmetry42 should increase the ISC rates between them, which may account for the 23 fold increase in the ISC rates k3 and k3 going from 105 to 295 K (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, linking two pentacenes using a non-conjugated 1,3-diethynyladamantyl spacer results in sufficient electronic coupling between the pentacenes to render SF facile, while at the same time keeping the coupling sufficiently weak to allow spin decoherence leading to two independent triplet states to compete successfully with triplettriplet annihilation leading back to the 1(S1S0) state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a highly viscous butyronitrile matrix at cryogenic temperatures, we directly observe spin-mixing of 1(T1T1) with 5(T1T1) followed by spin decoherence yielding separated (T1+T1) states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of transient optical and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data provides a means of identifying and analysing the SF mechanism over a very broad time range, which should prove very useful in optimizing molecular designs for SF.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

At 105 K, PrCN is a viscous, supercooled liquid with a dielectric relaxation time of 5 ms (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the timescale of solvent motion at this temperature is much longer than that of the photophysics observed here, PrCN at 105 K can be treated as a solid for the purposes of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Global analysis was performed on the transient absorption data sets using an in-house written program in Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) previously described46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analytic solution to the coupled differential equations that describe the kinetic model is convoluted with a Gaussian instrument response function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the least-squares fitting has converged, the raw data matrix is deconvoluted using the specific solution to the kinetic model and parameters from the fit to obtain the species-associated spectra and their populations as a function of time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'EPR measurements were made at the X-band (9.5 GHz) using a Bruker Elexsys E680-X/W EPR spectrometer outfitted with a split ring resonator (ER4118X-MS5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were performed at 105 and 5 K using an Oxford Instruments CF935 continuous flow cryostat with liquid N2 or He, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TREPR measurements were performed following photoexcitation with 7 ns, 2.5 mJ, 640 nm pulses using the output of an optical parametric oscillator (Spectra-Physics Basi-scan), pumped with the output of a frequency tripled Nd:YAG laser (Spectra-Physics Quanta-Ray Pro 350).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transient EPR spectra were collected following laser photoexcitation, the transient magnetization was detected in quadrature under continuous wave microwave irradiation (5 mW), without field modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sweeping the magnetic field gave two-dimensional spectra versus both time and magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each kinetic trace, the signal acquired prior to the laser pulse was subtracted from the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kinetic traces recorded at magnetic field values off resonance were considered background signals, whose average was subtracted from all kinetic traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pulsed experiments employed a 1 kW travelling wave tube (TWT) amplifier (Applied Systems Engineering 117X) to generate high-power microwave pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resonator was partially overcoupled to maximize echo intensity and minimize ringing following microwave pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spin nutation experiment was performed with a PnutT/2 pulse sequence; the nutation pulse, Pnut, was of variable length, the delays were T=600 and =200 ns, the /2 and  denote microwave pulses of lengths 16 and 32 ns, respectively, and were optimized to provide ideal turning angles for the quintet spin echo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were photoexcited 600 ns and 15 s prior to the microwave pulse sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid spin relaxation effects, the pulsed experiments were performed at 5 K.
