Endomucin prevents leukocyteendothelial cell adhesion and has a critical role under resting and inflammatory conditions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Endomucin is a membrane-bound glycoprotein expressed luminally by endothelial cells that line postcapillary venules, a primary site of leukocyte recruitment during inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that endomucin abrogation on quiescent endothelial cells enables neutrophils to adhere firmly, via LFA-1-mediated binding to ICAM-1 constitutively expressed by endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, TNF- stimulation downregulates cell surface expression of endomucin concurrent with increased expression of adhesion molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adenovirus-mediated expression of endomucin under inflammatory conditions prevents neutrophil adhesion in vitro and reduces the infiltration of CD45+ and NIMP-R14+ cells in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that endomucin prevents leukocyte contact with adhesion molecules in non-inflamed tissues and that downregulation of endomucin is critical to facilitate adhesion of leukocytes into inflamed tissues.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A primary function of the endothelium in the non-inflamed steady state is to maintain an anti-adhesive surface by regulating and inhibiting coagulation, and by resisting the adhesion of blood leukocytes1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well documented that activation of the endothelium in response to injury or infection leads to the upregulation of adhesion molecules and chemokines that localize the recruitment of blood leukocytes to specific tissues and organs5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postcapillary venules, with their low laminar shear stress and sparse mural cell investment, are the primary site for the recruitment of leukocytes7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This response is comprised of a cascade of distinct sequential events including leukocyte tethering and rolling, firm adhesion and transmigration6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The majority of the work conducted to understand the molecular regulation of leukocyteendothelial interactions has focused on adhesion molecules and chemokines responsible for recruitment of leukocytes to the activated endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include E-selectin and P-selectin, which interact with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL1) and other glycosylated ligands on leukocytes; VCAM-1, which binds to very late antigen 4 (VLA4; also known as 41-integrin); and ICAM-1, which interacts with lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1; also known as L2-integrin)9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytokines, bacterial endotoxins, hemodynamic factors and viruses predispose the surface endothelium to local thrombosis, loss of vessel barrier function and leukocyte recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro and in vivo studies have illustrated that leukocyte adhesion and crawling is initiated by activation of the endothelium by cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interleukin-1 alpha and beta (IL-1,) and interferon gamma (IFN-)10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to adhesion molecules, much less attention has been focused on molecules that might prevent adhesive tethering of leukocytes or modulate their rolling without adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly important since ICAM-1 is expressed on quiescent or non-activated endothelial cells1,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Glycoproteins in the endothelial glycocalyx have been shown to block adhesion of blood cells12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endothelial glycocalyx is a negatively charged, organized meshwork composed of proteoglycans and their negatively charged glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins bearing terminal sialic acids and associated plasma proteins13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which comprise 5090% of the surface glycosaminoglycans, are cleaved as part of the response to inflammation14, presumably to facilitate the association of leukocytes with the endothelial surface15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sialomucins, such as CD34a marker of vascular endothelial cellsor CD43 on leukocytes, have been shown to both support and prevent cell adhesion either by increasing or decreasing surface expression, or by post-translational modification, which allows controlled O-linked glycosylation17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Endomucin (EMCN) is a type I integral membrane O-sialoglycoprotein expressed on the surface of endothelium in venules and capillaries, but not on arterial endothelium of adult tissues19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deduced protein sequence of both human and mouse EMCN long splice variant has 261 amino acid residues with an extracellular domain rich in serine and threonine residues21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  O-Glycans attached to these residues are important for maintaining the highly extended and rigid structure of the protein, as clustered O-glycans induce the peptide core to adopt a stiff and extended conformation that prevents folding into a globular structure23, which has an important role in regulating cellcell and cellmatrix interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we identify a function of EMCN in resisting the adhesion of blood leukocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, we demonstrate that expression of EMCN opposes the binding of neutrophils to constitutively expressed ICAM-1 on non-activated endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we find that inflammatory cytokines decrease EMCN expression, and that overexpression of EMCN under inflammatory conditions prevents neutrophil adhesion in vitro and reduces the infiltration of CD45+ and NIMP-R14+ cells in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data establish a critical role for EMCN in preventing leukocyte adhesion within non-inflamed tissues, and indicate that downregulation of EMCN during inflammation is necessary to facilitate migration of inflammatory cells into targeted tissues.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Under normal, non-inflammatory conditions, the vascular endothelium maintains an apical surface in which leukocytes and platelets do not adhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once inflammation is initiated, leukocyte trafficking is coordinated by sequential adhesive interactions between the blood leukocytes and endothelial cells25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevailing paradigm is that circulating leukocytes localize specifically at the inflammation site due to proinflammatory cytokines that are produced and released by interstitial or paracellular resident leukocytes, which leads to endothelial cell activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endothelial glycocalyx is the primary site of the rapid transition between non-adherent and adherent states, and a vast array of adhesive molecules both on leukocytes and endothelial cells has now been described6,8,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-inflammatory nature of the endothelial surface has been largely ascribed to the absence of pro-adhesive receptors and the possible presence of a functional anti-adhesive molecule has not been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endothelium plays a major role in regulating adhesiveness by providing a strong negative charge12 and exposing membrane proteins with glycosylation motifs that have both anti-adhesive and pro-adhesive roles, such as members of the CD34 family18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have documented the biological importance of an endothelial-specific sialomucin, EMCN, in maintaining an anti-inflammatory endothelial cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although previous studies22,27 have suggested an anti-adhesive function for EMCN, our data reveals the biological importance of EMCN localization and expression in the vascular endothelium under normal and inflammatory conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA knockdown of EMCN led to a significant increase in neutrophilendothelial cell adhesion under a range of physiologically relevant laminar shear stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometry analysis of HUVECs treated with siRNA targeting EMCN demonstrated that this effect was due to the depletion of EMCN and not to an increase in expression of pro-adhesive molecules, as E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were not by affected by the depletion of EMCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICAM-1, which is involved in leukocyte firm adhesion during inflammation, is constitutively expressed by HUVECs1,11 and was unchanged by siRNA against EMCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of the known relative sizes and conformation of EMCN (7590 kDa; extended mucin-like ectodomain) and ICAM-1 (90 kDa; multiple extracellular Ig-like loops)28, we speculated that depletion of EMCN was unmasking ICAM-1, and allowing neutrophil adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of neutralizing mAb against LFA-1 on neutrophils to disrupt neutrophil binding to ICAM-1 on HUVECs supported this hypothesis and also demonstrated that the EMCN in the endothelial cell glycocalyx, possibly by exposing negatively charged O-glycans that provide charge repulsion and steric hindrance, is critical to maintaining an anti-adhesive surface under non-inflammatory conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in vivo studies have shown EMCN localization to the luminal surface of venous and capillary, but not arterial, endothelium19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro, however, EMCN expression has been observed in human aortic and microvascular endothelial cells29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that laminar shear stress may play an important role in regulating EMCN expression, since expression of EMCN in the cell lines was determined under static conditions, whereas the reported absence of EMCN in arterial endothelium was in tissue where shear stress is present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis is supported by data indicating that prolonged exposure to high shear stress downregulates expression and surface localization of EMCN in HUVECs (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our observations are consistent with the idea that the glycocalyx provides a first line of defence against leukocyte adhesion and furthermore, support a role for EMCN in limiting access of leukocytes to cell surface adhesion molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'EMCN has been shown to include the MECA-79 carbohydrate epitope that is important in L-selectin-mediated interactions21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work has suggested that EMCN supports L-selectin-mediated rolling, and is thus a pro-adhesive molecule30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the data to support this conclusion were generated using CHO cells overexpressing EMCN along with a specific combination of carbohydrate modifying enzymes, glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases, which generates L-selectin-reactive capping group in core-2 branched O-glycans attached to sialomucin core proteins, such as EMCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this experimental system that was used to demonstrate that EMCN supports L-selectin-mediated rolling along glass capillaries coated with a neutralizing anti-L-selectin mAb appears unlikely to be relevant to the endothelium in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the critical role of EMCN in maintaining a non-inflammatory phenotype, we investigated its expression under inflammatory conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A primary focus in the study of inflammation has been on the promotion of leukocyte recruitment and extravasation, and much less is known about the potential contribution of anti-adhesive molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that components of the glycocalyx, including heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, are shed in response to injury or cytokine-mediated inflammation13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we speculated that EMCN levels would be reduced in response to TNF-.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this notion, we found that TNF- treatment of HUVECs led to a decrease in EMCN mRNA and surface protein, and an increase in the pro-adhesive molecules E-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A potential mechanism of EMCN downregulation by TNF- is likely to involve binding to the membrane receptors TNF-R55 and TNF-R75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNF-R55 is primarily responsible for the stimulation of leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium by upregulation of adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell surface31, but the role of these membrane receptors in the downregulation of EMCN has not been yet examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TNF- is also known to control the activation of GATA-2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32), a key transcription factor commonly expressed in endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since GATA-2 elements are present in EMCN gene regulatory sequences33, it is tempting to speculate a potential role for GATA-2 in modulating EMCN expression under proinflammatory conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to our results, a previous study has reported increased EMCN expression upon TNF- treatment29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is difficult, however, to draw conclusions from this study, since results were shown in sparse culture conditions, which demonstrated significant variability in the basal level of EMCN expression, protein levels were not shown, and the authors did not determine the statistical significance of the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Motivated by the concept that the endothelial cell glycocalyx has the capacity to prevent leukocyte adhesion to constitutively expressed ICAM-1, we assessed the ability of EMCN to interfere with the pro-adhesive effects of TNF-.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accomplish this, we treated HUVECs that were overexpressing EMCN with TNF- and examined neutrophil adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, overexpression of EMCN prevented neutrophil adhesion to TNF- stimulated HUVECs under a range of physiologically relevant shear stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the accessibility of the eye for study and the fact that several ocular pathologies, including uveitis34,35, diabetic retinopathy36,37 and glaucoma35, have inflammatory components, we generated ocular inflammation to assess the role of EMCN in vivo, and examined the level of EMCN protein in the ciliary body, the primary site of neutrophil infiltration during intraocular inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our in vitro observations, intravitreal injection of TNF- led to decreased of EMCN in the ciliary body within 24 h of treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, overexpression of EMCN dramatically reduced the accumulation of CD45+ cells as well as neutrophils (NIMP-R14+ cells) in the ciliary body following TNF- injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the results in this experimental model, it is tempting to speculate that promoting expression of EMCN to physiological levels would prevent neutrophil extravasation into inflamed tissue, but this question still remains unanswered in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our observations introduce the novel paradigm that the downregulation of anti-adhesive molecules may be as important in transforming the endothelial cell surface to a proinflammatory state as the elevation in adhesive molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our in vivo results provide an exciting new therapeutic option for the manipulation of the inflammatory process.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
