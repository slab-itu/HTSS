IgD attenuates the IgM-induced anergy response in transitional and mature B cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Self-tolerance by clonal anergy of B cells is marked by an increase in IgD and decrease in IgM antigen receptor surface expression, yet the function of IgD on anergic cells is obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we define the RNA landscape of the in vivo anergy response, comprising 220 induced sequences including a core set of 97.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Failure to co-express IgD with IgM decreases overall expression of receptors for self-antigen, but paradoxically increases the core anergy response, exemplified by increased Sdc1 encoding the cell surface marker syndecan-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IgD expressed on its own is nevertheless competent to induce calcium signalling and the core anergy mRNA response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Syndecan-1 induction correlates with reduction of surface IgM and is exaggerated without surface IgD in many transitional and mature B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that IgD attenuates the response to self-antigen in anergic cells and promotes their accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, IgD minimizes tolerance-induced holes in the pre-immune antibody repertoire.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Clonal anergy is an enigmatic mechanism for actively acquired tolerance, a process in which self-reactive cells remain in the lymphocyte repertoire of secondary lymphoid tissues but are deficient in generation of effector progeny1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anergy is best characterized in mouse and human peripheral B cells expressing high cell surface levels of IgD and low levels of IgM B cell receptors (BCR), which account for 1050% of the mature pre-immune B cell repertoire, depending on an arbitrary cut-off for low surface IgM (refs 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retaining anergic B cells bearing self-binding antibodies in the secondary lymphoid organs presents a risk of autoimmunity8, as the diminished proliferation and antibody secretion that characterizes anergic B cells is potentially reversible2,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathological proliferation of B cells that would normally be anergic also leads to common adult malignancies, exemplified by a large subgroup of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cases10, and by the over-representation of B cells using self-reactive VH4-34 heavy chains, which are normally anergic, within the poor prognosis subset of diffuse large B cell lymphoma11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, physiological proliferation of B cells that were initially anergic has been shown to occur when these cells bind a foreign antigen recognized by T-follicular helper cells and produce germinal centre (GC) progeny and IgG antibodies that have been hypermutated away from self-reactivity12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular nature of B cell anergy that precedes any reactivation into proliferation nevertheless remains unresolved, in particular whether or not anergy is explained by binding antigen primarily through IgD antigen receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Anergic cells selectively inhibit trafficking of nascent IgM but not IgD through the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar change in IgM trafficking occurs in malignant B cells in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia15 and during normal maturation of B cells in the spleen16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This altered trafficking may be explained by the IgD juxtamembrane and transmembrane segmentsone of the few evolutionarily conserved domains of IgD (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17)associating preferentially with the CD79 subunits needed for IgM and IgD trafficking and signalling on the cell surface18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immature B cells begin by expressing only IgM, but IgD co-expression progressively increases as they become transitional and mature B cells in the spleen due to increased expression of Zfp318 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22), which facilitates alternative mRNA splicing of the heavy chain variable (VDJH) exon to either IgM or IgD heavy chain constant (C)-region exons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This arrangement is evolutionarily preserved in most species of fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals17,23, yet mice lacking IgD have normal B cell development and only slightly delayed antibody responses24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, comparison of mice that express only IgM or only IgD reveals no discernable difference in the capacity of these alternative receptors to promote B cell development, tolerance, activation or antibody secretion in vivo26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Conflicting results from tissue culture experiments support the idea that IgM and IgD signal differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early experiments suggested that IgM signals drive apoptosis whereas IgD signals induce proliferation, so that immature IgM-only B cells would pass through a window of obligate tolerance susceptibility28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these differences might reflect the use of different antibody ligands to engage IgM and IgD, rather than an intrinsic difference in the receptor isotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In transfected B lymphoma cells, a single haptenated antigen signalled through IgD more strongly and durably than through IgM30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, hen egg lysozyme (HEL) antigen signalling induced CD86 identically through IgD or IgM on splenic B cells expressing one or other isotype21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when the same IgMHEL and IgDHEL BCRs were expressed separately in a pro-B cell line with a partially crippled BLNK (SLP65) intracellular signalling adaptor, soluble monovalent HEL antigen signalled an increase in intracellular calcium when it bound IgM but induced no calcium signalling when it bound IgD, whereas multivalent HEL-antigen signalled through both isotypes31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extrapolating the findings from the BLNK mutant cell line, it was concluded that the predominant expression of IgD on anergic cells prevents any response to monovalent self-antigens, ascribing the in vivo state of anergy to the change in BCR isotype31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we directly address the role of IgD on anergic B cells in vivo with three complementary approaches, by analysing anergic B cells in mice either lacking IgD, with a novel point mutation in IgD, or inactivation of the IgD-splicing factor Zfp318.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find little intrinsic signalling difference between the two receptor isotypes, but IgD has an essential function when co-expressed with IgM, attenuating the in vivo response to self and promoting accumulation of mature anergic B cells to increase their availability to encounter foreign antigens and potentially form GCs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Calcium signalling by IgD and IgM', 'We first tested the proposal that IgD is unable to trigger an acute elevation of intracellular calcium in response to monomeric antigens like soluble HEL (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31), potentially explaining the unresponsive state of anergic B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intracellular calcium increase elicited by monomeric HEL was directly compared in splenic B cells from MM4 and DD6 transgenic mice, which respectively express the IgMHEL or IgDHEL antigen receptors studied in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31 comprising identical variable regions and different constant regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the findings made in BLNK-mutant pro-B cells31, when tested here in mature B cells with normal BLNK both isotypes signalled an acute and sustained calcium response (Fig 1), although the initial rise in calcium was slightly decreased in cells with IgDHEL antigen receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: IgD and IgM both signal intracellular

9% of GC cells averaged across the groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, anergic IgD+ B cells formed more GC progeny than naïve IgD+ counterparts, as observed previously12, but the opposite was observed for anergic B cells without IgD, which formed many fewer GC progeny than their naïve counterparts (orange bar, Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, IgD-deficiency did not alter the number of GC progeny formed from naïve B cells on day 5 (green bar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'IgD promotes accumulation of mature anergic B cells', 'One explanation for the results above was that IgD assists short-lived anergic B cells to survive in the spleen long enough to respond to foreign antigen and T cell help.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this hypothesis, mature CD93CD23+ anergic B cells accumulated to much lower frequency in the spleen of IgD-deficient MM4:ML5 double transgenic animals compared with MD4:ML5 animals (Fig 2f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude differences in transgene integration site between the MD4 and MM4 animals, we also prevented IgD co-expression in MD4:ML5 transgenic mice by breeding with a Zfp318 null allele22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accumulation of anergic mature B cells was diminished in Zfp318/ MD4:ML5 transgenic mice where the B cells only expressed IgMHEL (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'IgD promotes accumulation independently of effects on IgM', 'Diminished accumulation of mature anergic B cells in the experiments above could reflect either a difference between surface IgM and surface IgD in the way they trigger responses to self-antigen, or a loss of

IgM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimit strain (C57BL/6JAnu-Ighddmit/Apb) has acquired a single T greater than A point mutation resulting in an Ile81Lys substitution within the C1 exon (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

 This contrasts with the aberrantly high cell surface IgM on B cells in IgD knockout or Zfp318 knockout mice22,24,25, where IgD no longer competes with IgM for assembly with CD79 (refs 18, 20).

of surface IgD affected mature B cell accumulation independently from IgDs inhibitory effect on surface IgM levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In heterozygous Ighddmit/+mice, allelic exclusion resulted in 50% of

surface IgD for the accumulation of mature B cells relative to immature B cells was observed in the bone marrow, blood and spleen of mixed bone marrow chimeras reconstituted with a mixture of CD45.1 and CD45.2 bone marrow (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 52% decrease in mature B cells with the Ighddmit mutation appears less than the decrease in mature anergic B cells in MD4:ML5 transgenic mice with the Zfp318 mutation or the decrease in MM4:ML5 anergic cells lacking IgD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may reflect the fact that the latter two lose two functions of IgD: surface IgD display and IgD attenuation of surface IgM expression, whereas the Ighddmit mutation selectively disrupts surface IgD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'IgD attenuates anergic B cell mRNA response to self-antigen', 'We next performed a global RNA analysis of MD4 and MM4 naïve and anergic mature B cells to test for any evidence that surface IgD and IgM differ in their capacity to elicit responses to self-antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two variables differ between MD4:ML5 and MM4:ML5 anergic B cells: (1) surface IgM is lower on MD4:ML5 cells because IgD competes with IgM for CD79 assembly and surface expression; (2) the total cell surface pool of antigen-binding receptors is higher on MD4:ML5 cells, because IgD is not downregulated on anergic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The null hypothesis, that there is no difference in the response to self elicited by surface IgM and IgD, would therefore predict that there should be no difference in the induction of anergy RNAs or there should be less induction of some or all anergy RNAs in MM4:ML5 cells because of their 65% fewer receptors for self-antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The opposite resulta higher response to self by some or all of the anergy-induced RNAs in MM4:ML5

of the surface receptors themselves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much higher induction of all anergy genes in MM4:ML5 cells, and little or no response to self-antigen in MD4:ML5 cells, would be predicted based on

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The experiments above advance understanding of self-tolerance and the role of IgD in six ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, they define 220 induced RNA species that provide a comprehensive definition of the anergic state in vivo, enabling future studies of how anergy is distorted by susceptibility genes in autoimmunity or by mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia10 or lymphoma11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the global RNA analysis reveals that IgD differs from IgM by attenuating a large subset of the anergy response to self-antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the results of the RNA analysis and of calcium signalling did not support previous conclusions that IgD signals for B cell activation while IgM signals for tolerance28,29, that IgD signals in a stronger and more sustained way than IgM (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30), nor that IgD is unable to signal to monovalent ligands31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourth, flow cytometric staining for SDC1 reinforces the proposal that IgM downregulation on many B cells in the normal repertoire reflects an active anergic response to self3 and yields a method to analyse and sort anergic B cells without engaging surface IgM with antibodies3,4 nor requiring crosses to a transgenic Nr4a1:GFP reporter strain7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifth, we discover a new mouse mutant that eliminates surface IgD but retains the inhibitory effect of IgD on surface IgM display, and show that the selective loss of surface IgD results in exaggerated induction of SDC1 on IgMlow anergic B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the experiments reveal that IgD promotes accumulation of anergic B cells as mature follicular B cells, thus minimizing tolerance-induced holes in the pre-immune repertoire of antibodies available in secondary lymphoid tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Loss of surface IgD on transitional IgMlow T3 B cells decreases the number of surface BCRs and would be expected to diminish their response to self-antigen if IgM and IgD were functionally equivalent, but paradoxically it increased the anergy response reported by SDC1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasma cells with high levels of SDC1 are absent in Prdm1 (Blimp-1) knockout mice but the subset of SDC1low mature B cells analysed here are not plasma cells because they form independently of Blimp-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41) and have high B220 and CD19 that are both downregulated on plasma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDC1 is also induced on self-reactive B cells binding the Smith ribonucleoprotein37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While MD4 B cells did not express SDC1 in the absence of self-HEL (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37), SDC1 was spontaneously induced on MD4 naïve B cells when their intracellular calcium was chronically elevated by genetic deficiency of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase b (Itpkb)38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated cycles of self-antigen binding in anergic cells raise cytosolic calcium to 100400 nM in an oscillatory manner, and calcium reverts to the 50 nM baseline of naïve B cells when anergic cells are transplanted into recipients lacking the self-antigen40 or when the self-antigen is outcompeted by a non-stimulatory ligand for the BCR (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the range of SDC1 induction between B cells in non-transgenic mice and its correlation with surface IgM downregulation, intracellular calcium is elevated to varying extents among polyclonal B cells in proportion to their expression of an Nr4a1:GFP reporter transgene7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus SDC1 serves as a convenient reporter for the varying degrees of self-reactivity among B cells in the pre-immune repertoire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The attenuated self-antigen response when IgD is coexpressed with IgM in vivo helps clarify earlier conflicting findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small decrease in the proportion of mature B cells was observed comparing a pair of transgenic strains expressing a polyreactive BCR as IgM-only or as IgM and IgD (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, another pair of transgenic mice with a slightly different H-chain V-region displayed more mature B cells when bearing IgM-only than with IgM+IgD, although in these animals transitional IgM-only B cells appeared more susceptible to deletion when exposed to a tolerizing injection of human IgG antigen44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mature B cells were depleted by a tolerizing injection of TNP-dextran in IgM-only IgSP6 transgenic mice, but not when these mice were crossed with an IgD-only IgSP6 transgenic strain so that IgD was co-expressed with IgM (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these results it was hypothesized that IgD attenuates tolerogenic signalling by IgM (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  46), consistent with the findings here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interpretation of these effects was confounded by the absolute requirement for endogenous light chain specificities for IgSP6 B cells to mature, and by rescue of their maturation by injection of TNP-ficoll47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A key question is how much the attenuation of the anergy response by IgD demonstrated here reflects an intrinsic decrease in the ability of IgD to signal in response to self-antigens and how much reflects IgD inhibition of surface IgM for assembly with CD79 and trafficking to the cell surface18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments with the IgD dmit point mutant in Figs 3 and 6 show that exaggerated response to self-antigen still occurs when IgD attenuates surface IgM normally but IgD is no longer expressed on the surface of anergic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus IgD attenuates the response to self-antigen in two ways: IgD is less able to elicit a subset of the response than IgM on the cell surface, and IgD decreases the display of surface IgM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A simple explanation for the decreased signalling by IgD on the surface has recently been proposed based on findings that IgD was unable to signal an acute calcium response by monovalent but not multivalent HEL antigen in a pro-B cell line where the BLNK cytoplasmic signalling adaptor was expressed as an oestrogen receptor-chimera that partially crippled BLNK function by binding to heat shock proteins31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four lines of evidence here indicate this black and white difference between IgD and IgM does not extrapolate to primary B cells with normal BLNK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in primary B cells IgD was capable of inducing an acute calcium response to monomeric HEL in vitro (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial calcium peak was consistently slightly lower in IgDHEL B cells than in IgMHEL B cells, and conceivably this subtle difference may be exaggerated in cells with defective BLNK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, IgD was competent to induce 78% of the anergy-induced RNA species in response to monomeric HEL in vivo, including calcium-induced genes like Egr2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, anergic IgMlow B cells in mice with a normal antibody repertoire make antibodies binding to DNA and other polymeric self-antigens4,6,7, making it unlikely that IgD attenuation of SDC1 on a large fraction of these cells reflects recognition of only monovalent self-antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, IgD appears to acquire the capacity to attenuate the response when it is co-expressed with IgM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might reflect competition between the two receptor isotypes for particular signalling molecules or membrane domains18,19,21,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The need for IgD to promote anergic B cell accumulation in the spleen and blood may represent a mechanism to minimize holes in the antibody repertoire created by self-tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of self-reactive B cells in the bone marrow, either by apoptosis or receptor editing, removes antibody specificities from the repertoire before they can be tested for binding to foreign antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, antibodies on anergic B cells can be hypermutated in germinal centres and selected for variants that have lost binding to self but retain binding to foreign microbes13.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
