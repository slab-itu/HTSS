Regional adaptation defines sensitivity to future ocean acidification  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Physiological responses to temperature are known to be a major determinant of species distributions and can dictate the sensitivity of populations to global warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, little is known about how other major global change drivers, such as ocean acidification (OA), will shape species distributions in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, by integrating population genetics with experimental data for growth and mineralization, physiology and metabolomics, we demonstrate that the sensitivity of populations of the gastropod Littorina littorea to future OA is shaped by regional adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals from populations towards the edges of the natural latitudinal range in the Northeast Atlantic exhibit greater shell dissolution and the inability to upregulate their metabolism when exposed to low pH, thus appearing most sensitive to low seawater pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that future levels of OA could mediate temperature-driven shifts in species distributions, thereby influencing future biogeography and the functioning of marine ecosystems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Populations of the same species from different climatic regions often differ in their ability to withstand altered environmental conditions1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the marine realm, diversification of populations along thermo-latitudinal gradients has been demonstrated for traits related to thermal physiology in several taxonomic groups1,2,3,4,5,6, dispelling the assumption that local adaptation in marine organisms is uncommon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is little evidence as to whether a similar latitudinal trend in sensitivity exists for other environmental drivers, such as elevated partial pressure of CO2 (Pco2)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The anthropogenically driven increase in atmospheric Pco2 is causing a decrease in global ocean pH and altered carbonate chemistry8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In several marine invertebrate species, this combination of chemical changes, collectively known as ocean acidification (OA), has been shown to exert significant effects on organismal life history, ecology and behaviour9,10, and on fundamental physiological processes, resulting in imbalances in acidbase status, a reduction in aerobic scope and a shift in energy budget allocation11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects can reduce physiological performance, growth and reproductive output12 and can increase the risk of local extinction, as has been shown to occur in natural high Pco2 habitats13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These patterns appear to be partly explained by the ability of some taxa to colonize naturally elevated Pco2 areas by exhibiting greater metabolic control and capacity for acidbase regulation14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is some evidence for interpopulation variation in the level of sensitivity to Pco2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17) and adaptation potential to different Pco2 regimes18, there has been no large-scale integrative assessment of this variation along latitudinal gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the current study, we take an integrative approach using data from population genetics, population shell growth and mineralization, physiology and metabolomics to compare the OA responses of different populations of the common intertidal snail Littorina littorea (Linnaeus, 1758) sampled from its geographical range in the Northeast Atlantic (that is, from the Iberian Peninsula to the North of Norway19; see Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six populations were collected from three distinctive climatic regions: (1) warm temperate; (2) cold temperate; and (3) subpolar (Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results altogether suggest that different populations of L. littorea found across its geographical range of extension were differently sensitive to future OA conditions, with populations closer to the range edges being most sensitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, with increased OA, we may predict a further shift and possible reduction in the geographical range of L. littorea, with OA likely modulating in future the species response to ongoing warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, our study points to the fact that information from single population studies should be used with caution when aiming at predicting species global responses to global drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, we may be currently over- or underestimating the impact of different environmental changes in different climatic regions, with this having important implications for the development of directives and policies to promote the preservation of marine biodiversity under the ongoing global change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Genetic structure of Littorina littorea populations.Thermal map of Europe from the POLCOMS-ERSEM biogeochemical model showing sampling locations and genetic structure of the six different populations of L. littorea sampled across the Northwest Atlantic latitudinal gradient (from 42° to 70°): pie chart position indicates location of collection of specimens, from south to north: Vigo (Spain), Île de Ré (France), Roscoff (France), Plymouth (UK), Millport (UK), Trondheim (Norway), Tromsø (Norway).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neighbour-joining population tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pie charts=proportion of common haplotypes (grey), shared between climatic regions (pastel colours, northern=blue, mid=green, southern=pink), private to individual sites (primary colours).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Background image courtesy of NASAs Earth Observatory.Full size image', 'Figure 2: Collection locations for populations of Littorina littorea.Map of Europe (left panel) with the locations (full circles) where populations of the common periwinkle Littorina littorea (Linnaeus, 1758) were collected from along the Western coastline of Europe during June to August 2010.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Horizontal boxes indicate population mean values for temperature (central vertical line) of sea-surface temperature (SST): blue dashed line, and land-surface temperature (LST): red dashed line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The edges define the 25th and 75th percentiles, and error bars represent 95% CI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature data were obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Aeronautics and Space Administration (http://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/) and comprised the mean annual SSTs for the 5-year period 20052009, measured across latitudes from 5.07 to 15.47 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average annual (LSTs were obtained from World Climate (http://www.worldclimate.com/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Map outline courtesy of http://www.d-maps.com/.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Sequence variability and population structure', 'Sequencing of a 598 bp section of COI from 238 individuals revealed 57 haplotypes (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No saturation of substitution was detected in either the entire data set or third codon positions (ISS less_than ISS.C, P less_than 0.001 in both cases, test of substitution saturation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Percent nucleotide composition was C: 21.9, T: 35.6, A: 22.2 and G: 20.2 and no insertions or deletions were detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Base frequencies were found to be homologous among sequences at all sites (2=3.98, P=1.00, 2 test), the 54 variable sites (2=21.59, P=1.00, 2 test) and the third codon sites (2=0.13, P=1.00, 2 test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall nucleotide diversity and haplotype diversity were both low and did not differ substantially among sampling sites (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 57 haplotypes detected, two haplotypes (Ll2 and Ll4) were the most common and found at all sites, in most cases constituting over 45% of the total individuals surveyed at each site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the case of the Norwegian sites, Ll1 was the most numerous haplotype present, comprising over 62% of the individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, 36 of the 57 haplotypes identified were exclusive (private) to a single sampling site (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of the private haplotypes occurred at low numbers, with only a few individuals present at each sampling site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The sampled populations had a high level of genetic structuring (Fig 1 and Supplementary Figs 1 and 2), with a clear genetic difference between the two subpolar and all other sites (FST values, P less_than 0.05, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) test; Supplementary Table 2) and between the climatic regions (CT=0.140, P less_than 0.005, AMOVA test; Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Metabolic responses under current PCO2 conditions', 'These genetic differences appeared to be related to the physiology of populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Snails maintained under current Pco2 conditions showed a linear decline in mean metabolic rates (Fig 3a) and mean metabolomic profiles (Figs 3c, 4 and 5) with increasing latitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the presence of a positive linear relationship between mean population metabolomic PC1 scores and metabolic rate under control PCO2 conditions (r5=0.084, P=0.019, best-fit regression approach, see Fig 3) suggests the existence of a clear mechanistic link between cellular and whole-organism responses (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relationship suggests the adaptation of the cellular physiology underpinning the observed whole-organism metabolic rate adaptation along the latitudinal cline investigated (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a linear positive relationship between mean population metabolic rate and ATP+ADP levels under control PCO2 (r5=0.77, P=0.041, best-fit regression approach, y=427.820 × 1.078) further corroborate this idea, specifically suggesting the existence of a positive relationship between metabolic rate levels and cellular energy levels20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subpolar (Norwegian) populations had the most divergent metabolomic profiles (Fig 4a,b) with lower concentrations of homarine and ATP+ADP but higher concentrations of leucine, valine, glutamate, glutamine and formate compared with other sites (for formate and ATP+ADP see Fig 5b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amino acids are used extensively in energy metabolism21 and can function as an alternative carbon source in the citric acid cycle when ATP has been exhausted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratios of adenylates and amino acids seen here could indicate changes that have occurred in the underlying metabolic machinery of northern populations that have allowed snails to adapt metabolically to cooler climates (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in marine molluscs, homarine and branched chain amino acids (such as leucine and valine) also underpin processes related to acidbase balance and immune function that are intertwined with energy metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, glutamate has been highlighted as a possible excitatory neurotransmitter in molluscs22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data suggest that compared with more southerly populations, subpolar snails significantly upregulate a host of physiological systems, including metabolism and acidbase balance and immune and neurological function to help maintain homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the trends observed under present-day PCO2 levels suggest that populations are metabolically adapted to the different environmental conditions found along the latitudinal cline investigated (Figs 1 and 3a,b)1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Physiological responses of Littorina littorea populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Mean metabolic rate plotted against the latitude of each population, current Pco2, best-fit regression approach r5=0.97, P less_than 0.001, y=0.049x+4.880, elevated Pco2, r5=0.76, P=0.047, y=0.004x2+0.393x7.644;

the Vigo population showed a significant decrease in ATP (or ADP) concentrations that is of fundamental importance for central metabolism25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Shell responses under different PCO2 conditions', 'In order to determine whether differences in metabolic rates and metabolomic profiles following exposure to OA conditions were accompanied by changes in life-history responses26, growth and (empty) shell dissolution and mineralization status27 were examined in the six populations investigated (Fig 6, Supplementary Figs 35 and Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under current Pco2 conditions there was no relationship between growth rate and latitude (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, under elevated Pco2, mean growth was significantly negative (between 0.45 and 3.60%) across all populations (Fig 6a), with this decrease being most pronounced in subpolar and warm-temperate populations (mean reduction 3.25%) compared with cold-temperate populations (0.46%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tests of mean passive dissolution on empty shells showed that dissolution and net growth levels were generally comparable in warm- and cold-temperate populations, but were 2.54 times greater in subpolar populations (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that differences in the amount of mean shell loss across populations (Fig 6b) cannot be wholly explained on the basis of differences in mean shell mineral status (that is, original concentration and ratios for shell Ca2+, Mg2+ and Sr2+) nor responses to elevated PCO2 (Supplementary Figs 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure to elevated PCO2 led to a change in empty shell mineral content of L. littorea, although responses varied among populations (see Supplementary Fig 3), as indicated by the presence of a significant interaction between the factors latitudinal position and PCO2 for Ca2+ and Sr2+ (see Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In more detail, snails from Roscoff (48.73°) showed the lowest Sr2+ following exposure to elevated PCO2, whereas snails in Trondheim (63.45°) showed the least change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the populations in Millport (55.73°) and Tromsø (69.62°) showed the highest Ca2+ after exposure to PCO2, whereas snails from Roscoff (48.73°) showed the least change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shell Mg2+ and K+ were significantly lower in snail exposed to elevated PCO2 and both significantly decreased with increasing latitude (Supplementary Fig 3 and Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio Mg2+:Ca2+ and Ca2+:Sr2+ in shells of L. littorea decreased and increased significantly following exposure to elevated PCO2 respectively, but differently in different population as indicated by the presence of a significant interaction between the factors latitudinal position and PCO2 (see Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the Mg2+:Sr2+ ratio showed a significant decrease with increasing latitude, equally for control and acidified conditions (Supplementary Fig 4 and Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the presence of a significantly negative relationship between ATP and shell Mg2+, K+, Mg2+:Ca2+ and Mg2+:Sr2+ (Supplementary Fig 5), which appeared comparable at both control and elevated PCO2 conditions, could suggest that differences may exist in the way shells are built and in the costs associated with mineralization in each of the different populations of L. littorea (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Relationship between latitude and growth of L. littorea populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Mean total snail weight, current Pco2, best-fit regression approach r5=0.66, P=0.104, y=0.008x20.867x+27.242, elevated Pco2, r5=0.98, P less_than 0.001, y=0.016x2+1.753x48.143.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Mean empty shell weight, current Pco2, best-fit regression approach r5=0.85, P=0.016, y=0.011x2+1.210x32.369, elevated Pco2, r5=0.93, P=0.002, y=0.030x2+2.910x72.874.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Growth effort (mean total snail weightmean empty shell weight), current Pco2, best-fit regression approach r5=0.54, P=0.212, y=0.004x2+0.340x5.130, elevated Pco2, r5=0.91, P=0.004, y=0.010x21.150x+24.730.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population mean data, n=6;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
"Together, the findings of this study suggest that the relative sensitivity of different populations of L. littorea to future OA are likely to vary considerably across its geographical range of extension in the Northeast Atlantic through local and regional adaptation, with populations closer to the range edges being most sensitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If OA selects against these sensitive, range-edge genotypes, it could cause a reduction of genetic diversity levels that could have far-reaching consequences for the ability of these populations to respond and further adapt to other local and global stressors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, with increased OA, we may predict a further shift and possible reduction in the geographical range of L. littorea, as genotypes closer to the range edge appear at greater risk of extinction based on their specific metabolic abilities36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genotypes could be replaced by central population genotypes, particularly towards the northern edge where snails appear to be metabolically less competent to deal with OA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the negative relationship between seawater pH and latitude37 may mean that southern genotypes would require to migrate southward in order to compensate for the negative effects of OA8, although this seems unlikely given the negative impact of global warming that has already caused a northward migration of L. littorea populations at this species' southern range edge38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the negative effects of OA on L. littorea, a keystone species in rocky intertidal habitats, may have negative repercussions on the structure, dynamics and functioning of intertidal communities and ecosystems across the North Atlantic39,40, particularly towards the range edges of its distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'In conclusion, single population studies should be used with caution when aiming to predict species and community responses to global environmental drivers, such as OA, as phenotypic variation between populations may be considerable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, modellers, conservationists, environmental managers, stakeholders and policy makers should be aware of the pitfalls of developing predictions, directives and policies solely based on single population observations, as has so far been the case41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that the effects of environmental changes on species may currently be over- or underestimated in different regions, particularly as, historically, most research is conducted in cold-temperate areas43, despite polar and tropical species remaining the most vulnerable to climate change44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of which populations and genotypes will be more resilient to global change and which ones will be most at risk of extinction will improve conservation efforts and management of natural resources, if marine biodiversity and ecosystem functions are ultimately to be preserved39,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This will be facilitated by the use of an integrated approach, as demonstrated in this study.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Species distribution and specimen collection', 'The common periwinkle L. littorea (Linnaeus, 1758) is an intertidal gastropod that has a wide latitudinal distribution along the coasts of the North Atlantic, between 42 and 70°N in the eastern North Atlantic (from the Iberian peninsula to the White Sea) and between 38 and 41°N in the Western North Atlantic (from southern New Jersey to northern Labrador)19,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A total of six populations living along the European coastline of the north-east Atlantic from three distinctive climatic regions (that is, (1) warm temperate, (2) cold temperate and (3) subpolar) were sampled for this study covering a latitudinal range of 28° (4270°), from Vigo in northern Spain to Tromsø in northern Norway, a distance of 3,780 km (Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During JuneSeptember 2010, adults of L. littorea were collected by hand from the intertidal zone of rocky shores at low tide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 250 adult individuals (shell width 1215 mm) were collected per site and transported to the Marine Biology and Ecology Research Centre at Plymouth University (Plymouth, UK) within 48 h of collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before transport, live snails were placed into rectangular plastic containers (20 × 20 × 12 cm) with a perforated lid with 25 holes (ø 10 mm) to allow air circulation and reduce overheating during transportation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 5075 individual snails were placed in each container with damp seaweed (Fucus serratus) to prevent desiccation and mechanical damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No mortality was recorded during transport and snails were in good condition with normal activity levels upon arrival at the laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once in the laboratory, snails and algae were transferred to aerated filtered sea water (pH 8.01, salinity 35, 15 °C) and maintained for 14 days in four plastic aquaria (56 l, a maximum of 75 individuals per aquarium) before transfer to the experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourteen days of exposure to laboratory conditions was considered sufficient to standardize the snails physiological condition following any stress from collection and transportation, and to minimize any environmental signature resulting from the local conditions at the collection site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specimens were fed every second day ad libitum on F. serratus and 50% seawater volume was replaced every 4 days to maintain stable salinity and pH conditions and to eliminate any accumulated ammonia20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All specimens were kept in a temperature-controlled room (12:12 h light/dark regime) at 15 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the genetic distinctiveness of the populations of L. littorina investigated (Fig 1), we cannot discount the possibility that the patterns observed in the snails physiology were generated by exposing northern populations at an experimental temperature (15 °C) that is at the upper end of their natural range of seawater temperatures experienced (particularly for the Tromsø population), but not of air temperatures (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both these Norwegian populations possess metabolomics fingerprints and metabolic rates (Fig 3a,b) that are similar to each other, despite snails from these two populations experiencing thermal regimes that are somewhat different (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

15 °C did not cause bias by stressing the northernmost population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because of logistical limitations, population collection was staggered by a week so that no more than two
