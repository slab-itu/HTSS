Selective labelling and eradication of antibiotic-tolerant bacterial populations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Drug resistance and tolerance greatly diminish the therapeutic potential of antibiotics against pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibiotic tolerance by bacterial biofilms often leads to persistent infections, but its mechanisms are unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a proteomics approach, pulsed stable isotope labelling with amino acids (pulsed-SILAC), to quantify newly expressed proteins in colistin-tolerant subpopulations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms (colistin is a last-resort antibiotic against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migration is essential for the formation of colistin-tolerant biofilm subpopulations, with colistin-tolerant cells using type IV pili to migrate onto the top of the colistin-killed biofilm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colistin-tolerant cells employ quorum sensing (QS) to initiate the formation of new colistin-tolerant subpopulations, highlighting multicellular behaviour in antibiotic tolerance development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The macrolide erythromycin, which has been previously shown to inhibit the motility and QS of P. aeruginosa, boosts biofilm eradication by colistin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work provides insights on the mechanisms underlying the formation of antibiotic-tolerant populations in bacterial biofilms and indicates research avenues for designing more efficient treatments against biofilm-associated infections.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics can be severely crippled by two major bacterial defence strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resistance occurs when bacteria acquire genetic mutations or mobile genetic elements that enable growth under conditions of constant antibiotic exposure1, while tolerance is mediated by transient phenotypic variations (based on protein expression) that enable bacteria to survive exposures to the highest deliverable doses of antibiotics2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the current view is that development of tolerance is intrinsically linked to the biofilm lifestyle, early experiments conducted on bacteria in the planktonic lifestyle revealed that tolerance can develop to a number of stresses including antibiotics4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to the planktonic mode of life, biofilms are sessile, densely populated multicellular communities embedded in biopolymeric matrix components6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major advantage for bacteria that aggregate into biofilms is that a multitude of matrix components and physiological states offers additional levels of protection against immune defences and antibiotics, which cannot be obtained in the planktonic growth mode7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is widely accepted that pathogenic bacteria in the biofilm mode significantly contribute to the development of nosocomial infections as they are colonizing hospital settings and chronic infection sites, where they represent a serious threat to public health6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial cells differentiate into several physiologically distinct subpopulations within a biofilm10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibiotic treatment often eradicates sensitive subpopulations, but leaves small antibiotic-tolerant subpopulations behind, resulting in recurring infections after antibiotic treatment has been stopped10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibiotic-tolerant bacterial cells are variants of wild-type cells that can revert back to the wild type when antimicrobial treatment has ceased11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their transient nature and low abundance make it difficult to investigate their tolerance-related physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With only a few studies that have investigated planktonic antibiotic-tolerant cells by pre-isolating them using flow cytometry12,13,14,15, the mechanisms underlying the formation of antibiotic-tolerant subpopulation in biofilms have remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these pre-isolation-based strategies are destructive and not feasible for studying the antibiotic-tolerant subpopulations in biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This prompted us to develop an alternative, high-resolution -omics approach to simultaneously characterize the physiologies of sensitive and antibiotic-tolerant subpopulations in biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms biofilm with extreme tolerance to antibiotics in nosocomial infections, such as pneumonia and surgical site infections, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to classify P. aeruginosa under serious-threat level (http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America to declare it as one of the six top-priority dangerous, drug-resistant microbes16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colistin is a last-resort polymyxin antibiotic available for treatment of infections caused by drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P. aeruginosa biofilms in flow chambers develop colistin-tolerant cells rapidly and these cells feature high expression levels of the pmr operon18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we observe the dynamic development of drug-tolerant subpopulations in P. aeruginosa biofilms after treatment with colistin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain knowledge about the physiology of the colistin-tolerant biofilm cells, we apply pulsed stable isotope labelling with amino acids (pulsed-SILAC) proteomics method to selectively quantify the newly expressed proteins that incorporate and are thus labelled with heavy C13 lysine, to promote understanding of the colistin-tolerant subpopulation physiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colistin-tolerant populations are able to migrate to the top of the dead biofilm by employing type IV pili-dependent motility and initiate formation of new biofilm via quorum sensing (QS)-regulated group activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synergistic treatment by use of erythromycin, which can inhibit QS and motility with colistin, is able to boost the elimination of P. aeruginosa biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our study provides key insights in developing novel treatments against biofilm-associated infections, which otherwise prove hard to eradicate.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results and Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Development of colistin-tolerant subpopulations in biofilms', 'We monitored the development of live and dead subpopulations of P. aeruginosa biofilms after exposure to colistin in real-time by using time series confocal image acquisition as well as enumeration of viable cells with colony forming units (c.f.u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  per ml).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colistin exposure of P. aeruginosa wild-type biofilms tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) led to a sudden reduction in cell viability according to the propidium iodide (PI) dead staining (Fig 1a and Supplementary Movies 1 and 2) and c.f.u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  per ml counting (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we noticed that a few P. aeruginosa cells localized at the substratum of the biofilms remained alive even after 24 h of colistin treatment (Fig 1a), which might result from the heterogeneous compositions/structures of the exopolymeric matrix materials19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain exopolymeric matrix components might act as physical barriers and reduce the penetration of colistin into deep part of biofilms21, which allows a few biofilm cells at the substratum to survive and acquire colistin tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The migration and formation of colistin-tolerant subpopulations in biofilm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) P. aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type biofilms were treated with minimal medium containing 10 g ml1 colistin followed by real-time CLSM observation from 2 to 32 h of treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 50 m. Colistin-tolerant cells in P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms migrated onto the dead biofilm and formed a live colistin-tolerant biofilm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Culture medium flow through on top of the biofilms from the top of image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments were performed in triplicate, and a representative image for each condition is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live cells appear green, whereas dead cells appear red or yellow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Videos of the migration and formation of colistin-tolerant biofilm are available in online Supplementary Videos 1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) C.f.u.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  per ml of the PAO1 biofilms after 0, 6, 24 and 48 h of colistin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The means and s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from three experiments were shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Movement trajectories and track displacement of live colistin-tolerant cell aggregates moving onto the dead biofilm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Culture medium flow through on top of the biofilms from top of image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 10 m.Full size image', 'Interestingly, we observed that colistin-tolerant subpopulations were able to migrate towards the top of the large microcolonies of dead P. aeruginosa biofilm cells (Fig 1a,b and Supplementary Movies 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracking of colistin-tolerant cell aggregates close to the large microcolonies revealed that those aggregates moved towards the dead microcolonies (Fig 1c and Supplementary Movies 3 and 4)a migration that was unrelated to the flow direction of the culture medium (from top to bottom of the image).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, single colistin-tolerant cells far away from the large microcolonies appeared randomly distributed (Fig 1c and Supplementary Movies 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggested that migration of colistin-tolerant cell aggregates towards large microcolonies of dead biofilm cells was a coordinated process that might involve specific signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Colistin-tolerant cells obtained from biofilms only showed transient expression of the pmr operon (Supplementary Fig 1a) and lost their colistin tolerance after overnight culturing in ABTGC medium containing no colistin (Supplementary Fig 1b,c), supporting our view that the colistin-tolerant cells were the result of phenotypic variation and not per se resistant cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA sequencing of the biofilms with and without colistin treatment showed that there was no convergent non-synonymous mutation gained by the three colistin-treated biofilm populations compared with the control biofilm populations (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of motile colistin-tolerant subpopulations in biofilms has major clinical implications as they can result in persistent infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using pulsed-SILAC to study colistin-tolerant subpopulations', 'To further understand the process that caused the directed motility and formation of colistin-tolerant biofilm subpopulations, we further used the pulsed-SILAC quantitative proteomic approach, with the aim of studying new proteins abundance in the colistin-tolerant subpopulations formed by P. aeruginosa biofilms after a high-dose colistin treatment (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the actively expressed proteins in the colistin-tolerant subpopulations provided the survival advantages to the bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SILAC is a simple and fast but powerful in vivo method, commonly used for eukaryotes to label proteins for mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this method had been used in labelling prokaryotes to compare biofilm and planktonic cells23,24, pulsed-SILAC had never been employed to determine new proteins abundance in the antibiotic-sensitive and -tolerant subpopulations coexisting in the same bacterial biofilm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Workflow of pulsed-SILAC proteome analysis of antibiotic-tolerant and -sensitive subpopulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Biofilms were grown in medium containing C12 L-lysine for 72 h and were then treated with medium containing 10 g ml1 colistin for 6 h to allow the development of colistin-tolerant cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colistin-tolerant subpopulations were then treated with medium containing C13 L-lysine and 10 g ml1 colistin to label the tolerant cells with C13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were collected, and pulsed-SILAC proteome analysis was conducted to determine the protein abundance in the colistin-tolerant cells in which the new synthesized proteins are tagged with C13 L-lysine, while the proteome of colistin-susceptible biofilm cells contain the normal C12 L-lysine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downregulated: lowly expressed proteins in the colistin-tolerant cells (b);

After killing the antibiotic-sensitive population, the remaining surviving antibiotic-tolerant cells were then treated with fresh medium containing colistin and C13 L-lysine for 48 h to incorporate C13 L-lysine into the newly expressed proteins of only live cells (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This pulsed-labelling approach allowed for selective tagging of newly expressed proteins in the antibiotic-tolerant subpopulations, with C13 L-lysine without prior physical isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of new protein abundance could be normalized by dividing the relative abundances of C13 L-lysine-tagged proteins (proteins expressed after colistin treatment) with the relative abundances of C12 L-lysine-tagged proteins (proteins expressed before colistin treatment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used Q Exactive MS to analyse the pulsed-SILAC labelled samples, followed by the MaxQuant and Andromeda software25,26 to identify 4,250 P. aeruginosa proteins with  less_than 1% false discovery rate (FDR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only proteins that were significantly and consistently changed/regulated in three biological replicates (variability  less_than 30%) were shortlisted for further analysis (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lowly and highly expressed proteins in the colistin-tolerant subpopulation as compared with the colistin-sensitive population are functionally grouped in Fig 2b,c, respectively, while the complete list of lowly and highly expressed proteins are listed in Supplementary Data 3 and 4, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our initial analysis of the data showed that some of the actively expressed proteins were subunits of ribosomes (Supplementary Data 4), supporting the notion that colistin-tolerant cells are metabolically active27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the bifunctional polymyxin-resistance proteins ArnA and PmrA were expressed at a high level in antibiotic-tolerant cells (Supplementary Data 2, markers intensity sheet: ArnA (intensity L:H=1.51E+10:4.58E+10); PmrA (intensity L:H=5.26E+09:1.12E+10)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arnBCADTEF lipopolysaccharide-modification operon had been shown to be controlled by the upstream pmr operon and contribute to the tolerance to polymyxin B and colistin in P. aeruginosa28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, both proteins served as positive controls and showed that pulsed-SILAC was highly reliable in detecting proteins important in colistin tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two markers were consistently detected with high abundance level in the heavy C13 lysine-labelled proteins in seven out of eight technical replicates of the three biological replicates except in BR1:R2, where ArnA was not detected in the light C12 condition, and PmrA was not detected in both H and L conditions due to technical variation (Supplementary Data 2, markers intensity sheet).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The missing detection of marker proteins in BR1:R2 might be attributed to growth variations during biofilm cultivation as biofilm experiments normally require a long cultivation period (5 days).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pili and QS led to colistin tolerance', 'Interestingly, we found that antibiotic-tolerant subpopulations also expressed proteins required for type IV pili assembly, such as PilF (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29, at high levels (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we hypothesized that type IV pili are required for the migration of colistin-tolerant cell aggregates onto the dead microcolonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migration of colistin-tolerant subpopulations was decreased in biofilms formed by the type IV pili mutant, pilA (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complementation of pilA with pDA2, a plasmid containing the pilA gene in a pUCP18 vector, restored the antibiotic-tolerant phenotype (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: The role of pili and QS in the development of antibiotic-tolerant subpopulations in biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Biofilms were cultivated for 72 h using P. aeruginosa PAO1, pilA, pilA/pDA2, lasIrhlI, lasIrhlI+OdDHL and pilAlasRrhlR strains, followed by treatment with medium containing 10 g ml1 colistin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No migration of tolerant subpopulation was observed for pilA mutant biofilms, and the majority of the cells in pilA biofilms were killed by colistin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complementation of pilA with pDA2 restored the antibiotic-tolerant subpopuation development after colistin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QS-defective lasIrhlI mutant biofilms could only develop small amount of antibiotic-tolerant subpopulation after colistin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of OdDHL partially restored the development of antibiotic-tolerant subpopulation after colistin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pili and QS-defective pilAlasRrhlR mutant biofilms were unable to develop antibiotic-tolerant subpopulation after colistin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central images show horizontal optical sections, whereas the flanking images show vertical optical sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live cells appear green and dead cells appear red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 50 m.
