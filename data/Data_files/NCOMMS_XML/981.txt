Image-guided genomics of phenotypically heterogeneous populations reveals vascular signalling during symbiotic collective cancer invasion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Phenotypic heterogeneity is widely observed in cancer cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, to probe this heterogeneity, we developed an image-guided genomics technique termed spatiotemporal genomic and cellular analysis (SaGA) that allows for precise selection and amplification of living and rare cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SaGA was used on collectively invading 3D cancer cell packs to create purified leader and follower cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leader cell cultures are phenotypically stable and highly invasive in contrast to follower cultures, which show phenotypic plasticity over time and minimally invade in a sheet-like pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic and molecular interrogation reveals an atypical VEGF-based vasculogenesis signalling that facilitates recruitment of follower cells but not for leader cell motility itself, which instead utilizes focal adhesion kinase-fibronectin signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While leader cells provide an escape mechanism for followers, follower cells in turn provide leaders with increased growth and survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support a symbiotic model of collective invasion where phenotypically distinct cell types cooperate to promote their escape.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A single tumour can harbour distinct genetic and epigenetic cellular subpopulations that drive tumour initiation and progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This intratumor heterogeneity is proposed to be one of the major confounding factors of treatment causing relapse and poor clinical outcome1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic instability and epigenetic modifications generate intratumor heterogeneity2,3,4,5,6,7 creating distinct genetic and epigenetic subpopulations or clones5,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A branched tumour evolutionary architecture can emerge12,13 containing the plasticity to progress under harsh environmental conditions and thwart therapeutic attempts to eradicate the tumour2,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can be argued that until we discover how intratumor heterogeneity can be circumvented, precision oncology initiatives may fall short of expectations2,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Single cell sequencing methodologies17,18,19 have improved the genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic resolution of clonal tumour populations; however, the phenotypic implications of these alterations remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is partly due to experimental challenges and is compounded by phenotypic plasticity that allows cancer cells to adapt to local changes in the microenvironment, without changes to the genome itself (for example, epithelial to mesenchymal transition20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite repeated observations that a small number of rare cancer cells or clones, hidden within a larger tumour population can drive tumour growth and spread11,21,22,23,24,25,26, studies linking single cell or clonal phenotypes with genomic data have been limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To probe the biology of a rare and phenotypically heterogeneous cell populations, single cells or subclones need to be isolated based upon user-defined criteria, instead of a random isolation approach; therefore, we developed a technique to image live cells within a biologically relevant three dimensional (3D) environment, select a cell or cellular group based upon user-defined criteria, extract the cell(s) and subject the cell(s) to genomic and molecular analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, we can purify, amplify and systematically dissect the biologies of rare cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique, termed spatiotemporal genomic and cellular analysis (SaGA), was used to dissect the phenotypic heterogeneity of collective cancer cell invasion in a 3D lung cancer model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data incorporate the first SaGA-derived leader and follower cell lines to reveal that leader cells utilize atypical vasculogenesis signalling machinery by secreting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to attract follower cells in invasive cell chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, follower cells support leader cell growth by increasing their mitotic efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relationship argues for a cellular symbiosis within the collective invasion pack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these data provide proof of concept that SaGA is a powerful technology for dissecting phenotypic heterogeneity within cancer cell populations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

leader cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditioned media from leader cells was sufficient to promote the motility of follower cells (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that leader cells can

however, VEGFA addition was not able to stimulate follower invasion in 3D (Supplementary Fig 5C), suggesting that the leader cells themselves are necessary to promote follower invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we probed if blocking VEGF signalling could impact leader cell influence on follower motility and invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An inhibitory anti-VEGF antibody was added to leader cell conditioned media that bathed 2D follower cell cultures, which was to sufficient to inhibit leader cell stimulation of follower cell motility (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if this is observed during 3D collective invasion, the anti-VEGF antibody was added to mixed spheroids with 90% followers and 10% mCherry-leaders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control-treated cells, mCherry-leader cells were observed at the tip of 80% of invasive chains (Fig 4e); however, anti-VEGF treatment abolishes chain formation, and the percentage of chains positive for mCherry-leaders decreased to 20% (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chain invasion was significantly reduced in parental spheroids with anti-VEGF treatment, knockdown of VEGFR2 (KDR) or treatment with the VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor, ZM323881 (Fig 4f,g and Supplementary Fig 5EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, leader cell invasion itself was not dependent on VEGF signalling, as the total number of leader cells found in the entire invasive area (that is, independent of location within the invasive area) was not significantly reduced in the mixed spheroids (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, purified leader spheroids remained highly invasive with anti-VEGF treatment (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized this may be due to expression of VEGFR1 decoy receptor, since leader cells had increased levels of VEGFR1 mRNA (Flt1; Fig 4a and Supplementary Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leader cells have significantly more VEGFR1 expression when compared to follower cells (Fig 4h and Supplementary Fig 5D), supporting the concept that VEGFR1 decoy receptor could dampen VEGF autocrine signalling in leader cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We probed other mechanisms controlling tip-stalk cell maintenance during vasculogenesis and found that VE-cadherin, the major cadherin that links endothelial cells during vasculogenesis, is highly expressed in leader cells but not in follower cells (Supplementary Figs 6A,B and 9), suggesting that leaderfollower cell:cell contacts are maintained by VE-cadherin but followerfollower cell:cell contacts are not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also focused on canonical Notch-Dll4 signalling28 during collective invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notch protein is highly expressed in follower cells but not in leader cells, while Dll4 is expressed in leader but not follower cells (Supplementary Fig 6CE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mimics tip-stalk cell expression patterning during vasculogenesis, further supporting the concept of a vascular mimicry during collective cell invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe if Notch1 acts as a leader cell-suppressing signal, similar to its role in regulating tip cell formation in vasculogenesis28,29, we utilized the -secretase inhibitor RO4929097, which inhibits Notch1 activity (Supplementary Figs 6F and 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, inhibition of Notch1 signalling via RO4929097 treatment did not promote the leader cell phenotype as observed in other models30 but instead, blocked chain invasion in H1299 parental spheroids (Supplementary Fig 6G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the role of Notch1 in follower cells in our system must differ from its canonical role in tip cell formation and we therefore tested whether follower cells may utilize Notch signalling to promote proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result showed that treatment with RO4929097 significantly decreased follower cell growth (Supplementary Fig 6H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data taken together suggest that leaderfollower cells utilize a non-canonical vascular signalling program to promote formation of the invasion chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fibronectin-FAK signalling drives leader cell invasion', 'Transcriptome data showed significant changes in cell adhesion pathways between leader and follower cells;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'SaGA combines microscopy, cell biology and genomics to isolate and amplify phenotypically distinct subpopulations within a larger, heterogeneous population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique lies at an emerging intersection of cell biology and genomics by combining single cell analysis with unbiased genomic datasets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that SaGA can be used to isolate selected cells from phenotypically heterogeneous populations, including highly proliferative cells, drug-resistant cells or other microscopy-amenable phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, since a protein can be Dendra2-tagged (as opposed to palmitoylation-tagged Dendra2 used here), subcellular localization could also be a stratifying phenotype to select cells with specific protein localizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used SaGA here to probe the biological mechanisms that guide the phenotypic heterogeneity found in collectively cancer invasion (reviewed in refs 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leader cell phenotype is stable over many generations of culture and maintains an invasive and networked morphology when compared to follower or parental cells (Fig 2); therefore, leader cells are a stable phenotype and lack the phenotypic plasticity to revert back to a non-invasive phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not observe follower cells taking on a leader cell position during collective invasion, which is in contrast to 2D wounding studies where leader cells are replaced35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our studies, follower cells revert back to the parental phenotype (that is, gain collective invasion chains) suggesting that follower cells have greater phenotypic plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that leader cells are a specialized invasive cellular population, where phenotypic heterogeneity could be hardwired into their genome or epigenome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by previous studies that have found a specialized keratin-14 positive subpopulation capable of pioneering collective invasion in breast cancer36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, recent work shows that a distinct epigenetic state of a breast tumour cellular subpopulation promotes a transition to a more invasive cooperative cell invasion phenotype where canonical mesenchymal markers were insufficient to mark leader cells37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, leader cells here also lack a complete EMT signature (Fig 2), supporting the concept that invasive cancer cells can have partial EMT phenotypes that generate phenotypic plasticity38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our transcriptomic data of SaGA-derived cell populations show several significant pathways enriched in leader or follower cells, including VEGF and adhesion signalling (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGF signalling was an attractive candidate since leaderfollower collective invasion morphologically resembles VEGF-driven vascular sprouting39, which utilizes a leader-like tip cell and follower stalk cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support a model that resembles, but is not identical to, vascular sprouting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leader cells secrete VEGFA, which is necessary for collective invasion pack formation, but not leader cell motility itself (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this differs from the endothelial cell vascular sprouting where a tip cell chemotaxes along a VEGF gradient through a hypoxic microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leaderfollower chain mimics the expression pattern of canonical Notch-Dll4 endothelial cell expression patterns28, further supporting the concept of a vascular signalling mimicry; however, Notch1 expression in follower cells does not appear to repress the leader phenotype, as is observed in canonical stalk cell maintenance28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, in our case, inhibiting Notch1 reduces collective chain invasion (Supplementary Fig 6), suggesting an atypical vascular signalling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other reports have described a tumour cell vascular mimicry where cancer cells upregulate endothelial-like gene expression programs to form vessel-like structures that act as a functioning blood supply40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vessel-like structures were not observed here but this possibility cannot be ruled out in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, while VEGFA is required for pack formation, the actual motility of leader cells is instead dependent upon the traction force generated by fibronectin-FAK signalling (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibronectin itself has been classically linked to cell invasion42,43, and leader cells secrete fibronectin at significantly higher levels than followers, and fibronectin is required for leader cell motility (Fig 5 and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, this supports a model where formation of the collective invasion pack is VEGF dependent and utilizes vascular signalling components, but motility itself requires fibronectin-FAK signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One important question is why do cancer cells invade as a collective pack as opposed to single cells?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One potential answer is that the multi-cellular pack provides a survival or invasive advantage to escaping cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In circulating tumour cells, cells that invaded as groups had greater success and worse clinical outcomes44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, studies show that tumour cell clusters rather than single cells seed polyclonal metastases in mouse models44,46,47,48, supporting the concept of collective invasion and/or metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that leader cells are competent to invade, even when follower cells are absent; however, when co-cultured with followers, leader cells almost always invade with follower cells, suggesting that pack migration is preferred to single cell migration (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that followers provide a growth advantage to leader cells by increasing leader cell colony formation (Fig 6 and Supplementary Fig 8) and correcting their mitotic defects (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data argue for a symbiotic relationship between leader and follower cells, where the follower cell secretome improves leader cell mitotic success and leader cells provide followers with an escape mechanism (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, LCM caused follower cell death and inhibited their colony formation (Figs 6 and 7), suggesting leader cells impact follower cell growth dynamics, perhaps to maintain the leader cell lineage within the greater cellular population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, how a follower cell secreted factor(s) impacts leader cell growth and mitosis remains an area of interest, where pathways related to growth factor signalling49,50,51 could be candidates for impacting cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Model of cell symbiosis during collective cancer cell invasion.A collective invasion pack shows phenotypic heterogeneity consisting of at least two subpopulations, a highly invasive leader cell (red) at the front of the pack and follower cells (green) immediately attached to and following the leader cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leader cell has increased VEGFA secretion, which promotes the motility and invasion of the follower cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other vasculogenesis signalling molecules are also utilized in the cell:cell communication between leader and follower cells, including VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VE-cadherin and Notch1 (not shown in the model for brevity); This atypical VEGF-based signalling allows for successful chain formation during invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitantly, leader cells secrete excess fibronectin, which activates the canonical integrin/FAK pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway allows for leader cells to create force to move the invasive pack forward into the microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, follower cells are a highly proliferative population that promote leader cell growth via a secreted factor, whereas leader cells secrete a factor that hinders follower cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support a symbiotic relationship in the collective invasion pack in which the follower cells promote leader cell survival and leader cells promote follower cell escape.Full size image', 'Symbiosis usually involves a mutually beneficial relationship between different organisms52; in this case however, the benefit occurs between two phenotypically distinct cellular populations within the collective invasion unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Symbiosis in cancer has been proposed where cells cooperate to promote survival53, especially in the context of heterogeneous subclonal populations (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in a zebrafish melanoma model show that heterogeneous tumour cell populations cooperate to drive melanoma progression54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, in a mouse xenograft model, inter-clonal cooperation occurs where tumour growth is driven by a minor cell subpopulation55, and in breast cancer mouse models inter-clonal cooperation can be essential for Wnt-driven tumours56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest that therapeutic approaches aiming to disrupt the symbiotic ecosystem within the tumour cell community could potentially combat the dynamic evolutionary architecture of cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

controlled by comparing invasive cells that have been photoconverted (IR) to invasive cells that were not photoconverted (NG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Any gene that significantly changed between these two conditions was denoted as alterations due to the photoconversion process and was excluded from analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to these controls, significant expression differences between leader and follower cells were tested with the four following hypotheses: (1) mean gene expression differences between leader versus follower cells is greater than mean (absolute) expression differences between control (IR and NG) cells; (2) mean expression differences between leader versus follower cells is greater than zero; (3) mean gene expression differences between followers versus leaders is greater than mean (absolute) expression differences between control (IR and NG) cells; and (4) mean expression differences between followers versus leaders is greater than zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothesis testing was done based on 500 permutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each permutation of the data, a t-statistic was defined by taking all pairs of differences among samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In specific, nine pairs of expression differences between leaders and followers were formed by taking one sample from each of leader and follower cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, nine pairs of expression differences between the two defined controls were formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these nine difference pairs, both a two- and one-sample t-statistic were defined for each gene for testing respective hypotheses 1 and 2; the differences were reversed for testing hypotheses 3 and 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By permuting the expression difference pairs between groups (leaders and followers differences versus controls differences), a P value was estimated for each gene based on comparing the number of times the permuted data exceeded both the one- and two-sample t-statistic formed based on the observed data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes with P less_than 0.05 were selected as the differentially expressed genes in the leaders (N=788) and followers (N=634).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heat map of differentially expressed genes was generated using heat map.2R function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biological pathways enriched among these differentially upregulated genes were searched against several curated databases

cells were plated in triplicate in a 24-well plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At days 13, cells were counted using an automatic cell counter (BioRad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For mitotic event analyses, H1299 RFP-leader and follower cells were plated in an eight-well LabTek glass bottom slide either alone or in co-culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 6 h, cells were imaged every 5 min for 21 h on the Leica SP8 inverted confocal microscope at × 10 using a 488 nm argon laser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitotic events were analysed from these images using Leica Application Suite X software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of time from prophase to anaphase and anaphase to cytokinesis was determined by morphological features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beginning of prophase was defined as the first image where the cell became spherical and increased Dendra2 fluorescence, the beginning of anaphase was defined as the first image where the chromosomes were visibly separated and the cell has begun elongating, and cytokinesis was defined as the first image where the two daughter cells are separated by a plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of a variety of mitotic defects was defined by morphological abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytokinetic instability was defined as what appears to be initially  greater than two daughter cells with excessive membrane blebbing and cell shape deformation during cytokinesis, but over time is corrected to two daughter cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell death events were counted based on morphological changes consistent with cell death phenotypes (loss of all cell motility and membrane dynamics, shrinkage of cell, nuclear fragmentation, formation of apoptotic bodies, phagocytosis by neighbouring cells and so on).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cell cycle analysis', 'H1299 follower and
