A rhesus macaque model of Asian-lineage Zika virus infection  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Infection with Asian-lineage Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with GuillainBarré syndrome and fetal abnormalities, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal models of infection are thus urgently needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that rhesus macaques are susceptible to infection by an Asian-lineage ZIKV closely related to strains currently circulating in the Americas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following subcutaneous inoculation, ZIKV RNA is detected in plasma 1 day post infection (d.p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in all animals (N=8, including 2 pregnant animals), and is also present in saliva, urine and cerebrospinal fluid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-pregnant and pregnant animals remain viremic for 21 days and for up to at least 57 days, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutralizing antibodies are detected by 21 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rechallenge 10 weeks after the initial challenge results in no detectable virus replication, indicating protective immunity against homologous strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Asian-lineage ZIKV infection of rhesus macaques provides a relevant animal model for studying pathogenesis and evaluating potential interventions against human infection, including during pregnancy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus first identified in 1947 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little was known about ZIKV when fetal abnormalities and GuillainBarré syndrome were reported coincident with epidemic spread of Asian-lineage ZIKV in South America2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animal models are essential for quickly understanding ZIKV transmission and pathogenesis, as well as for evaluating candidate vaccines and therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV infects immunocompromised mice5, providing evidence suggesting that ZIKV causes microcephaly by attacking neuronal progenitor cells and leads to intrauterine growth restriction6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mouse models do not mimic key attributes of human infection and fetal development such as infection in an immunocompetent state or the same type of remodelling of the spiral arteries and arterial vasodilation10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This remodelling of the arteries that occurs in humans and nonhuman primates, but not in mice, leads to high blood flow to the fetus, altering the potential transmission of viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast to mice, immunocompetent macaque monkeys are widely used in both infectious disease and obstetric research, with similar gestation and fetal development as humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe infection of rhesus macaques with an Asian-lineage ZIKV strain.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cohort definitions', 'To determine whether a physiologically relevant dose and route of Asian-lineage ZIKV infects immunocompetent pregnant and non-pregnant macaques, we inoculated eight Indian-origin rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) subcutaneously with ZIKV derived from a French Polynesian virus isolate (Zika virus/H.sapiens-tc/FRA/2013/FrenchPolynesia-01_v1c1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eight animals were divided into three cohorts as shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cohort 1 (three male animals) received the first ZIKV challenges and were then rested for 6 weeks before a rechallenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cohort 2 (three female animals) was a repeat experiment of cohort 1 that allowed for additional experiments and sample collection (for example, serum infectivity) that were not feasible when we initiated cohort 1 studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals in cohort 3 (two pregnant animals) were challenged on two different days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both cohort 3 animals are currently in the once weekly sampling phase until the pregnancies come to term (165 gestational days).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic representation of the timeline of infection and sampling for each animal in the presented studies.Cohort 1 received the first ZIKV challenges and was then rested for 6 weeks before a rechallenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all studies, samples were collected daily for 10 days and then on 14, 21 and 28 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as indicated by hashes in the timelines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cohort 3 represents the two pregnant animals that were challenged on two different days.

loss in four animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two animals (912116 and 393422) also developed a very mild rash around the inoculation site at 1 day post infection (d.p.i.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  that persisted for 45 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other abnormal clinical signs were noted (for example, increased body temperature, joint pain, lymphadenopathy and lethargy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Daily complete blood counts (CBCs) were evaluated for all six non-pregnant animals for 10 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and then every 37 days thereafter and serum chemistry analyses were performed intermittently post infection as per the protocol (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reference intervals (RIs) developed for the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC) colony for species, gender and age were used to evaluate results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All six animals developed elevated serum creatine kinase (CK), which peaked by 5 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increases in serum CK are strongly associated with muscle damage and myositis (skeletal, smooth and cardiac), but can also be caused by repeated sedation, haemolysis and endocrine abnormalities14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predictable increases in CK have been noted in nonhuman primates undergoing repeated sedation and venipuncture15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CK levels did not remain elevated during the 10-day period of daily sedation and blood collection, suggesting other causes for the noted increase in values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies are planned to determine whether CK increases may be due to viral myositis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alanine aminotransferase values in three of six animals exceeded the maximum WNPRC RI (Supplementary Fig 1c) and the expected increase associated with repeated ketamine sedation15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although aspartate aminotransferase values exceeded upper RI values for all six non-pregnant animals after infection, they did not increase above the expected levels

secondary to the viral infection or simply a result of frequent blood collections could not be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Platelet values for all six animals remained within RI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both

daily for 1011 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and every 37 days thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral RNA (vRNA) was quantified by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (qRTPCR) from plasma18 and was detected in all six animals at 1 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peak plasma viremia occurred between 2 and 6 d.p.i., and ranged from 8.2 × 104 to 2.5 × 106 vRNA copies per ml.

vRNA detected in the serum and plasma were very similar (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The estimated doubling time for plasma viremia averaged 7.7 h (range=4.810.2 h) and was independent of the infecting dose and sex of the macaque.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By 10 d.p.i., plasma viral loads were undetectable ( less_than 100 vRNA copies per ml) in all six animals, although intermittent low-level detection ( less_than 550 vRNA copies per ml) continued sporadically through 17 d.p.i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, vRNA remained undetectable in all fluids throughout

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Altogether, our study shows the persistence of ZIKV RNA in the plasma of rhesus macaques for 10 days, similar to other vector-borne flaviviruses that cause acute, typically self-limiting infections in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work also shows that ZIKV infection elicits a robust immune response including ZIKV-specific T-cell response and nAb responses that confer protection against reinfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the prolonged detection of vRNA in urine and saliva after apparent clearance from the blood, detection of virus in the CSF and occasional plasma blips after initial clearance suggest that ZIKV may persist longer, at low levels, in certain tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work in rhesus macaques will seek to determine whether and where these reservoirs may exist, and whether they seed virus into fluids that might allow for human-to-human transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, persistence of plasma viremia beyond 10 days was detected in both animals we infected during the first trimester of pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work will determine the source of that virus, as these pregnancies come to full term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study establishes immunocompetent rhesus macaques infected with physiologically relevant ZIKV, as a relevant translational model for infection and pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large immunological toolset available for rhesus macaques will enable investigations of immunity and potential vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pregnancy, the maternalfetal interface and fetal development have been described in detail in rhesus macaques, so this model will also enable assessments of the impact of maternal ZIKV infection on the developing fetus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have established persistent viremia in pregnant macaques, despite activation of NK cells and T cells as well as development of a nAb response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We continue to follow these pregnant animals and will establish whether fetal infection and/or abnormalities have occurred through serial ultrasound assessments of the fetus and placenta as well as tissue analysis at pregnancy termination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Updates to all experiments are available in real time at the Zika Open-Research Portal (https://zika.labkey.com).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
