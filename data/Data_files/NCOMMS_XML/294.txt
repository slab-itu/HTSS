Genetic suppression reveals DNA repair-independent antagonism between BRCA1 and COBRA1 in mammary gland development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is well known for its function in double-strand break (DSB) DNA repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While BRCA1 is also implicated in transcriptional regulation, the physiological significance remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COBRA1 (also known as NELF-B) is a BRCA1-binding protein that regulates RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) pausing and transcription elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we interrogate functional interaction between BRCA1 and COBRA1 during mouse mammary gland development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissue-specific deletion of Cobra1 reduces mammary epithelial compartments and blocks ductal morphogenesis, alveologenesis and lactogenesis, demonstrating a pivotal role of COBRA1 in adult tissue development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, these developmental deficiencies due to Cobra1 knockout are largely rescued by additional loss of full-length Brca1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Brca1/Cobra1 double knockout restores developmental transcription at puberty, alters luminal epithelial homoeostasis, yet remains deficient in homologous recombination-based DSB repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus our genetic suppression analysis uncovers a previously unappreciated, DNA repair-independent function of BRCA1 in antagonizing COBRA1-dependent transcription programme during mammary gland development.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Germline mutations in BRCA1 predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRCA1 is best known for its role in promoting the homologous recombination (HR)-based pathway of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to DSB repair, BRCA1 has also been implicated in other cellular processes, including transcription3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRCA1 binds to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)5 and various site-specific transcription factors, including oestrogen receptor  (ER) and GATA3 (refs 6, 7), which are involved in mammary gland development and breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous work indicates that BRCA1 is capable of regulating transcription through high-order chromatin reorganization and unfolding8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a role for BRCA1 in transcriptional regulation, genome-wide analysis indicates that chromatin binding of BRCA1 is enriched at transcription start sites (TSS) across the human genome13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding these in vitro findings, there is a gap of knowledge concerning the physiological relevance of these transcription-related activities of BRCA1 in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously identified a BRCA1-binding protein, cofactor of BRCA1 or COBRA1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11), which is identical to the B subunit of the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NELF is a metazoan-specific regulator of transcription elongation that pauses RNAPII at the TSS-proximal region17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although NELF was first identified as a transcription elongation repressor in vitro16, subsequent in vivo studies indicate that NELF-mediated RNAPII pausing can lead to both decreased and increased transcription18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ER+ breast cancer cells, COBRA1 interacts with ER (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22) and regulates RNAPII movement at ER target genes23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While NELF-mediated RNAPII pausing has been proposed to ensure synchronous transcriptional activation of developmentally regulated genes25, the exact physiological roles of mammalian NELF have just begun to be deciphered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Published work from us and others indicates that mouse COBRA1 is critical for early embryogenesis26,27 and energy homoeostasis in adult myocardium28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of COBRA1 in adult tissue development remains unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it is not clear whether the previously characterized physical interaction between COBRA1 and BRCA1 has any physiological significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using mammary epithelium-specific knockout (KO) mouse models for Brca1 and Cobra1, we provide compelling genetic evidence for a previously unrecognized functional link between BRCA1 and a transcription elongation factor in dictating the developmental outcome in mammary epithelium.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Brca1 and Cobra1 complementation in ductal development', 'To investigate the role of COBRA1 in mammary gland development, we generated mammary epithelium-specific KO mice by breeding the MMTV-Cre strain29 with Cobra1f/f animals26, which resulted in deletion of the first four Cobra1 exons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mammary epithelium of the resulting female MMTV-Cre,Cobra1f/f (CKO) animals was effectively depleted of COBRA1 (Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with age-matched wild-type littermates (WT, Cobra1f/f) and hemizygous mice (MMTV-Cre,Cobra1f/+), virgin CKO with homozygous deletion of Cobra1 displayed severely retarded mammary ductal growth (Fig 1a,b; Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normal developmental phenotype of hemizygous Cobra1 knockout mice (MMTV-Cre,Cobra1f/+, Supplementary Fig 2a) strongly indicates that the CKO-associated developmental defects are due to homozygous Cobra1 ablation, not Cre recombinase expression per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore used littermates carrying floxed WT gene alleles as the control for most of our subsequent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: DKO rescues ductal developmental defect in CKO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Whole mounts of mammary glands from 8-wk virgin mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The boundary of the ductal area is highlighted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 1 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images are representatives of at least 6 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Measurement of the average ductal length at four developmental time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numbers of animals used for each of the four time points (6, 8, 12 and 24 wks) are: WT (4, 7, 7 and 12 mice), BKO (3, 3, 4 and 4 mice), CKO (3, 6, 5 and 8 mice) and DKO (4, 7, 4 and 4 mice).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses here and in c were conducted using Students t-test for comparison between CKO and WT, and between DKO and CKO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Flow cytometry analysis of total live cells in various subpopulations per mammary gland from 16-wk virgin mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stromal cells: CD49f-EpCAM, luminal epithelial cells: CD49fmedEpCAMhigh, myoepithelial cells: CD49fhighEpCAMmed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numbers of animals used are: WT (4), BKO (3), CKO (3) and DKO (4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01 by Students t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars represent s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  wks, weeks.Full size image', 'The developmental defect of CKO was most profound during and shortly after puberty (6 and 8 weeks), and remained significant in older virgin mice (12 and 24 weeks, Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In further support, flow cytometry using established cell-surface markers for mammary epithelial cells30 showed that total live luminal (CD49fmedEpCAMhigh) and myoepithelial (CD49fhighEpCAMmed) cell populations of CKO mammary glands were equally reduced compared with their WT littermates (Fig 1c; Supplementary Fig 3), suggesting an overall developmental arrest of multiple mammary epithelial lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data clearly indicate that mouse COBRA1 is important for adult tissue development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the physical interaction between BRCA1 and COBRA1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11), we compared the phenotypes of CKO with MMTV-Cre-mediated Brca1 KO that was conditionally deleted of Brca1 exon 11 (MMTV-Cre,Brca1f/f; BKO), and Brca1/Cobra1 double KO mice (MMTV-Cre,Brca1f/f,Cobra1f/f; DKO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with published findings31,32, BKO animals exhibited grossly normal ductal growth at puberty (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ductal development of DKO mice was stunted at 6 weeks (Fig 1b; Supplementary Fig 4), but remarkably, it approached that of WT and BKO at later stages (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, abundance of luminal and myoepithelial cells in DKO mammary glands was significantly higher than that in age-matched CKO (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While myoepithelial cell number in DKO was still lower than that in WT (P=0.026 by Students t-test), there was no appreciable difference in luminal cell abundance between DKO and WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that COBRA1 and BRCA1 expression in DKO mice were depleted to a similar extent versus the corresponding single-gene KO animals (Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore the marked phenotypic difference between CKO and DKO reflects a bona fide genetic complementation between Brca1 and Cobra1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret our finding to mean that BRCA1 imposes a developmental blockade on CKO mammary glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Rescue of alveologenesis and lactogenesis in DKO', 'Despite the partial ductal growth in older virgin CKO (Fig 1b), all pups of CKO dams died shortly after birth from obvious lack of nursing, suggesting a profound and persistent functional defect rather than transient ductal growth delay in CKO mammary glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support, mammary glands of CKO at postpartum were largely devoid of alveolar structure (Fig 2ac) and milk proteins (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to CKO, hemizygous Cobra1 knockout dams (MMTV-Cre,Cobra1f/+) displayed alveologenesis (Supplementary Fig 2b) and nursing ability comparable to their WT littermates (Cobra1f/f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that COBRA1 is required for normal mammary gland functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: DKO rescues alveolar and lactogenic defects associated with CKO and BKO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Whole mounts of mammary glands from 16 to 20-week mice 1-day postpartum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 1 mm in a and 500 m in b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) H&E stain of the lobular-alveolar structure in mammary glands of 1620-week mice 1-day postpartum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 m.

Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these CKO-affected genes were enriched with previously identified pubertal genes44 (P=7.65 × 1013 for 6 weeks by Fishers exact test), and oestrogen (P=7.73 × 106 by Fishers exact test) and progesterone-responsive genes45 (P=5.00 × 105 by Fishers exact test) in mammary epithelium (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, 80% of the CKO-affected genes at 4 and 6 weeks were either partially or completely rescued in DKO mammary glands (Fig 5a; Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the DKO-rescued genes were enriched with puberty-related (P=2.34 × 109 for 6 weeks by Fishers exact test) and oestrogen (P=2.09 × 105 by Fishers exact test) and progesterone-responsive genes (P=7.64 × 104 by Fishers exact test, Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, expression of Gata3 and Prlr, two known pubertal genes, was disrupted by Cobra1 ablation but partially restored in DKO (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed the microarray result for several pubertal genes by gene-specific RT-PCR (PCR with reverse transcription;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our mouse genetic study unequivocally demonstrates an important role of the COBRA1 in mammary gland development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our work uncovers genetic complementation between Brca1 and Cobra1 in the context of mammary gland development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, genetic suppression analysis has provided a highly valuable tool used in various simple model organisms for identifying functional interactions between genes that act in a common pathway or two related ones46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although multiple mechanisms can explain a genetic suppression phenotype, the specific genetic complementation between Brca1 and Cobra1 is most likely due to an antagonistic action of these two gene products in a common pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First of all, the observed genetic suppression during DKO mammary gland development is associated with a similar functional rescue in pubertal transcriptional programme, but not in DSB repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, mutual suppression, which was observed in alveologenesis and lactogenesis of DKO mammary glands (Fig 2), often occurs between two genes that encode interacting proteins46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the genetic finding serves as a satisfying functional validation of our previously characterized physical interaction between human BRCA1 and COBRA1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, CKO-associated developmental defects were only suppressed by deletion of Brca1, not other tumour suppressor genes tested, including Trp53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gene-specific genetic suppression most likely reflects a COBRA1-opposing action of BRCA1 in a specific functional pathway, rather than a more general, p53-like DNA damage checkpoint function in cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The MMTV-Cre system has been widely used in tissue-specific characterization of genes involved in mouse mammary gland development and functions47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent reports indicated that MMTV-Cre Line A, which was used in the current study, exhibited moderate impairment in alveologenesis and lactogenesis49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reported side effect of MMTV-Cre unlikely affects our conclusions on BRCA1 and COBRA1 for the following reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, unlike age-matched CKO, hemizygous MMTV-Cre,Cobra1f/+ dams displayed grossly normal alveologenesis and nursing capability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the previous reports49,50, the absence of any appreciable MMTV-Cre-associated lactational defects in our study could be due to the more heterogeneous strain background in our work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, virgin CKO animals, but not MMTV-Cre,Cobra1f/+, display a dramatic defect in mammary ductal development at all age groups examined (624 weeks of age, Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, no ductal defects were reported for virgin MMTV-Cre Line A animals in previously published studies49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, CKO, BKO and DKO, which were assessed in the same MMTV-Cre Line A background, gave rise to distinct alveologenic and lactogenic phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data strongly suggest that usage of MMTV-Cre Line A alone is not the cause of the profound developmental defects in CKO or the striking genetic rescue observed in DKO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our genetic findings clearly indicate that DNA repair-independent antagonism between BRCA1 and COBRA1 plays a critical role in pubertal mammary gland development and maintenance of mammary epithelial homoeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loss of COBRA1 manifests the BRCA1-mediated inhibition of ductal morphogenesis as observed in CKO, and conversely, BKO mice without functional BRCA1 exhibit enlarged luminal progenitor cell population and defective alveolar development as a result of unopposed COBRA1 actions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absence of both BRCA1 and COBRA1 in DKO mammary glands could reach a quasi-balanced state that allows for gross tissue development and restored mammary gland functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While functions of DKO mammary glands are largely restored to a level comparable to WT, the inner layer of DKO epithelial ducts tend to have an expanded K8+ cell population juxtaposed with some K14+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the ratio of CD49b+ over CD49b luminal cells in DKO is significantly lower in DKO versus WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, DKO epithelium experiences both increased proliferation and apoptosis, which could explain why the absolute number of total live cells as measured by flow cytometry is similar to that in WT animals (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that DKO luminal epithelium may have the propensity for precocious differentiation, thus resulting in exhaustion of the luminal progenitor subpopulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As luminal progenitor cells are thought to be the cells of origin for BRCA1-associated tumours37,38,39, investigation is under way to interrogate the impact of Cobra1 ablation on tumorigenesis in Brca1-deficient mouse mammary epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our current genetic work underscores the importance of interrogating functional interactions between Brca1 and Cobra1 in the physiologically relevant tissue context and developmental window.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
