Similarity in viral and host promoters couples viral reactivation with host cell migration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Viralhost interactomes map the complex architecture of an evolved arms race during host cell invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mRNA and protein interactomes reveal elaborate targeting schemes, yet evidence is lacking for genetic coupling that results in the co-regulation of promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we compare viral and human promoter sequences and expression to test whether genetic coupling exists and investigate its phenotypic consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that viralhost co-evolution is imprinted within promoter gene sequences before transcript or protein interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-regulation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human C-X-C chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) facilitates migration of infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon infection, HIV can actively replicate or remain dormant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migrating infected cells reactivate from dormancy more than non-migrating cells and exhibit differential migrationreactivation responses to drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells producing virus pose a risk for reinitiating infection within niches inaccessible to drugs, and tuning viral control of migration and reactivation improves strategies to eliminate latent HIV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viralhost genetic coupling establishes a mechanism for synchronizing transcription and guiding potential therapies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Within biological organisms, interactions and functions can be topologically represented as a network of interaction modules1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigations have integrated viralhost messenger RNA2 and protein3,4,5 interaction networks essential for our understanding of human disease6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These networks can lead to therapeutic outcomes as demonstrated by a study in which viralhost interactome screening identifies and targets host factors involved in influenza virus replication with antiviral drugs7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical interaction networks rely on direct mRNA and protein interactions, but long-range indirect coupling of viral and host pathways may exist at the DNA level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Human host gene promoters hold clues for identifying pathways harnessed by viruses and viralhost relationships stem from millions of years of evolution in different viruses and hosts8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions have potential insight into regulatory mechanisms and viral targeting strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the study of endogenous retroviral elements has focused predominantly on their structure, evolution, distribution and regulation of, or interaction with, the host9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reports have shown methodologies for quantifying the real-time activity of transposable elements in single bacterial cells13, identified the rewiring of transcriptional circuitry in pluripotent stem cells by transposable elements14 and revealed widespread similarity of enhancers of innate immune response genes in a number of viruses15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies highlight that investigating endogenous retroviral elements may provide a deeper understanding of viralhost regulatory relationships and have broad therapeutic potential by identifying novel drug targets of viralhost regulation and their interlaced phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic coupling constitutes an indirect co-regulator of viral and host promoters driven by high similarity in cis regulatory arrangement and represents an additional layer to viralhost interactomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a long evolutionary history of interactions, viral and host gene promoters may hold clues into regulatory mechanisms and host cell dependencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, the virus has converged to co-express with an array of host cell-coding promoters and pathways for a fitness advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic coupling would provide a framework for synthetic gene programming strategies by exibiting robust functionality in diverse chromosomal landscapes and environments faced by competing viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Implementing a comprehensive search for similarity between viral and human promoter sequences, we discover the existence of genetic coupling and co-regulation of highly similar promoters of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and corresponding human genes, whereby co-expression of the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter and human C-X-C motif chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) facilitates migration and reactivation of dormant or latently infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that both migration and reactivation can be differentially controlled using drug treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings further complicate leading strategies for eliminating latent reservoirs of HIV16, as current approaches risk reactivating latent virus in migrating cells that can reach target-rich cell niches17.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'A genome-wide search for viralhost promoter similarity', 'To search for promoter similarity between human protein coding genes and the HIV-1 LTR promoter, we performed a logic-based search of the annotated human genome for conserved cis regulatory binding sites in the LTR across clades of HIV-1 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The search was strictly limited to promoters with binding sites for TBP (TATA-binding protein), specificity protein 1 (SP1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB), and did not filter for site arrangement, exact distance from the transcription start site (TSS) or number of sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of additional binding site types were ignored to de-constrain the search and resulted in 366 TBPSP1NFKB gene promoters (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human coagulation factor 3 (F3) and CXCR4 were found to exhibit the highest promoter similarity to the LTR (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Promoters of HIV-1, HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and the CMV major immediate early promoter (MIEP) showed high conservation of TBPSP1NFKB arrangement in their core promoters18,19,20 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Post-search curation revealed additional similarities between the promoters (AP1, nucleosome occupancy, P-TEFb, CPG islands and so on).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, similar to the LTR, the distance of NFKB and the most upstream SP1 site in the CXCR4 and F3 promoters is within a reported range required for cooperativity by both transcription factors in promoter activation21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, this binding site arrangement suggests a uniquely conserved viralhost promoter for gene regulation, cooperativity, expression dynamics and an elaborate control and coordination of viralhost gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Viral and host promoters display high similarity in gene regulatory sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Logic-based search of human coding gene promoters for similarity to viral core promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The list of human promoters indicates a logic series of cis-binding elements (boxes) for each promoter (rows) comprising diverse patterns of TATA box (red), SP1 (pink) and NFKB (blue) binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conserved cis-binding sites in a virus (NFKB: blue triangles, SP1: pink diamonds and TATA: red squares) are searched for in all human coding genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV and CMV promoters are curated and compared within ±250 bp from the TSS of human promoters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Promoters are clustered regardless of number, arrangement or distance of sites from the TSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional transcription factor-binding site types are ignored to de-constrain results of the search.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The genome-wide promoter search results in 366 gene promoters with binding sites for TBP (TATA-binding protein, red squares), SP1 (pink diamonds) and NFKB (blue triangles), and F3/TF, CXCR4 and HIV-1 LTR show the

#@NEW_LINE#@#  69), BRD4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  69) and CPG islands (purple and navy rectangle regions) from the TSS are also consistent between promoters and curated after the initial genome-wide search.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The brown circle in the SIV LTR promoter represents simian factor 1 or SF1, an activator protein 1 (AP1) related transcription factor in monkeys reported in SIV around 135 to

perturbations in a neutrophil HL60 cell line (z-score, P less_than 0.04, Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the three cell lines measured in the original study where the genome-wide microarrays were performed, the HL60 neutrophil cell line was chosen as the closest to the Jurkat T-lymphocyte cell line for evaluating co-expression (compared with MCF7 breast cancer and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines in the microarray data set).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The co-expression slopes of genetically coupled promoters land high on distributions comparing over 10k human genes with either F3 or CXCR4 (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-expression of the HIV LTR and human promoters was quantified using expression data from a recently reported drug screen on a clonal Jurkat T-cell population of the LTR driving an mCherry reporter23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accounting for 262 treatments common to the microarray data set, co-expression slopes were quantified between changes to human mRNA transcription and fluorescent intensity of LTRmCherry expression after applying a moving average (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXCR4 and F3 result in significantly high co-expression slopes on a distribution between the LTR and 10k human genes (z-score, P less_than 0.003 for CXCR4, Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes with higher co-expression than CXCR4 or F3 to the LTR promoter exist and most likely occur through alternate modes of cis, trans and posttranscriptional regulation, and are not co-regulated through the cis regulatory binding elements used to determine genetic coupling in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

for latency reversal', 'Upon infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes, HIV integrates into the host genome and exploits cellular resources to produce viral progeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Productive infection leads to active replication, whereas an alternate quiescent state termed proviral latency in which the integrated virus does not express is also established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eliminating the latent cell reservoir has proven difficult26 and is identified as the primary barrier for curing infected patients27,28,29 as the latent virus re-establishes infection by stochastically switching into a replicating state30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The leading strategy for eliminating the latent reservoir termed shock and kill, entails complete reactivation of the latent reservoir while under treatment with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART)16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HAART protects uninfected bystander cells from produced virus, while reactivated cells undergo cell death over time (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, HIV cure research has made progress23,26,29,32, but the possibility of correlated migration and reactivation of latent cells poses unaddressed challenges for shock and kill

the minimal promoter system, we performed migration assays in the context of full-length HIV-1, to determine whether the correlation between migration and viral expression is conserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isoclones of a previously generated Jurkat latency model (JLat)41, a Jurkat cell line containing full-length HIV with a deletion of env and GFP replacing the nef reading frame, were used for migration assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were reactivated with TNF for 1248 h followed by 3 h migration measurements and compared with untreated cell migration (Fig 4b and Supplementary Figs 4 and 5).

#@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether decreased migration with increased reactivation is controlled by Tat, identical experiments were performed using latent clonal cell lines harbouring minimal viral circuits expressing Tat41 (LTR-Tat-IRESGFP, Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although still migrating, a decoupling of correlated migration and reactivation was preserved (Fig 4d), suggesting that full-length HIV has evolved the capacity to tune host cell migration using two coordinated mechanisms: co-expression with the genetically coupled CXCR4 promoter and protein interactions at the cell surface between the viral product Tat inhibiting CXCR4 for decreased cell motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The observation of decreased migration of reactivated latent cells agrees with recent reports in vivo.

for HIV env-infected cells, suggesting that other HIV factors contribute to decreased T-cell motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro findings, with env JLat or minimal LTR-Tat-IRESGFP vectors, suggest that Tat expression during reactivation is sufficient to reduce migration and is consistent with full-length HIV behaviour in vivo implicated in playing a role in pathogenesis within target-rich lymph nodes44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, despite a consistent trend of reduced migration for HIV expressing cells44,45, JLat and minimal Tat clones treated with TNF for 24 or 48 h reveal that sub-populations of migrating cells reactivate at higher rates compared with stationary (or non-migrating) cells (Fig 4e, Supplementary Figs 7 and 8, and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral control of migration at both genetic (LTR) and protein (Tat) levels motivates the potential for exogenous manipulation of viralhost migration and reactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Regulatory control of latently infected cells with migrationreactivation drug cocktails has implications for latency reversal strategies in diverse scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, stimulation of cell migration without reactivating latency may benefit the channelling of HIV-1 strains residing in the central nervous system17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study in HIV-infected patients demonstrates that brain-derived HIV-1 strains are less responsive to latency-reversing agents due to polymorphisms occurring in the LTR regulatory SP1 sites46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This further supports a need for multi-modal and migratory control strategies addressing the spatial dependence and motility of the latent reservoir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Drug control of reactivation and migration of latent cells', 'To investigate the ability of leading reactivation cocktails to exogenously and differentially control migration and reactivation, latently infected cells were treated with common modulators of HIV transcription (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude the possibility of cell toxicity from applied drug treatments, we used published concentrations (Supplementary Table 2) as well as propidium iodide staining with flow cytometry analysis to assess cell death (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a low reactivating latent clone41 (JLat 15.4 from Fig 4b), cell populations fall into three behaviours after 48 h treatments defining distinct classes of drug cocktails (Fig 5): (1) migrating cells without reactivation (blue circles); (2) migrating and reactivating cells (purple triangles); and (3) reactivating cells without migration (red diamonds).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although TNF and Pro couple migration and reactivation, Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and combinations with PMA were found to be the strongest suppressors of migration that reactivate latency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through a CXCR4 internalization mechanism at the cell surface47, PMA demonstrates that a treatment strategy directly targeting receptors at the membrane may be more effective and faster than intracellular regulation of the CXCR4 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results motivate that drug cocktails directly affecting receptors at the cell surface for immobilization are favourable to avoid viral spread through additional infections (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cancer

show that PMA reduces Iono-treated cell migration, SAHA reduces TNF migration and Pro reduces enhanced migration by E2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Off-target effects increase the migratory challenge for affecting infected CD4+ T-cells with minimal influence on bystander cells using strategic drug therapies for migration in and out of target-rich niches without producing new infections (Fig 3b).'

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The computational investigation of similarity between viral and human coding promoters and their cis regulatory arrangements guided the experimental investigation of a novel regulatory relationship between a virus and its host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CXCR4 is typically studied for its role as a mediator of HIV viral entry at later stages of infection52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite genetic coupling and co-expression observed between HIV and CXCR4, the dominant CCR5 tropism of HIV is completely uncoupled genetically and uncorrelated in response to drug perturbations (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in a dual-role of HIV-CXCR4 with membrane interactions and promoter co-regulation for both infection and migration of the host cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-expression between the LTR and CXCR4 in polyclonal LTRGFP cell populations shows that the promoter coupling is largely invariant to differences in episodic transcriptional activity of LTR integration across the human genome24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the observed decoupling of migration in the minimal and full-length latency models that express Tat suggests that the virus has evolved to synchronize viral gene expression with host cell CXCR4 upregulation, to control or decrease CXCR4-mediated migration individually within each infected cell, potentially for a fitness increase44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the consistent difference in reactivation levels of stationary and migrating cells may be also under the influence of the viral Tat protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tat transactivation is heterogeneous in clonal populations with single-cell transients stochastically initiating from the inactive state when reactivated, which could lead to asynchronous coupling of steady state levels30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Best-in-class drug cocktails (Fig 5) were used to quantify migration and reactivation, and to identify major migrationreactivation behaviours of Tat-expressing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous reports, HDACis and PMA reduce CXCR4-mediated migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, certain preferred synergistic compounds in reactivation cocktails such as JQ1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53) and Iono may migrate treated cells when a migratory suppressor is not combined simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of compounds combined with TNF provided the largest reactivation with reduced migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although consistent with a general trend of decreased migration with increasing reactivation from Fig 4b,c, sole treatment and quenching of migration by SAHA and PMA suggests a consistency with their known internalization of CXCR4 at the membrane and a complete reduction of TNF migration levels, that is, membrane modification dominates intracellular NFKB activation (Figs 5 and 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with a combination of JQ1 and TNF, both migrating compounds when treated independently, results in high reactivation and a strong reduction of migration, whereas migrating compounds E2 and Tamoxifen conserve both migration and reactivation levels when combined with TNF compared with TNF alone (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, anticancer drug treatments of E2 or Cytarabine raise additional risk in HIV+ cancer patients by migration of latently infected T-cells, which underlines the need for customized latency removal treatments individualized for each patient and their pre-existing medical conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, migratory cocktails and their diverse mechanisms affecting both the latent reservoir and uninfected bystander T-cells will need to be accounted for in designing migration strategies (Figs 5 and 6, and Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results set the stage for either advanced gene therapies utilizing synthetic biology or large-scale screening of small molecules that strategically modulate migrationreactivation behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Customized therapeutic strategies are further needed as recent studies contribute to an emerging picture of prolonged cell viability impeding eradication of HIV-infected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reports using mathematical models to provide an understanding of in vivo replication kinetics of HIV estimate a generation time of 12 days for productively infected cells54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These theoretical models do not directly measure apoptotic death for productively infected cells or latency in patients on long-term HAART.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports further extend the possibility of prolonged cell death through experimental investigations by showing that: (1) HIV-1 can acquire mutations to evade cytolytic T lymphocytes required for clearance of the latent reservoir56, (2) latency reversal agents impair cytotoxic T-cell-mediated killing57,58,59 and (3) clinical trials with HDACis and disulfiram fail to deplete the latent HIV reservoir in patients on HAART despite HIV reactivation60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these studies provide evidence that T-cell killing of reactivated latent cells is difficult and may not occur at all.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migratory challenges to HIV shock and kill presented in this study are only further exacerbated by this lack of T-cell death by providing a longer migration window accompanied by viral shedding of reactivated cells (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in a latent population, migrating cells reactivate more than stationary cells (Fig 4d and Supplementary Figs 7 and 8), presenting an additional risk for viral spread with shock and kill (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Computational logic-based promoter searches for similarity in gene regulatory arrangements can elucidate additional genetic coupling and guide drug therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An unexpected genetic coupling of HIV-LTR and CMV-MIEP promoters was uncovered between two distinct and co-evolving viruses (Fig 2f and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CMV has been prominent in patients infected with HIV-1 and the relationship between both viruses is important for persistence under current HAART treatment61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LTR-MIEP coupling not only suggests that viralhost coupling can include co-evolution of multiple viruses, but may elucidate a more comprehensive viralhost network and treatment for common co-infection in patients61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Moreover, human F3 (tissue factor), another coupled promoter, is involved in inflammation, cellular homing, blood coagulation, hypercoagulation and thrombosis (Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thromboembolic complication has been observed in HIV+ and AIDS patients62,63,64,65, and along with inflammation is elevated in HIV-infected patients65,66 with mixed reports regarding those under HAART63,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a coagulationinflammationthrombosis circuit67 affected by both HIV and CMV infection, the findings in this study may provide mechanistic insight for the elevated risks for thrombosis in patients and the design of novel treatments for hypercoagulation and inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Coupled transcription factor control of promoters has implications for advancing predictive DNA networks and understanding interactomes of human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies of genetically coupled viralhost promoters may elucidate mechanisms of viralhost regulatory dynamics, viral fitness and innovative therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discovery that HIV exploits transcriptional coupling with host cell pathways provides a novel paradigm for viralhost DNA interactions and the future engineering of synthetic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although adding challenges to HIV therapies, this study reports the existence of a genotype to phenotype coupling of migration and reactivation of latent HIV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Improving regulatory control of migrationreactivation behaviours with drug cocktails may benefit migration-based disease phenotypes such as HIV and cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
