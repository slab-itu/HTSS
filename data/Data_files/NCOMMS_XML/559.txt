Imaging and controlling plasmonic interference fields at buried interfaces  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Capturing and controlling plasmons at buried interfaces with nanometre and femtosecond resolution has yet to be achieved and is critical for next generation plasmonic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use light to excite plasmonic interference patterns at a buried metaldielectric interface in a nanostructured thin film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmons are launched from a photoexcited array of nanocavities and their propagation is followed via photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting movie directly captures the plasmon dynamics, allowing quantification of their group velocity at 0.3 times the speed of light, consistent with our theoretical predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that the light polarization and nanocavity design can be tailored to shape transient plasmonic gratings at the nanoscale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work, demonstrating dynamical imaging with PINEM, paves the way for the femtosecond and nanometre visualization and control of plasmonic fields in advanced heterostructures based on novel two-dimensional materials such as graphene, MoS2, and ultrathin metal films.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs)1 are considered ideal for circuitry miniaturization to nanoscale dimensions2, due to their inherent surface-bound and spatially confined characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes them appealing for various applications, such as nanoscopic signal processing3 and high-resolution sensing4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, considering the femtosecond (fs) temporal and nanometre (nm) spatial scales involved, direct real space characterization of evanescent waves presents a significant experimental challenge, especially in materials and devices involving buried interfaces and complex heterostructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several optics-based approaches have been developed to meet the challenge of tracking surface-bound SPPs with appropriate resolution, notably dual-colour coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS)5 and scanning-tip-based techniques such as near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM)6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, the spatial and temporal resolution limits of these optical techniques have been pushed to the tens of nm and hundreds of fs9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an alternative approach, the use of electron photoemission for detection, as in time-resolved nonlinear photoemission electron microscopy (TR-PEEM)11,12,13, has allowed for comparable spatial resolution in imaging SPPs, with a time resolution extending down to the few-fs single optical cycle regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent advances in TR-PEEM methods have facilitated the successful spatiotemporal mapping of localized and propagating surface plasmons in a variety of systems14,15,16,17,18, even allowing for experimental access to plasmon phases19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, both NSOM and TR-PEEM have demonstrated sensitivity towards probing the near-field corresponding to SPPs confined to sub-surface interfaces with a spatial resolution of up to 40 nm (refs 19, 21, 22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as TR-PEEM relies on sample-emitted photoelectrons, and scanning-tip-based techniques require physical probe proximity to the evanescent field, both are inherently limited to the study of electromagnetic near-fields that are external to materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the connection between the probed field and the local density of photonic states is not always direct19,24, although PEEM measurements performed in a nonconventional normal incidence geometry largely overcome this issue25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to these restrictions, these techniques are not suited for studies of advanced multilayer systems and heterostructured devices that rely on truly sub-surface plasmonic waves bound to buried interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An alternative method to those mentioned above employs electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in a transmission electron microscope26, either in a spectrum imaging or energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy configuration, enabling 1 nm spatial resolution in the imaging of SPPs in thin films and nanostructures27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, plasmonic guided modes are excited by the transient electric field generated by the fast (80300 keV) electrons traversing the specimen30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In its most widespread spectrum imaging implementation, EELS is combined with an electron beam raster scanning approach, offering temporal imaging resolution down to the millisecond (camera-rate) range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a new technique termed photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM)32 extended the accessible domain of EELS-based experiments to the nm/fs regime by optically exciting SPPs with intense fs laser pulses, and subsequently probing the resulting plasmonic near-fields through their interaction with ultrafast electron bunches33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By virtue of the employed transmission geometry, the SPP near-field is probed along the entire trajectory of these relativistic electrons, which couple to the field component along the electron propagation direction35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By creating an image using only the transmitted electrons that have gained energy through the inelastic scattering by plasmons, PINEM performed in the energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy configuration enables the direct field-of-view imaging of photoexcited plasmonic fields37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to CARS, NSOM and TR-PEEM, the PINEM approach is able to directly access the sub-surface plasmonic near-field of the SPPs bound to buried interfaces, even when such fields are entirely internal to the heterostructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is possible while maintaining a proven sub-10 nm spatial resolution (Supplementary Fig 1), with a 1 nm resolution readily available when further optimized37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-invasive probe does not strongly affect the plasmons being measured and couples exclusively to the evanescent component of the electromagnetic field at the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It thus avoids incident or reflected beam signal contributions and enables a direct image interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PINEM further allows for the tailored study of specific plasmons in any energy range, due to its complete decoupling of the optical excitation and the electron probing mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These advantages, along with the convenient ability to obtain complementary nanoscale morphological, structural and chemical information through static or time-resolved TEM imaging, electron diffraction and EELS in the same setup, make PINEM uniquely suited for probing plasmonics in more complex geometries and advanced multilayer systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, PINEM has been used to image optical near-fields at the surfaces of a variety of materials, nanostructures and biological specimens at energies ranging from near ultraviolet to infrared32,37,38,39,40,41, although these efforts did not track the dynamical behaviour of the photoinduced plasmons or target the material properties of the specimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, the use of PINEM to experimentally access SPP dynamics has remained an open challenge due to the typical SPP lifetime (on the order of 100 fs) being beyond instrumental temporal resolution (to date at best200 fs using 60 fs single optical pulses (Supplementary Fig 2), extendable down to the optical pulse durations through photon gating42), with the latter being primarily limited by the electron bunch duration38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the recent progress in the generation of attosecond electron bunches, there is a lot of potential to improve the time resolution of the PINEM approach even further40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we employ localized, embedded SPP sources to launch SPPs in a two-dimensional (2D) plasmonic waveguide, provided by a buried Ag/Si3N4 interface, allowing the photoinduced plasmons to propagate and interfere over several microns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this geometry, due to the finite time delay needed for plasmon propagation, the scattering of probe electrons by the propagating SPP wave occurs at later times as the distance to the source increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By visualizing and characterizing this temporal dependence using time-resolved PINEM imaging, we could follow the dynamical evolution of the collective plasmonic field propagating at a buried interface with combined ultrafast and nanoscale resolution.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Capturing plasmon dynamics', 'A conceptual scheme of our experiment is sketched in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linearly polarized optical pump pulse is incident on a nanocavity in a Si3N4-supported Ag thin film, launching SPPs of energy ESPP= that are confined to the Ag/Si3N4 interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a variable time delay , the propagating plasmonic wave is then probed by a spatially dispersed pulse of fast electrons, which inelastically scatter from the optically excited SPPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scattering interaction results in the electrons gaining and losing integer numbers of SPP energy quanta33,34,36,40, yielding equidistantly spaced peaks in the energy distribution of the transmitted electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By subsequently constructing an energy-filtered image using only those electrons that have gained energy, one directly obtains a spatially resolved snapshot of the EZ component of the buried plasmonic near-field32,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the large field of view of the electron beam employed here, snapshots recorded at different relative time delays  capture the spatiotemporal evolution of the photoinduced plasmonic wave (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure

pump pulse incident on a nanopatterned Ag-on-Si3N4 bilayer structure generates a surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave propagating along the buried Ag/Si3N4 interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The near-field of the propagating SPP is subsequently probed through its interaction with a field-of-view electron pulse at a time delay .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy-filtered imaging of the resulting electron distribution of transmitted electrons then provides spatially resolved temporal snapshots of the near-field corresponding to the propagating plasmonic wave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Variation of the relative time delay

in this work consisted of a 30 nm Ag thin film deposited on a 50 nm Si3N4 membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variety of different rectangular nanocavity (NC) arrays were patterned into the Ag film using focused ion beam milling (Methods and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To experimentally measure the propagation speed of SPPs at the buried interface, we monitor a large, featureless area adjacent to a linear array of NCs (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical pump beam (diameter 100 m, 0=786 nm, full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) duration 105 fs) and the photoelectron probe beam (diameter 40 m, E0=200 keV, FWHM duration 650 fs) are spatially overlapped at near-normal incidence on the Ag side of the nanopatterned bilayer sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical pump pulses generate SPPs at the edges of the NCs, with each edge coupling to the incident electric field component along the in-plane edge normal43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the NCs fully perforate the metal film, photoexcited SPPs are transmitted through the NCs to the other side of the Ag layer and subsequently launched across the Ag/Si3N4 interface44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first approximation, each NC edge effectively acts as a source of SPPs that travel radially outward in a point-dipole-like pattern at the buried interface45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, according to the HuygensFresnel principle, the interferometric plasmonic wave propagating away from the NC array (along the y axis in Fig 2a) corresponds to the coherent superposition of the SPPs launched from the different NCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2:

the optical pump and electron probe pulse maxima (the chosen arbitrary temporal reference).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the entire frame in Fig 2b gives direct access to the spatial frequencies present in the interference pattern8, and its radial integral is singularly peaked at the spatial period corresponding to the wavelength of the optically driven SPP wave (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can thus directly extract the SPP wavelength SPP,exp and wavevector kSPP=2/SPP,exp as 633±13 nm and 9.94±0.20 m1, respectively, where the errors are due to the uncertainty in the calibration of the PINEM image (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2d depicts the calculated electron energy loss probability for 200 keV electrons transmitted through a model of our layered sample (30 nm Ag on 50 nm Si3N4), plotted as a function of energy loss and momentum transfer normal to the beam direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the relative EELS probabilities for the different plasmon modes it becomes clear that the electron probe mainly couples to the buried plasmon mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the known energy of the optically driven SPPs in the measurements (ESPP=Ephoton=1.58±0.015 eV), we find that the experimentally obtained SPP characteristics indeed match well with the theoretical dispersion of the plasmonic mode propagating at the buried interface (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since PINEM is an ultrafast field-of-view technique, it can track the evolution of the photoexcited plasmonic wave in time, given a sufficient combined spatiotemporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the convolution with finite duration electron bunches, here we can follow its evolution and build-up as it propagates away from the linear NC array on photoexcitation by performing a slice analysis of the PINEM images obtained at different time delays .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As sketched in Fig 3a, we divide up each of the different snapshots in a series of horizontal slices centered at increasing distances y from the NC array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By taking the spatial FFT of these slices for each delay, and integrating the Fourier features corresponding to the SPP interference, we can track the propagation of the plasmonic wavefront in time, as is sketched for a number of discrete slices in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These time traces correspond to the sub-ps cross-correlation of the electron probe and the photoexcited SPP pulse in the different discrete y-ranges in the sample, offset by a temporal difference t due to the SPP wave propagation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining the data of all slices yields a quantitative description of the dynamic behaviour, which directly captures the SPP propagation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3c depicts the temporal centre of Gaussian fits to the cross-correlation time traces of different slicing schemes as a function of the distance y from the NC array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The linear slope of this curve is a direct measure of the group velocity of the composite plasmonic wave, corresponding to approximately a third of the free-space speed of light, vg,exp=(9.4±1.3) × 107 m s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is consistent with that expected from theory for the buried SPP mode, as indicated in Fig 2d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SPP propagation is further visualized in the time-resolved real-space PINEM

domain16,22,47 experiments for plasmons whose near-field extends outside of the waveguide material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, a major advantage of the time-resolved PINEM approach is the ability to measure the propagation characteristics even for truly sub-surface plasmons that are entirely buried inside the material, such as for protected graphene waveguides (Supplementary Fig 6).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The unique combination of characterization and control capabilities offered by PINEM enables new scenarios for nanoplasmonic circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advanced nanopatterning and multilayered designs could be used to exploit the quantum entanglement of plasmons51,52, efficient plasmon sources based on the quantum erenkov effect53,54 or local nonlinear effects at topological defects55, to name a few.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent years, the emergence of methods to make integrated 2D heterostructures56,57 based on graphene58, hexagonal BN59 and the layered transition metal dichalcogenides60, along with the availability of new plasmonic materials61, has opened up many possibilities in nanoscale material design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these materials and techniques offer a comprehensive set of tools to develop and advance plasmon-based technology in a wide range of areas, including plasmonic sensing4, nonlinear plasmonics62 and plasmonic lasers63,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most, if not all, of these applications are anticipated to make use of protected plasmon modes whose near-fields are confined to remain entirely internal to the material heterostructure, such that the time-resolved PINEM approach discussed here provides the only existing experimental means of spatiotemporal access.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the ability to control the spatial shape and temporal evolution of confined plasmonic fields in PINEM enables the implementation of nanoscale experiments to showcase fundamental properties of quantum mechanics39 and coherently manipulate electron beams40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In analogy to the KapitzaDirac effect65,66, describing the interaction between photons and electrons in free space, it was recently shown67 that electron diffraction from standing plasmon waves can be feasible under experimental conditions similar to those achieved in PINEM, paving the way to the active control of electron diffraction for the generation of tailored beams (for example, vortex beams) and other exotic superpositions of electron wave functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Summarizing, in this work we demonstrate the in situ visualization of photoinduced plasmonic interference patterns confined to otherwise inaccessible buried interfaces, enabling a critical tool for the investigation and development of complex plasmonic heterostructures and advanced multilayer devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of ultrafast imaging of plasmon dynamics using PINEM, allowing us to experimentally measure the carrier wavelength and propagation speed of SPPs travelling along buried interfaces directly in the time domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that transient plasmonic interference patterns can be shaped, manipulated and controlled through both the polarization of the excitation light and the nanopatterning architecture, thus facilitating a widely tunable range of nanoscale near-field structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the results presented here represent a considerable advance towards the realization of the recently proposed methodology involving inelastic electron diffraction from transient plasmonic gratings.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
