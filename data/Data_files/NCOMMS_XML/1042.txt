Membraneless water filtration using CO2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Water purification technologies such as microfiltration/ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis utilize porous membranes to remove suspended particles and solutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These membranes, however, cause many drawbacks such as a high pumping cost and a need for periodic replacement due to fouling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show an alternative membraneless method for separating suspended particles by exposing the colloidal suspension to CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissolution of CO2 into the suspension creates solute gradients that drive phoretic motion of particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the large diffusion potential generated by the dissociation of carbonic acid, colloidal particles move either away from or towards the gasliquid interface depending on their surface charge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the directed motion of particles induced by exposure to CO2, we demonstrate a scalable, continuous flow, membraneless particle filtration process that exhibits low energy consumption, three orders of magnitude lower than conventional microfiltration/ultrafiltration processes, and is essentially free from fouling.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'With global demand for clean water increasing, there is a continuing need to improve the performance of water treatment processes1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membraneless separation of suspended particles is conventionally achieved by sedimentation, which relies on the gravitational force3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When particle suspensions are stable, for example, due to the particles being small, neutrally buoyant and highly charged, unassisted sedimentation is ineffective and additives are needed to induce aggregation (coagulation or flocculation4) and accelerate sedimentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, inducing directed motion of colloidal particles in stable suspensions is critical to membraneless separation processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are several ways to induce directed motion of colloidal particles such as using an external force, for example, electrostatic5, dielectric6, magnetic7, acoustic8, or optical9, inertial effects10 and so on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One less known but significant driving force is a chemical gradient, which causes diffusiophoresis11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, diffusiophoresis is observed in liquid environments where chemical gradients are generated by contact between solutions with different solute concentrations12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that diffusiophoresis of colloidal particles can be achieved by dissolution of a gas into a liquid, namely CO2 dissolution into water and its subsequent dissociation that produces ion concentration gradients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this principle, we show that the directed motion driven by dissolution of CO2 can be exploited to separate particles with very low energy consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, CO2 is abundant, biologically benign when dissolved in water, and can be easily separated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features make CO2 dissolution a very promising means to clean water especially for the developing world, which requires water purification technologies that have low energy demands and are not chemically intense2.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'By exploiting the dissolution of CO2 as a way to drive particle motion, we have demonstrated a membraneless method that is capable of separating the types of particles that would otherwise form a stable suspension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to their small size, surface charge, and the absence of dissolved ions to screen the charge (that is, a large Debye length), the particles we separate would be difficult to remove via sedimentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed technique is easily scalable and shows a three order of magnitude lower energy consumption than conventional filtration systems, suggesting the technique could be particularly beneficial in both the developing and developed worlds2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that the proposed technique could be used either to replace microfiltration and ultrafiltration or benefit such conventional filtration processes by mitigating membrane fouling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, considering that most bioparticles are charged32, the proposed method can be utilized to remove bacteria and viruses without chlorination or ultraviolet treatment2,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Efficient scaling-up of the process to significant flow rates requires optimization of the channel dimensions, the flow rate in each channel, the split ratio, and the number of parallel channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While frictional losses can be reduced by using a wider or taller channel, increasing the width decreases the magnitude of the concentration gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced gradients and lower residence times due to higher flow rates can be compensated by using longer channels at the expense of increasing the required energy input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer and narrower channels can also be used to overcome reductions in the diffusiophoretic driving force in applications with sufficient background salt concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the extent of the decrease in the diffusiophoretic driving force with increasing salt concentrations, further experiments with controlled amounts of common salts as well as representative samples with typical mineral contents from industrial and natural water sources would be valuable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term experiments are also needed to assess fouling, such as by proteins or bacterial extracellular polymeric substances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our demonstration of particle transport driven by CO2 dissolution is not limited to particle separation, but may also explain the mechanisms underlying some applications that involve dissolution of CO2, such as the stabilization of bubbles via particle assembly at their surfaces33 and the enhancement of froth flotation through the use of CO2 bubbles34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These applications require collection of particles at gasliquid interfaces, and Fig 1h demonstrates that even hydrophilic particles can be collected at a gasliquid interface from a dilute suspension.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
