An Xist-activating antisense RNA required for X-chromosome inactivation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The transcriptional imbalance due to the difference in the number of X chromosomes between male and female mammals is remedied through X-chromosome inactivation, the epigenetic transcriptional silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-linked Xist long non-coding RNA functions as an X inactivation master regulator; Xist is selectively upregulated from the prospective inactive X chromosome and is required in cis for X inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we discover an Xist antisense long non-coding RNA, XistAR (Xist Activating RNA), which is encoded within exon 1 of the mouse Xist gene and is transcribed only from the inactive X chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective truncation of XistAR, while sparing the overlapping Xist RNA, leads to a deficiency in Xist RNA expression in cis during the initiation of X inactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the Xist gene carries within its coding sequence an antisense RNA that drives Xist expression.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In a shared nucleoplasm, one X chromosome of an identical pair undergoes transcriptional inactivation in mammalian females early during embryonic development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once inactivated, replicated copies of the inactive X chromosome are transmitted as inactive through many rounds of cell division1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both of these reasons, X inactivation is a model of epigenetic regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Xist long non-coding (lnc) RNA is preferentially upregulated from the prospective inactive X and physically coats that X chromosome at the onset of X inactivation2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xist RNA coating is believed to recruit protein complexes that then execute gene silencing on the inactive X (refs 5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How Xist is selectively induced from only one of the two identical X chromosomes is the subject of much debate7,8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we describe the discovery of a novel Xist antisense transcript that is embedded within exon 1 of Xist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This transcript is co-expressed with Xist from the inactive X chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On truncation of the antisense transcript, Xist induction is diminished by 90%, resulting in defective X-linked gene silencing on the inactive X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an Xist antisense RNA activates Xist in cis and is required for X inactivation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Expression of a novel antisense RNA from the Xist locus', 'We previously derived F1 hybrid male and female mouse trophoblast stem (TS) and extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN) cell lines deficient in the expression of the Xist antisense transcript Tsix14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TS and XEN cells represent progenitors of the extra-embryonic lineages that contribute to the placenta and the yolk sac, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both cell types undergo imprinted X inactivation resulting in silencing of genes on the paternal X chromosome15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cell lines, Xist is normally expressed exclusively from the paternal X chromosome and Tsix from the maternal X chromosome14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To confirm that the cell lines lacked Tsix expression, we performed strand-specific PCR with reverse transcription (RTPCR) on RNA purified from Tsix-mutant TS and XEN cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We excluded amplification of genomic DNA in reactions lacking reverse transcriptase in all sets of RTPCRs (Fig 1be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an additional negative control, we included reactions lacking primers in the reverse transcription (RT) step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of amplified cDNAs in such reactions suggested that cell intrinsic primers in purified RNAs can function to reverse transcribe RNAs20 (Fig 1be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Sanger sequencing, these cDNAs proved to be nonspecific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To varying degrees, the same amplified cDNAs were also detected in the test RTPCR samples containing exogenously added RT and PCR primers (Fig 1be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize the spurious RT and PCR amplification by cell intrinsic primers20, including, importantly, of the sense Xist RNA, we implemented a modified RTPCR protocol using tagged RT primers designed to specifically reverse transcribe the antisense transcript (see Methods; primer positions outlined in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the test XTsixY male TS and XEN samples did not display specific amplification of Tsix (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XTsixX female TS and XEN cells, however, unexpectedly showed a band of the size expected of the Tsix amplicon (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On Sanger sequencing, the cDNA in fact matched the Tsix sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Expression of a novel Xist antisense transcript from the inactive X chromosome.

originated from the inactive paternal X chromosome and not the active maternal X chromosome, as would be expected of Tsix in these cells14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore sought to conclusively determine which of the two X chromosomes is the source of the antisense transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two Xs in our F1 hybrid cells are derived from divergent strains of mice and harbour numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Xist/Tsix sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the X chromosome harbouring the intact Tsix locus is derived from the Mus molossinus JF1 strain (XJF1), the XTsix X chromosome is inherited from a Mus musculus laboratory strain14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exploited a known SNP in the RTPCR amplicon to distinguish which X chromosome transcribes the antisense RNA by Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that in both TS and XEN cells, the inactive paternal X chromosome is indeed the source of the transcript (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next assayed Xist antisense expression in wild-type (WT) F1 hybrid male and female TS and XEN cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish parent-of-origin-specific from strain-specific bias in expression, we also tested F1 hybrid TS and XEN cells generated from the reciprocal parental cross14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both sets of cells, while one X is the Mus molossinus-derived XJF1 X chromosome, the other X is derived from a M. musculus laboratory strain (XLab), as in Fig 1b (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TS and XEN cells derived from both the initial (F1i) and reciprocal (F1r) crosses displayed the specific amplification of antisense RNA(s) in males as well as females (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNP profiling of the amplified cDNAs demonstrated that Xist antisense transcription occurs from both the maternal (active) and paternal (inactive) X chromosomes in females (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Tsix is expressed from the maternal X in the amplicon assayed, the Xist antisense transcript originating from the paternal X is distinct from Tsix, in agreement with Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We termed this novel inactive X-specific Xist antisense transcript XistAR (Xist Activating RNA; see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also independently confirmed XistAR expression from the inactive X by strand-specific RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single-stranded RNA FISH probe designed to hybridize specifically to Xist antisense transcripts detected a signal that coincided with or was adjacent to the Xist RNA-coated inactive X chromosome in a subset of nuclei in both TS and XEN cell lines (probe location shown in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probe unexpectedly did not detect Tsix RNA on the maternal X chromosome in the cells, potentially owing to its lower expression in these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next tested if the third primary developmental lineage from the early mouse embryo, the epiblast, also expressed XistAR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pluripotential epiblast cells generate all the cells of the embryo proper and give rise to epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs)19,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the epiblast and EpiSCs undergo random inactivation of either the maternal or the paternal X chromosome in individual cells23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a randomly inactivated population of cells, however, it is not possible to deduce allele-specific expression of X-linked genes by RTPCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore utilized EpiSCs in which X inactivation was biased absolutely in favour of one of the two Xs by assaying XistAR expression in an F1 Tsix-heterozygous EpiSC line23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this hybrid EpiSC line, the M. musculus-derived XTsix is the inactive X in all cells, while the M. molossinus-derived XJF1 is the active X23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We again detected an Xist antisense transcript of the expected size in females but not in males, and only from the inactive XTsix in females (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed inactive X-specific XistAR expression by RNA FISH in WT EpiSCs (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, stem cells of all three lineages of the early embryo express XistAR only in females and exclusively from the inactive X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then wished to know if XistAR RNA is detected from the inactive X in cells of the developing embryo itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assayed the expression of XistAR by strand-specific RNA FISH in embryonic day (E) 3.5 mouse blastocysts, which undergo imprinted inactivation of the paternal X in all cells26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A substantial percentage of E3.5 nuclei (28%) displayed XistAR signal adjacent to or overlapping with Xist RNA coat (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We similarly tested E6.5 extra-embryonic ectoderm cells, which maintain imprinted X inactivation17, and observed XistAR expressed from the inactive X in 40% of the nuclei (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that 48% of the randomly inactivated E6.5 epiblast cells displayed inactive X-specific XistAR expression (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both in stem cell lines and in the embryo, XistAR is expressed from the inactive X chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That XistAR was not detected in all nuclei may be explained by its low expression or by inefficient probe hybridization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: XistAR expression in embryos.Detection of XistAR in

5 RLM-RACE exploits the 7mG cap at the 5 end of RNA polymerase II-transcribed RNAs to precisely map the 5 end of RNAs27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using total RNA from TS cells, we thereby mapped the 5 end of XistAR RNA to base pair (bp) 2,802 of Xist, which is in exon 1 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attempted to map the 3 end of XistAR RNA by 3 RACE, but were unsuccessful, presumably due to the absence of a poly-A+ tail at the 3 end of XistAR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, neither 5 RACE nor RTPCR with poly-A+ selected RNAs amplified XistAR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore mapped the 3 end of XistAR by overlapping RTPCRs with total RNAs followed by SNP profiling (Fig 3cf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3 end maps to bp 13 at the very 5 end of Xist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We independently delineated XistAR structure by RNA FISH using overlapping strand-specific probes (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple RTPCR amplicons and RNA FISH probes  greater than 5 kb upstream of Xist did not detect inactive X-specific

XistAR transcript) (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A larger fragment extending to Xist bp 3,500 did not display stronger promoter activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although weaker than the Xist P1 promoter, the

sense transcription within Xist exon 1 is disrupted via the insertion of a human -globin intronic cassette harbouring multiple polyadenylation sequence (mpA) in the antisense orientation at bp 933 of Xist (TsixpA; XpA) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34) (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, we used a strain that contained the same intronic cassette but without the mpA sequence (XistIVS; XIVS) (refs 34, 35) (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both strains were originally generated to examine Tsix function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of the mpA sequence truncates antisense expression in TsixpA; its absence leaves the XistIVS allele relatively unaffected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, sense transcription can still occur due to splicing donor and acceptor sequences that flank the inserted cassette in the sense orientation in both the TsixpA and XistIVS alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first examined E3.5 blastocyst-stage embryos, since XXpA embryos display lethality shortly thereafter during gestation34.

mature Xist RNA in XXpA and XXIVS embryos (Fig 6e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest a role for XistAR expression in driving or enhancing Xist expression rather than in mediating Xist elongation.

offered a venue to address this possibility, since a poly-A+ sequence is added to XistAR in the TsixpA mutation (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On assaying XistAR expression upstream of the inserted cassette (that is, towards the 5 end of XistAR) by RTqPCR, we found that the XXpA blastocysts did not exhibit a significant increase in XistAR abundance compared with XXIVS and XX embryos (Fig 6f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inclusion of a poly-A+ tail, therefore, did not appear to increase the stability of the XistAR transcript (Fig 6f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the absence of a poly-A+ tail may not be a contributing factor in the low XistAR levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also tested if Tsix is ectopically expressed from the paternal X in XJF1XpA blastocysts, as would be expected if Xist RNA is

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we have identified and functionally characterized a novel Xist antisense lncRNA, XistAR, that is expressed only from the inactive X chromosome and which we propose is required for robust expression of Xist RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intriguing possibility is that XistAR functions as an enhancer RNA (eRNA) to induce Xist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  eRNAs are broadly transcribed from enhancers and may contribute to their function (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like XistAR, eRNAs exhibit a 5 cap are often not spliced or polyadenylated, and have short half-lives compared with mRNAs42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enhance Xist expression, the transcription of XistAR, rather than the RNA itself, may be sufficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since XistAR is transcribed close to the 5 end of Xist, the act of its transcription may remodel the shared chromatin and mark it as transcriptionally competent, thus facilitating Xist expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, in the TsixpA mutants XistAR transcription does not reach the 5 end of Xist and Xist expression is reduced by 90%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, that in the XistIVS mutant blastocysts Xist expression does not decrease despite the insertion of  greater than 1 kb sequence also supports a functional role for antisense transcription and not the XistAR RNA itself in Xist induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we cannot rule out a role for the XistAR RNA in enhancing Xist expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In TsixpA, instead of the truncation of XistAR, the added mpA sequence or the larger size of the inserted cassette could formally be responsible for the reduced Xist expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the larger insertion could impede transcription in the vicinity of the cassette.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That Xist expression from both the P1 and P2 promoters is reduced but XistAR expression upstream of the inserted cassette remains unaffected in XXpA compared with XXIVS blastocysts (Fig 6f), however, argues against transcriptional interference by the cassette as the proximate cause of diminished Xist expression from the XpA X chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The 3 end of XistAR lacks a poly-A+ tail but resides in the region of Xist termed the A-repeat, which can adapt thermodynamically stable stemloop secondary RNA structures in solution43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reverse complement of the A-repeat antisense sequence found in XistAR should also be able to base pair to form similar stemloop structures, perhaps conferring stability to the transcript normally provided by a poly-A+ tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, the inclusion of a poly-A+ tail in the TsixpA allele did not increase XistAR abundance relative to XistIVS and WT alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results therefore favour the notion that the low steady-state levels of XistAR are due to weak induction and/or inherently short half-life rather than instability due to the lack of a poly-A+ tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In both mice and humans, Xist transcripts can initiate from two separate start sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each transcript is believed to be driven by its own promoter, P1 and P2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P2 transcript starts 1,503 bp downstream of the P1-driven transcript31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XistAR appears to influence the induction of both Xist transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An amplicon downstream of P2 designed to detect both Xist isoforms by RTPCR demonstrated significantly reduced Xist expression in XXpA embryos (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, an Xist RNA FISH probe generated from Xist exon 7 template that can detect both transcripts shows significantly fewer nuclei with Xist RNA coating in XXpA embryos (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since in TsixpA the -globin intronic cassette is inserted at Xist bp 933, a truncated XistAR transcript that traverses the putative P2 promoter in XXpA embryos is nevertheless incapable of inducing the P2 Xist RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the complete transcription of XistAR appears necessary to induce both Xist P1 and P2 isoforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intriguingly, Tsix and XistAR have opposing effects on Xist expression, despite both being transcribed in the antisense orientation to Xist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas Tsix inhibits Xist expression45,46,47, XistAR appears to induce Xist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The divergent effects of the two RNAs may be explained by differences in the 3 ends of the two transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tsix is transcribed across the very 5 end of Xist and through the Xist promoter47,48, whereas XistAR transcript ends just shy of the 5 end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of Xist requires that antisense transcription extends across the Xist P1 promoter34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, Tsix but not XistAR may be capable of suppressing Xist expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Both Xist and XistAR traverse the A-repeat sequence at the 5 end of Xist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A-repeat is believed to be important for Xist RNA induction and/or its gene-silencing function38,44,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to Xist, the A-repeat sequence is proposed to be a part of the 1.6-kb RepA transcript that is expressed from within exon 1 of Xist and in the same 5-to-3 orientation as the Xist RNA49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RepA is believed to activate Xist by recruiting polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to the Xist locus49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PRC2 catalyses trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and triggers a transient heterochromatic state within the 5 end of Xist12,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This 5 Xist sequence overlaps with both RepA and XistAR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore possible that a perturbation of the RepA RNA by the inserted human -globin intronic cassette is the cause of Xist RNA diminishment in XXpA embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, that Xist is able to be upregulated in the control XXIVS embryos argues against this notion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We instead propose that the function of the A-repeat in inducing Xist is partly or wholly executed via the antisense XistAR transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, antisense transcription in Xist exon 1 from the inactive X has also recently been documented in human cells50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An earlier study in mice may also have identified an Xist antisense transcript originating from the inactive X in the XistAR interval, as the antisense transcript was amplified in female but not male embryonic stem cells51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to PRC2-catalysed chromatin modification, Xist activation is believed to be controlled by the pluripotency-associated factors such as NANOG and OCT4 (refs 8, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the histone H4 lysine 16 acetyltransferase (H4-K16ac) MOF52,53,54 has been shown to control the pluripotency network and to control Xist expression either through the pluripotency proteins or through Tsix52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, MOF binds the XistAR DNA sequence and acts as a negative regulator of Xist52,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of MOF results in Xist induction from the active X in male embryonic stem cells52,54, potentially via derepression of XistAR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, an attractive hypothesis is that counterbalancing functions of MOF and PRC2 control Xist induction via XistAR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas H4-K16ac may inhibit XistAR expression, PRC2-catalysed H3-K27me3 at the 5 end of Xist induces XistAR and thus Xist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future work will define precisely how XistAR is induced or silenced and how XistAR influences Xist expression.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
