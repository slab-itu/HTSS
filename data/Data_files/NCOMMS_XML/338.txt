miR-22 has a potent anti-tumour role with therapeutic potential in acute myeloid leukaemia  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'MicroRNAs are subject to precise regulation and have key roles in tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the oncogenic role of miR-22 reported in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and breast cancer, here we show that miR-22 is an essential anti-tumour gatekeeper in de novo acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) where it is significantly downregulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forced expression of miR-22 significantly suppresses leukaemic cell viability and growth in vitro, and substantially inhibits leukaemia development and maintenance in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, miR-22 targets multiple oncogenes, including CRTC1, FLT3 and MYCBP, and thus represses the CREB and MYC pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The downregulation of miR-22 in AML is caused by TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A-mediated epigenetic repression and/or DNA copy-number loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, nanoparticles carrying miR-22 oligos significantly inhibit leukaemia progression in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our study uncovers a TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A/miR-22/CREB-MYC signalling circuit and thereby provides insights into epigenetic/genetic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AML, and also highlights the clinical potential of miR-22-based AML therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'As one of the most common and fatal forms of hematopoietic malignancies, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is frequently associated with diverse chromosome translocations (for example t(11q23)/MLL-rearrangements, t(15;17)/PML-RARA and t(8;21)/AML1-ETO) and molecular abnormalities (for example, internal tandem duplications of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) and mutations in nucleophosmin (NPM1c+))1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite intensive chemotherapies, the majority of patients with AML fail to survive longer than 5 years2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, development of effective therapeutic strategies based on a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AML is urgently needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual miRNAs may play distinct roles in cancers originating from different tissues or even from different lineages of hematopoietic cells4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unclear whether a single miRNA can play distinct roles between malignancies originating from the same hematopoietic lineage, such as de novo AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although around 30% of MDS cases transform to AML, the genetic and epigenetic landscapes of MDS or MDS-derived AML are largely different from those of de novo AML5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MDS and MDS-derived AML are more responsive to hypomethylating agents than de novo AML7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular mechanisms underlying the distinct pathogenesis and drug response between MDS (or MDS-derived AML) and de novo AML remain unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ten-eleven translocation (Tet1/2/3) proteins play critical transcriptional regulatory roles in normal developmental processes as activators or repressors8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the frequent loss-of-function mutations and tumour-suppressor role of TET2 observed in hematopoietic malignancies11,12,13, we recently reported that TET1 plays an essential oncogenic role in MLL-rearranged AML where it activates expression of homeobox genes14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is unknown whether TET1 can also function as a transcriptional repressor in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Tet1-mediated regulation of miRNA expression has rarely been studied10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, we demonstrate that miR-22, an oncogenic miRNA reported in breast cancer and MDS15,16, is significantly downregulated in most cases of de novo AML due to TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3A-mediated epigenetic repression and/or DNA copy-number loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  miR-22 functions as an essential anti-tumour gatekeeper in various AML and holds great therapeutic potential to treat AML.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'The downregulation of miR-22 in de novo AML', 'Through Exiqon miRNA array profiling, we previously identified a set of miRNAs, such as miR-150, miR-148a, miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-184, miR-342, miR-423 and miR-22, which are significantly downregulated in AML compared with normal controls17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we showed that among all the above miRNAs, miR-150 and especially miR-22 exhibited the most significant and consistent inhibitory effect on MLL-AF9-induced cell immortalization in colony-forming/replating assays (CFA) (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the reported upregulation of miR-22 in MDS16, our original microarray data17 (Fig 1a,b) and new quantitative PCR-independent validation data (Supplementary Fig 1b) demonstrated a significant and global downregulation of miR-22 in de novo AML relative to normal controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, miR-22 is significantly downregulated in AML samples (P less_than 0.05) compared with all three sub-populations of normal control cells, that is, normal CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), CD33+ myeloid progenitor cells, or mononuclear cells (MNCs) (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of miR-22 is significantly downregulated in all or the majority of individual subsets of AML samples than in the normal CD33+ or CD34+ cell samples (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: miR-22 inhibits AML cell transformation and leukemogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Exiqon microRNA profiling assay showed that miR-22 is significantly (P less_than 0.05) downregulated in the entire set of AML set (n=85) (a) or each individual subset (b), relative to normal controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression data were log(2) transformed and mean-centred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  values were shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Comparison of effects of in-house miR-22, miR-22_Song16 and miR-22 mutant (miR-22mut;

conversely, miR-22 knockout20 significantly enhanced colony forming (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that miR-22 likely plays a broad anti-tumour role in AML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In accordance with the potential anti-tumour function of miR-22 in AML, miR-22 was expressed at a significantly higher level (P less_than 0.05) in human normal CD33+ myeloid progenitor cells than in more immature CD34+ HSPCs or MNC cells (a mixed population containing both primitive progenitors and committed cells) (Fig 1a,b), implying that miR-22 is upregulated during normal myelopoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we showed that miR-22 was also expressed at a significantly higher level in mouse normal bone marrow (BM) myeloid (Gr-1+/Mac-1+) cells, relative to lineage negative (Lin) progenitor cells, long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs), short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), and committed progenitors (CPs) (Supplementary Fig 1e), further suggesting that miR-22 is upregulated in normal myelopoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The anti-tumour effect of miR-22 in the pathogenesis of AML', 'Through bone marrow transplantation (BMT) assays, we showed that forced expression of miR-22 (but not miR-22 mutant) dramatically blocked MLL-AF9 (MA9)-mediated leukemogenesis in primary BMT recipient mice, with a more potent inhibitory effect than miR-150 (Fig 1e; Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All MA9+miR-22 mice exhibited normal morphologies in peripheral blood (PB), BM, spleen and liver tissues (Fig 1f), with a substantially reduced c-Kit+ blast cell population in BM (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forced expression of miR-22 also almost completely inhibited leukemogenesis induced by MLL-AF10 (Fig 1g; Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, miR-22 knockout significantly promoted AML1-ETO9a (AE9a)-induced AML (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the repression of miR-22 is critical for the development of primary AML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, forced expression of miR-22 in MLL-AF9 and MLL-AF10 leukaemia mouse models caused only a 23-fold increase in miR-22 expression level (Supplementary Fig 2a), in a degree comparable to the difference in miR-22 expression levels between human AML samples and normal controls (Fig 1a), suggesting that a 23-fold change in miR-22 expression level appears to be able to exert significant physiological or pathological effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To examine whether the maintenance of AML is also dependent on the repression of miR-22, we performed secondary BMT assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forced expression of miR-22 remarkably inhibited progression of MLL-AF9-, AE9a- or FLT3-ITD/NPM1c+-induced AML in secondary recipient mice (Fig 2ad), resulting in largely normal morphologies in PB, BM, spleen and liver tissues (Fig 2b;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It remains poorly understood how TET proteins mediate gene regulation in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that in de novo AML, it is TET1, but not TET2 (a reported direct target of miR-22 in MDS and breast cancer15,16), that inversely correlates with miR-22 in expression and negatively regulates miR-22 at the transcriptional level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likely together with GFI1, TET1 recruits polycomb cofactors (for example, EZH2/SIN3A) to the miR-22 promoter, leading to a significant increase in H3K27me3 occupancy and decrease in RNA pol II occupancy at that region, and thereby resulting in miR-22 repression in AML cells; such a repression can be abrogated by ATRA treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study uncovers a novel epigenetic regulation mechanism in leukaemia involving the cooperation between TET1/GFI1 and polycomb factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Besides GFI1, it was reported that LSD1 is also a binding partner of TET1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, LSD1 is known as a common binding partner shared by TET1 and GFI1, and mediates the effect of GFI1 on hematopoietic differentiation51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that LSD1 might also participate in the transcriptional repression of miR-22 as a component of the GFI1/TET1 repression complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously reported that TET1 cooperates with MLL fusions in positively regulating their oncogenic co-targets in MLL-rearranged AML14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that TET1 can also function as a transcriptional repressor (of a miRNA) in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The requirement of TET1-mediated regulation on expression of its positive (for example, HOXA/MEIS1/PBX3)14 or negative (for example, miR-22) downstream effectors in leukemogenesis likely explains the rareness of TET1 mutations in AML53, and highlights its potent oncogenic role in leukaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The aberrant activation of both CREB and MYC signalling pathways has been shown in AML24,25,26,54,55, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that the activation of these two signalling pathways in AML can be attributed, at least in part, to the repression of miR-22, which in turn, results in the de-repression of CRTC1 (CREB pathway), FLT3 and MYCBP (MYC pathway), and leads to the upregulation of oncogenic downstream targets (for example, CDK6, HOXA7, BMI1, FASN and HMGA1) and downregulation of tumour-suppressor downstream targets (for example, RGS2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we uncover a TET1/GFI1/EZH2/SIN3AmiR-22CREB-MYC signalling circuit in de novo AML, in which miR-22 functions as a pivotal anti-tumour gate-keeper, distinct from its oncogenic role reported in MDS or MDS-derived AML16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our study together with the study of Song et al.16 highlight the complexity and functional importance of miR-22-associated gene regulation and signalling pathways in hematopoietic malignancies, and may provide novel insights into the genetic/epigenetic differences between de novo AML and MDS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings also highlight the possibility of using miR-22-based therapy to treat AML patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our proof-of-concept studies demonstrate that the nanoparticles carrying miR-22 oligos significantly inhibit AML progression and prolong survival of leukaemic mice in both BMT and xeno-transplantation models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, miRNA-based nanoparticles have already entered clinical trials56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be important, in the future, to further test the combination of miR-22-carrying nanoparticles (or small-molecule compounds that can induce endogenous expression of miR-22) with standard chemotherapy agents (cytosine arabinoside and anthracycline), or with the emerging small molecule inhibitors against MYC and/or CREB pathway effectors, to achieve optimal anti-leukaemia effect with minimal side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our results suggest that restoration of miR-22 expression/function (for example, using miR-22-carrying nanoparticles or small-molecule compounds) holds great therapeutic potential to treat AML, especially those resistant to current therapies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
