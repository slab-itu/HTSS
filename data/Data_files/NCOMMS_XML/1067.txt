Myomerger induces fusion of non-fusogenic cells and is required for skeletal muscle development  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite the importance of cell fusion for mammalian development and physiology, the factors critical for this process remain to be fully defined, which has severely limited our ability to reconstitute cell fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myomaker (Tmem8c) is a muscle-specific protein required for myoblast fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of myomaker in fibroblasts drives their fusion with myoblasts, but not with other myomaker-expressing fibroblasts, highlighting the requirement of additional myoblast-derived factors for fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that Gm7325, which we name myomerger, induces the fusion of myomaker-expressing fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, myomaker and myomerger together confer fusogenic activity to otherwise non-fusogenic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myomerger is skeletal muscle-specific and genetic deletion in mice results in a paucity of muscle fibres demonstrating its requirement for normal muscle formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myomerger deficient myocytes differentiate and harbour organized sarcomeres but are fusion-incompetent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings identify myomerger as a fundamental myoblast fusion protein and establish a system that begins to reconstitute mammalian cell fusion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The fusion of plasma membranes is necessary for numerous biological processes from conception to the development of skeletal muscle, osteoclasts, trophoblasts and giant cells1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular regulation of fusion is poorly understood and the reconstitution of fusogenicity has not been achieved with mammalian proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the factors that directly participate in membrane coalescence have not been identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of systems that reconstitute fusion in the absence of other processes allow identification of nodal fusion machinery and associated molecular mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the Caenorhabditis elegans fusogen epithelial fusion failure (Eff-1) is sufficient to fuse typically non-fusing cells2,3 and mechanisms of intracellular membrane fusion were partially revealed through reconstitution of SNAREs on synthetic membranes4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, discoveries of specific fusion proteins and development of reconstitution systems have been historically critical to decipher multiple types of membrane fusion, however these systems are lacking for mammalian cellular fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Myoblast fusion is a highly regulated process essential for muscle formation during development and regeneration7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While numerous proteins have been shown to contribute to mammalian myoblast fusion8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, myomaker is the only known muscle-specific protein absolutely required for this process19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although its biochemical function is unknown, expression of myomaker in fibroblasts or mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) induces their fusion with muscle cells21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myomaker-expressing fibroblasts do not fuse to each other indicating that these cells harbour a competency to fuse, but only in the presence of a fusogenic cell (such as muscle cell).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, additional myocyte factors that confer fusogenicity would be required for reconstitution of fusion in myomaker+ fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding also suggests that unlike virus-cell fusion23 or C. elegans epithelial cell fusion2, which are both controlled by single factors, namely vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Eff-1 respectively, mammalian muscle cell fusion is regulated by multiple proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using the idea that additional factors necessary for fusion would be expressed on myocytes but not fibroblasts, we discovered that Gm7325 (myomerger) is sufficient to fuse myomaker-expressing fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell mixing experiments reveal that while myomaker renders cells fusion competent, myomerger induces fusogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that myomerger is exclusively expressed in skeletal muscle only during developmental and regenerative myogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of myomerger in myoblast cell lines and in the mouse, through Cas9-mutagenesis, generates non-fusogenic myocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study shows that myomerger controls myoblast fusion and, together with myomaker, reconstitutes cell fusion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Identification and fusogenic activity of myomerger', 'To uncover potential fusion factors, we compared genes induced by expression of MyoD to their level of expression in 10T ½ fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the top 100 MyoD-regulated genes not expressed in fibroblasts (Supplementary Table 1) we eliminated genes not likely to be directly involved in fusion (transcription factors, sarcomeric and metabolic genes) and focused on genes with transmembrane domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis yielded the following five genes: Tmem182, Gm7325, Cdh15, Tspan33 and Tm6sf1, however Cdh15 was omitted from further analysis because it is not necessary for myoblast fusion or muscle formation24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We retrovirally expressed each gene in myomaker+ GFP+ fibroblasts and assayed for fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Appropriate expression in fibroblasts was verified through quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed mainly mono-nucleated GFP+ cells in all cultures except when Gm7325 was expressed where widespread multi-nucleated cells were present (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the ability of Gm7325 to induce fusion of myomaker+ fibroblasts and the observations described below we named the protein myomerger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Induction of fibroblast fusion by

yields a protein with 84 amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the longer transcript utilizes an upstream exon with an alternative start site and results in a protein of 108 amino acids (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single coding exon of the short transcript is conserved in other mammalian genomes, including humans, while the upstream alternative exon leading to the longer transcript is not highly conserved (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the initial screen we cloned the Gm7325 locus into a retroviral vector, allowing normal splicing and expression of both short and long transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transduction of myomaker+ fibroblasts with either myomerger-short (S) or myomerger-long (L) induced formation of multi-nucleated cells, indicating both proteins are sufficient for fusion (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, myomerger and myomaker together induced fusion of 3T3 fibroblasts and MSCs (Supplementary Fig 2d), suggesting these two genes could activate fusion in a multitude of cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given that multi-nucleated cells could arise from fusion or replication associated with incomplete cytokinesis, we designed a system to validate that multi-nucleated cells observed in fibroblasts expressing both myomerger and myomaker were generated through fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We engineered two fibroblast cell lines that both express myomaker, with one expressing GFP and the other expressing nuclear-localized TdTomato (NLS-Tom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myomaker+ GFP+ and myomaker+ NLS-Tom+ fibroblasts were infected with a myomerger retrovirus or a control empty retrovirus, mixed, and fusion was assessed (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed cells with multiple nuclei containing both GFP and NLS-Tom in fibroblasts expressing myomaker and myomerger indicating fusion (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of fusion revealed approximately 20% of nuclei were contained in syncytia in cultures where fibroblasts were expressing both myomaker and myomerger (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results confirm that the observed syncytial cells are formed through fusion and that expression of myomaker and myomerger is sufficient to confer fusogenicity in non-fusogenic fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also sought to determine the cell biology of fusion induced by myomaker and myomerger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mixed myomaker+ myomerger+ GFP+ fibroblasts with NLS-Tom+ fibroblasts expressing myomaker or myomerger (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we observed fusion of myomaker+ myomerger+ GFP+ fibroblasts with myomaker+ NLS-Tom+ but not myomerger+ NLS-Tom+ fibroblasts (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected 10% of nuclei in syncytia (Fig 2b), significantly lower than the fusion observed when both cells express myomaker and myomerger (Fig 1b) suggesting an enhanced fusogenic efficiency when cells express both proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, these data indicate that myomerger is not sufficient for fusion in the absence of myomaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This heterotypic nature of fibroblast fusion, where myomaker is required on both cells and myomerger is only required on one cell, are consistent with our previously reported heterologous fusion system between myoblasts and fibroblasts19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that system, myomaker+ fibroblasts that do not express myomerger fused with muscle cells, which express both myomaker and myomerger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this concept, we utilized our heterologous fusion system where fibroblasts were infected with GFP and either empty, myomaker, or myomerger retrovirus, and then mixed with C2C12 myoblasts (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, fusion is detected through co-localization of GFP (fibroblasts) with myosin+ myotubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with empty-infected GFP+ fibroblasts, we detected a significant increase in fusion between myosin+ cells with either myomaker+ GFP+ fibroblasts or myomerger+ GFP+ fibroblasts (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, quantification of myosin+ GFP+ cells revealed that myomerger did not drive the fusion of fibroblasts with muscle cells to the levels observed with myomaker (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data confirm myomaker is required in both fusing cells for in vitro fusion, while myomerger is essential in one fusing cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Efficient fusion

potential expression in embryonic stem (ES) cells25, therefore we interrogated its expression pattern more thoroughly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed qRT-PCR on multiple tissues from postnatal (P) day 5 mice with primers to distinguish the two potential mouse transcripts (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In neonatal tissues, we detected expression of both myomerger transcripts only in skeletal muscle (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the evidence of two myomerger transcripts, immunoblot analysis of skeletal muscle lysates from P5 mice using a commercially available antibody identified a single band at approximately 12 kDa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This band was absent in P28 lysates indicating that myomerger is downregulated after neonatal development (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Skeletal muscle exhibits a robust ability to regenerate due to the presence of muscle stem cells, also known as satellite cells26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed expression of myomerger in mdx4cv mice, which is a mouse model of muscular dystrophy that leads to chronic cycles of degeneration and regeneration28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myomerger expression was detected in diaphragm lysates from mdx4cv mice, but not control diaphragms (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we analysed expression of myomerger in a model of skeletal muscle overload-induced (MOV) hypertrophy and observed up-regulation (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these data demonstrate that myomerger is expressed only during development and is induced during adult myogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Muscle-specific expression

myomerger is regulated as myoblasts differentiate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In C2C12 cells, both Gm7325 transcripts were significantly elevated during differentiation (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, myomerger protein levels were low in proliferating myoblasts (day 0), but increased upon differentiation with expression maintained during myoblast differentiation and fusion into myotubes (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short mouse myomerger protein, but not the long form, is highly conserved among vertebrate species (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After transduction of C2C12 cells with empty, myomerger-S, or myomerger-L we detected an increased upper band in cells expressing either myomerger-S or myomerger-L that co-migrated with the 12 kDa endogenous protein in the empty-infected C2C12 cells (Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A lower band was identified exclusively in myomerger-S lysates suggesting that complex mRNA or post-translational processing results in the endogenous single 12 kDa band observed in WT C2C12 cells and muscle homogenates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both myomerger proteins harbour a hydrophobic region close to the N terminus, where computational analysis of this region indicates a signal peptide or transmembrane domain (Supplementary Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that both variants were found to confer fusogenicity, the significance of the predicted domains is presently unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand subcellular localization, we fractionated C2C12 cells on day 2 of differentiation and identified myomerger in membrane fractions containing caveolin-3, a protein known to associate with both heavy and light vesicles (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunostaining of fibroblasts expressing myomerger-S or myomerger-L shows that both proteins exhibit similar diffuse and vesicular localization (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, myomerger associates with membrane compartments consistent with its ability to induce fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Myomerger controls myoblast fusion', 'The ability of myomerger to induce fusion of myomaker-fibroblasts, and its muscle-specific expression in the mouse, suggests that myomerger may play a critical role during myogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To begin to decipher the role of myomerger in myogenesis, we evaluated its function during myoblast differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to disrupt myomerger in C2C12 myoblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two guide RNAs (gRNA) were designed to target the largest exon of Gm7325, which resulted in a 166 base pair deletion thereby disrupting both mouse transcripts (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C2C12 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing Cas9 with an IRES-GFP and myomerger gRNAs, or transfected with only Cas9-IRES-GFP as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flow cytometry of GFP+ cells followed by genotyping through PCR analysis revealed disruption of the myomerger locus (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myomerger was not detectable in myomerger KO C2C12 cells confirming efficient disruption of the locus (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control and myomerger KO C2C12 cells were then analysed for their ability to differentiate and form myotubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT myoblasts differentiated, as indicated by myosin+ cells, and fused to form multi-nucleated myotubes (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, myomerger KO C2C12 cells exhibited the ability to differentiate but lacked fusogenic activity to form myotubes (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, quantification of the differentiation index revealed no difference in the percentage of myosin+ cells between WT and myomerger KO cultures (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, quantification of fusion demonstrated that myomerger KO myosin+ cells remain mono-nucleated while WT cells fuse (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qRT-PCR analysis for the myogenic genes Myogenin, Myh4, Ckm and Tmem8c (myomaker) further indicated that myomerger KO myoblasts activate the differentiation program (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, myogenic transcripts were elevated in myomerger KO cells potentially suggesting a feedback mechanism by which non-fusogenic cells attempt to further differentiate (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infection of myomerger KO C2C12 cells with either myomerger-S or myomerger-L rescued the fusion defect demonstrating that the phenotype in these cells is specifically due to the loss of myomerger and not an off-target effect of Cas9 (Supplementary Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis from these lysates shows re-expression of myomerger in KO cells (Supplementary Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a potential mechanism for the lack of fusion in myomerger KO myocytes, we examined expression and localization of myomaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On day 2 of differentiation, myomerger KO cells exhibited normal expression and localization of myomaker (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we did not detect widespread co-localization between myomaker and myomerger suggesting that myomerger does not directly regulate myomaker distribution (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data reveal that myomerger is necessary for myoblast fusion in vitro through a mechanism that does not involve regulation of myomaker levels or localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Requirement of

lethality of 9 of the 10 F0 pups, suggesting that the high efficiency of Cas9 leads to homozygous deletion of myomerger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The one remaining pup was heterozygous for myomerger (Supplementary Fig 5a) and sequencing of the mutant PCR product revealed the presence of the same mutation as was achieved in C2C12 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heterozygous founder was mated to WT mice for multiple generations, which controlled for potential off-target effects given that we only selected pups with the Gm7325 mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterozygous mice from these litters were then

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we report the discovery of an additional muscle-specific factor required for myoblast fusion and developmental myogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While myomaker and myomerger are both necessary for muscle formation, E17.5 myomerger KO embryos grossly exhibit more myocytes compared with embryos lacking myomaker suggesting that these two key myoblast fusion proteins may have distinct functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent publication suggests that myomaker and myomerger physically interact30, although we did not detect robust co-localization indicating that the potential interaction could be transient or occur at discrete cellular locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The precise biochemical function of these two fusion proteins is not known, however the fibroblast cell fusion system developed here, through expression of myomaker and myomerger, provides a unique platform to decipher these mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, our data from the cell mixing experiments reveal that myomaker is necessary in both fusing cells while myomerger is only required in one fusing cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that, for reconstitution of cell fusion, both fusing cells must become fusion competent (amenable to fuse), while only one cell needs to become fusogenic to allow syncytial formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this concept in mind, our data suggest that myomaker allows the cell to become fusion competent, whereas myomerger confers fusogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell mixing experiments also indicate that myomerger requires myomaker activity for fusogenic function because myomerger-expressing fibroblasts do not fuse to fibroblasts expressing both myomaker and myomerger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data potentially suggest that myomerger acts downstream of myomaker, where myomaker acts as an initiator of fusion and myomerger executes the final steps to drive syncytial formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The distinct consequences of myomaker and myomerger expression in fibroblasts are consistent with the idea that the two proteins regulate different aspects of fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Membrane fusion is a complex process that includes membrane apposition and tethering, mixing of the outer membranes (hemifusion), pore formation, and pore expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Classical viral fusogens, as well as Eff-1, are large proteins with long ectodomains that are able to accomplish all of the steps necessary for fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the discovery of myomerger as an additional myoblast fusion factor indicates that in higher organisms these multiple functions of viral proteins have been delegated to different myocyte proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This evolutionary strategy, at least in the case of muscle fusion, could provide more regulatory control to ascertain that cells are compatible for fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'How a relatively small protein, such as myomerger, induces membrane fusion is not understood although there is some precedence for small proteins activating fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins are a class of nonenveloped viral proteins that induce syncytium formation31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that myomerger associates with membranes it is tempting to speculate that it functions to alter membrane dynamics that overcomes the thermodynamic barriers for fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another intriguing possibility, proposed by the data from the Sampath group29, is that myomerger activates fusion through cytoskeletal alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This potential function for myomerger would be consistent with induction of fusogencity as cytoskeletal alterations provide the necessary tension to induce membrane fusion in various systems32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our identification of a second fusogenic factor reveals the complexity of plasma membrane fusion in mammalian cells, and highlights the potential for additional discoveries through utilization of the fusion reconstitution system achieved through co-expression of myomaker and myomerger.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
