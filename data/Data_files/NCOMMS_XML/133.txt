Branched-chain amino acid catabolism is a conserved regulator of physiological ageing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ageing has been defined as a global decline in physiological function depending on both environmental and genetic factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify gene transcripts that are similarly regulated during physiological ageing in nematodes, zebrafish and mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe the strongest extension of lifespan when impairing expression of the branched-chain amino acid transferase-1 (bcat-1) gene in C. elegans, which leads to excessive levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that BCAAs reduce a LET-363/mTOR-dependent neuro-endocrine signal, which we identify as DAF-7/TGF, and that impacts lifespan depending on its related receptors, DAF-1 and DAF-4, as well as ultimately on DAF-16/FoxO and HSF-1 in a cell-non-autonomous manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcription factor HLH-15 controls and epistatically synergizes with BCAT-1 to modulate physiological ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly and consistent with previous findings in rodents, nutritional supplementation of BCAAs extends nematodal lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, BCAAs act as periphery-derived metabokines that induce a central neuro-endocrine response, culminating in extended healthspan.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'While the process of ageing has been fascinated humankind for several thousands of years, interventions that reproducibly delay physical decline have first been described less than a century ago1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the rise of genetic methods, specific pathways that control the process of ageing have been identified and analysed, giving rise to novel approaches to improve quality of life at higher age3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The first systematic studies to identify random mutations associated with longevity were performed in the model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, other organisms including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, rodents and more recently several fish models were employed to dissect genetic pathways linked to physiological ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best-studied one is the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway that has been identified in C. elegans to extend lifespan5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This role has then been extended to other organisms including Drosophila7,8 and rodents9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given its evidently conserved nature, it was anticipated and subsequently confirmed that this pathway may impact human longevity as well12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this and few other signalling pathways mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)15, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)16,17, sirtuins18 or reactive oxygen species19,20 are evolutionary conserved, multiple others appear restricted to individual model organisms with little or no impact to mammals nor humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Concomitantly, unbiased screening approaches to identify ageing-associated genes and pathways have been performed for single model organisms indicating that 1 per cent of coding genes may impact the lifespan of nematodes21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently and to identify conserved pathways that may apply to several species, two invertebrate model organisms have been compared23, and genes identified in S. cerevisiae have been, at least in part, found to be conserved in C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  elegans24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We here have extended these approaches by comparing ageing-related gene expression patterns in three different organisms, namely C. elegans, zebrafish and mice, to identify ageing-related regulations of gene expression levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify a crucial step for the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), encoded by a gene named branched-chain amino acid transferase 1 (bcat-1) to be consistently regulated in three different organisms, and dissect the signalling role of BCAAs in C. elegans to promote increased healthspan.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Identification of ageing-related genes in three species', 'We have studied three well-established model organisms, the invertebrate nematode C. elegans, the vertebrate fish Danio rerio and the mammalian Mus musculus strain C57BL/6J, to identify genes that are similarly regulated on a transcriptional level during physiological ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained skin samples from individual zebrafish and mice, as well as pellets containing 2,000 C. elegans Bristol N2, at three different ages (see Fig 1 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA was extracted from these samples and subjected to Illumina next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 1382 million reads were obtained for each individual sample (Supplementary Data 1,2,3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data analysis had to be restricted to genes for which orthologs could be identified in all three species (C. elegans: 4,850; D. rerio: 6,064; M. musculus: 5,904; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those with transcript levels showing statistically significant differences by both DESeq and edgeR at least between two time points or by the baySeq test over the three time points were regarded as differentially expressed genes (DEG; C. elegans: 3,608; D. rerio: 1,721; M. musculus: 339; Supplementary Data 1,2,3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All DEGs were combined and the expression profiles optimally clustered into six courses, two of which each showed global up- or downregulation with ageing, respectively (Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 13 genes to be upregulated during ageing in all three species, while 16 genes were found to be downregulated (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Sample acquisition and data processing scheme of the trans-species screening approach.RNAs of each sample were sequenced.

confirmed the downregulation of bcat-1 transcript levels during physiological ageing in all three species (Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional support for the important role of BCAT-1 during ageing comes from an analysis of differentially regulated metabolic pathways during ageing in C. elegans, in which we found that the degradation of BCAAs, whose first step is catalysed by BCAT-1, was the most significantly downregulated pathway (26 out of 29 BCAA-metabolizing reaction steps, Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, published metabolomics-based evidence suggest that BCAAs are upregulated in long-lived daf-2 nematodes in a daf-16-dependent manner making them strong candidates for being causally involved in longevity25 while a putative role of bcat-1 has not been analysed in this regard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together these findings suggest that bcat-1 expression may promote ageing, and that ageing organisms may endogenously downregulate this gene, potentially to counteract ageing across species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Validation and characterization of bcat-1 as an ageing-related gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Shows bcat-1 RNA levels in whole-worm RNA

applied RNA-seq to nematodes exposed to bcat-1 RNAi for 5 days, and analysed the number of genes consistently regulated during physiological ageing (Fig 2) as well as in the state of bcat-1 impairment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that physiological ageing and bcat-1 impairment affects DEGs similarly where 45.8% (physiological ageing) and 54% (bcat-1 RNAi) of the respective DEGs overlapped (Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we found that physiological ageing and bcat-1 RNAi up- or downregulate the same DEGs, respectively: while 1700 DEGs were up- and 1378 DEGs were downregulated in the same direction, only 619 and 822 DEGs were regulated in an opposing manner (Fig 7e), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, statistical analysis revealed a highly significant (MonteCarlo, P=0.00099) correlation between DEGs of normal ageing versus bcat-1 RNAi, suggesting a global functional relevance of BCAT-1 for the process of physiological ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Impairing bcat-1 expression promotes C. elegans healthspan', 'We next aimed at quantifying a number of ageing-associated parameters, including the accumulation of previously established ageing pigments26, which was observed to be reduced in 13-days-old nematodes exposed to bcat-1 RNAi (Fig 7f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While interventions to extend lifespan typically reduce fecundity, we did not observe such effect of bcat-1 RNAI treatment (Fig 7g and Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we quantified maximum movement speed of nematodes and found impairment of bcat-1 expression to increase this parameter (Fig 7h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, reduced bcat-1 expression extends lifespan without affecting fecundity, reduces ageing pigments and promotes physical activity, consistent with increased health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Impairing bcat-1 expression increases BCAAs', 'We next questioned whether blocking bcat-1 expression would affect accumulation of its substrates, namely L-leucine,

while L-alanine, L-glutamine and L-glutamate were found to be slightly decreased (Fig 7i), possibly resembling anaplerotic refuelling of the Krebs cycle, while other amino acids remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in BCAAs was independently confirmed using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics (Fig 7j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter methodology in addition indicated a metabolic shift in bcat-1-impaired worms (Supplementary Data 4), further corroborated by RNA-seq pathway analysis of such nematodes (upregulated: neuro-active ligand-receptor interaction (cel04080); downregulated: TGF signalling pathway (cel04350), oxidative phosphorylation (cel00190), BCAA degradation (cel00280)), both in comparison with wild-type controls, at an age of 5 days.

(Supplementary Fig 2c) and L-valine (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that impaired bcat-1 expression may promote lifespan, at least in part, by increasing organismal levels of different BCAAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: Increased BCAAs act through neuronal LET-363/mTOR and peripheral DAF-7/TGF signaling to extend lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Shows lifespan

epistatically relevant, since impairment of hsf-1 abolished lifespan extension (Fig 8b, Supplementary Fig 2g ), and impaired daf-16 expression reduced it almost completely (Fig 8c and Supplementary Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, application of bcat-1 RNAi to nematodes increases phosphorylation of the C. elegans equivalent of the murine Ser326 residue of HSF-1 (Supplementary Fig 2il).

(+38.4%) in organismal free amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased levels of amino acids activate the mTOR pathway, or its C. elegans ortholog let-363, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of this pathway is known to extend lifespan in different species17, being in apparent conflict with our current findings (Figs 7b and 8a, Supplementary Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore repeated the experiments depicted in Fig 7b in the presence of the mTOR-inhibitor rapamycin and the respective solvent control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously observed27, rapamycin extended lifespan of C. elegans (Fig 8d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the effect of bcat-1 on lifespan was reduced by chemically inhibiting LET-363 to the same extent as lifespan was increased by rapamycin alone (Fig 8d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unexpectedly indicates that bcat-1 disruption acts lifespan-extending in a let-363-dependent manner (Fig 8d) paralleled by increased BCAAs and global amino acid levels (Fig 7i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Neuronal mTOR signalling transduces bcat-1 impairment', 'Treatment with RNAi is known to affect all tissues of the wild-type Bristol N2 strain except for neurons, while small molecule-based compounds like rapamycin also act on this latter cell type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This together with the findings summarized above raised the hypothesis that non-neuronal bcat-1 interference would generate a cell-non-autonomous small-molecule signal that exerts its lifespan-extending effects in the neuronal compartment in a let-363-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we used the C. elegans TU3311 strain known to respond to RNAi feeding by preferentially impairing expression of the corresponding gene in neurons only28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impairing expression of let-363 in neurons only had no effect on C. elegans lifespan (Fig 8e), while the effect of reducing bcat-1 in neurons had a strongly reduced, albeit still detectable effect (Fig 8e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, impairing expression of both bcat-1 and let-363 in neurons in parallel almost completely abolished the effect of bcat-1 RNAi on lifespan (Fig 8e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the fact that mTOR transduces availability of anabolic substrates and specifically the BCAA L-leucine in the murine hypothalamus16,29, we next analysed a possible involvement of the nematodal ASI neurons which are considered the hypothalamus equivalent in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we laser-ablated these two neurons in nematodes and found the effect of bcat-1 RNAi (Fig 8f) and L-leucine feeding (Fig 8g) on lifespan to be abolished, while sham-treated worms still responded to the respective intervention (Supplementary Figs 3a, b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether this indicates that peripheral BCAAs activate neuronal let-363 as well as ASI neuron-specific pathways to exert a lifespan-extending response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hypothalamic TGF signalling executes bcat-1 impairment', 'Given this potentially ASI-specific response (Fig 8d,e) as well as the RNA-seq-based pathway analysis (Fig 7l), we next studied the nematodal paralog of mammalian TGF, daf-7, as a putative candidate to explain the BCAA-dependent activation of let-363 in neurons, also since daf-7 expression is restricted to ASI neurons30 and to the daf-16 pathway31,32, while hypothalamic TGF is linked to ageing in mammals33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When exposing a strain with a constitutive inactivation of daf-7, namely daf-7 (m62), to bcat-1 RNAi no effect of this treatment was observed (Fig 8h) opposing the effect in wild-type nematodes (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that ASI-specific release of DAF-7 may execute the effect of bcat-1 impairment on lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further support this, we epistatically tested whether the absence of known DAF-7-receptor genes, namely daf-1 and daf-4, would affect bcat-1 RNAi-mediated lifespan extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the impairment of either daf-1 (Fig 8i) or daf-4 (Fig 8j) expression completely inhibited the bcat-1 RNAi effects on lifespan: while daf-1-mutated worms were long-lived, and so were nematodes treated with daf-4 RNAi, addition of bcat-1 RNAi would not extend lifespan further, indicating that bcat-1 and daf-1/daf-4 epistatically share a downstream pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably and since daf-4 RNAi does not affect neurons, while daf-7 expression is limited to ASI neurons30, this also indicates that this TGF/daf-7 signal qualifies as a cell-non-autonomous feedback loop linking peripheral signals that activate neuronal (and potentially ASI-specific) mTOR back to the periphery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overexpression of bcat-1 impairs lifespan and fecundity', 'We next questioned whether overexpression of bcat-1 would have opposing effects on lifespan, particularly in comparison to states of impaired expression, as shown above (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this purpose, we expressed a bcat-1-complementary DNA (cDNA) 3-/C-terminally fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-cDNA under the control of the endogenous bcat-1 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent microphotographs indicated a reduction of BCAT-1 expression with increasing age (Fig 9a), consistent with the gene expression levels of the endogenous bcat-1 in wild-type worms (Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly and opposing the findings on bcat-1 RNAi (Fig 7b), overexpression of bcat-1 shortens C. elegans lifespan (Fig 9b), further supporting a regulatory role in the regulation of lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, overexpression of bcat-1 decreased fertility of nematodes (Fig 9c) that, from an evolutionary perspective, suggests a selective advantage of low bcat-1 expression levels, notably independent of ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Increased BCAA catabolism and specifically increased activity of the corresponding enzyme, BCAT, has been linked to various pathological states, including accelerated growth of malignant gliomas34, decreased sepsis survival35 and increased accumulation of liver fat36, the latter being linked to a number of metabolic diseases37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, systemic disruption of one BCAT isoform38, namely BCATm, in mice increases energy expenditure and reduces body weight39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'More specifically, L-leucine is capable of reducing food uptake in rodents when injected into the hypothalamus, notably depending on neuronal mTOR (refs 16, 29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, others have linked hypothalamic BCAAs to increased insulin resistance, providing a potential link to type 2 diabetes40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since nematodal ASI neurons are considered the homologue of the mammalian hypothalamus42, and ablation of these two neurons abolishes the effect of both L-leucine (Fig 8g) and bcat-1 RNAi (Fig 8f), the effect of increasing organismal L-leucine levels on lifespan (Fig 7b,i,j) may be translatable into mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, feeding increased amounts of BCAAs to middle-aged mice did improve healthspan depending on induction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase43, an enzyme not known in C. elegans44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, other hypothalamic signals have been recently linked to the regulation of lifespan in rodents45,46, while mTOR signalling has not been tested in this regard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Global inhibition of mTOR is generally considered to promote lifespan in different species17 including C. elegans27 (also confirmed by our control findings, Fig 8d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast and unexpectedly, we here find that activation of mTOR in nematodal neurons due to a peripheral BCAA signal promotes lifespan (Fig 7e) and parameters of healthspan (Fig 7f,h) without affecting fecundity (Fig 7g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exerting the BCAA signal in neurons only still exerts an effect on lifespan, however to a reduced extent (Fig 8e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of mTOR is known to induce HSF-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47), and the latter suppresses daf-7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48), consistent with our findings which link mTOR activation to suppression of daf-7/TGF signalling (Figs 7l and 8hj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since daf-7 is expressed in ASI neurons only30, while its receptors daf-1 and daf-4 act in the periphery49, daf-7/TGF may now be considered to act cell-non-autonomous as a neuro-endocrine hormone that impairs lifespan in otherwise healthy animals in response to evolutionary conserved pathways and amino acid signals derived thereof (Fig 9g).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
