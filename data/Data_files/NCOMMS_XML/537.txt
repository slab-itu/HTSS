Sequences flanking the core-binding site modulate glucocorticoid receptor structure and activity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binds as a homodimer to genomic response elements, which have particular sequence and shape characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the nucleotides directly flanking the core-binding site, differ depending on the strength of GR-dependent activation of nearby genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study indicates that these flanking nucleotides change the three-dimensional structure of the DNA-binding site, the DNA-binding domain of GR and the quaternary structure of the dimeric complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional studies in a defined genomic context show that sequence-induced changes in GR activity cannot be explained by differences in GR occupancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, mutating the dimerization interface mitigates DNA-induced changes in both activity and structure, arguing for a role of DNA-induced structural changes in modulating GR activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our study shows that DNA sequence identity of genomic binding sites modulates GR activity downstream of binding, which may play a role in achieving regulatory specificity towards individual target genes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cells can exploit a variety of strategies to ensure that genes are expressed at a specific and well-defined level, including the tight control of the production process of transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcription of genes is controlled by the coordinated action of transcriptional factors (TFs), which bind to cis-regulatory elements to integrate a combination of inputs to specify where and when a gene is expressed and how much gene product is synthesized1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signals influencing the level of transcriptional output include the sequence composition of cis-regulatory elements that can, for example, direct the assembly of distinct regulatory complexes (reviewed in refs 2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other mechanisms that influence the transcriptional output of individual genes include the distance of regulatory elements to the transcriptional start site (TSS) of genes4, the chromatin context in which regulatory elements are embedded5, DNA methylation6,7 and post-translational modifications of proteins1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a member of the steroid hormone receptor family, the sequence of its DNA-binding site is known to modulate the receptors activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some studies suggests that depending on the sequence of the GR-binding sequence (GBS), the direction of regulation might be influenced, that is, whether GR will activate or repress transcription8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the magnitude of transcriptional activation by GR depends on the exact sequence composition of the GBS, which consists of inverted repeats of two half-sites of 6 base pairs (bp) separated by a 3-bp spacer11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Affinity for specific GBSs can explain some, but not all, of the modulation of GR activity by the sequence composition of the GBSs12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GR activity can also be modulated by DNA shape, which can serve as an allosteric ligand that fine-tunes the structure and activity of GR without apparent changes in DNA binding affinity13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GR can read the shape of DNA through non-specific DNA contacts with the phosphate backbone in the spacer region and at other positions within each half-site11,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, GR contacts the minor groove just outside the core 15-bp GBS11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How the DNA-induced structural changes in the associated protein result in different transcriptional outputs is largely unknown, but requires an intact dimerization interface and may involve sequence-specific cooperation with GR cofactors11,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we further investigated this question and uncovered that the 2 bp flanking the GBS, which are involved in modifying the shape of the DNA target, influence transcriptional output levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first studied if GBS variants can modulate GR activity in a chromosomal context and found that GBS variants can indeed modulate GR activity when integrated at a defined genomic locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this modulation appears to occur downstream of GR binding as the differences in transcriptional responses cannot be explained by differences in occupancy levels based on chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we analysed genome-wide data on GR binding and gene regulation and identified differences in the sequence composition between GBSs associated with genes with strong and those with weak transcriptional responses to GR activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a combination of experiments with atomic resolution and functional studies, we found that the base pairs directly flanking the core 15-bp GBS modulate GR activity and induce structural changes in both DNA and the associated DNA-binding domain of GR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our studies suggest that modulation of GR activity and structure by GBS variation at positions directly adjacent to the core recognition sequence plays a role in fine-tuning the expression of endogenous target genes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genomic GR-binding site sequence affects GR activity', 'Previous studies relied on transiently transfected reporters to show that GBS composition can modulate GR activity11,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if GBS variants can also influence GR activity in a chromosomal context, we used zinc finger nucleases (ZFN) to generate isogenic cell lines with integrated GBS reporters14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GBS reporters consist of a GBS variant upstream of a minimal promoter driving expression of a luciferase reporter gene (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-cell-derived clonal cell lines with integrated reporters were isolated by flow-activated cell sorting (FACS) and genotyped for correct integration at the AAVS1 locus (Supplementary Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our expectation, no induction by dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone, was observed for the reporter lacking a GBS (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reporters with a single GBS, transcriptional activation was observed with sequence-specific activities ranging from 17-fold for the Cgt, to 9-fold for the GILZ and 2-fold for the SGK2 GBS (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, activation of the endogenous GR target gene TSC22D3 was comparable for all clonal lines (Supplementary Fig 1B), arguing that the GBS-specific activities are not a simple consequence of clonal variation in GR activity.

transcriptional activities could be explained by differences in GR occupancy, we compared GR recruitment to the GBS variants by ChIP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all clonal lines, a similar level of hormone-dependent GR recruitment was observed for the endogenous FKBP5 locus, indicating that the ChIP efficiency was comparable between our clonal lines (Supplementary Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the integrated reporter lacking a GBS showed no GR binding, whereas GR was recruited in the presence of a GBS (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no clear correlation between the level of transcriptional activity and GR recruitment was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the GILZ GBS, which showed an intermediate transcriptional activity, showed the highest occupancy whereas recruitment was comparable for the GBSs with the highest (Cgt) and lowest (Sgk2) activities (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together these data show that GBS nucleotide variation can modulate GR activity in a chromosomal context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this modulation appears to occur downstream of recruitment, consistent with the idea that DNA can change the structure and activity of GR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genome-wide computational analysis of GBS variants', 'The experiments with integrated GBS reporters showed that GBS variants can modulate the activity of GR towards target genes in a chromosomal context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether GBS variants may indeed play a role in fine-tuning the activity of GR towards individual endogenous target genes, we analysed genomic data to see if the level of GR activity correlates with the presence of specific GBS variants near genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we first grouped genes regulated by GR in U2OS cells15, a human osteosarcoma cell line, into strong responders (top 20% with greatest fold induction on dexamethasone treatment, 290 genes) and a control group of weak responders (genes with significant changes in expression, log2-fold change  less_than 0.72, 688 genes) (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we associated GR-bound regions, based on ChIP-seq data15, with a regulated gene when a ChIP-seq peak was located within a window of 40 kb centred on the TSS of that gene (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong GR-responsive genes were associated with 543 peaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare our findings, a control group with similar peak number was generated consisting of 532 peaks that were associated with weak GR responsive genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each group of peaks, we conducted a de novo motif search with RSAT peak motifs16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both groups, we identified the GR motif (Fig 2a) and motifs of AP1 and SP1, which are known cofactors of GR17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core GR motif was similar for both groups (Fig 2a) and closely matches the GR consensus sequence15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we observed subtle differences in preferred nucleotides at individual positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the spacer for GBSs associated with weak responders preferentially contains a G or C at position 1, whereas no such preference is observed for GBSs associated with strong responders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with previous studies showing that the sequence of the spacer can modulate GR activity11,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that the nucleotide flanking each half site (position 8 and +8) exhibited high information content in the strong responders data set, with sequence preferences that were different for peaks associated with strong and weak responder genes (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For GBSs associated with strong GR responsive genes, the flanking nucleotide was preferentially an A or T, whereas for GBSs associated with weak GR responsive genes the flanking nucleotide was preferentially a G or C. Because the motifs discovered by the de novo motif search are not necessarily present at different frequencies in the two groups, we quantitatively compared the occurrences of motif matches flanked by A/T and G/C nucleotides 5 and 3 of the core motif, which are associated with strong and weak peaks, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the outcome of the de novo motif search, this analysis showed more motif matches for the A/T flanked motif for strong-responder-associated peaks compared with weak-responder-associated peaks, whereas the opposite was found when we scanned with the G/C flanked motif (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, this suggests that GBS variants may indeed play a role in modulating GR activity towards endogenous target genes, and hint at a possible role in this process for the base pairs directly flanking the half-sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Identification and characterization of high-activity GBS variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Overview

'GBS flanking nucleotides modulate GR activity', "To test the role of base pairs flanking the half-site (position 8 and +8) in modulating GR activity, we generated reporters where we flanked each of five GBS variants (Cgt, FKBP5-1, FKBP5-2, Pal and Sgk) by either A/T or by G/C bp (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reporters displayed comparable basal activities, whereas the level of induction on dexamethasone treatment varied between the sequence variants (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the observations for endogenous GR target genes the A/T flanked GBSs showed higher reporter gene activity than the G/C flanked GBSs for four out of five tested GBS variants, whereas little to no effect of changing the flanks was observed for the Pal sequence (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the activity of A/T flanked Cgt was twice that of the G/C flanked version of this GBS (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these experiments indicated that the proximal flanking nucleotides can indeed modulate GR activity, and from now on we use the term 'flank effect' to refer to the dependency of GR target gene expression on flanking nucleotides of the GBS core motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the Sgk and Cgt GBSs showed the greatest flank effect whereas the effect for the Pal and FKBP5-1 GBSs was small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When comparing the sequences of these GBS variants, we observed that the second half-site (position 27) forms an imperfect palindromic sequence (not matching TGTTCT) for the GBSs with the greatest flank effect (Cgt and Sgk) whereas this sequence is palindromic for Pal and FKBP5-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the imperfect half-site of Cgt and Sgk is responsible for the flank effect, we generated new luciferase reporter constructs with mixed flanking nucleotides 5 and 3 of the core motif (A/C and G/T) (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments showed that the imperfect half-site is indeed mainly responsible for the flank effect, with on average a 98% increase in activity when we change the flank of the imperfect site, whereas this increase was a more modest 18% when we changed the flank of the perfect half-site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'We focused on the Cgt and Sgk GBS in further experiments as they showed the strongest influence of the flanking nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the role of flanking nucleotides in the chromosomal context, we stably integrated a Sgk-GBS luciferase reporter in U2OS cells at the AAVS1 locus to simulate an endogenous gene environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Matching what we observed with the transiently transfected reporters, we again found that integrated A/T flanked Sgk showed a 1.5 times greater reporter activity than the G/C flanked GBS (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, we wondered how the proximal flanks influence GR activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the flank effect might be caused by a change in the intrinsic affinity of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) for GBSs, we conducted electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, arguing against a role for changes in the intrinsic affinity, we found similar Kd values for both A/T and G/C flanked Cgt and Sgk GBSs (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a second approach, we also studied GR binding in vivo to A/T and G/C flanked Sgk versions of the stably integrated reporter constructs from the previous experiment by ChIP (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the GR occupancy of G/C flanked Sgk was twice that of the A/T flanked Sgk (Fig 3c), despite the fact that A/T flanked Sgk leads to higher gene activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, GR binding was essentially the same when comparing the peak height of all endogenous GR ChIP-seq peaks containing an A/T flanked GBS with those flanked by G/C (Supplementary Fig 3), showing that peak height and flanking site sequence are independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, we therefore conclude that the flank effect appears not to be a consequence of changes in DNA-binding affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Effect of flanking sites on binding and on regulation in a genomic context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Transcriptional activation of the

spacer influences DNA shape and GR activity13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether the local structure of the DNA-binding site is affected by the flanking nucleotides of the GBS, we compared DNA shape features between G/C (75 GBSs) and A/T (83 GBSs) flanked GBSs from peaks associated with weakly and strongly upregulated genes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DNA shape features were predicted using a high-throughput method that has been extensively validated based on experimental data19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis showed a slight difference in minor groove width between GBSs flanked by G/C and A/T at positions 8 and +8 (proximal flanks) (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More strikingly, at positions 7, +7, 6 and +6 the predicted minor groove width in A/T flanked GBSs is not only narrower than the rest of the GBS but also narrower than at the corresponding position in G/C flanked GBSs (Fig 4a and Supplementary Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the overall nucleotide composition (given as A/T content in Fig 4a) of the GBS and its surrounding region was comparable for the two groups of sequences, indicating that the effect on the two neighbouring nucleotides is a consequence of changing the sequence of the proximal flanks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also predicted the propeller twist for the same sets of A/T and G/C flanked GBSs and found that the propeller twist differs between the two groups of sequences, especially at positions 8 and +8 (proximal flanks) (Supplementary Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we repeated the DNA shape prediction for individual GBSs, tested previously in the luciferase reporter assays (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the first half-site (positions 7 to 2) is identical in all tested GBSs it is not surprising that all GBSs have a similar minor groove width at these positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, minor groove width of the spacer varies among GBSs, consistent with the known role of the spacer in modulating GR activity13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we focus on the proximal flank of the second half-site (positions 68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both Cgt and Sgk GBSs, the minor groove width at the flanking position +8 is slightly narrower in the G/C flanked version than in the A/T flanked version.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the neighbouring positions +6 and +7 exhibit a narrower minor groove width in A/T flanked versions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that the crucial structural DNA shape change occurs at positions +6, +7 and +8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Pal and FKBP5-1 GBS variants (which do not exhibit a flank effect) the minor groove width is already quite narrow at these positions perhaps explaining why these GBSs do not exhibit a flank effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Effect of flanking sequences on

affect GR-DBD conformation', 'Overall, the predicted changes in DNA structure induced by the flanking nucleotides suggest that DNA shape may serve as an input signal that regulates GR activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if the flanking nucleotides influence GR structure and/or dynamics, we probed the DBD of GR in complex with flank-site Cgt variants by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) spectroscopy experiments in which nuclei of protein backbone amines (1H, 15N) are correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting spectra provide one signal for each amide and depict the so-called protein fingerprint region, which is unique for each protein construct and chemical (for example, binding-dependent) environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, addition of proximal flank Cgt variants resulted in spectral changes when compared with unbound DBD (Supplementary Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we compared the spectra of the complexes between GR DBD and G/C and A/T flanked Cgt

distinguish oligomers with similar conformations or dynamics from one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the assignment and CSP calculation though, it became apparent that several residues, which map predominantly to the DNA-recognition helix 1 (G458, C460 and K461), show split peaks meaning more than one signal for a given DBD amino acid (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, split peaks were not observed for all residues (example shown for Q520, Supplementary Fig 6) and a comparison of apo and DNA-bound GR DBD spectra (Supplementary Fig 5a) showed that the extra peaks are not a simple consequence of having a fraction of GR DBD in our samples that is not DNA-bound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Splitted peak patterns are characteristic for either conformational exchange within each monomer

substitution of A/T by G/C nucleotides at the proximal flank positions indicates the possible presence of two distinct conformations for one of the individual monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Helix 1 sits in the major groove opposite to the minor groove at positions (6, 7/+6, +7) where the flanking nucleotides induce a narrowing of that groove.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the DBD of GR might contact DNA differently, for example, by contacting other nucleotide positions when we change the sequence of the flanks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we analysed the proteinDNA complex again by NMR spectroscopy but this time by not observing the resonances of the protein but those of the DNA itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assigned the imino protons in the 1D spectra for Cgt flanked by either A/T or G/C nucleotides (Supplementary Fig 7A) and titrated both oligonucleotides with increasing amounts of protein to determine whether the proximal flanks influence proteinDNA contacts within the complex (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the crystal structure of the GRDNA complex, these experiments indicate that the DBD contacts both half-sites of the motif at positions 6 (G6), 4 (T41), 3 (G40) or +2 (T14), +4 (T16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On protein addition, we observed a progressive uniform line broadening for both DNAs, indicative of similar Kd values, which is in agreement with EMSA experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we compared the base pairs contacted between A/T and G/C flanked DNAs, the same set of residues showed evidence for binding to the DBD of GR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the imino proton of G46 (position 9), whose resonance is well-resolved, led to a more pronounced broadening in the case of the A/T-flanked DNA (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This base pair located outside the 15-bp consensus sequence interacts with the DBD of GR, in agreement with contacts formed by helix 3 in the crystal structure10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights a very subtle difference introduced by the flanking nucleotides on the proteinDNA complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, our approaches probing changes in the structure indicate that a G/C flank induces several changes in the DBD of GR compared with the GBS with an A/T flank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Flank effect requires an intact dimer interface', 'To investigate how the DBD of GR might recognize the shape of DNA to modulate GR activity, we tested the role of several candidate residues of the DBD that contact the DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As candidates we chose R510, which is part of helix 3 and contacts the flanking nucleotide directly according to the crystal structure11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, K511 might contact the flanking nucleotide and thus shows a significant chemical shift in our NMR experiments on changing the flanks (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we tested K461 and K465, which reside in the DNA recognition helix 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the crystal structure, K461 makes a base-specific contact with the G at position 6/+6 in the major groove opposite to the position where the flank induces a change in minor groove width, whereas K465 contacts the phosphate backbone11,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we mutated R510, K511 or K465 to alanine, the flank effect was still observed arguing against a role of these residues in reading the DNA to modulate GR activity (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutating K461 to an alanine resulted in a marked decrease in GR-dependent activation for the A/T and a slight decrease for the G/C-flanked GBS, consistent with decreased activity found for this mutant in previous studies24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, however, there was still some residual activity for the G/C flanked GBS, the one with the slightly higher affinity (Fig 3b), whereas no activation was seen for the A/T-flanked variant, which is more active for wild-type GR (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interpretation of this result is complicated by the fact that mutating this charged residue alters the binding energetics and potentially structure of the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None the less, our findings suggests that the K461 residue might play a role in

spacer or of GR half sites13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the binding affinity for A/T- and G/C-flanked Cgt showed that GRs affinity was comparable for both sequences for both wild type (Fig 3b) and also for A477T DBD (A/T: 3.1±0.4 M; G/C: 3.5±1.1 M) although the affinity was lower for the mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test if the dimer interface plays a role in mediating the flank effect, we tested the impact of disrupting the dimerization interface on proximal-flank-induced modulation of GR activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As reported previously, mutating A477 of the dimer interface resulted in GBS-specific effects13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the A/T-flanked GBSs Cgt and Sgk, the difference in GR activity between wild type and the A477T mutant was small (Sgk: 8% decrease; Cgt 13% increase, Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, for the flank with the lower activity, G/C, the A477T mutation resulted in a more pronounced increase in activity for both GBSs tested (Sgk: 50% increase; Cgt: 69% increase, Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the difference in activity between the A/T and G/C flanked versions of Cgt and Sgk is smaller for the dimer mutant than for wild type GR (Fig 7b), indicating that the dimerization domain is involved in transmitting the flank effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the dimerization interface lies on the opposite side of the GR monomer relative to the flanking nucleotide position, suggesting that a more global change in GR conformation induced by the flanking nucleotides may occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further elucidate the role of the dimer interface in transmitting the flank effect, we studied the impact of the A477T mutation on proximal-flank induced conformational changes of GR by 2D NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig 5E,F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis uncovered two main results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, several of the residues with significant CSPs for wild type (C460, F464, M505, L507, R511, T512, K514) no longer show a significant shift when we compare the G/C and A/T flanked Cgt for the A477T mutant (Fig 5, Supplementary Fig 5F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, several peaks that show flank-specific patterns of peak splitting for wild type GR (for example, C460) show an overlapping single peak for the mutated A477T DBD (Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that proximal flanks can only induce alternative conformations of the DBD when the dimerization interface is intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these functional and structural analyses of the consequences of disrupting the dimer interface, argue for its role in facilitating flank-induced changes in GR conformation and activity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Specific recognition of DNA sequences by TFs is a consequence of both base readout and shape readout of the DNA-binding site25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to specifying which genes are regulated by a particular TF, the binding site sequence can also play a role in fine-tuning the expression level of genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, binding sites might be able to modulate gene expression as a consequence of differences in affinity12,26,27,28, where high affinity binding sites induce a higher level of transcriptional activation than low affinity binding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in vitro affinity and in vivo activity often do not correlate11,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we find in this study that sequences flanking the core GBS induce changes in activity without apparent changes in affinity derived from in vitro binding studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One explanation for this apparent disconnect between binding affinity and activity could be that in vitro binding affinity does not reflect binding affinity in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, here we also fail to see a correlation when we compare in vivo occupancy derived from ChIP experiments as a proxy for in vivo affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We would like to point out that the interpretation of quantitative comparisons of ChIP efficiencies between binding sites is complicated by possible sequence-specific efficiencies of formaldehyde cross-linking32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we focused on the first flanking nucleotide or proximal flank.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when we changed the second flanking position, we found an even more dramatic effect, where depending on the sequence of this position GR could either robustly activate transcription, or completely lack the ability to activate transcription (Supplementary Fig 8A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, the modulation of GR activity appears independent of binding affinity, and could be a consequence of conformational changes of the DNA (Supplementary Fig 8B,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings argue that GBSs can modulate GR activity downstream of binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structural studies8,11,13, including those presented here, indicate that GBS variants with distinct transcriptional activities induce alternative conformations in the DBD of GR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structural changes can be induced by changing the sequence of the spacer, of the half-sites, or as we show here of the nucleotides flanking the core-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the structure, the side chain of R510 and K511 can contact the flanking nucleotides and thus serve as potential readers that interpret the DNA-encoded instructions and translate these into changes in activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when we change these residues to alanines, the flank effect is still observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that direct contacts with the flanking nucleotides are not responsible for the flank effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the effects of the proximal flanks might be a consequence of the predicted changes in DNA shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA shape, in turn, could induce structural changes in the associated GR dimer partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further understand the molecular basis that gives rise to the aforementioned split peaks in our NMR spectra, we turned to molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate how changing the flanks influences the individual monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we compared the overall trajectories, however, we did not observe significant structural differences for either chain A or chain B when we compared the root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  values between the A/T- and the G/C-flanked Cgt GBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we only observed subtle changes when we compared the root mean squared fluctuation (r.m.s.f.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Supplementary Fig 9), a measure of flexibility of the DBD, between the two Cgt flank variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes that do occur, predominantly map to residues at the dimerization interface (Supplementary Fig 10A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the r.m.s.f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  values for monomer B when bound to the G/C-flanked GBS show higher values than those observed for the A/T counterpart indicating that chain Bs interaction with the DNA for this sequence is more dynamic (Supplementary Figs 10A and 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we compared the median GR-DBD structures (computed from the last 50 ns of the MD simulations) when bound to A/T- or G/C-flanked Cgt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, the deviations between these two structures are only small except for the lever arm, which connects the dimerization interface with the DNA recognition helix (Supplementary Fig 10B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, however, changing the flanking nucleotides appears to result in a different relative positioning of the dimer-halves as can be seen from the median conformations for both flank-variants when aligned on chain A (Supplementary Fig 10C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, our structural approaches showed flank-induced changes in the dynamics and conformation of the dimer partners and in the relative positioning of GR dimer halves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous studies13, we find that GRs ability to read DNA-shape encoded instructions, in this case as a consequence of changing the flanks, requires an intact dimer interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the mutation in the dimerization domain we studied (A477T) does not result in an inability of GR to dimerize in vivo33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our interpretation of the effect of mutating the dimerization interface is that they are a consequence of perturbing an interface important for communication between dimerization partners or for communication between different GR domains of each monomer, rather than a consequence of an inability of the mutant to bind DNA as a dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that mutating the dimer interface diminishes flank-induced changes in both GR structure and activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the dimer interface prevents the monomers from adopting an optimal positioning in the major groove and consequently the dimer partners switch between different conformational states to accommodate conflicting optimal contacts at the dimer interface and those with the DNA (Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might also explain the high degree of flexibility that the dimer interface and connected lever arm display based on the r.m.s.f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  values of the MD experiments (Supplementary Figs 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of the dimer interface might release this stress and allow optimal positioning of both dimer partners for contacting the DNA in the major groove.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, conflicts in the optimal positioning of dimer halves might be relieved when mutating K461, which weakens the interactions between DNA and protein24 thus favouring optimal positioning of the GR partners for interactions at the dimerization interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To link the structural changes to variations in transcriptional output, we propose that DNA-shape-induced effects on the conformation, dynamics or relative positioning of GR partners influence its interactions with co-regulators by making or breaking interaction surfaces to ultimately modulate the recruitment or activity of the RNA polymerase machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to fine-tuning the activity of TFs, DNA shape also enables paralogous TFs to have distinct DNA-binding preferences34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, members of the Hox family of TFs share a similar consensus recognition sequence, yet have distinct functions in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This specificity was explained by Hox-specific DNA shape preferences which enabled the exchange of binding site preferences from one Hox protein to another by swapping shape-recognizing residues34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, several other studies have shown a role of nucleotides flanking the core-binding site in guiding TFs to their cognate binding sites35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For GR, several related nuclear receptors share the same DNA binding specificity in vitro yet regulate different physiological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the androgen receptor promotes myogenesis37 whereas chronic GR activation results in muscle wasting38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that DNA shape could also generate specificity for this family of TFs by modulation of TF activity downstream of binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, two TFs might bind at the same target site, yet only one adopts an activation-competent conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility that only certain binding events induce activation-competent conformations could also explain, in part, why only a minority of genes show changes in their expression level on binding of TFs to regulatory sequences nearby39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The activity of TFs towards individual target genes can be modulated by a variety of mechanisms other than the sequence identity of the binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a recent study showed that the number of occupied NF-B-binding sites associated with a gene correlates with the magnitude of activation39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in addition to being expressed at higher levels, genes with multiple TF-binding sites might display a greater degree of cell-to-cell variability (transcriptional noise) of gene expression40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we speculate that it could be beneficial for some GR target genes to be under control of a single, highly-active GBS with little transcriptional noise rather than multiple GBSs which induce greater noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another benefit of modulating activity by DNA-shape-induced conformational changes is that this might allow GR to induce different expression levels of a gene from the same binding site depending on its cellular context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could, for example, occur when a GBS-induced conformation facilitates interaction with a particular co-regulator that is expressed in a cell-type-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would be one of several mechanisms that GR can exploit to extract context information from its cellular environment to allow fine-tuning of its activity towards distinct sets of target genes responsible for GRs role in diverse physiological processes including metabolism, inflammatory response and emotional behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present study advances our understanding of GBS-mediated regulation of GR activity in several ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we show for the first time that GBSs can modulate GR activity in a genomic context and our in vivo occupancy studies indicate that this modulation occurs downstream of binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural studies indicate that this modulation may be a consequence of GBS-dependent conformational changes of individual monomers and of changes in the relative positioning of dimeric partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies with related hormone receptors that heterodimerize have shown allosteric communication between dimerization partners across the dimerization interface to fine-tune the structure and activity of the complex41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we propose that GR monomers can change their shape and that the homodimerization partners can change their relative positioning to assemble multiple distinct complexes, effectively allowing a kind of combinatorial regulation of transcriptional output by a single TF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether GBSs indeed play a role in modulating the activity of GR towards endogenous GR target genes is still unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arguing in favour of this possibility, we show that GBS sequence features found at GR-bound regions in the genome, specifically the nucleotides flanking the core GBS, show different preferences depending on strength of regulation of the nearby gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next step to study the role of GBS composition in the modulation of endogenous target gene expression would be to test the consequences of changing the sequence identity of endogenous binding sites, which, given the recent advances in the ability to edit the genome, has now become within reach.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
