Observation of the universal magnetoelectric effect in a 3D topological insulator  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The electrodynamics of topological insulators (TIs) is described by modified Maxwells equations, which contain additional terms that couple an electric field to a magnetization and a magnetic field to a polarization of the medium, such that the coupling coefficient is quantized in odd multiples of /4 per surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on the observation of this so-called topological magnetoelectric effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use monochromatic terahertz (THz) spectroscopy of TI structures equipped with a semitransparent gate to selectively address surface states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In high external magnetic fields, we observe a universal Faraday rotation angle equal to the fine structure constant =e2/2hc (in SI units) when a linearly polarized THz radiation of a certain frequency passes through the two surfaces of a strained HgTe 3D TI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments give insight into axion electrodynamics of TIs and may potentially be used for a metrological definition of the three basic physical constants.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Maxwells equations are in the foundation of modern optical and electrical technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To apply Maxwells equations in conventional matter, it is necessary to specify constituent relations, describing the polarization Pc(E) and magnetization Mc(B) as a function of the applied electric and magnetic fields, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soon after the theoretical prediction1,2,3 and experimental discovery of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators (TIs)4,5, it has been recognized that the constituent relations in this new phase of quantum matter contain additional cross-terms Pt(B) and Mt(E) when time-reversal symmetry is weakly broken6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '', 'Here N is an integer and 1/137 is the fine structure constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The derivation of equation (1) is based on the topological field theory of time-reversal invariant insulators6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its intriguing consequences are the universal Faraday rotation angle =, when a linearly polarized electromagnetic radiation passes through the top and bottom topological surfaces6,7, and magnetic monopole images, induced by electrical charges in proximity to a topological surface8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, experimental verification of these topological magnetoelectric effects (TMEs) has been lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the modified Maxwells equations describing electrodynamics of TIs are applicable in the low-energy limit, optical experiments should be performed at terahertz (THz) or sub-THz frequencies9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Qualitatively, equation (1) applied to the magnetic and electric fields of the primary THz radiation results in a perpendicular polarized secondary THz radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sum of the primary and secondary radiation can be viewed as the rotation of the polarization plane, that is, as the Faraday effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We would like to note that the quantum Faraday effect and the TME are basically different manifestations of the same axion physics13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In real samples, the TME may be screened by nontopological contributions13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, quantized Faraday rotation has been detected in 2D electron gas16 and graphene17 in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in both experiments the Faraday rotation takes a value F=4/(1+nsub), that is, it depends on the refractive index of the substrate nsub and hence is not fundamental.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report on the observation of the universal Faraday rotation angle equal to the fine structure constant .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strained HgTe layers grown on CdTe, that are investigated in the present work, are shown to be a 3D TI18 with surface-dominated charge transport19 that was observed in THz experiments as well9,11,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To eliminate the material details, we perform measurements under antireflection conditions, such that the transmission through the CdTe substrate is approaching 100% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'THz Faraday effect in 2D systems', 'The observed Faraday rotation angle = (for N=0) comes from two spatially separated topological surfaces in a 3D TI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to the half-quantized Hall conductivity e2/(2h) per surface or, equivalently, to the TME occurring at each surface separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the observed Faraday effect 2(N+1/2) is intimately related to the TME, which distinguishes qualitatively our 3D TI from 2D or quasi-2D materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is also a quantitative difference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even without the substrate (nsub=1), the Faraday rotation in graphene would be quantized as 4(N+1/2), including the spin and valley degeneracies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimum Faraday rotation angle is then =2 (for N=0)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a conventional 2D electron gas, such as hosted in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures, the quantization of the Faraday angle is expected to be 2N, where the factor of 2 comes from the equal contributions of the up- and down-spin subsystems, which independently exhibit the integer QHE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures, the Zeeman splitting for magnetic fields below  is negligible compared to the THz photon energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the minimum Faraday rotation angle would be also =2 (for N=1)16, which is twice larger than our result.

51 nm (lower layer) and 11 nm (top/cap layer), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The purpose of these layers is to provide the identical crystalline interface for top and bottom surface of the HgTe films as well as to protect the HgTe from oxidization and adsorption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This leads to an increase in carrier mobility with a simultaneous decrease in carrier density compared to uncaped samples18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transport characterization on a standard Hall bar sample shows a carrier density at 0 V gate of 1.7 × 1011 cm2 and a carrier mobility of 2.2 × 105 cm2 V1 s1.

Dirac-like surface states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since only surface states are observed in transport experiments on the similar structures19, a possible explanation of the appearance of additional resonances is interband Landau-level transitions between the HH bulk bands and topological surface states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such transitions are generally allowed as can be shown using the Kubo
