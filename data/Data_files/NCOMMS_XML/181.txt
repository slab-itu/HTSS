Clouds enhance Greenland ice sheet meltwater runoff  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Greenland ice sheet has become one of the main contributors to global sea level rise, predominantly through increased meltwater runoff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main drivers of Greenland ice sheet runoff, however, remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that clouds enhance meltwater runoff by about one-third relative to clear skies, using a unique combination of active satellite observations, climate model data and snow model simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This impact results from a cloud radiative effect of 29.5 (±5.2) W m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, the Greenland ice sheet responds to this energy through a new pathway by which clouds reduce meltwater refreezing as opposed to increasing surface melt directly, thereby accelerating bare-ice exposure and enhancing meltwater runoff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high sensitivity of the Greenland ice sheet to both ice-only and liquid-bearing clouds highlights the need for accurate cloud representations in climate models, to better predict future contributions of the Greenland ice sheet to global sea level rise.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Regionally amplified1 anthropogenic climate change2 in combination with anomalous large-scale atmospheric circulations3 have made the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) a dominant contributor4,5 to recent global sea level rise (0.63±0.07 mm per year during 20002012; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increasing contribution is primarily driven by a reduction in GrIS surface mass balance (SMB)6,7,8, related to a significant increase in GrIS surface melt extent9 and volume10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface melt is determined by the surface energy balance (SEB)11, the sum of incoming and outgoing energy fluxes at the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Clouds are known to play a pivotal role in regulating the local SEB, with competing warming and cooling effects on the surface12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dominating effect depends strongly on cloud properties such as vertically integrated ice and liquid water contents that determine cloud optical depth and emissivity, in addition to cloud temperature, sun position and surface albedo13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite their importance, the distribution of clouds over the GrIS, their phase partitioning (for example, ice-only clouds versus liquid-bearing or mixed-phase clouds) and their precise impact on the SEB and SMB are poorly understood, owing to the limited availability of measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensitivity studies based on observations have been limited to particular events or cloud types such as the role of low-level liquid-bearing clouds16 together with the enhanced poleward transport of humid and warm air17 in the July 2012 extreme GrIS melt event, whereas ice sheet-wide assessments of cloud SEB impact relied on climate model output to overcome the limited availability of observations18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, analysis of the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 model ensemble and a regional climate model shows a significant inter-model spread in the estimates of both ice-only and liquid-bearing cloud frequency and water paths over the GrIS (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the need for an observation-based assessment of the cloud distribution over the GrIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we use a unique combination of state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing, ground-based observations and a regional climate model, to quantify the impact of clouds on the SEB over the entire GrIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GrIS shows a strong sensitivity to cloud presence, where both ice-only and liquid-bearing clouds are warming the ice sheet surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an advanced snow model, we find that this warming enhances GrIS meltwater runoff in response to reduced refreezing rates at night, when cloud warming is highest compared with clear skies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

warmer and moister air28, whereas winter is characterized by a much higher frequency of ice-only clouds (55%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ice clouds occur frequently over the entire GrIS, whereas liquid-bearing clouds are much more abundant in the coastal regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annual mean cloud LWP in all conditions varies between 3 and 33 g m2 over the entire GrIS with highest values in the coastal

by the snowpack, warming the surface and enhancing outgoing LW radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Warmer snow promotes snow metamorphism, which lowers the albedo of the snowpack30, whereas multiple reflections of SW radiation between clouds and the surface in combination with spectrally dependent cloud absorption generally increase it31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To account for these processes,

overpasses (on average CloudSat and CALIPSO observe each 2° by 2° grid box once every 17 days, depending on the location), we constructed a hybrid satellite-climate model data set, combining the benefits of the observationally based estimates of CREs with the hourly temporal resolution of a regional climate model (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The snow model simulations, which capture the

identical under all-sky and clear-sky conditions (Fig 3b), clouds enhance GrIS meltwater runoff by 56±20 Gt per year (32±12 %), with similar contributions from cloud ice (25 Gt) and cloud liquid (31 Gt) water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the primary influence of clouds is by reducing meltwater refreezing; in clear-sky conditions, about 58% of the meltwater refreezes, but this fraction decreases to 45% in the presence of clouds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The governing mechanisms that explain this effect are illustrated in Fig 4, for a case study during 1621 June 2008 at 67°N-49°E (ablation zone), during an albedo transition period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of a thick cloud (Fig 4a), strong SW cooling and LW warming partly compensate during daytime (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface melt occurs during and shortly after solar noon, when incoming SW radiation peaks (Fig 4c, red curves).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the subsequent nighttime hours, when incoming SW is small (Fig 4b, grey zones), clear-sky conditions favour strong surface radiative cooling, extracting heat from the warmer subsurface snow by conduction, (partly) refreezing the meltwater (Fig 4c, blue curves).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This radiative cooling is reduced under cloudy conditions, impeding the refreezing mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional meltwater that does not refreeze fills up the available pore space until it runs off34 (Fig 4d), whereas a persistent positive CRE leads to firn warming, further enhancing melt and subsequent runoff35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combined effect causes an earlier exposure of bare ice and slush under cloudy conditions, which amplifies these mechanisms through enhanced SW absorption with lower albedo values (albedo feedback, Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the last 2 days of the case study, when the cloud has disappeared in the all-sky simulation, this albedo feedback is strengthened due to increased SW insolation in the absence of cloud SW blocking, enhancing melt relative to the clear-sky simulation (Fig 4c, red curves).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Case study showing cloud impacts on melt/refreezing during 1621 June 2008 at

refreezing (negative) processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Melt rates are highest at solar noon when SW insolation peaks, whereas refreezing rates are highest at night when strong surface radiative cooling dominates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of clouds, this radiative cooling is reduced, impeding the refreezing mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Cumulative meltwater runoff in snow water equivalent (SWE) is higher under cloudy conditions, due to limited meltwater refreezing and earlier bare-ice exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Surface albedo as simulated by SNOWPACK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Persistent warming by clouds enhances meltwater runoff, leading to an earlier exposure of bare ice and slush that have a much lower albedo than (fresh) snow (from 19 June onwards).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, the warming is amplified due to a much higher absorption of SW radiation in the all-sky simulation, as opposed to the clear-sky simulation.Full size image', 'Along with meltwater runoff, our results suggest that clouds enhance GrIS sublimation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, liquid-bearing and ice-only clouds contribute equally to a GrIS SMB decrease during 20072010 of 35±5% relative to clear-sky

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results highlight the strong sensitivity of the GrIS SEB and SMB to clouds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis overcomes many of the current issues that exist in observing and modelling of mixed-phase clouds by creating a hybrid satellite-climate model data set that closely matches satellite retrievals and ground-based observations with hourly temporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong positive CRE over the GrIS is found to warm the surface, enhance meltwater runoff in the GrIS ablation area and increase sublimation in the GrIS accumulation area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, a substantial uncertainty is associated to the sublimation term, as SNOWPACK was used in an offline configuration and does not account for any feedbacks to the atmosphere in response to changes in the snowpack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality, changes in surface temperature induced by clouds will modify turbulent fluxes and thus the boundary-layer air temperature and humidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we did not include these second-order effects and focused exclusively on the sensitivity of the GrIS to cloud-related changes in the SEB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This constitutes a first important step in assessing the impact of clouds on the GrIS SMB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results further indicate that not only liquid-bearing clouds16 but also clouds composed exclusively of ice significantly increase radiative fluxes into the surface and decrease GrIS SMB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This underscores the need for continued research into the factors that govern the formation and maintenance of these distinct cloud regimes, and their evolution in a future warmer and wetter Arctic36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence of the large spread in cloud cover and liquid/ice partitioning over the GrIS in current state-of-the-art climate models, in combination with our limited understanding of the interaction between clouds, circulation and climate37, suggests that improved cloud representations in climate models could significantly increase the fidelity of future projections of GrIS SMB and subsequent global sea level rise.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

over the GrIS are available from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric re-analysis (ERA), the uncertainty in these fluxes is large, as they are calculated based on

comprehensive set of cloud observations from space21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) sensor aboard CALIPSO was designed to focus on optically thin clouds and the 94-GHz Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) aboard CloudSat probes optically thicker clouds and precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CALIOP and CPR measure the backscattered energy by cloud particles,

whereas the vertical resolution is 240 m.', 'We found that in the presence of low-level supercooled liquid-bearing clouds that occur frequently over the Arctic27, the original 2B-FLXHR-LIDAR product was severely underestimating downwelling LW fluxes because of the inability of the existing algorithm to properly handle these clouds, which were falsely identified as ice-only clouds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was attributed to the fact that the CloudSat CPR is insensitive to small supercooled liquid droplets, while an exact retrieval of water path in this case was often not available from the CALIOP sensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such an event, a simple linear temperature-based relationship was used in the original version, to decide on the portion of ice and liquid water to which the CALIOP
