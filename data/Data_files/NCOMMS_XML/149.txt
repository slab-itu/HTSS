Transformable liquid-metal nanomedicine  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'To date, numerous inorganic nanocarriers have been explored for drug delivery systems (DDSs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the clinical application of inorganic formulations has often been hindered by their toxicity and failure to biodegrade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe here a transformable liquid-metal nanomedicine, based on a coreshell nanosphere composed of a liquid-phase eutectic gallium-indium core and a thiolated polymeric shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This formulation can be simply produced through a sonication-mediated method with bioconjugation flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin (Dox) have an average diameter of 107 nm and demonstrate the capability to fuse and subsequently degrade under a mildly acidic condition, which facilitates release of Dox in acidic endosomes after cellular internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equipped with hyaluronic acid, a tumour-targeting ligand, this formulation displays enhanced chemotherapeutic inhibition towards the xenograft tumour-bearing mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This liquid metal-based DDS with fusible and degradable behaviour under physiological conditions provides a new strategy for engineering theranostic agents with low toxicity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The engineering flexibility provided by inorganic nanoparticles with tailorable shape, size, surface ligands and physical properties has enabled on-demand design of novel drug delivery systems, contrast agents and integrated systems for disease diagnosis and treatment1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last decade has witnessed numerous efforts in developing inorganic nanoparticles capable of effectively targeting different diseases7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these formulations often fail to be useable due to systemic toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, targeted cancer therapy requires nanoparticles with relatively large sizes to minimize clearance12 and enhance tumour retention13,14, yet such inorganic particles often remain in the body for a long time because of their lack of biodegradability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, few studies have demonstrated how to engineer the physicochemical properties of inorganic nanoparticles to satisfy both target delivery and efficient elimination15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This design bottleneck has long existed and is impeding the clinical translation of therapy and diagnostics based on inorganic carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We report here a novel liquid metal-based nanoscale formulation for drug delivery to achieve enhanced anticancer therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking advantage of the unique characteristics of a eutectic alloy of gallium indium (EGaIn, 75% Ga and 25% In by weight), this novel nanomedicine has a variety of merits in terms of simple fabrication, facile surface bioconjugation and the capability of fusion and degradation in a mildly acidic environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGaIn is a low-viscosity liquid at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike Hg, it has low toxicity and has thus attracted considerable attention for applications of microfluidic systems, soft robotics and stretchable electronics17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain EGaIn-based drug nanocarriers, an emulsion-like ligand-mediated procedure is simply applied through ultrasonication at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During sonication20, the thiolated ligands readily assemble onto the surface of the EGaIn, competing with the oxidation process and facilitating control of the particle size17,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two ligands used here, thiolated (2-hydroxypropyl)--cyclodextrin (designated MUA-CD) and thiolated hyaluronic acid (designated m-HA), not only serve as capping agents during the formation of nanoscaled liquid-metal spheres but also play roles of drug-loading matrix and active targeting moiety, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final formulation (designated LM-NP/L) comprises three primary functional constituents: a CD-based drug-loading motif, the targeting ligand HA and an EGaIn core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seven-membered sugar ring of the CD provides faithful loading sites for doxorubicin (Dox)23, a model broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HA moiety supports active tumour targeting towards the receptors including the CD44 receptor, which is overexpressed on the cell surface of a broad variety of tumours, including human cervical cancer and breast cancer24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After intravenous injection, LM-NP/L is expected to accumulate at tumour sites as a result of passive25 and active targeting effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon endocytosis, the LM-NPs/L are expected to fuse with each other in the mildly acidic endosome microenvironment26, leading to the dissociation of Dox-containing ligands and therefore promote drug release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aggregates of fused LM-NPs/L are expected to degrade due to the synergistic effect of oxidative corrosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the main degradation product, Ga (III), can serve as anticancer agent itself to reverse drug resistance in drug-resistant cancer cells27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, this liquid metal-based nanomedicine is transformable: (1) it can be simply generated from a bulk material; (2) fusion happens to promote drug release in an acidic cellular environment; and (3) it can be biodegraded to reverse drug resistance and avoid potential systemic toxicity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Preparation of transformable liquid-metal nanomedicine', 'To prepare the liquid metal nanocarriers, EGaIn was added to a centrifuge tube filled with an ethanolic solution of thiolate CD and thiolate HA (volume ratio of EGaIn: ethanol=1:150, Fig 1a,b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After sonication, the largest particles precipitated within seconds, and the nanoscale colloids was removed from the tube and resuspended in water (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, Dox-loaded LM-NP/L (LM-NP/Dox-L) was obtained by overnight incubation with triethanolamine-treated Dox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixture was washed to remove the excess Dox.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting LM-NP/Dox-L appeared as coreshell structured nanospheres with a diameter of 107 nm, which was consistent with the results determined by dynamic light scattering tests (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Dox-loading capacity could be tuned by adjusting the ratio between MUA-CD and m-HA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a typical formulation used in the following investigations, the Dox-loading capacity was determined as 24% (Dox weight ratio of the total weight of nanoparticles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the addition of m-HA could significantly decrease the average particle size of product as well as enhance the systemic stability, which could be attributed to the negative charge of the anionic m-HA (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic design of the transformable liquid-metal delivery system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Preparation route of LM-NP/Dox-L.

release, the release profile of Dox from LM-NP/Dox-L (Fig 2c) under neutral (1 × PBS buffer, pH 7.4) and acidic (1 × PBS buffer, pH 5.0) conditions were investigated through the dialysis method29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A burst release of loaded Dox was clearly observed within the first 30 min in the acidic buffer, significantly different from the release curve recorded in the neutral buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, paclitaxel (PTX), which shows insignificant solubility change in the pH range of 2.58 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30), was loaded to LM-NP/L as a model drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the release profile of LM-NP/L loaded with PTX also presented a high release rate within the first 30 min in the acidic buffer (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acidic buffer caused 72% of the loaded PTX to release within 4 h, which was significantly higher than the 28% in the neutral environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dox-loaded gold nanoparticles (GNPs/Dox) with an average diameter of 100 nm, where Dox was included into the MUA-CD ligands with the same Dox-loading capacity as LM-NP/Dox-L, were also applied as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with GNP/Dox, LM-NP/Dox-L displayed a more potent acid-promoted Dox release at pH 5.0 (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon could be attributed to fusion of LM-NP/L triggered by the disruption of the oxidized shell of LM-NP/L, and the subsequent dissociation of surface ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the conformational change of LM-NP/Dox-L with up to 4 h acid treatment (pH 5.0) was visualized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial fusion behaviour was captured within the first 5 min after acid treatment, and the aggregates formed by fusion increased in size over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were in good agreement with the significant increase in size distribution upon acid treatment as measured by dynamic laser scattering (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that the acid attacked the oxidized layer20 on the surface of the LM-NP/L to trigger fusion of LM-NP/L (Supplementary Figs 8,9; Fig 2f), which further led to the fusion of the liquid inner cores31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the degradation of LM-NP/Dox-L at pH 5.0 was clearly observed via the optical microscope (Fig 2g) and TEM imaging (Fig 2d) over time; while negligible difference was observed in the case of neutral buffer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The representative TEM image of LM-NPs/Dox-L immersed in acidic (pH 5.0) PBS buffer for 72 h showed evidence of degradation into the hollow polymeric shells dotted with shrunk metallic cores in the inner wall evidenced the occurrence of degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further verify the degradation of LM-NPs, the change of Ga (III) ion concentration in PBS buffer over time was monitored by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ga (III) concentration in the acidic buffer displayed a notable increase over time; while the degradation of LM-NPs in neutral solution was moderate (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degradation process of LM-NPs was then tracked and quantified by monitoring the change of light transmittance over time (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The light transmittance of acidic LM-NP solution increased from 25 to 66%, which was in good agreement of the proposed degradation of LM-NPs in acidic environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the main degradation product, Ga (III) ion, has been reported to reverse drug resistance in drug-resistant cancer cells27,28, which could potentially generate synergistic effects and prevent drug resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Furthermore, the nature of the EGaIn metal core and the verified acid-triggered fusion might also open the possibility of utilizing these transformable nanospheres for imaging contrast enhancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After acid treatment (12 h in 1 × PBS buffer, pH 5.0), the homogeneous contrast enhancement caused by LM-NPs was disrupted, replaced by heterogeneous contrast within the imaged area with higher contrast at the locations of fused particles and lower contrast at spots in absence of LM-NPs (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting changes in contrast were quantified by studying the grey value profiles of representative areas in X-ray images (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grey values of the imaging area were approximately constant before acid treatment, indicating homogeneous imaging contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disruptions of the homogeneous imaging contrast after acid treatment were supported by the appearance of peaks in the grey value plot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar fusion of LM-NPs accumulated at tumour site would potentially lead to enhanced contrast of tumour tissue during X-ray imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intracellular acid-triggered fusion and promoted Dox release', 'The intracellular delivery of LM-NP/Dox-L into HeLa cells was further explored using the confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence of Dox was clearly observed in HeLa cells after 1 h of incubation with LM-NP/Dox-L, indicating the cellular internalization of the nanospheres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the incubation time was prolonged to 4 h, Dox was highly localized within the nuclei of HeLa cells, as indicated by the magenta fluorescence (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cellular uptake of LM-NP/Dox-L displayed an energy-dependent manner, and LM-NP/Dox-L mainly entered HeLa cells via macropinocytosis (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the endocytosis process of LM-NP/Dox-L was also visualized by TEM imaging (Figs 1c,d and 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HeLa cells were treated with LM-NP/Dox-L for different time durations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1 h incubation, fusion of LM-NPs was clearly observed in the acidic endosomes, agreeing with the in vitro results discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 4 h incubation, more fusion events of LM-NPs were spotted, together with few single LM-NPs dispersed in the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we quantified and visualized the fusion process intracellularly by lysing the cells incubated with LM-NPs/Dox-L at different incubation time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intracellular Ga/In ion concentrations were then quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the structures formed via fusion were also further validated using TEM and analysed with the titan scanning/TEM at an atomic scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the LM-NPs/Dox-L treated with acid (Fig 2d), the initial fusion behaviour was captured immediately upon cellular uptake, followed by the formation of larger aggregates and the eventual degradation, which was in good agreement with the significant increase of intracellular Ga (III) ion concentration over incubation time (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The element mapping results revealed the fusion of the polymeric shells during the conformational changes of LM-NP/L (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scattering of Ga signal after 5-min incubation indicated the fast disruption of the oxidized shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 1 h of incubation, the increase of S and O signals in the background suggested the dissociation of thiolated surface ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry was further utilized to analyse the surface of LM-NP/L and intracellular LM-NP/L collected by lysing the cells internalized with particles (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coexistence of thiols and oxides was well evidenced by the overlap of the signals of GaO and GaS in LM-NP/L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase of HS signal in the background after 5 min incubation visualized the dissociation of thiolated surface ligands, indicating the initial stage of fusion behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remarkable increase in the background HS signal and the significant decreases in the signals of GaO and GaS clearly indicated that the intracellular fusion behaviour of LM-NP/L was a result of the synergistic action of the dissociation of thiolated surface ligands and the disruption of oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Intracellular interaction and drug release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Intracellular delivery of LM-NP/Dox-L towards HeLa cells at

detection and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay were performed to compare the apoptosis-inducing capabilities of LM-NP/Dox-L and free Dox solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annexin V-FITC labels the phosphatidylserine translocated to the extracellular membrane upon the initiation of apoptosis32, while 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole has significantly higher staining efficiency with cells where the plasma membrane integrity has been compromised33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combination allows the differentiation among the early apoptotic cells, the late apoptotic cells and the viable cells, which can be quantitatively determined by the flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total apoptotic ratio of HeLa cells incubated with LM-NP/Dox-L was 68%, which was significantly higher than 43% of HeLa cells incubated with LM-NP/Dox (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the cells treated with LM-NP/Dox-L showed extensive apoptotic DNA fragmentation stained by the Alexa Fluor 488 as green fluorescence (Fig 3e), substantiating that LM-NP/Dox-L is an effective intracellular delivery vehicle for enhanced apoptosis-inducing activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, the cytotoxicity of Dox-loaded nanospheres towards HeLa cells was evaluated with 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell viability was dependent on both Dox concentration and incubation time, as expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of LM-NP/Dox and LM-NP/Dox-L towards HeLa cells for 24 h treatment were 0.81 and 0.23 mg l1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LM-NP/Dox-L displayed higher cytotoxicity than free Dox solution (IC50=1.33 mg l1), while blank LM-NPs/L without Dox showed insignificant cytotoxicity within the range of tested concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low Dox concentration (0.16 and 0.31 mg l1), LM-NP/Dox also had higher cytotoxicity than free Dox solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was suggested that the acid-promoted release of Dox achieved by liquid metal nanospheres provided higher cytotoxic activity towards cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that LM-NP/Dox-L showed significantly enhanced cytotoxicity (3.5-fold for 24 h treatment) compared with LM-NP/Dox towards HeLa cells that overexpress CD44 receptor34, which can be attributed to the HA-targeting moiety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We further investigated in vitro cytotoxicity of LM-NP/Dox-L towards Dox-resistant HeLa cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that LM-NP/Dox-L displayed significant cytotoxicity towards Dox-resistant HeLa cells (IC50=2.46 mg l1), while free Dox solution did not show any obvious cytotoxicity even at the concentration of 5 mg l1 (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

collected from the mice treated with LM-NP/Dox-L (Fig 4i), indicating that the supreme tumour inhibition activity was attributable in part to the increased apoptosis induced by LM-NP/Dox-L.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have developed a new liquid metal-based drug delivery platform for anticancer therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formulation can be easily formed and tailored via ligand-mediated self-assembly using facile ultrasonication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting liquid-metal nanospheres are able to fuse for promoting drug release and eventually degrade under a mild acidic environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After fusing, these nanospheres also display a contrast enhancing capability when imaged by X-ray, suggesting potential as a theranostic reagent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systematic investigation of toxicology of LM-NP/L revealed no obvious toxicity at the treatment dose, favouring its biomedical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there were no obvious signs of toxicity in these studies, we will further evaluate the systemic toxicity of the developed formulations, as well as other promising candidates made from different liquid metal, such as pure gallium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, considering other physical properties of liquid metal, including capability of dissolving iron or other metals, mechanical flexibility towards tissues and electrical conductivity, many new materials and scaffolds integrated with liquid metal for drug delivery and tissue engineering can be envisioned.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
