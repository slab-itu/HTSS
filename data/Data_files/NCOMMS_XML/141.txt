Adaptive immunity increases the pace and predictability of evolutionary change in commensal gut bacteria  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Co-evolution between the mammalian immune system and the gut microbiota is believed to have shaped the microbiotas astonishing diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we test the corollary hypothesis that the adaptive immune system, directly or indirectly, influences the evolution of commensal species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare the evolution of Escherichia coli upon colonization of the gut of wild-type and Rag2/ mice, which lack lymphocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that bacterial adaptation is slower in immune-compromised animals, a phenomenon explained by differences in the action of natural selection within each host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emerging mutations exhibit strong beneficial effects in healthy hosts but substantial antagonistic pleiotropy in immune-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature is due to changes in the composition of the gut microbiota, which differs according to the immune status of the host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that the adaptive immune system influences the tempo and predictability of E. coli adaptation to the mouse gut.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The maintenance of a healthy status in mammals depends on the interaction between their microbiota and the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The partnership between gut commensals and the host is hypothesized to result from millions of years of co-evolution, where the host immune response is tightly regulated to tolerate commensals, which in turn shape its development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it recently became clear that specific bacterial species, such as segmented filamentous bacteria1, Clostridia spp.2 and Bacteroides fragilis3, can promote the expansion of regulatory and pro-inflammatory T cells, promoting immune homeostasis and contributing to restoration of health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further support for a role of microbes in controlling host physiology comes from faecal transplants, which can affect their weight4 and even protect hosts from invasion of pathogens5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patterns of microbiota species composition also differ between healthy and immune-compromised mice lacking an adaptive immune system6,7, suggestive of the hypothesis of co-evolution between host and gut commensals8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a direct support for co-evolution requires the study of how host genetics affects evolutionary change within the gut microbial species it carries and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These issues have been poorly studied, probably partly due to the difficulty in conducting studies that demonstrate the direct influence of microbial evolution on mammalian host evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, however, easier to address the influence of host genetics on microbial ecology and evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Escherichia coli, the most abundant aerobe and one of the first species to colonize the human gut, offers a powerful system to investigate how and to what extent the genetic composition of a commensal changes with time when facing a healthy or a compromised host immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis, which are increasing in incidence in the human population and are associated with different mutations in genes with important immune functions, often show an increased abundance of Proteobacteria, namely E. coli, which tends to be sampled, in comparison with healthy hosts9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using a classical E. coli colonization systemthe streptomycin-treated mousewe have recently shown that E. coli undergoes rapid adaptation to the intestinal tract11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This adaptation was detected through observation of phenotypic sweeps, which occurred across populations of E. coli evolving independently in genetically identical immune-competent hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have tested the hypothesis that the process of adaptation of E. coli can be altered in immune-compromised mice lacking an adaptive immune system (Rag2/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that evolution of E. coli is slower in these hosts than in immune-competent animals, due to smaller selective effects of the first beneficial mutations that emerge in these bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate that the strength of natural selection is dependent on the composition of the microbiota, which differs between immune-competent and immune-compromised animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we describe the genetic targets of E. coli adaptation and find adaptive mutations specific to the host genetic background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the findings that emerging mutations exhibit strong beneficial effects in healthy hosts but substantial antagonistic pleiotropy in immune-deficient mice, support the notion that the adaptive immune system enhances the predictability of adaptive evolution of bacteria comprising the microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that not only the microbiotic environment but also the pace and the path of adaptation of a commensal species can be altered by the host immune system.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coli adaptation is slower in immune-compromised mice', 'To study E. coli adaptation in the gut of Rag2/ mice, we colonized 15 animals (see Methods) with two E. coli strains, isogenic except for the presence of a neutral fluorescent marker (cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first measured the frequency of the neutral marker and its dynamics by daily monitoring of E. coli numbers and fluorescence in the faecal content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much smaller changes in marker frequency were detected in Rag2/ compared with wild-type (WT) mice11 during the first 6 days of colonization (Fig 1a, binomial test P=0.03), suggesting a slower rate of adaptation in immune-compromised hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This delayed evolutionary change was not due to smaller population size, as similar loads of E. coli were recovered from both animals (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After this initial period, the marker frequency started to diverge (Fig 1b) in some Rag2/ animals, as had been observed in WT mice11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some populations showed a signature of a selective sweep, where a single marker steadily increased towards fixation (lines R1.1 and R1.12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other populations showed the classical signature of clonal interference (R1.11 and R1.15), where clones carrying a given fluorescence first increased in frequency and then were replaced by clones with a different fluorescence, likely due to beneficial mutations with stronger effect arising in the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next asked whether the slower pace of adaptation in Rag2/ mice could be due to a longer time for sweeps to occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT mice, the first adaptive mutations to appear involve changes in genes of the gat operon, conferring E. coli with a gat-negative phenotype11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Rag2/ mice the same phenotype emerged and swept (Supplementary Fig 2; Fig 1c), but at a slower pace (z=25.5, P less_than 103).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though mutations in this operon ultimately reached high frequency in the majority of lineages evolving in Rag2/ mice, they could only be detected after 3 days of adaptation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contrasts with what was seen in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This occurred within the same experimental groups (Supplementary Fig 2, upper panels versus lower panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we detected populations where the increase in frequency of the phenotype was as fast as in WT (Supplementary Fig 2, lines R1.3 and R1.10), this increase was slower in the majority of the populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the gat-negative phenotype arose faster (Fig 1c), and variance in this phenotype was eliminated quicker (Fig 1d), in WT compared with Rag/ animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both patterns are consistent with faster adaptation under the pressures of an adaptive immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: E. coli adapts at a slower pace in immune-compromised mice.Dynamics of marker frequency (±2 s.e.m., representing the error associated with the sampling when calculating the frequency of the marker) during the first 6 (a) or 24 (b) days of adaptation of

gut', 'We then sought to identify the mechanism responsible for the observed slower adaptive pace in Rag2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adaptation rate depends on generation time, population size, mutation rate and the strength of selection on newly adaptive alleles12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Population size estimates based on bacterial loads recovered from both groups of animals (Supplementary Fig 1) suggested that this factor would not play a leading role in the observed differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the division rate of E. coli in the mouse gut, we used in situ hybridization with a probe specific for E. coli 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to estimate cellular rRNA content, which strongly correlates with bacterial division rate (Supplementary Fig 3), using an adapted version of a previously described method13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We colonized WT and Rag2/ mice with E. coli and collected faecal samples at days 1 and 3 after inoculation, when E. coli had already reached the same load as observed during the course of the evolution experiment (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the fluorescence intensity of hybridized E. coli cells, we inferred an average duplication time of 66 (±3, 2 s.e.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and 76 (±3, 2 s.e.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  min in Rag2/ and WT mice, respectively (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the generation time for E. coli was significantly smaller in Rag2/ than in WT mice (MannWhitney U-test, W=111.5, P less_than 103), this parameter also could not explain the different rates of adaptation observed between hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

duplication time in Rag2/ compared with WT animals, we tested the hypothesis that the observed delay in the emergence of the adaptive phenotype in Rag2/ mice was due to a lower spontaneous mutation rate in these hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the spontaneous mutation frequency towards resistance to different antibiotics, by measuring the number of clones resistant to rifampicin, nalidixic acid or furazolidone in E. coli populations colonizing Rag2/ and WT mice over a period of 15 days (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resistance against these antibiotics can be conferred through mutations in specific E. coli genes (rpoB, gyrA and nfsA, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resistance to rifampicin (RifR) and nalidixic acid (NalR) involves mainly point mutations, while resistance to furazolidone (FzdR) can also be acquired by transposition of insertion sequence (IS) elements14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that such resistant alleles are slightly deleterious, and thus kept at mutation-selection balance in a large population, the fraction of resistant mutants is proportional to the mutation rate12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated an average log10 mutation frequency for RifR of 7.53 in Rag2/ animals, not significantly different from that in WT mice (MannWhitney U-test, W=284.5, P=0.95).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar result was found for NalR mutants (7.76 in WT and 7.76 in Rag2/ mice, MannWhitney U-test, W=202, P=0.65) and FzdR (5.65 in WT and 5.49 in Rag2/ mice, MannWhitney U-test, W=1613, P=0.10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also measured the in vivo frequency of spontaneous resistant mutants to furazolidone, where resistance was achieved through transpositions, therefore providing the first estimate of the in vivo spontaneous transposition frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an important parameter in E. coli adaptation to the gut, given that approximately half of the adaptive mutations identified in WT mice were caused by insertion of transposable elements11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated an average log10 transposition frequency of 5.99 in WT and a similar frequency of 5.75 in Rag2/ mice (MannWhitney U-test, W=83, P=0.09).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate that both the point-mutation frequency and transposition frequency are similar in immune-compromised and immune-competent animals, suggesting that the slower rate of adaptation observed in the former was not due to an overall decreased mutation rate of E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altered selective pressures in immune-compromised mice', 'We next asked whether the fitness effects of adaptive mutations were different in the gut of Rag2/ and WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the fitness effect (s) of a mutant (gatZ) harbouring a single beneficial mutation through in vivo competition assays against the ancestral E. coli (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT mice (Fig 2c, left panel; Supplementary Table 1), we estimated a mean advantage, per hour (sgatZ), of 0.068 (±0.008, 2 s.e.m.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the selective effect of the gatZ mutant was smaller in Rag2/ mice (sgatZ=0.03 (±0.01, 2 s.e.m.))  #@NEW_LINE#@#  compared with WT (analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukeys post hoc test, P less_than 103).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, considerably higher variation in the selective effects of the gatZ mutation was found in Rag2/ mice (Fig 2c, right panel; Supplementary Table 1), with a two-tailed test for variance in sgatZ between Rag2/ and WT being marginally significant (F=0.30, P=0.09).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutation shows antagonistic pleiotropy, that is, in some Rag2/ mice it was advantageous (Rag2/ 1 and 5), while in others it was neutral or slightly deleterious (Rag2/ 4 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that variability for the fitness effect of the mutant was observed in mice from the same litter (for example, Rag2/ littermates 3 and 4 or 5 and 6 in Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of natural selection is therefore the principal source of variation in the evolutionary dynamics between the hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the selective pressures in the gut of immune-compromised and WT mice are different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Differences in host immune status are associated with differences in microbiota species composition: the microbiota of mice lacking T and B cells has been shown to differ from that in WT controls7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the potential role of the microbiota in driving the changes in adaptation rate observed in this study, we estimated sgatZ by direct in vivo competition against the ancestral in (i) WT and Rag2/ mice previously co-housed for 1 month, a procedure that leads to homogenization of the microbiota between different individuals15 (Fig 3a; Supplementary Table 2), and (ii) germ-free (GF) WT and Rag2/ mice devoid of microbiota (Fig 3b; Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysing the full data set (Fig 3c) including competitions in independently housed WT and Rag2/ animals, revealed a significant overall interaction between host immune status and the microbiota (ANOVA; F(2,50)=9.64; P less_than 103), upon the fitness effect of the emerging mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In WT animals, co-housing slightly (sgatZ=0.05±0.01) but not significantly (ANOVA with Tukeys post hoc test, P=0.3, Fig 3c) decreased the mutant fitness (Fig 3a, left panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This advantage was similar to that measured in co-housed Rag2/ (sgatZ=0.050±0.009, ANOVA with Tukeys post hoc test, P greater than 0.99), which was higher than in independently housed Rag2/ (ANOVA with Tukeys post hoc test, P=0.02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another marked effect of the co-housing protocol was a reduction in the variance for the fitness effect of gatZ in Rag2/ mice, which became more similar to that observed in WT animals (F-test, F=1.32, P=0.67), indicating loss of antagonistic pleiotropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: The microbiota influences the

average smaller (0.03±0.02, ANOVA with Tukeys post hoc test, P less_than 103, Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extensive variability for the fitness effects was observed, with an extreme case in which gatZ

deleterious in Rag2/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis and identify other targets of adaptation, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of large population samples ( greater than 1,000

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We investigated the process of E. coli evolution in the gut of immune-compromised mice and compared it with the evolutionary patterns observed for the same ancestral strain in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a difference in the initial divergence of the neutral marker in immune-compromised compared with immune-competent animals, compatible with a slower rate of evolution in the former.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is further supported by a delayed emergence of the adaptive gat phenotype, whose dynamics displayed a slower pace and increased variability in its fitness effects among these hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a system of intense clonal interference, as is the case here, the power of the two-marker system in detecting adaptive mutations becomes rapidly reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the lack of differences in marker dynamics between hosts over longer periods is not interpretable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings of a higher growth rate of E. coli in Rag2/ animals compared with WT is compatible with a weakened control of bacterial growth in immune-compromised hosts, suggesting a more benign environment for E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same explanation may also be valid for the GF mice, where even lower duplications times, regardless of the immune state, were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this conjecture, the selective effects of the first sweeping beneficial mutations were smaller in immune-compromised hosts, indicating stronger selective pressures in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The bulk of our work indicates that the adaptive immune system indirectly increases this selective pressure through the shaping of the microbiota, which in turn interacts with E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, alteration (co-housing) or removal (GF) of the microbiota modulates the selective effects, clearly revealing that this is a major factor controlling the selective pressures in the mouse gut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we could indeed detect differences in the relative abundance of some genera, notably Barnesiella spp, between the two host genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria belonging to this genus have been shown to confer protection against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, through some undefined direct or indirect mechanism31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results obtained upon antibiotic treatment in Rag2/ animals, not only show an increase in the mean frequency of Barnesiella but also a substantial degree of inter-individual variation, supporting a role for the host adaptive immune system in maintaining coherence in the ecology and evolution of the commensal microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The influence of the host immune system, in particular the adaptive immune system, on the shaping of the gut microbiota has been the focus of recent studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these, the microbiota composition of WT and Rag1/ or Rag2/ mice (both Rag1 and Rag2 null mutations result in total ablation of the adaptive immune system) has been compared using 16S analysis7,16,17,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While each study reports differences in the representation of several microbial groups, these are not the same across animal facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, one work revealed an expansion of anaerobes, especially SFB, in the gut of Rag2/ mice18, while others described differences in the abundance of Bifidobacteria and Clostridium leptum19, or in the phylogenetic community membership such as increased Lachnospiraceae and decreased Porphyromonadacea in Rag1/ mice17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of these specific differences were noticeable in our colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a previous study reported an increased frequency of Akkermansia sp in Rag2/ hosts when compared with WT controls7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this genus was represented at notable frequency (5%) in one unmanipulated Rag2/ animal in our study, it was undetectable in the streptomycin-treated mice analysed here, irrespectively of their genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we detected differences in phylogenetic memberships (unweighted UniFrac) between unmanipulated WT and Rag2/ animals, confirming that the two genotypes do carry different microbial gut compositions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our observation of reduced phylogenetic diversity in unmanipulated Rag2/ corroborates other works, where immune-compromised mice, including mutants lacking either or both T and B cells display decreased microbial diversity6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar finding was reported recently, where the abundance and diversity of B-cell-secreted immunoglobulin-A was correlated with the diversity of the gut microbiota32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'More directly relevant to the scope of this work, we found differences in both phylogeny- and OTU-based measures of alpha diversity between streptomycin-treated WT and Rag2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with our findings of distinct community structures (weighted UniFrac and BrayCurtis distances) between the two genotypes, these results suggest that the pre-existing differences in microbial composition between WT and Rag2/ are exacerbated upon antibiotic treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, and in agreement with the majority of previous works, our results indicate that microbial composition differs between immune-competent and -compromised animals, supporting the hypothesis that adaptive immunity plays an important role in the shaping of the microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The genetic basis of E. coli adaptation determined by WGS of evolved populations revealed that most of the mutations were related with bacterial metabolism and respiration, indicating that the main selective pressure was adaptation to the metabolic environment of the intestine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the microbiota provides key metabolites33 and given our findings of different microbial profiles in WT and Rag2/ mice, it is possible that the gut environment of these hosts differs in the availability of different metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, mutations found exclusively or mainly in one host may reflect the specific metabolic composition of that environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One example, and the most extreme case, is the mutational target dcuB found in half of the WT populations but absent in Rag2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gene codes for a transporter of C4-dicarboxylic acids such as fumarate and succinate34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mouse gut, succinate can be produced by Bacteroides35, a genus that our microbiota analysis revealed to be present at higher relative abundance in WT than in Rag2/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that differences in the availability of succinate, produced by the microbiota, may have driven the differential selection for mutations in genes related to the uptake and metabolism of this compound in the two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same may be true to yeaR, which codes for a protein induced in the presence of nitric compounds27, that can be used by E. coli to perform anaerobic respiration in the intestine of the host36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, mutations in frlR, found in Rag2/ mice, may be related to the levels of fructosamines, compounds that are present in the gut and likely metabolized by bacteria29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutations identified may lead to inactivation of frlR and consequently, to the constitutive expression of the frl operon, conferring an advantage for E. coli in the gut when nutrients are available at low concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another example is kdgR, a transcriptional repressor of the EntnerDoudoroff aldolase-coding eda gene24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eda is a key enzyme in the EntnerDoudoroff pathway25 responsible for the metabolism of sugar acids, and mutants of this pathway are known to display impaired growth in the mouse gut22,37,38, which is consistent with our finding of selection for mutations inactivating kdgR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, our data reveal that the path and rate of adaptation of commensal bacteria is influenced by the presence of a healthy adaptive immune system, providing experimental evidence to the first corollary of the co-evolution hypothesis between commensal microbiota and the host immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings further suggest that the shaping of the gut microbiota composition by the adaptive immune system results in a coherent environment under which E. coli evolves along a stronger selective pressure and a more predictable path.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
