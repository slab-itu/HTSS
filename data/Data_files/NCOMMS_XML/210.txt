Live-cell protein labelling with nanometre precision by cell squeezing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Live-cell labelling techniques to visualize proteins with minimal disturbance are important; however, the currently available methods are limited in their labelling efficiency, specificity and cell permeability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe high-throughput protein labelling facilitated by minimalistic probes delivered to mammalian cells by microfluidic cell squeezing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-affinity and target-specific tracing of proteins in various subcellular compartments is demonstrated, culminating in photoinduced labelling within live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the fine-tuned delivery of subnanomolar concentrations and the minimal size of the probe allow for live-cell super-resolution imaging with very low background and nanometre precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method is fast in probe delivery (1,000,000 cells per second), versatile across cell types and can be readily transferred to a multitude of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the technique succeeds in combination with well-established methods to gain multiplexed labelling and has demonstrated potential to precisely trace target proteins, in live mammalian cells, by super-resolution microscopy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Direct observation of intracellular processes has the potential to yield insight into fundamental biological pathways and disease mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several techniques have been developed to enable high-resolution imaging of live cells; yet, the limited ability to trace intracellular components has hindered progress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, two of the persistent challenges are probe design and cellular delivery with minimal toxicity, pivotal for advances in live-cell imaging technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe an efficient approach to tag and image intracellular components in live mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the microfluidic cell squeezing platform to deliver small fluorescent tris-N-nitrilotriacetic acid (trisNTA) probes (1 kDa), we demonstrate highly efficient, minimally disruptive, light-triggered tracing of native proteins and the subsequent super-resolution imaging of live-cell phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Live-cell microscopy contributed significant knowledge of dynamic processes such as protein trafficking and single-molecule localization-based imaging techniques visualize proteins with high-resolution information (50 nm)1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All fluorescent imaging techniques require protocols to introduce the label with the need to minimize its influence on the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent proteins, self-labelling tags3,4,5,6 or labelling by enzymatic methods7,8 can interfere with protein function, assembly or dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bulky fusion proteins (20 kDa) entail the risk of steric hindrance and functional perturbations, whereas smaller tags (for example, tetracysteine tag) deal with unspecific interactions or require additional experimental steps8 and optimized flanking sequences for each protein target9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although synthetic fluorophores have enhanced photostability, quantum yield, spectral range and localization precision, it is difficult to introduce such probes to the cytosolic environment using existing delivery technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, current transduction strategies such as delivery by cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), electroporation and so on are suboptimal, suffering from poor and endosomal uptake, rapid degradation by extracellular and endosomal proteases, low in vivo efficiency or elaborated chemical synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, antibody-based labelling approaches, for example, are limited to chemically arrested (fixed) cells and the availability of specific antibodies for a protein target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the described limitations of existing labelling and transduction technologies, there is a persistent demand for techniques enabling high-throughput in-cell labelling by minimal tags that are conductive to high-resolution and super-resolution microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate robust in-cell targeting of native proteins using a labelled multivalent chelator head trisNTA10 and a genetically encoded oligohistidine sequence (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  trisNTA site specifically recognizes His610-tagged proteins in the (sub)nanomolar range (Kd of 0.110 nM) even in the crowded cellular environment11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimal size of the tag and the molecular probe allows direct targeting with nanometre precision at subnanomolar concentrations as required for single-molecule localization-based imaging techniques1,2,12,13 with no impact on intracellular trafficking or demand for additional cofactors affecting endogenous processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We simplified efficient transfer of the trisNTA probe into living cells by cell squeezing14, combining precisely controlled cytosolic delivery with high specificity and low cytotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, transient cell permeabilization is achieved by rapid viscoelastic deformation of cells as they pass through micrometre-scale constrictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This facilitates fast uptake of probes into the cytosol before cell-intrinsic repair mechanisms kick in15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Traceless tracing of protein assemblies by a minimal lock-and-key recognition pair.

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'High-affinity protein labelling at subnanomolar concentration', 'We first investigated the specificity of the trisNTA/His tag targeting in chemically arrested cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate precise localization, different proteins resident at distinct subcellular compartments were selected: (i) the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum16; (ii) histone 2B (H2B) in the nucleus; and (iii) Lamin A at the nuclear envelope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All proteins of interest (POIs) were fused to a His10 tag and a fluorescent protein (TAP1mVenus-His10, H2BmVenus-His10 and His10-mEGFPLamin A) for specific targeting and co-localization studies, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sensitive detection, trisNTA was covalently coupled to different fluorescent dyes (trisNTAf, f=Alexa488, ATTO565, ATTO647N, Alexa647 and ATTO655).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mammalian cells were transiently transfected with the corresponding target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  His-tagged proteins were specifically stained by trisNTAf with excellent co-localization and signal-to-noise ratio (Pearsons coefficients between 0.90 and 0.96), using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM; Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, even at 200 pM of trisNTAf, His-tagged proteins were labelled with high specificity (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analysing a variety of fluorescent dyes, we noticed that trisNTAATTO565 targeting produced a higher background compared with trisNTAATTO647N, trisNTAAlexa647 or trisNTAATTO655 (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was assigned to unspecific binding of the ATTO565 dye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the superposition of both fluorescence intensity profiles reflects an excellent correlation between the POI expression level and the labelling density of trisNTAAlexa647 (Fig 1c,d, Pearsons coefficient r=0.95).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, using nanomolar concentrations, trisNTAf labelling is significantly more efficient within 30 min than SNAPf-tag labelling (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, mammalian cells expressing H2B lacking a His tag showed neither trisNTAf labelling nor unspecific staining (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, trisNTAf targeting at subnanomolar concentrations is highly specific to trace His-tagged proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exploit these benefits further, we combined trisNTAf with well-established labelling methods for multiplexed protein modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific trisNTAAlexa488 labelling of His10LaminA (Fig 1e, green) was successfully achieved in combination with SNAPf-tag labelling of H2B (magenta) and antibody labelling of tubulin (red), as well as the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the ultra-small interaction pair complements the toolbox of well-established labelling techniques and the nanomolar concentrations perform various avenues in multiplexed labelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High-throughput live-cell labelling within mammalian cells', 'Encouraged by these observations, we aimed at protein labelling in living cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To transfer trisNTAf into cells, we applied microfluidic cell squeezing (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the trisNTAf probes are chemically diverse relating to the used fluorophores, common transduction strategies are unlikely to efficiently deliver nanomolar concentrations of trisNTAf into mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, mammalian cells were mechanically pushed (squeezed) through micrometre constrictions at elevated pressure of 30 psi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach allows for high cell survival (90%) and efficient uptake of trisNTAf (up to 80%; Supplementary Figs 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Energy-dependent endocytosis, often observed at cargo transfer with supercharged molecules (Supplementary Fig 8) or low concentrations of CPPs (Supplementary Fig 9)17, were prevented by performing cell squeezing at 4 °C (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Live-cell labelling of protein assemblies in distinct subcellular compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Delivery of trisNTAf into living cells by microfluidic cell squeezing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells are pressed through micrometre constrictions of a microfluidic device, to introduce trisNTAf (bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell passage causes the formation of transient holes in the plasma membrane and enables trisNTAf transfer into the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  His-tagged POI (grey) is specifically

subcellular localizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  trisNTAAlexa647 was delivered to cells and transfected with TAP1mVenus-His10 (HeLa), His10-mEGFPLamin A (Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1)) or H2BmVenus-His10 (HEK293) by squeezing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High target specificity of trisNTAAlexa647 is represented by excellent co-localization with the POIs (merge).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Determined Pearsons coefficients range from 0.81 to 0.93.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images were taken by CLSM 10 min (b) or 1 h (d) after squeezing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dashed lines indicate the cell border.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 50 m (b),

by an excellent co-localization between both reporter molecules (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noticed that both probe delivery by cell squeezing and protein labelling are highly reproducible (n20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the trisNTAf delivery, we performed flow cytometry analysis on micromanipulated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty-five per cent of transfected cells (54% of total) were effectively transduced with trisNTAATTO565 (Fig 2c), which is  30 × more efficient for trisNTAf delivery than electroporation (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Squeezing of up to 1,000,000 cells per second enables live-cell labelling at high throughput and reproducibility, and hence largely exceeds the efficiency achieved by other direct transfer methods such as microinjection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The massively parallel and constant cell transduction surpasses the stochastic, while variable efficient uptake by CPPs (Supplementary Fig 9) and is more than 1,000-fold below the micromolar probe concentrations used by elegant self-labelling tags, for example, SNAP tag3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Highly specific protein targeting with minimal disturbance', 'Analogous micromanipulation and live-cell labelling was applied to H2BmVenus-His10- and His10-mEGFPLamin A-transfected cells (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell transduction was analysed 15 min and 1 h after squeezing by CLSM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An excellent co-localization between the trisNTAf reporter molecule and the His-tagged POIs was observed (Pearsons coefficients range from 0.81 to 0.93), in line with the subcellular localization in chemically arrested cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, live-cell labelling is independent of cell types, for example, HeLa, HeLa Kyoto, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) or human embryonic kidney 293 cells (Figs 1b and 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond that, trisNTAf labelling after removal of the bulky fluorescent protein fully exploited the small size of the lock-and-key element and confirmed again specific labelling in living cells with minimal perturbation (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specificity was validated in cells transfected with H2BEGFP lacking a His tag and untransfected cells (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, neither co-localization of trisNTAf with H2BEGFP nor unspecific binding was detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delivery of nickel-free trisNTAf or of free Alexa647 dye showed no labelling in TAP1mVenus-His10-transfected cells (Supplementary Figs 14 and 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, trisNTAAlexa647 (Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 14) and trisNTAATTO565 (Supplementary Fig 16) clearly stain TAP1mVenus-His10 at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane after cell squeezing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noticeably, cell viability of trisNTAf-transduced cells was negligibly affected 1 and 24 h after labelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar concentrations of unbound nickel ions inside mammalian cells had no significant toxic effects (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, electroporation entailed more than twofold increased toxicity compared with squeezing (Supplementary Figs 7 and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, nanomolar delivery of trisNTAf fully realized the potential of in-cell protein manipulation with minimal perturbation and modification rates exceeding common approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After successful in-cell labelling of different His-tagged proteins, we aimed for in vivo multiplexed labelling by combining trisNTAf with well-established labelling methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By trisNTAAlexa647 delivery via squeezing and subsequent SNAPf-tag labelling, we achieved specific and distinct targeting of His10LaminA in the presence of two different SNAPf-tagged proteins in live cells (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, trisNTAf complements the toolbox for in vivo multiplexed labelling, offering minimal disturbance due to its small size and simultaneously using low nanomolar concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Light-triggered live-cell labelling and super-resolution microscopy of protein assemblies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

trisNTAAlexa647 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on previous observations, approximately one-third of the cargo provided during squeezing is the effective intracellular concentration14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the estimated cytosolic concentration of trisNTAf further corroborates the high target sensitivity at subnanomolar concentrations (300 pM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in line with the detection limit of 200 pM trisNTAAlexa647 in chemically arrested cells (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, this enables the precise adjustment of the effective, intracellular trisNTAf concentration to improve the signal-to-background ratio, hardly realized by alternative approaches at nanomolar probe concentrations (for example, CPPs, SNAP, CLIP and Halo tag; Supplementary Figs 4 and 9)3,4,6,18, and circumvents endocytic uptake observed with supercharged proteins at similar nanomolar concentrations (Supplementary Fig 8)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In-cell protein modification with nanometre precision', 'Incited by this observation, we aimed at temporal and spatial control of protein tracing by light, which depends on low probe concentrations for high signal-to-background ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using photoactivatable trisNTAf (PA-trisNTAATTO565)20 for dynamic cellular imaging on demand, light-activated in vivo labelling of His10-mEGFPLamin A was demonstrated up to 24 h after squeezing (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, already a 10-s 405-nm light pulse sufficiently activated PA-trisNTA at single-cell level and led to excellent co-localization in a dose-adapted manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This probe enables in situ labelling at defined time points such as certain mitotic phases and paves the way for live-cell protein tracing with high temporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanomolar concentrations (10 nM) and in particular the small size of the tag and probe are especially beneficial for advanced microscopy techniques, bringing the fluorophore in 1-nm proximity to the target protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we performed live-cell super-resolution microscopy with trisNTAATTO655 on His10-mEGFPLamin A-transfected cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM)21, Lamin A structures with a high signal-to-noise ratio were obtained in the super-resolved images of live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A localization precision of 16.4±3.1 nm was achieved, resulting in a resolution of 40 nm by in-cell trisNTAATTO655 tracing with substantially increased resolution compared with diffraction-limited fluorescence microscopy (Fig 3d).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We established a high-throughput method for protein labelling inside living cells using a minimalistic lock-and-key probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our method is versatile in the choice of the molecular probe, cell type and the subcellular localization of the POIs, a persistent challenge in live-cell analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high-affinity trisNTA/His tag interaction pair enables fast labelling (10 min) at subnanomolar concentrations with tunable labelling density and flexibility of cell-impermeable organic fluorophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with carrier-mediated transport by CPPs11,18, delivery of 1,000-fold lower concentrations (nM versus M) effectively decreases the fluorescence background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, high-throughput analysis with up to 1,000,000 cells per second can be achieved in contrast to microinjection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, trisNTAf delivery via squeezing avoids endocytic cargo uptake, frequently observed with low CPP concentrations and supercharged molecules, offering decreased toxicity and a 30-fold higher efficiency compared with electroporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimal probe complements the toolbox of well-established labelling techniques such as self-labelling enzymes and can be combined with the latter to achieve distinct labelling of different proteins in fixed as well as in living cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in situ photoactivation of PA-trisNTA allows labelling at defined time points, to trace proteins for dynamic cellular imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The achieved close target proximity of the labelling pair substantially improved the localization accuracy in live-cell super-resolution microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkable aspects of our approach are the speed, flexibility and efficiency for high-throughput live-cell targeting of proteins even if assembled in stable and transient macromolecular complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study is exploited via one of the smallest high-affinity lock-and-key recognition pairs known so far and allows even multiple cargos to be delivered simultaneously, displaying diverse chemical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantity of cargo for in-cell manipulation can be precisely tuned and the biological output can in turn be fine-tuned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the affinity tag is widely used in life sciences and our delivery platform is broadly applicable across cell types, this live-cell labelling method could potentially be implemented across numerous cell-impermeable probes and prodrugs, as well as translated to difficult cell lines including patient-derived cells and embryonic stem cells, providing the opportunity to use these cells for advanced microscopy techniques and live-cell analysis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
