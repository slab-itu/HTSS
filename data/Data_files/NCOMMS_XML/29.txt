Direct observation shows superposition and large scale flexibility within cytoplasmic dynein motors moving along microtubules  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cytoplasmic dynein is a dimeric AAA+ motor protein that performs critical roles in eukaryotic cells by moving along microtubules using ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here using cryo-electron microscopy we directly observe the structure of Dictyostelium discoideum dynein dimers on microtubules at near-physiological ATP concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They display remarkable flexibility at a hinge close to the microtubule binding domain (the stalkhead) producing a wide range of head positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About half the molecules have the two heads separated from one another, with both leading and trailing motors attached to the microtubule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other half have the two heads and stalks closely superposed in a front-to-back arrangement of the AAA+ rings, suggesting specific contact between the heads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All stalks point towards the microtubule minus end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean stalk angles depend on the separation between their stalkheads, which allows estimation of inter-head tension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide a structural framework for understanding dyneins directionality and unusual stepping behaviour.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dyneins are a group of motor proteins that move along microtubules (MTs) to cause the beating of the axoneme in cilia and flagella and to perform vital and diverse transport and tethering roles in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells, for instance transporting mRNA, growth factors and -amyloid precursor protein1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynein also transports the nucleus in neurons, which is essential to human development and maintenance of healthy neuronal activities3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growing numbers of neurodegenerative diseases and developmental problems are now known to result from mutations in dynein or dynein-binding proteins5,6, and dynein-mediated processes are implicated in cancer7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So, in addition to its intrinsic interest, understanding dynein mechanism is critical for future treatment of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dyneins have an unusual structure in which each ring-like ATPase head attaches to the MT via a slender, coiled-coil stalk at the tip of which is a small, globular, MT-binding subdomain that we term the stalkhead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (The stalkhead has also been called the MT binding domain (MTBD) but the meaning of MTBD is ambiguous for axonemal dyneins, since the stalkhead binds to one MT doublet and the tail binds to an adjacent doublet; by contrast, stalkhead is intuitively understood and more concise.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atomic structure of the motor domain is known8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heart of the motor domain is a AAA+ superfamily mechano-enzyme11, in which six AAA+ motifs form a ring that hydrolyses ATP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Associated with the AAA+ ring (hereafter simply ring) is a C-terminal sequence that is implicated in determining the stall force and run length of the motor12,13, and that is unusually short in the much-studied yeast dynein13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytoplasmic dynein includes two identical heavy chains, each forming tail and motor domains (Fig 1a)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complex N-terminal tail incorporates additional polypeptides, binds cargoes and dimerizes the motors15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between the tail and ring is the linker18 that provides the power stroke of the motor19 by switching from bent (primed) to straight (unprimed)8,9,10,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ring, C-terminal sequence and linker together constitute the head, from which the stalk extends (Fig 1a)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Cryo-EM of dimeric dynein motors bound to MTs in 2 mM Mg-ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Domains in the amino acid sequence of D. discoideum dynein heavy chain and (right) cartoon depicting the domain architecture of the dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal tail (residues 1-1387, brown) dimerizes the motor in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The motor includes six AAA+ modules: AAA1 (blue)-AAA6 (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stalk and stalkhead emerges from AAA4, the strut from AAA5 and sequence numbers indicate the invariant prolines at the stalk-stalkhead junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linker (magenta and pale grey) and C-terminal domain (black) lie on opposite faces of the AAA+ ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proposed moving part of the linker (L, magenta) is indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Recombinant chimeric dynein dimerized by GST and with stalkhead from human axonemal dynein heavy chain 7;

Fig 1b) yields a simpler dimer that still processively steps along MT13,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural mechanism of cytoplasmic dyneins processive stepping along MTs is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracking fluorescently-tagged dynein suggested uncoordinated stepping by the two heads26,27, but they must also communicate since the properties of dimers on the MT are different from those of monomers13,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dyneins unusual architecture suggests that its stepping mechanism may be fundamentally different from the other transport motors, kinesin and myosin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The structural basis of processive stepping by cytoplasmic dynein has not previously been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding of myosin-5s movement along actin filaments was greatly aided by visualizing it on its actin track by using negative stain electron microscopy at rate-limiting (micromolar) ATP concentrations29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a study on dynein would be problematic because MT diameter is much greater than actin filament diameter, which could lead to structural collapse of both MT and dynein during drying of the stained specimen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to understand dynein stepping, we have used the technically more demanding unstained cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) technique to discover the structures of stepping dynein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike many recent applications of cryo-EM, our aim here is not to produce a high resolution structure of the stepping molecule, but rather to trap a dynamic motor in action, so that we can see the range of structures that dynein adopts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have succeeded in imaging dynein-MT complexes at near-physiological (millimolar) ATP and revealed a great diversity of structures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cryo-EM of cytoplasmic dynein dimers moving on MTs in physiological ATP', 'In the presence of millimolar MgATP, we found most artificially-dimerized Dictyostelium discoideum cytoplasmic dynein motors (GST-380) are detached from MTs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replacement of the stalkhead with that of human axonemal dynein 7 (DNAH7) to form GST-380H7 produces a dimer that has a similar structure in the absence of MTs as GST-380 (Supplementary Fig 1), but stronger binding to MTs in TIRF-M stepping assays (Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The longer duration of runs together with the higher attachment rate of GST-380H7 compared with that of GST-380 also indicate that GST-380H7 has a much higher affinity to MTs than GST-380 (Supplementary Table 1), and this chimeric dynein moves robustly along MTs (Supplementary Fig 2a; Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cryo-EM in the presence of 2 mM Mg-ATP shows almost all GST-380H7 dimers are bound to the MTs (Fig 1ce), including at their flared ends (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynein forms a fringe along either side of the MT, not all around it (Fig 1c), indicating that these rapidly stepping molecules use the few seconds taken to prepare the specimen to favour the MT protofilaments nearest the centre of the thin (typically 50 nm) liquid film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This simplifies the analysis of the configurations of the stepping dynein molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Characterization of MT-bound dimer configurations', 'Raw images have sufficient contrast to show the head and stalk domains (Fig 1d, arrows), but greater structural detail is revealed using single-particle image processing30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first determined MT polarity31 and hence the direction of dynein stepping (see Supporting Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 1,082 such MTs we identified 10,080 dynein-MT complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid ambiguity of assignment of heads into dimers we then selected a subset of isolated molecules in which two heads  less_than 40-nm apart lacked neighbours within ±40 nm along the MT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forty nanometres exceeds the maximum headhead separation observed in MT-free GST-dynein dimers (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stringent criterion yielded 374 molecules showing two variably spaced heads, referred to as offset dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second group of 322 molecules showed only a single head  greater than 40 nm from its nearest neighbour (single arrows, Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For such heads, summed, normalized pixel values of individual molecules are almost twice those of monomeric dynein (that is, lacking the N-terminal GST) bound to MTs, and are within error the same as those of the combined heads of offset dimers (Fig 1f;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We succeeded in seeing dimeric dynein attached to MTs in ATP by using Dictyostelium cytoplasmic dynein motors dimerized by GST at the end of the linker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also have the stalkhead

shares many properties with intact dynein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, for our construct attached to MT in ATP, the stalk angle and the position of GST, close to the MT surface, are consistent with the

similar to intact dynein22,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally yeast GST-dynein movement on MTs is comparable to intact yeast dynein25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there are strong grounds for supposing that our findings are informative for understanding the behaviour of intact cytoplasmic dynein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our cryo-EM of stepping dynein reveals a great diversity of structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only is there the variety in the separation of stalkheads along the MT anticipated from step-measuring studies, but also a flexibility at the stalk-stalkhead junction that produces a continuum of structures that is especially marked for offset dimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have been able to exploit this flexibility to deduce estimates of mechanical properties of dynein attached to its track.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When stalkheads are attached far apart along the MT, the internal stress within the dynein dimer is expressed partly in a change in the angles of both stalks, allowing the heads to be less far apart, but principally by an extension of the linkage between the two heads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We deduce a value of 0.035 pN nm1 for the elastic spring constant of this headhead linkage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modelling the behaviour of a dimerized yeast dynein33 has suggested a similar value (0.083 pN nm1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular basis of this elastic linkage is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If it were an unstructured polypeptide behaving as a worm-like chain, the deduced low stiffness over the wide observed range of head separations would require a polypeptide of several hundred amino acids, which is not present in our dimeric dynein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative which invites future investigation is flexion of the two linker subdomains away from the unprimed conformations that they adopt in the superposed dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A natural interpretation of our finding that superposed and offset heads are equally abundant is that these structures alternate during stepping and that each has a similar lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An example of how such a stepping cycle could coordinate with ATPase activity and how the two stalkheads would move along the MT is shown in Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strict alternation is not, however, implied by our data and other examples that demonstrate more freedom, including stepping along single protofilaments and movements between protofilaments, are shown in Supplementary Fig 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the lifetimes of the two structures are unequal, the one with shorter lifetime should occur more often during a stepping sequence to yield the observed similar abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Summary of dimer configurations in ATP and tentative stepping model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

alternative stepping patterns are illustrated in Supplementary Fig 9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) In superposed dimers, the stalkhead-stalk hinge allows flexing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In offset dimers, the compliant GST-linker bridge between rings (black coil spring) additionally allows quasi-independent flexing of the heads and pulls the heads towards one another with increasing stalkhead separation.Full size image', 'An important parameter for a processive, cargo-carrying motor protein is its duty ratio, that is, the fraction of the motor cycle during which it is strongly attached to its track.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The duty ratio of the dimeric dynein that we have imaged is 0.9 if determined assuming independent heads42 and 600-nm mean run length on MT (Supplementary Table 1; see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a higher value than our previous estimate (0.6) for dimeric D. discoideum dynein28, and much higher than that of monomer (0.2) ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By EM we have not detected dimers with one detached motor, suggesting that each motor is almost always attached, that is, has a duty ratio near 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'What structural mechanisms could enhance processivity of the dimer over that of monomer to reduce the probability of both heads detaching simultaneously?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the superposed dimer the two motors appear identical, so it is unclear why either motor would behave differently from a monomer, unless this is mediated by contacts between the two heads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In offset dimers, we find that intramolecular force biases the orientation of the two stalks in opposite directions (which has been shown to alter the force required to detach them from the MT24,33), and this force may have further impacts on head structure, such as linker position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When dynein is pulling against a load, formation of the superposed dimer may be favoured because the advancing head may more often attach only 0.9 nm ahead of its partner, and the compact structure may then provide additional stability, helping dynein function as an anchor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reasoning thus predicts that the superposed configuration is dominant in, for example, the mitotic spindle (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of the frequency of superposed and offset rings among molecules with superposed stalkheads (318/31; see Fig 3i, first bar) yields an estimate of 10 for the equilibrium constant for the headhead association when the two motors are attached to the MT under no load, and resistive load would be expected to increase this value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results provide direct evidence for the mechanism of dynein stepping in ATP, since we have observed dynein directly during ATP-fuelled movement along MT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This establishes that (1) the angle between stalk and MT is 42° for both leading and trailing motors; (2) the ring of the attached motor maintains a constant orientation in which its plane is parallel to the axis of the MT; (3) the linkers point towards the MT track, rather than away from it (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our atomic model derived from earlier EM and crystal structure data (Fig 2h) the stalk angle is similar (45°), but steeper angles of 50°-70° are seen for monomeric dynein densely labelling MTs36 and for axonemal dyneins43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this motor configuration on the MT, and as is shown in Fig 4b, when ATP binding to the ring causes stalkhead detachment from46 (or weak binding to40,47) the MT, the subsequent linker swing to the primed position is in a direction which biases the stalkhead towards the minus end of the MT, that is, in the known direction of dynein movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because, in order for the stalkhead to rebind stereospecifically to the MT, the stalk must be pointing towards the MT minus end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rebinding to the MT, followed by linker swing back to the unprimed position (that is, the power stroke), will then drag dyneins cargo towards the MT minus end.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Perhaps the most striking feature of stepping dynein is the great flexibility between the ATPase domain and the track binding domain (Fig 4c), which is in marked contrast to myosin and kinesin motors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the hinge is close to the MT surface, at the stalk-stalkhead junction, the dynein head swings over a wide range (20 nm) compared with the 8 nm spacing of binding sites on the MT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that fluorescent tags attached to the heads for stepping studies26,27 may not reliably report the position of the MT-bound stalkheads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During stepping, this flexing of the attached motor will allow the detached stalkhead of its partner motor great freedom to explore the surface of the MT to find its next binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, together with extensibility between the two heads of the dimer, which will differ between the native dimer and the artificial dimers used here and elsewhere, provides a structural basis for the great range of step sizes seen in dynein stepping studies24,25,26,27,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This inherent flexibility of the dynein motor, and the quasi-independent flexibility of the two motors of offset dimers, implies that it is wrong to imagine stepping dynein as having a single structure, even when both motors are attached to the MT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will therefore be a challenge to determine the structure of any dynein-MT complex at high resolution, since current methods for this all combine data from many molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynein flexibility also raises new questions about the nature of the allosteric communication between the ATPase cycle in the head and the MT binding affinity of the stalkhead that is vital to dyneins many cellular functions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

each particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We manually identified the centre of each ring (producing two images from each offset dimer) and masked features outside this with a soft-edged mask.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This produced a total of n=1,092 ring images (2 × 381 offset+330 superposed) which were combined into a single image stack for subsequent reference-free translational alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maintaining the rotational alignment obtained in the previous step (to ensure MTs remain horizontal) we refined their translational alignment in two successive rounds, excluding those that were assigned excessively large translations arising from spurious image features (leaving n=374 offset dimers and n=322 superposed dimers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To create class averages showing the heterogeneity of ring configurations in offset dimers (Fig 3a) we applied classification procedures to the (x,y) coordinates of each ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pixel intensity value measurement of dynein motor domain', 'The dynein ring total pixel values measurement (Fig 1f) was carried out after adjusting each image to ensure the background ice had a mean pixel value of zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projected sum of pixel values of each dynein dimer was then calculated as shown in Supplementary Fig 4, measured relative to the values of the adjacent MT in each individual particle (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images of monomeric dynein were treated identically to those of superposed dimers, except that MT polarity was not determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Atomic model building', 'To create hypothetical atomic models of the dynein dimer strongly bound to a MT (Supplementary Fig 6), we first fitted the tubulin dimer that is part of a murine stalk-stalkhead-tubulin dimer atomic model obtained by cryo-EM analysis (PDB 3J1T36) into a cryo-EM map of a 14_3 protofilament MT (emd_5194 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  67)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To complete the dynein motor we used the 2.8-Å crystal structures of the ADP-dynein motor domain from D. discoideum lacking the stalkhead (PDB 3VKG8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comprises two independent dynein monomers (chains A and B), that are arranged back-to-back in the crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chains A and B also have different stalk angles relative to the ring (25°)8, which therefore repositions the rings in the MT-bound dynein models depending which chain is fused to the murine stalk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We superposed the stalk using the CCP4 LSQKAB program68, to fit the C atoms of the distal portions of CC1 and CC2 of the motor domain stalk coiled coil to the corresponding atoms of the murine stalk (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To create complete molecule A, we fitted residues 33503366 (CC1) and 34963514 (CC2) in chain A of 3VKG to residues 32643280 (CC1) and 34093427 (CC2) in chain A of 3J1T (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To create complete molecule B, we fitted residues 33503358 (CC1) and 35023514 (CC2) in chain B of 3VKG to residues 32643272 (CC1) and 34153427 (CC2) in chain A of 3J1T (Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then measured the distances between C atoms among the fitted residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the shortest distance among the fitted residues we fused the two structures together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This produced two alternative back-to-back models, in which necessarily only one of the stalks was attached to the MT (Supplementary Fig 6b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both these models the stalks are not superposed in the view seen in our data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we made a third back-to-back model by rotating chains A and B about an axis approximately parallel to the stalks until the stalks superposed (Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To make four front-to-back models of dimeric dynein on the MT (Supplementary Fig 6dg), we deleted the detached dynein motor in the back-to-back models shown in Supplementary Fig 6b,c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then docked a second complete dynein molecule, either A or B, to a neighbouring tubulin dimer in an adjacent protofilament, by fitting the model into the MT cryo-EM map as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rotate each ring into the plane of view (see text), we broke the coiled-coil chains near the stalk-stalkhead junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Molecular graphics were created using the UCSF Chimera package69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Deduction of dynein mechanical properties', 'The torsion spring constant for the dynein stalk-stalkhead hinge was estimated by applying the Equipartition Theorem to the observed distribution of stalk angles, using =kBT/2, where  is the torsion spring constant (N m rad2), kB the Boltzmann constant, T absolute temperature (293 K in our case) and 2 the variance of measured lever angle (rad2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To express stiffness as the apparent cantilever stiffness (k in pN nm1) of the MT-attached stalk (that is, the resistance experienced by a force applied parallel to the MT axis at the base of the stalk, where the linker ends), we equated the energy for rotation of the stalk through an angle  (.2/2) with the energy to bend the stalk to move the head through the same distance (x) as produced by the angular rotation (that is, kx2/2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a cantilever, length L, at 90° to the MT axis, x=L.sin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, for small displacements for which sin, k=/L2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the cantilever is at angle  (in our case  42°), the effective lever length is L.sin, hence k=/(L.sin)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated L=12.3 nm by subtracting the head radius (6.5 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8)) from our measured mean value (18.8 nm) of the distance from ring centre to hinge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To observe trends in mean stalk angle due to increasing intramolecular tension in offset dimers with increasing stalkhead separation (Fig 3e,f), we generated running averages as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using data sorted by stalkhead separation, the mean angle and mean stalkhead separation of the first 100 data points was calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first data point was then removed, the 101st data point was added and the calculations repeated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cycle was repeated until all data points had been included.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
