Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Metal oxide semiconductors are promising photoelectrode materials for solar water splitting due to their robustness in aqueous solutions and low cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, their solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies are still not high enough for practical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a strategy to enhance the efficiency of metal oxides, hetero-type dual photoelectrodes, in which two photoanodes of different bandgaps are connected in parallel for extended light harvesting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a photoelectrochemical device made of modified BiVO4 and -Fe2O3 as dual photoanodes utilizes visible light up to 610 nm for water splitting, and shows stable photocurrents of 7.0±0.2 mA cm2 at 1.23 VRHE under 1 sun irradiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A tandem cell composed with the dual photoanodessilicon solar cell demonstrates unbiased water splitting efficiency of 7.7%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results and concept represent a significant step forward en route to the goal of  greater than 10% efficiency required for practical solar hydrogen production.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The first requirement for efficient conversion of photons to electrons using a semiconductor is its proper bandgap (Eg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photons with energy smaller than Eg pass through the semiconductor without being absorbed (non-absorption loss), while photons with energy in excess of Eg lose a part of their energy by emitting phonons (that is, lattice vibrations and heat) on absorption (thermalization losses)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two fundamental losses could be minimized by a multi-junction approach as proven in photovoltaics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a large Eg semiconductor absorbs first the high-energy photons of the solar spectrum, and a small Eg semiconductor placed behind it utilizes the low-energy photons that transmit through the first absorber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the theoretical efficiency of a multi-junction solar cell can reach 68%, breaking the ShockleyQueisser limit of 31% for a single junction solar cell1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We attempt to apply this concept to solar water splitting by combining two well-established metal oxide photoanodes, BiVO4 and Fe2O3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virtues of these metal oxide semiconductors are good stability in aqueous solutions3,4,5,6, low-cost and easy solution-based processing7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, BiVO4 could use only photons of  less_than 510 nm due to its rather large Eg (direct 2.6 eV and indirect 2.4 eV)5,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Fe2O3 has a nearly ideal Eg of 2.0 eV, and can utilize the longer-wavelength ( less_than 620 nm) photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, its solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies (STH) of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting remains modest because of its notoriously poor electrical properties15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, by combining these two semiconductors, different parts of the solar spectrum could be utilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The common way to utilize different Egs for efficient light harvesting is to form a heterojunction12,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, when BiVO4 and Fe2O3 are combined to form a bilayer-type heterojunction, this composite photoanode shows an inferior PEC water oxidation performance relative to either of the single-component photoanodes as demonstrated in Supplementary Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ineffective BiVO4/Fe2O3 heterojunction originates from their straddling (type I) band alignment instead of a desired staggering (type II) type, which prevents the holes generated in Fe2O3 from transferring to BiVO4, and thus is not suitable for effective charge separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To enhance the light harvesting in two semiconductors of different Egs, here we introduce a concept of hetero-type dual photoelectrode (HDP) containing two independent liquidsemiconductor junctions as presented in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using the large Eg semiconductor as the top absorber and the small Eg semiconductor at the bottom, both thermalization and non-absorption losses could be minimized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advantage of our HDP concept is that current-matching of the two electrodes is not required unlike multi-junction solar cells9 and heterojunction photoelectrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we can independently optimize each photoelectrode, and the performance of the HDP device becomes the simple sum of the individual performance of the two.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the spectral range of light harvesting in the solar spectrum utilized for PEC water splitting is extended.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Wavelength-selective solar light absorption by hetero-type dual photoanode.HDP made with different bandgap materials (for example, BiVO4 and Fe2O3).Full size image', 'We note that the HDP concept is analogous to a natural photosynthesis by seaweeds (or marine algae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They develop varying colours depending on the depth of the sea that they inhabit due to the availability of different photons at different depths in the seared light can reach only shallow depths because of its low photon energy ( greater than 600 nm) while blue light (  less_than 420 nm) can penetrate deeper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adapting to the availability of photons of varying wavelengths, the seaweed colony is capable of selective light utilization for photosynthesis by varying their habitat depth from green (Chlorophyta), yellow (Phaeophyceae) and then to red (Rhodophyta) as one goes deeper into the sea21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of developing an ideal single-light absorber that can handle all range of photons, the seaweeds develop smart wavelength-optimized light absorbers for sequential light utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such resemblance is rather interesting, as the other commonly used light utilization schemeso called tandem cell also resembles PSII/PSI of natural photosynthesis in using multiple light absorbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we implement the concept of the HDP using BiVO4 as the front and -Fe2O3 as the back photoanodes for PEC water splitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To extract the best possible performance of the single photoanodes, we need bulk and surface modifications by doping and co-catalyst, respectively, to improve the charge separation/transfer properties of these semiconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, a PEC device made of modified BiVO4 and -Fe2O3 as dual photoanodes shows stable photocurrents of 7.0±0.2 mA cm2 at 1.23 VRHE under 1 sun irradiation utilizing visible light up to 610 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A tandem cell composed of HDPsilicon solar cell demonstrates unbiased water splitting efficiency of 7.7%.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fabrication of photoanodes and their PEC properties', 'The base BiVO4 electrode was fabricated by a metal-organic deposition method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, 1 at% (optimized) Mo doping and partial reduction treatment were performed to increase mainly the bulk charge separation efficiency as reported in our recent work8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction treatment via a borohydride decomposition method induced Vo.. defects that effectively increase the charge carrier density in BiVO4 lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the partial reduction and extrinsic Mo doping treatments synergistically improve the n-type conductivity of BiVO4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other photoanode, haematite Fe2O3, was synthesized by a nitrate decomposition method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This photoanode was doped with 0.5 at% (optimized) Ti, and also partially reduced by the borohydride decomposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Supplementary Figs 2 and 3, BiVO4 and Fe2O3 have nanoporous, well-connected and non-isotropic morphologies with typical feature sizes of 50 and 10 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, co-catalysts of NiOOH/FeOOH and Ni2FeOx with a thin TiO2 overlayer were deposited on the surface of BiVO4 and haematite, respectively, to improve the charge carrier injection efficiency to the electrolyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SEM images in Supplementary Figs 2 and 3 show that the co-catalyst nanoparticles are well dispersed on each semiconductor surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray diffraction crystal structures of the photoanode films are standard monoclinic BiVO4 and haematite -Fe2O3 as shown in Supplementary Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) spectra in Supplementary Fig 5 show binding energies at typically expected positions for BiVO4 and Fe2O3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  See the Methods section and Supplementary Discussion for detailed procedures and discussion for synthesis, optimization and characterization of the two modified photoanodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The bulk-modified films were tested first as photoanodes for PEC oxidation of a sacrificial sulphite (SO32) solution in a standard three-electrode PEC cell to evaluate their light absorption capability and bulk charge separation efficiency (bulk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Supplementary Fig 6, doping with Mo (or Ti) combined with reduction treatment greatly increases the photocurrent and bulk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For BiVO4, reduced 1% Mo:BiVO4 shows bulk  90% at 1.23 VRHE, which is comparable to the reported state-of-the-art BiVO4 photoanodes6,8,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Doping and partial reduction treatments are also found to reduce the photocurrent gap between front and back illumination, indicating improved bulk electron transport8,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same tendency was also observed for Fe2O3, although the highest bulk was only 41% at 1.23 VRHE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) values of bare haematite above 400 nm in Supplementary Fig 7 are relatively low as they originate from an inefficient indirect dd transition of Fe3+ (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the Ti doping and reduction treatments are especially effective in increasing the IPCE of the indirect transition near the absorption edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated by the MottSchottky (MS) plots in Supplementary Fig 8, the main effect of the doping and reduction treatments is to increase the charge carrier density of BiVO4 and Fe2O3, and thereby to improve their bulk charge transfer properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using these two optimized photoanodes, a HDP denoted as BiVO4||Fe2O3 was fabricated by placing the haematite electrode (H, TiO2/0.5% Ti:Fe2O3) behind the BiVO4 electrode (H, 1% Mo:BiVO4) in parallel connection as depicted in Figs 1 and 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2b, the fabricated BiVO4, Fe2O3 and BiVO4||Fe2O3 electrodes are all highly transparent with a transmittance of 75% at 550 nm for BiVO4, 70% at 650 nm for haematite and 50% at 650 nm for the HDP (Fig 2f and Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, 50% of the incident light remains available for the third absorber (double c-Si) placed behind the HDP, which is needed to generate sufficient bias photovoltage to split water spontaneously as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

investigated first in a three-electrode configuration (with Pt counter electrode) under AM1.5 illumination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An aqueous solution containing a sacrificial agent (0.5 KPi+0.5 M Na2SO3) was used as an electrolyte.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the photo-oxidation of sulphite is so facile, the hole injection efficiency (surface) is essentially 100%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we can compare bulk photoactivities of the photoanodes by these measurements while avoiding any complications of the hole injection at the semiconductorelectrolyte interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2c, photocurrents of 5.0±0.2, 4.5±0.2, 2.2±0.1 and 7.1±0.2 mA cm2 at 1.23 VRHE were obtained for BiVO4, Fe2O3, Fe2O3 behind BiVO4 (with no BiVO4 contribution), and BiVO4||Fe2O3, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These photocurrents are optimized values by adjusting the thickness of BiVO4 and Fe2O3, which can be easily regulated by changing the quantity of precursor solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (See Fig 2d, Supplementary Figs 10 and 11 and Methods part for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, the HDP shows an increased photocurrent by 29.3% from that of a single BiVO4 photoanode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its photocurrent is almost the same as the sum of photocurrents generated by BiVO4 and Fe2O3 behind BiVO4, indicating that the HDP concept is indeed operating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also noteworthy that the onset potential of the BiVO4||Fe2O3 combination is 0.2 VRHE, which is the same as that of BiVO4 alone and far lower than that of a single haematite photoanode (0.4 VRHE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The IPCE of BiVO4 in Fig 2e is significantly higher than that of haematite in the range of 300450 nm, justifying BiVO4 as the first absorber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IPCE of the HDP further increases up to 95% in this region due to the additional photocurrent generated from haematite using the transmitted light through the BiVO4 electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the range of 450510 nm, IPCE of BiVO4 drops sharply due to the reduced light-harvesting efficiency close to its absorption threshold and indirect band transition (direct: 2.6 eV; indirect: 2.4 eV)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an important reason why the theoretical maximum photocurrent (7.5 mA cm2) of BiVO4 is very difficult to achieve with a single BiVO4 absorber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, haematite can utilize the transmitted light in this region efficiently as an additional absorber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the region of 510610 nm, only haematite contributes to the overall performance of HDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the IPCE values in this region drop below 20%, the effect is very significant since more than 50% of the solar energy exploitable by a photoelectrode lies in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The theoretical maximum photocurrent of Fe2O3 is 13.6 mA2, and nearly a half of it comes from photons with 500620 nm range24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this region has to be exploited to further improve the performance of HDP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PEC water splitting with an external bias', 'The performance of the photoanodes is now studied for water oxidation under 1 sun illumination in a three-electrode PEC cell without any sacrificial agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When used as a single photoanode, electrolytes of pH 7 and  greater than 12 are optimal for BiVO4 and Fe2O3, respectively, for their high activity and stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the first important task to apply the HDP for PEC water splitting is to find an optimum electrolyte suitable for both BiVO4 and Fe2O3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a screening test summarized in Supplementary Figs 12 and 14, we found that pH 9.2 (1.0 M bicarbonate KCi solution) was a good compromise for the two semiconductors and selected co-catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next step is to find the best co-catalysts to promote the PEC water oxidation activity and stability by accelerating the hole injection to the electrolyte to avoid surface charge recombination, and to protect the semiconductor from photochemical corrosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the co-catalyst selection process shown in Supplementary Figs 1214 and described in the Supplementary Information yielded NiOOH/FeOOH for BiVO4 and Ni2FeOx/TiO2 for Fe2O3 as the best oxygen evolution co-catalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the thin TiO2 layer deposited on the surface of Fe2O3 passivates the surface states of haematite (Supplementary Fig 13) that cause undesired electronhole recombination and potential drop within the Helmholtz layer25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the treatment not only improves photocurrent generation but also brings a negative shift of the onset potential and a greater photovoltage from the electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The water oxidation photocurrents of completed BiVO4, Fe2O3 and Fe2O3 behind BiVO4 photoanodes were 5.0±0.1, 4.0±0.2 and 2.0±0.1 mA cm2 at 1.23 VRHE, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BiVO4||Fe2O3 HDP photoanode recorded stable photocurrents of 7.0±0.2 and 8.0±0.2 mA cm2 at 1.23 VRHE and 1.5 VRHE, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This PEC performance represents the highest ever reported for stable metal oxide photoelectrodes to the best of our knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The benchmarking results against other studies are presented in Supplementary Table 1, in which it can be seen that not only HDP but also the individual BiVO4 and Fe2O3 photoanodes are among the top performers within their classes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The performance was highly reproducible as demonstrated in Supplementary Fig 15 and most of the photocurrents came from water splitting to 2H2+O2 gases with almost complete faradaic efficiency (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HDP utilized visible light up to 610 nm for water splitting as shown by action spectra in Fig 3eg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photocurrents and IPCEs for water oxidation show similar values to those in Fig 2 for sacrificial sulphite oxidation, indicating

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, we presented a HDP as a new strategy to fabricate a stand-alone, highly efficient solar water-splitting system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a HDP of BiVO4||Fe2O3, we obtained a water oxidation photocurrent density of 7.0±0.2 mA cm2 at 1.23 VRHE, which sets a new performance benchmark for metal oxide photoanodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As summarized in Fig 5 and Supplementary Table 1, it is the first metal oxide photoanode to break the barrier of 7.0 mA cm2 at 1.23 VRHE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also meaningful that the result demonstrates how to move forward beyond BiVO4 photoanode, which is the current forerunner material in solar water-splitting performance but is hampered by its relatively large bandgap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HDP photoanode was successfully incorporated into a tandem cell with a c-Si solar cell for unbiased solar water splitting to demonstrate a stable and reproducible STH of 7.7%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two easily conceivable ways to reach STH higher than 10%, which is required for practical solar water splitting and the goal of most solar fuel research projects in progress worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the saturated photocurrent of the current HDP is already over 8.3 mA cm2 (Fig 3a) and thus STH greater than 10% (8.1 mA cm2) could be obtained by further reducing the onset potential of the photoanode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, if the bulk charge separation efficiency of the Fe2O3 electrode increases from its current 40% to a modest 50%, a photocurrent of 8.1 mA cm2 or STH of 10.1% is expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the rapid progress made in the last decade as depicted in Fig 5, it seems highly likely that those two issues can be solved and that the goal of 10% STH can be achieved within the foreseeable future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the HDP concept proposed here represents a significant step forward en route to practical solar hydrogen production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Reported photocurrents of metal oxide photoanodes.HDP denotes BiVO4||Fe2O3 hetero dual photoelectrodes, and the unfilled symbols indicate that photocurrent values were measured at a potential different from the standard 1.23 VRHE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerical data are given in Supplementary Table 1.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
