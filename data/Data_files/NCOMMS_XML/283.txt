PX-RICS-deficient mice mimic autism spectrum disorder in Jacobsen syndrome through impaired GABAA receptor trafficking  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Jacobsen syndrome (JBS) is a rare congenital disorder caused by a terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of patients exhibit social behavioural problems that meet the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, the underlying molecular pathogenesis remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PX-RICS is located in the chromosomal region commonly deleted in JBS patients with autistic-like behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that PX-RICS-deficient mice exhibit ASD-like social behaviours and ASD-related comorbidities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PX-RICS-deficient neurons show reduced surface -aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) levels and impaired GABAAR-mediated synaptic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PX-RICS, GABARAP and 14-3-3/ form an adaptor complex that interconnects GABAAR and dynein/dynactin, thereby facilitating GABAAR surface expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASD-like behavioural abnormalities in PX-RICS-deficient mice are ameliorated by enhancing inhibitory synaptic transmission with a GABAAR agonist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings demonstrate a critical role of PX-RICS in cognition and suggest a causal link between PX-RICS deletion and ASD-like behaviour in JBS patients.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represents a group of aetiologically different neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by a triad of behavioural deficits: impairment in social interaction, difficulty with verbal and non-verbal communication and repetitive behaviour or restricted interests1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ASD is a highly heritable condition, with estimated heritability indices of 8090% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several lines of evidence suggest that an imbalance between neuronal excitation and inhibition (E/I) within specific cortical circuits is a shared cellular mechanism for the behavioural and cognitive symptoms in several psychiatric diseases, including ASD4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several known ASD-causative genes encode neuron-associated proteins that are essential for the formation and maintenance of glutamatergic excitatory synapses8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have also indicated that impaired presynaptic release of -aminobutyric acid (GABA), and the resulting dysfunction of GABA-mediated inhibitory signalling, has been associated with ASD5,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that a balance between glutamate and GABA signalling is essential for normal cognitive function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ASD-like behaviour is also known to appear as one of the comorbid symptoms of several developmental syndromes such as fragile-X syndrome2,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studying these syndromes will assist in better understanding the pathogenesis of non-syndromic ASD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jacobsen syndrome (JBS; MIM 147791), also known as 11q deletion syndrome or partial 11q monosomy syndrome, is a rare congenital disorder caused by a deletion within the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 11 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incidence of JBS has been estimated to be 1 of every 100,000 births14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JBS patients commonly suffer from a variety of pre- and post-natal developmental anomalies such as intellectual disability, characteristic facial dysmorphism, heart dysplasia and thrombocytopenia14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prospective genotype/phenotype studies have revealed several candidate genes that may be causative for each symptom of JBS15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Akshoomoff et al.18 have presented evidence that approximately half of JBS patients exhibit behavioural problems that meet the diagnostic criteria for ASD, and identified four annotated genes localized within a tiny (0.24 Mb) interstitial deletion region on 11q24.3 as candidate genes responsible for ASD-like behaviour in JBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have concluded that PX-RICS is the most promising candidate gene based on its predominant expression in the brain and its critical roles in dendritic spine morphology and axon elongation18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PX-RICS (ARHGAP32 isoform 1), a longer splicing isoform of RICS (ARHGAP32 isoform 2), is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Cdc42, containing multiple domains for proteinprotein interactions19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RICS is expressed exclusively in the brain in humans and regulates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated signalling at the postsynaptic density and axonal elongation at the growth cone19,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PX-RICS is expressed in relatively wide range of tissues but is predominantly expressed in the brain20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PX-RICS has a unique phospholipid-binding domain not shared by RICS: the Phox-homology (PX) domain that mediates its interaction with phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we have shown that PX-RICS interacts with GABA type A receptor (GABAAR)-associated protein (GABARAP) and 14-3-3/ to facilitate trafficking of the N-cadherin/-catenin cell adhesion complex in non-neuronal cells22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the autistic-like behaviour of PX-RICS-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate an essential role for PX-RICS in normal cognitive function and suggest that PX-RICS deficiency contributes to the behavioural deficits in JBS patients.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'PX-RICS-deficient mice exhibit ASD-like social behaviour', 'JBS is a haploinsufficiency disorder in which most cases carry a de novo terminal deletion of one chromosome 11q (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus included PX-RICS+/ mice in addition to PX-RICS+/+ and PX-RICS/ mice in all behavioural assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first examined voluntary social interaction using the three-chamber test (Supplementary Fig 1a)24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the emptyempty (habituation) session, no significant differences were observed between the time spent exploring both wired cages (Fig 1a,b) and between the time stay in left and right chambers (Supplementary Fig 1b,c) in all genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a stranger mouse was placed in one wired cage (strangerempty session), every genotype had a similar preference for the stranger-containing cage or chamber (Fig 1a,b and Supplementary Fig 1b,c), suggesting that PX-RICS/ mice have normal voluntary sociability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the subsequent familiarstranger session in which a novel stranger mouse was placed in the previously empty wired cage, PX-RICS+/+ mice spent more time with the novel stranger mouse (Fig 1a,b and Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PX-RICS/ mice did not show such a preference for social novelty and instead showed a tendency to spend more time with a familiar stranger mouse (Fig 1a,b and Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PX-RICS+/ mice exhibited an intermediate phenotype in the familiarstranger session.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences in exploration and locomotor activity were observed between genotypes in each session (Supplementary Fig 1df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1:

they only pushed their opponent, tried to squeeze themselves into the space between the opponent and the tube wall, or remained still.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Social interaction of nocturnal rodents is primarily driven by olfactory perception25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus examined responses to olfactory cues using the olfactory habituation/dishabituation test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that PX-RICS+/+ and PX-RICS+/ mice show strong habituation/dishabituation responses to all olfactory cues presented (Supplementary Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, whereas PX-RICS/ mice showed normal responses to non-social odours, they spent much less time interacting with unfamiliar social odours than PX-RICS+/+ and PX-RICS+/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that PX-RICS/ mice have decreased interest in unfamiliar social olfactory cues, although their olfactory perception is not impaired.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mouse pups, when separated from their mother, emit communicative ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during the first 2 or 3 postnatal weeks26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus measured maternal separation-induced USVs to quantify social communication deficits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1h, USVs of PX-RICS+/+ pups reached a maximum on postnatal day (PND) 7 and then decreased gradually to almost zero by PND21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PX-RICS/ pups emitted USVs much less frequently after PND7 and required more time to emit the first call on PND14 (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No significant differences were observed in the mean duration of calls, total calling time, peak frequency and peak amplitude between genotypes (Supplementary Fig 2be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest atypical postnatal development of motherpup communication in PX-RICS/ pups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Repetitive behaviour is the most noticeable symptom in ASD individuals1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We monitored repetitive self-grooming behaviour and found that PX-RICS/ mice spend more than twice as much time on repetitive self-grooming, persisting intermittently for an unusually long (more than 2 min) period (Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marble-burying test also revealed that PX-RICS/ mice have more than twofold higher activity of repetitive digging behaviour (Fig 1j,k and Supplementary Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PX-RICS+/ mice exhibited intermediate phenotypes in these assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly demonstrate increased repetitive behaviour in PX-RICS/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ASD individuals often exhibit inflexible adherence to routines1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the ability of mice to switch flexibly from a previously established habit to a novel habit, we employed acquisition and reversal learning tasks in a water T-maze27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Learning performance was represented by the number of trials in which mice made the correct arm choice, the number of trials required to achieve five consecutive correct arm choices and the latency to reach an escape platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the acquisition session, PX-RICS/ mice showed good learning performance comparable to PX-RICS+/+ and PX-RICS+/ mice (Fig 1l,m and Supplementary Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the subsequent reversal learning session, however, PX-RICS/ mice persistently chose the correct arm of the previous acquisition session, resulting in significantly worse learning performance (Fig 1l,m and Supplementary Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that PX-RICS/ mice have a tendency to adhere a previously established habit and less ability to adapt their behaviour to a novel situation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PX-RICS-deficient mice exhibit ASD-related comorbidities', 'In ASD individuals, the triad of core behavioural problems is commonly accompanied by neurodevelopmental comorbidities, including impaired motor coordination and epilepsy2,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated whether these ASD-related phenotypes are present in PX-RICS/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The accelerating rotarod test revealed that PX-RICS/ mice can stay on a rotating rod for significantly less time than PX-RICS+/+ controls (Fig 2a), indicating impaired motor coordination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PX-RICS+/ mice displayed intermediate motor coordination between PX-RICS+/+ and PX-RICS/ mice (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2:

tests prompted us to investigate the cellular function of PX-RICS underlying ASD-like behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that the PX-RICS/GABARAP/14-3-3 complex facilitates dynein-/dynactin-dependent trafficking of the N-cadherin/-catenin complex in non-neuronal cells22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GABARAP was originally identified as a protein that binds to the 2 subunit of GABAAR and is known to promote GABAAR trafficking to the neuronal surface31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus hypothesized that the PX-RICS/GABARAP/14-3-3 complex facilitates surface expression of GABAARs in neurons and that impairment of this trafficking mechanism causes ASD-like behaviour in PX-RICS-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first tested the possibility that PX-RICS is involved in GABAAR trafficking to the neuronal surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilized 2EP, a 2 subunit tagged at its N-terminal extracellular domain with ecliptic pHluorin33,34, a pH-sensitive variant of green fluorescent protein that is non-fluorescent in acidic environments (pH less_than 6)35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, 2EP-containing GABAARs are non-fluorescent during trafficking but become readily visualized when expressed on the neuronal surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When 2EP was expressed in PX-RICS+/+ cortical neurons and observed in pH 7.4 buffer, robust dot-like fluorescent signals could be detected (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fluorescence was almost entirely derived from surface-expressed 2EP because transient exposure to a pH 6.0 buffer quenched the fluorescent signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total 2EP fluorescence was revealed by subsequent exposure to an NH4Cl-containing pH 7.4 buffer, which equilibrates the intracellular pH to 7.4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in PX-RICS/ cortical neurons, surface fluorescence was markedly reduced, but total fluorescence in pH 7.4 NH4Cl-containing buffer was similar to that in PX-RICS+/+ neurons (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of the fluorescence intensities revealed that the amount of surface-expressed 2EP is markedly decreased in PX-RICS/ neurons (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was confirmed by the cell surface labelling and surface biotinylation assays (Supplementary Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Internalization activity for 2 was similar between the PX-RICS+/+ and PX-RICS/ cortical neurons, suggesting that the reduction in surface 2EP in PX-RICS/ neurons is due to impaired trafficking to the plasma membrane, not to enhanced endocytic withdrawal of surface 2EP (Supplementary Fig 3eh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell surface labelling and surface biotinylation assays revealed that surface-expressed 2 is markedly reduced in PX-RICS/ hippocampal neurons and cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) (Supplementary Fig 3a,c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, we concluded that surface expression of GABAARs is impaired in PX-RICS/ neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Decreased surface GABAAR expression and

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'JBS is a contiguous gene disorder caused by large terminal deletion of chromosome 11q (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simultaneous loss of multiple genes results in a wide variety of congenital defects, including intellectual disability14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Akshoomoff et al.18 have conducted cognitive and behavioural assessments of JBS patients using standardized diagnostic procedures and shown that more than half of JBS patients meet the criteria for ASD diagnosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, they defined the 0.24-Mb autism critical region in distal 11q and identified four annotated genes: KCNJ1, KCNJ5, TP53AIP1 and RICS/PX-RICS (Supplementary Fig 8) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KCNJ1 encodes the renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK), a member of the inward-rectifying K+ channel (Kir) family that plays important roles in K+ secretion into the tubular lumen in the nephron43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations of KCNJ1 cause antenatal Bartter syndrome type 2, a renal tubular disorder characterized by hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis and hyperreninemic hyperaldosteronism with normal blood pressure43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KCNJ5 encodes the G-protein-activated inward rectifier K+ channel that regulates aldosterone secretion44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations of KCNJ5 are implicated in primary hyperaldosteronism and cardiac long QT syndrome type 13 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TP53AIP, p53-regulated apoptosis-inducing protein 1, is a transcriptional target gene for p53 tumour suppressor protein and is specifically expressed in the thymus45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The encoded protein is localized in the mitochondrion and mediates p53-dependent apoptosis46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given their reported localizations and functions, it is unlikely that KCNJ1, KCNJ5 and TP53AIP1 are involved in cognitive function and cause the ASD-like behaviour observed in JBS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PX-RICS is the only candidate that is expressed predominantly in the brain and known to play functional roles in neurons20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study has shown that loss-of-function of PX-RICS in mice results in various ASD-like behaviour associated with deficits in PX-RICS-dependent GABAAR surface expression (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings strongly support the notion that PX-RICS is the gene responsible for ASD-like symptoms in JBS patients and also provide evidence that a gene encoding a trafficking factor is implicated in ASD-like behaviour (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore propose that JBS-related ASD (and possibly a subset of ASD) is a trafficking disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings also demonstrate that PX-RICS-mediated GABAAR trafficking is one of the biological systems that support normal cognitive function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, dysfunctional GABA signalling has been increasingly reported to be associated with ASD5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GABA-releasing neuron-specific deletion of the gene for methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2), a chromatin-associated transcription factor, in mice leads to a variety of Rett syndrome-like behavioural features10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice lacking the contactin-associated protein-like 2 gene (Cntnap2) encoding a neuronal transmembrane protein of the neurexin superfamily display a reduced number of GABA-releasing interneurons and ASD-related phenotypes11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forebrain interneuron-specific deletion of the Scn1a gene, which encodes the  subunit of the sodium channel neuronal type I, in mice results in decreased firing activity of GABA-releasing interneurons and ASD-related behaviour12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate that dysfunction of the presynaptic mechanisms for releasing GABA contributes to ASD-like behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the present study has shown that dysfunction of the postsynaptic mechanism for trafficking GABAARs in GABA-receiving neurons is also associated with ASD-like behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, GABA signalling is essential for normal cognitive function and seriously affects social behaviour if impaired in either GABA-releasing or GABA-receiving neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another important finding is that the ASD-like behavioural phenotypes of PX-RICS-deficient mice can be successfully rescued by treatment with a low dose of CZP, which suggests that compensatory potentiation of postsynaptic GABAergic signalling could be an effective therapeutic strategy for controlling ASD-like behavioural problems12,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the increasing number of children diagnosed with ASD and the high prevalence of ASD of 1% of the population, currently available pharmacological therapies remain supportive8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent whole-exome-sequencing study has identified a rare missense single-nucleotide variation in the PX-RICS gene in a non-syndromic ASD patient, suggesting that PX-RICS deficiency can be a pathogenic factor for this type of ASD as well48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that our PX-RICS-deficient mice can be a unique disease model that properly recapitulates the pathogenic process of ASD-like behaviour in JBS patients and a valuable tool for the discovery of permanent cure drugs, as well as for a better understanding of non-syndromic ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our previous reports revealed that PX-RICS is a GAP that selectively targets Cdc42 and that PX-RICS deficiency leads to an increase in neuronal Cdc42 activity19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that the Cdc42GAP activity is required for PX-RICS-mediated transport of the N-cadherin/-catenin complex22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How is Cdc42 activity connected with PX-RICS-mediated GABAAR trafficking?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, it is notable that collybistin, a brain-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor for Cdc42, is present in the scaffold protein complex for synaptic GABAARs and regulates gephyrin-dependent GABAAR anchoring and clustering49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collybistin binds to phosphatidylinositols (PIs), with a preference for PI3P and PI4P, through its pleckstrin homology domain50, as PX-RICS does20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the balance between the activities of the Cdc42 GDP/GTP exchange factor and GAP (that is, collybistin and PX-RICS) might control the synaptic expression and localization of GABAARs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have found that surface expression of GABAARs is impaired in PX-RICS/ neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, stimulation of GABA signalling with a GABAAR agonist improved some autistic-like phenotypes of PX-RICS/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we conclude that dysfunctional PX-RICS-mediated GABAAR trafficking in postsynaptic neurons is a plausible cause for the observed behavioural and molecular deficits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that alternative binding partners of PX-RICS are also relevant for GABAAR-mediated signalling; PX-RICS is known to interact with more than 60 proteins other than GABARAP and 14-3-3 s, many of which have potential roles in important neuronal processes such as neurite extension, regulation of Rho GTPases pathway and transcriptional regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cleary, further investigation is needed to test the involvement of other putative PX-RICS interactors in GABA signalling, as well as other proteins implicated in complementary or compensatory pathways.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
