Tamoxifen augments the innate immune function of neutrophils through modulation of intracellular ceramide  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tamoxifen, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator taken by hundreds of thousands of patients for the treatment of breast cancer1, is included on the World Health Organizations list of essential medicines due to its cost effectiveness and safety profile2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to its activity as an oestrogen receptor agonist/antagonist3, tamoxifen has many other effects that include modulation of sphingolipid biosynthesis4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such off-target effects have been shown to contribute to the therapeutic action of tamoxifen5; however, its impact on some normally functioning cell types, in particular circulating neutrophils, remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier investigations of the impact of tamoxifen on neutrophil function have largely been limited to its inhibition of transendothelial migration, suggesting a primary immunosuppressant activity6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because sphingolipids are known to be important modulators of immune cell function8, we investigated the effects of tamoxifen on human neutrophils, the primary phagocytic leukocyte of the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we find that tamoxifen, in addition to enhancing neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis, strongly promotes the formation of DNA-based neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NETs, which are coated with antimicrobial peptides, histones and/or granule proteases, are capable of entrapping and killing bacteria and other pathogens9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tamoxifen enhances killing of pathogens in vitro and enhances clearance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that such alterations in neutrophil activity are dependent on intracellular ceramide.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Direct assessment of N-Formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP)-induced neutrophil chemotaxis indicated that tamoxifen, while not stimulating chemotaxis by itself (Supplementary Fig 1), significantly enhanced directional cell migration in response to fMLP stimulation (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences in findings may be due to variations in protocol (for example, previous studies pre-incubated cells with tamoxifen and removed it before assessment of chemotaxis rather than assessing migration in its presence) or the added complexity of in vitro transendothelial migration models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these findings, fluorescence-based quantification of extracellular DNA release revealed that tamoxifen (Fig 1b), its active metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Fig 1b) and its primary metabolite N-desmethyltamoxifen (Supplementary Fig 2), strongly stimulated NET production in freshly isolated human neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were confirmed by immunostaining of stimulated neutrophils using a primary antibody against myeloperoxidase, a NET marker (Fig 1c)11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because tamoxifen is generally described to have antagonist activity at the oestrogen nuclear receptors ER and ER and agonist activity at the G-protein-coupled oestrogen receptor GPR30, we attempted to replicate these results using selective agonists/antagonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these studies, NET production was not observed in response to treatment with Methyl-piperidino-pyrazole (MPP) or pyrazolo 1,5-a pyrimidine (PHTPP) (selective ER and ER antagonists, respectively12,13), G-1 (a GPR30 agonist14) or fulvestrant (a selective oestrogen receptor modulator that mimics the mixed agonist/antagonist characteristics of tamoxifen15,16) (Supplementary Fig 3), indicating that tamoxifen-induced NET production is mediated by an oestrogen receptor-independent mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Tamoxifen promotes extracellular trap formation in human neutrophils in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The effect of 10 M tamoxifen (TAM;

Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated intracellular ceramides were also visually confirmed via immunocytochemistry using an anti-ceramide antibody (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further evidence of the role of ceramide in NET production was obtained by treating cells with D,L-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (DL-PDMP), a selective inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase that mimics the intracellular ceramide-increasing effect of tamoxifen22, which also promoted NET production (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sphingosine-1-phosphate, which is generated from ceramide via the cascade initiated by glucosylceramide synthase23, did not significantly promote NET production (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further confirm that tamoxifen-induced NET production is ceramide dependent, we pre-incubated neutrophils with myriocin, an inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of this enzyme, which initiates the pathway that generates ceramide from palmitoyl-CoA, prevents tamoxifen-mediated ceramide accumulation25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it does not directly inhibit PKC (Supplementary Fig 7), myriocin treatment resulted in complete inhibition of tamoxifen-induced NET production (Fig 3h) and partially reversed inhibition of PMA-induced ROS production by tamoxifen (Supplementary Fig 8), illustrating the key role of ceramide accumulation in this pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Tamoxifen-induced NET production is mediated by intracellular ceramide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Ceramide-induced NET production was visualized by immunostaining neutrophils for myeloperoxidase (blue: DAPI;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In sum, we have shown that tamoxifen enhances neutrophil bactericidal activity, with increased NET production a likely contributory mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our evidence suggests that this enhancement occurs in significant part through the modulation of intracellular ceramide levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ceramide, an important bioactive sphingolipid and cellular stress signal, has previously been linked to neutrophil apoptosis29,30, and tamoxifen-induced ceramide accumulation mediates certain oestrogen receptor-independent effects of the drug against cancer tissues5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that both tamoxifen and synthetic ceramide are potent inducers of NETosis, a novel cell death pathway with an important role in innate immunity31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ceramide can activate both apoptotic and autophagocytic pathways32, the latter of which have recently been implicated in NET production33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shifting the balance between apoptotic and autophagocytic pathways may influence relative levels of NET production; indeed, we found that rapamycin, a potent inducer of autophagy, enhanced ceramide-induced NET production while having little effect on its own (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further investigation of compounds that modulate the ceramide biosynthesis pathway may reveal more potent enhancers of neutrophil antimicrobial activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along these lines, it is interesting to note that the active metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, is even more potent at enhancing NET release and bactericidal activity than tamoxifen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exploring the mechanism underlying tamoxifen/4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced NET formation may facilitate discovery of derivative compounds specifically optimized to promote targeted enhancement of innate immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The outcomes of enhanced NET production are likely to be pathogen specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several bacterial species are capable of evading NET capture through various mechanisms (for example, via the expression of extracellular nucleases capable of cleaving DNA-based structures34,35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of S. aureus, a focus of this study, tamoxifen may exhibit particularly marked effects due to the pathogens ability not only to evade killing via opsonophagocytosis36,37 and oxidative burst38, but also to invade neutrophils and trigger a unique necrolytic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed neutrophils in peritoneal lavage samples collected from tamoxifen-treated mice exhibited a significantly reduced bacterial load in comparison with untreated controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to their role in innate immunity, excessive or aberrant production of NETs has been implicated in inflammatory diseases such as vasculitis and bronchial asthma39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cumulative effect of tamoxifen on neutrophil responses hold clinical implications, given the large number of patients receiving this drug and related therapeutic agents.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
