Spatial mapping of juxtacrine axo-glial interactions identifies novel molecules in peripheral myelination  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cellcell interactions promote juxtacrine signals in specific subcellular domains, which are difficult to capture in the complexity of the nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, contact between axons and Schwann cells triggers signals required for radial sorting and myelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Failure in this interaction causes dysmyelination and axonal degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its importance, few molecules at the axo-glial surface are known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify novel molecules in axo-glial interactions, we modified the pseudopodia sub-fractionation system and isolated the projections that glia extend when they receive juxtacrine signals from axons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By proteomics we identified the signalling networks present at the glial-leading edge, and novel proteins, including members of the Prohibitin family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glial-specific deletion of Prohibitin-2 in mice impairs axo-glial interactions and myelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus validate a novel method to model morphogenesis and juxtacrine signalling, provide insights into the molecular organization of the axo-glial contact, and identify a novel class of molecules in myelination.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Myelin is required for fast conduction of neural impulses, preserves axons, and is implicated in demyelinating and neurodegenerative diseases1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core of this function lies at the polarized surface of contact between myelin-forming glia and axons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because this surface lies beneath a series of concentric inward wraps of myelin, it is inaccessible to biochemical isolation, making the studies of this crucial nervous system apposition arduous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, only few molecules have been identified in this location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, compartmentalization of signalling events is crucial for glia, neurons and other polarized cells, and cellcell interactions are at the basis of morphogenesis and are required for the function of all tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a few tools are available to study these events in specific subcellular domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Insights into the spatial organization of signalling networks have been obtained using the pseudopod subcellular fractionation system, in cells responding to chemotactic (soluble) or haptotactic (extracellular matrix) stimuli2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this system2, cells are placed in a chamber with a microporous membrane, and extend pseudopodia in response to stimuli in the bottom chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pseudopods can be imaged and isolated from the cell body, which remains on the top chamber due to the size of the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this method has not yet been applied to juxtacrine signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we sought to adapt the pseudopod system to the study of cellcell interactions in the nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our goal is to identify signalling events, molecular networks and novel molecules specifically at the axo-glia interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Schwann cells (SC) make myelin in peripheral nerves, in response to contact with axons and the basal lamina (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4), making them excellent instruments to test if pseudopod sub-fractionation can model juxtacrine signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ask whether this system was suitable to study signals between axons and glia, we replaced soluble stimuli with neuronal cell membranes, to mimic cellcell contact, and isolated the cytoplasmic processes (pseudopods) that Schwann cells extend to contact axon membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By proteomic analysis we identified proteins that partitioned in pseudopods uniquely after axonal signals, including novel proteins and proteins known to localize at the Schwan cellaxon interface in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified the major signalling networks induced by Schwann cellaxonal contact, and a novel protein family, Prohibitins, which we show is required for appropriate axo-glial interactions in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This validation confirms that we were able to successfully model complex morphogenetic cellcell interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This novel method opens the possibility to map subcellular events that occur during the interactions between neurons and other glial cells, or between any cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'SC extend pseudopods in response to chemotactic stimuli', 'Several cell types such as fibroblasts (NIH3T3) in vitro respond to gradients of certain chemoattractants (for example, lysophosphatic-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), but not insulin) by directional cell migration2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial step is the extension of a polarized protrusion (pseudopod) that can be isolated by placing the cells on top of a Boyden chamber with microporous filters (3-m pores) and the chemoattractant on the bottom2 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell bodies and pseudopods can then be separated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schwann cells extend pseudopods in response to a soluble chemoattractants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,f) Schematic representation of NIH 3T3 (to the left) and Schwann cell (to the right) extending pseudopod towards a chemoattractant gradient of either lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or fetal calf serum and growth factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell body (CB) can be physically separated from the pseudopods (Ps).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,g) Confocal images of NIH 3T3 (b) and Schwann cell (g) bodies (top) or pseudopods (bottom) in response to the indicated stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were stained for F-actin with TRITC-phalloidin and with DAPI to visualize nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A small amount of random, non-polarized pseudopods are present in the absence of stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,h) Quantification by BCA of the protein content of NIH 3T3 (c) and Schwann cell (h) pseudopods and cell bodies, after induction with the indicated stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d,i) Western blots from NIH 3T3 (d) and Schwann cell (i) protein lysates from pseudopods and cell bodies, after induction by the indicated stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal amount of proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE, probed for the indicated proteins and stained with amido black.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e,j) Growth kinetics of NIH 3T3 (e) and Schwann cell (j) pseudopods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of proteins was determined for the indicated times after addition of the stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars indicate s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n=3 independent experiments in e,j, n=5 independent experiments in c,h.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were performed using t-test (c), one-way ANOVA (h) and two-way ANOVA (e,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  **P less_than 0.01, ***P less_than 0.001 and ****P less_than  0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 40 m.Full size image', 'To determine if primary Schwann cells respond like other cells, we compared their response (Fig 1fj) to that of NIH3T3 cells (Fig 1ae) to LPA, or to a combination of fetal calf serum, forskolin and growth factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By staining the top or the bottom of the membrane with phalloidin and DAPI, and imaging with confocal microscopy focused sequentially above and below the membrane, we showed that both primary Schwann cells and NIH3T3 cells extended pseudopods in response to the chemoattractants, but not to DMEM alone (Fig 1b,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, nuclei were detected solely on the upper surface, confirming that only pseudopods protruded through the small pores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins from the cell bodies or pseudopods can be solubilized independently and quantified or analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polarization was confirmed biochemically by showing that nuclear histones were present mostly in the cell body fraction (Fig 1d,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein quantification after 2 h of exposure to LPA or serum and growth factors confirmed that significantly more proteins were extracted from the pseudopod fraction in the presence of the chemoattractants (Fig 1c,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next asked if the kinetics of pseudopod growth were similar in the two cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extension of pseudopods in both Schwan cells and NIH3T3 cells was detected as early as 30 min after exposure to chemoattractants, and pseudopod growth reached a plateau after 2 h (Fig 1e,j), similar to previous reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of the chemoattractant reversed the polarization of the Schwann cells and induced pseudopod retraction (Supplementary Fig 1), confirming that the formation of pseudopods is an active and reversible process2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies showed that the molecular machinery required for the extension of pseudopods resembles that required for extension of a leading edge in polarizing cells at the beginning of migration2, including regulators of the actin cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus wished to confirm that Schwann cell pseudopods contained regulators of actin polymerization, and molecules required for formation of Schwann cell protrusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, Rac1, and Fak are required in vivo for Schwann cells to form polarized lamellipodia around axons and to begin myelination5,6 and p-Akt is associated with the onset of myelination7; in contrast p-Erk is not required for initial wrapping, but for addition of subsequent myelin layers8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed we found that Rac1, p-Fak and p-Akt, but not p-Erk, were enriched in pseudopods (Fig 1i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cells can polarize and migrate also towards haptotactic stimuli, like polymerized extracellular matrix, and this can also be mimicked in the pseudopod system3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, Schwann cells extended pseudopods in response to Laminin polymerized on the lower membrane and the Laminin receptors -Dystroglycan redistributed to these pseudopods (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results demonstrate that Schwann cells respond to soluble or haptotactic physiological stimuli by extending polarized pseudopods, which contain the appropriate molecular machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'SC extend pseudopods in response to neuronal membranes', 'It is established that contact between Schwann cells and axons is strictly required for induction of myelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuronal membrane preparations have been used as a model for axonal contact itself10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we asked if Schwann cells could extend polarized pseudopods in response to juxtacrine signals from neuronal membranes, and if the Schwann cell response to neuronal membranes was specific and unique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We prepared neuronal membranes from isolated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, and confirmed that they were biologically active by showing that they induced Akt phosphorylation in Schwann cells (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key juxtacrine signal on axons is Neuregulin 1-type III, which is required for Schwann cell myelination12,13, while soluble Neuregulin 1-type 1 cannot promote myelination unless it is presented at high concentration or after injury14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these published data, when we placed soluble Neuregulin 1-type I on the bottom chamber, Schwann cells failed to extend pseudopods (Fig 2b,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, when we plated DRG neurons on the bottom chamber, at a distance (0.2 mm) from the Schwann cells that precludes contact, the physical separation prevented formation of pseudopods (Fig 2b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when we filled the bottom chamber with a suspension of neuronal membranes, such that integral proteins in neuronal membranes could contact the Schwann cells, Schwann cells responded by making polarized protrusions (Fig 2b,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that the formation of Schwann cell protrusions requires neuronal contact, like myelination itself, and they are consistent with the notion that soluble signals from neurons are not sufficient to induce myelination12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and volume rendering showed that most cells responded by extending pseudopods, and that pseudopods were polarized (that is, extended only through the pores towards the neuronal membranes; Supplementary Fig 3, Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, membrane suspensions prepared from non-neuronal cells did not induce the extension of Schwann cell protrusions (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, only the direct contact between Schwann cells and neuronal membranes promotes the extension of Schwann cell pseudopods, supporting that they may represent a model of the first polarization events leading to myelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Schwann cells extend pseudopods selectively in response to juxtacrine-like neuronal signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Activation of Akt in Schwann cells by neuronal membrane suspensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuronal membranes were added to Schwann cells, protein lysates were probed for p-Akt, Akt and -Tubulin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soluble Neuregulin1 was used as a positive control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (cf) Confocal images of Schwann cell pseudopods and cell bodies in response to the indicated stimuli in the bottom chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were stained for F-actin with TRITC-phalloidin and DAPI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) No stimulus (DMEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Soluble neuregulin 1 (NRG1s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) DRG neurons in defined media plated on the bottom chamber, at 0.2-mm distance below the microporous surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) DRG neurons were solubilized and the membrane suspension was added to the bottom chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only this latter condition caused the extension of polarized pseudopods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Quantification by BCA of the protein content of Schwann cell pseudopod and cell bodies in the conditions indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars indicate s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n=5 independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA, ****P less_than  0.0001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Western blots from Schwann cell pseudopods and cell body protein lysates, after induction by neuronal membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equal amount of proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE probed for the indicated proteins and stained with amido black.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 40 m.Full size image', 'As before, we confirmed that molecules required for extension of membrane protrusions, migration and myelination such as Rac1, p-Fak and p-Akt partitioned in the pseudopods induced by neuronal membranes, while nuclear histones partitioned preferentially in the cell bodies (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next asked whether Schwann cell pseudopods contained molecules located at the glial surface that faces axons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, only few molecules at this important site are known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among them, N-cadherin is polarized immediately to sites of axo-glial contact, where it recruits Par3; Necl4 localizes at the axo-glial surface in mature fibers, and the receptor ErbB2/3 should localize near axons to interact with axonal Neuregulins16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, only N-cadherin, that mediates the first axonal contact, was clearly enriched in pseudopods, whereas ErbB receptors and Necls were present in both fractions, and Par3 was only detectable in cell bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that full polarization requires either  greater than 2 h after axonal contact or a second polarizing event, likely from the basal lamina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, it is possible that post-translational modifications that activate these molecules occur preferentially in pseudopods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it will be interesting in the future to determine whether ErbB2 and ErbB3 phosphorylation occurs mainly in pseudopods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, pseudopods did not contain the axonal specific molecules Caspr and Contactin-1 (Supplementary Fig 5), indicating that neuronal membranes did not contaminate the pseudopod proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that Schwann cells respond to juxtacrine signals in neuronal membranes by producing polarized pseudopodia that mimic the early cellular protrusions of intact neuro-glial systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the pseudopod system can model specific cellcell interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pseudopods induced by neurons contain a specific proteome', 'Having shown that Schwann cells respond specifically to juxtracrine neuronal signalling by producing appropriate polarized protrusions, we next determined the proteome of the pseudopods and compared it to that of cell bodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed equal amounts of pseudopod and cell body lysates (Fig 3a, Supplementary Fig 5a) and quantified the relative abundance of a given protein in the lysates in the induced (neuronal membranes) versus non-induced (DMEM) condition, by stable isotope labelling (SILAC), coupled with liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reliably identified 714 proteins, 605 of which were present in neuronally induced pseudopods (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, 176 proteins were enriched in pseudopods (as compared to cell bodies: Ps/CB ratio greater than 1.25, Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these, 95 proteins were also relatively increased in pseudopods after induction with neuronal membranes (as compared to DMEM: Ps induced by neurons/Ps non induced  greater than 1, Fig 3b,d and Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Proteins enriched in pseudopods after induction by neuronal membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Coomassie blue staining shows that equal amounts of lysates from Schwann cell bodies or pseudopods were separated on SDS/PAGE and used for proteomic studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Interaction network generated by the Ingenuity IPA software of proteins enriched in Schwann cells pseudopod (Ps/CB ratio greater than 1.25) after induction by neuronal membranes (Ps induced by neurons/Ps non induced  greater than 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signalling network consists of 95 proteins that are described in Supplementary Data 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins are named by their official gene symbol according to Entrez Gene (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative protein enrichment in pseudopods versus cell bodies (Ps/CB ratio) is colour coded according to the colour scale at the top of the figure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteins that were also enriched in pseudopods by serum and growth factors (Supplementary Data 3) have been given in grey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The references supporting the proteinprotein interactions are listed in Supplementary Data 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Distribution of the number of Schwann cell proteins that were enriched in pseudopods based on the Ps/CB ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Distribution of the number of proteins enriched by neuronal membranes specifically, based on the Ps induced by neurons/Ps non-induced ratio (second enrichment criteria).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Protein ontology analysis of the pathways most enriched in Schwann cells pseudopods (10 out of 162 shown, for complete listing, see Supplementary Data 5).Full size image', 'Formation of polarized protrusions in any cells requires the cytoskeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the largest group of proteins enriched in pseudopods and increased during neuronal contact was associated with the cytoskeleton (19%;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we show that neuronal cell membranes induce the formation of polarized protrusions in glial cells in vitro, mimicking juxtacrine signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using neuronal membranes in the pseudopod fractionation system, we could separate and profile these polarized glial protrusions that interacted with neuronal membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly 10% of proteins that we have identified are implicated in gliaaxonal interactions and myelination in vivo, validating the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, neuronal membranes induced the redistribution of a unique and novel set of proteins in Schwann cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, neuronal membranes can be used as stimuli to study juxtacrine interactions with other neuronal or glial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it has been hypothesized that the proteins that we chose to characterize, Prohibitins, function also in neuronneuron interactions at synapses, and may be dysfunctional in schizophrenia45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More broadly, the concept of isolating the portion of a cell touching another cell can be extended to any system, to study transient juxtacrine interactions, cellcell junction formation or non-cell autonomous mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The analysis of the proteome in pseudopods begins to illuminate some of the unique events that are triggered in Schwann cells by neuronal signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the interaction with neuronal membranes caused a change of twofold in 16% of the pseudopod proteome (Fig 3b, Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that this change could have been even more extensive in the presence of a second polarizing cue form Laminins in the basal lamina, which is necessary for proper Schwann cellaxon interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathway and interactome analysis suggest that, in addition to anticipated roles for signalling related to cytoskeleton and G-protein coupled receptors, local protein translation, sumoylation and metabolic control are crucial at the beginning of myelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cytoskeletal signalling molecules were prominent in pseudopods induced by neuronal membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They included regulators of Rho GTPases, Ephrins, axonal guidance molecules and Tec Kinase signalling components, supporting the idea that the cell protrusions extended by myelinating glia has the molecular characteristic of a growth cone or lamellipodia of migrating cells6,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent myelin wrapping also requires actin polymerization and depolymerization47,48,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, G-protein-related signalling was highly represented, supporting an emerging role for G-protein-coupled receptors in myelination29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, many of these molecules were connected in proteinprotein interaction networks, which also contained novel proteins, suggesting that the latter may also function in myelination or be involved in inherited human neuropathies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data reveal that local control of protein expression accounts heavily for Schwann cell polarization after axonal contact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interaction with neuronal membranes modulated the expression of molecules that regulate protein translation and degradation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, seven ribosomal proteins, two tRNA ligases, one elongation factor and three proteins associated with mRNA splicing were enriched in pseudopods (together accounting for 14% of the proteins enriched in pseudopods), suggesting either that local RNA regulation and translation is important for the extension of Schwann cells pseudopods or that these proteins serve extraribosomal functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, interactome analysis revealed that post-translational modifications, in particular by SUMO, might be important in axo-glial interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SUMO-2 was not only redistributed in pseudopods after axonal contact, but is also known to bind or regulate  greater than 10 of the other enriched proteins (Fig 3b), suggesting that sumoylation is an important event in myelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another set of functionally related proteins that was enriched in polarized pseudopods contained enzymes involved in amino-acid metabolism including GOT1, GOT2 and malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1), which control levels of aspartate and glutamate, suggesting further mechanisms in neuroprotection1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We identified the novel family of Prohibitins in pseudopods, and show that they are required for early axo-glial interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, both Prohibitin-1 and -2 are required for myelination in vitro, and deletion of Prohibitin-2 in Schwann cells impairs radial sorting, the process in which Schwann cells segregate large caliber axons that are destined for myelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prohibitin-2 may participate locally in the formation of lamellipodia-like polarized protrusions, similar to integrins and cytoskeletal regulators5,6,21, or in the transduction of axonal signals12,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This latter function could occur in different Schwann cell compartments, because Prohibitins can function in various cellular location, (reviewed in refs 39 and 52) where they interact with specific protein and lipids33,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Schwann cells Prohibitin-2 appear to localize at the plasma membrane and mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of Prohibitin interactors at the plasma membrane will reveal if Prohibitin-2 regulate signalling molecules required for myelination such as GPCR proteins, mTOR, integrins or RhoGTPases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In T-cells, Prohibitins translocate to the plasma membrane on activation54 and binds to Siglec-9 on other immune cells37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that Prohibitin-2 interacts with Schwann cells membrane proteins, and increased in pseudopods after induction with neuronal membranes, suggesting that axons may induce a redistribution of Prohibitin to pseudopods to promote Schwann cellaxon interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Siglecs are immunoglobulin adhesion molecules, like myelin-associated glycoprotein (or Siglec-4), thus it will be important to determine whether axons contain any Siglec molecule on their surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Prohibitins are present in oligodendrocytes55 suggesting that they might be important also for central nervous system myelination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we describe an innovative, modified method to study polarized cellular domains, and we used it for modeling and molecular profiling of the advancing glial sheath and to identify novel molecules involved in the interaction between glial cells and axons.
