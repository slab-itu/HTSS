Correlation detection as a general mechanism for multisensory integration  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The brain efficiently processes multisensory information by selectively combining related signals across the continuous stream of multisensory inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, it needs to detect correlation, lag and synchrony across the senses; optimally integrate related information; and dynamically adapt to spatiotemporal conflicts across the senses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that all these aspects of multisensory perception can be jointly explained by postulating an elementary processing unit akin to the HassensteinReichardt detectora model originally developed for visual motion perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unit, termed the multisensory correlation detector (MCD), integrates related multisensory signals through a set of temporal filters followed by linear combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model can tightly replicate human perception as measured in a series of empirical studies, both novel and previously published.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MCDs provide a unified general theory of multisensory processing, which simultaneously explains a wide spectrum of phenomena with a simple, yet physiologically plausible model.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'One of the most fundamental aspects of the brain is to effectively process multisensory information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animalseven the simplest onesare equipped with multiple sensory organs to perceive and interact with their surroundings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To successfully combine signals from different sensory modalities, the brain needs to detect which signals contain related information, that is, solve the correspondence problem, integrate this information and dynamically adapt to spatial or temporal conflicts across the senses as they arise1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatiotemporal correlation has often been advocated as the main common factor underlying the sensory signals to be integrated3,4,5,6,7,8: when signals from different modalities originate from the same physical event, and hence contain related information that should be integrated, they usually cross-correlate in time and space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sensory neuroscience has already acknowledged the fundamental role of correlation detection in multisensory processing5,6, and recent studies have demonstrated that multisensory cue integration is statistically optimal only when signals are temporally correlated3,4, although this effect seems to disappear at high temporal frequencies9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, there is no single model that can provide a unified explanation for the manifold aspects of early multisensory processing: how does the brain process multisensory signals to detect correlation and temporal lags across the senses?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How does it solve the multisensory correspondence problem?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And how does it eventually achieve optimal cue integration of redundant signals?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Correlation detection is at the core of any computational principle for combining different sensory signals, and it is widely exploited throughout the animal kingdom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the case for binaural hearing10, binocular vision11 and visual motion perception12, to name just a few.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In motion perception, for example, within the continuous stream of visual inputs, the brain needs to compare the luminance of two neighbouring receptive fields over time to detect speed and direction of motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the insect oculomotor reflex, Hassenstein and Reichardt12 proposed a biologically plausible cross-correlation model for motion perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model, known as the HassensteinReichardt detector (or elementary motion detector), posits the existence of two mirror-symmetric subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In its simplest version, each subunit multiplies inputs from two neighbouring visual receptive fields after applying a delay (or low-pass temporal filtering) to one of those signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference between the outputs of these subunits eventually determines the perception of motion and its direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over more than five decades, this model has been successfully applied to explain motion perception also in vertebrates and humans13, and neurophysiological studies support the existence of such a mechanism in the insect visual system, such as the fly optic lobe14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, the HassensteinReichardt detector is possibly the neural model whose biological substrates are best understood, and whose computational steps have been recently identified even at the level of individual cells15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The basic architecture of the HassensteinReichardt detector displays a number of important properties that would also be useful for multisensory processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, if a multisensory processing unit akin to the HassensteinReichardt detector would receive inputs from different modalities, it could compute the cross-correlation across the senses, and hence solve the correspondence problem3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, HassensteinReichardt detectors are naturally suited to detect the relative time of arrival of two separate signals: the very same mechanism that in visual perception detects the direction of motion could also be used crossmodally to detect temporal lags across the senses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that a neural mechanism similar to an elementary motion detector can concurrently explain several aspects of multisensory processing, including the detection of simultaneity, correlation and lag across the senses, and Bayesian-optimal multisensory integration.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Model and psychophysical experiment', 'The structure of the multisensory correlation detector (MCD, see Methods) proposed here closely resembles the HassensteinReichardt detector that was originally developed to explain visual motion perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, instead of receiving visual information from neighbouring receptive fields, the MCD receives inputs from spatially aligned receptive fields of different senses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a first processing stage, multisensory input signals undergo separate low-pass temporal filtering (Fig 1a, magenta and green filters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This accounts for the impulse response characteristics of each individual sense during transduction, transmission and early unisensory processing6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These filtered signals are then fed into two mirror-symmetric subunits, which multiply the signals after introducing a temporal shift to one of them through another low-pass filter (Fig 1a, centre, black filters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of this additional filtering stage, each subunit is selectively tuned to different temporal order of the signals (that is, vision vs. audition lead).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outputs of the two subunits are then combined in different ways to detect correlation and lag of multisensory signals, respectively (Fig 1a, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, correlation is calculated by multiplying the outputs of the subunits (Fig 1a, top-right; equations 4, 5, 6; Supplementary Video 1; and Supplementary Fig 1A), hence producing an output (MCDCorr) whose magnitude represents the correlation between the signals (Fig 1b, blue lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temporal lag is instead detected by subtracting the outputs of the subunits, like in the classic HassensteinReichardt detector (equations 5, 6, 7, Supplementary Video 1 and Supplementary Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yields an output (MCDLag) with a sign that represents the temporal order of the signals (Fig 1b, red lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: MCD model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic representation of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MCD integrates multisensory signals (SV(t), SA(t)) through a set of low-pass temporal filters followed by linear operations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MCD model yields two outputs, MCDCorr(t) (equation 4) and MCDLag(t) (equation 5), representing, respectively, the temporal correlation and lag across the input signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Time-averaged impulse response function of the MCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The y axis represents the response of the model to visual and auditory impulses as a function of the lag across the senses (see inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue line and axis represent the time-averaged response of the correlation detector (, equation 6), red line and axis represent the time-averaged response of the lag detector (, equation 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note how the correlation detector output (blue) peaks at low lags, whereas the output of the lag detector (red) changes sign depending on which modality comes first.Full size image', 'Without losing generality, we here focus on the integration of time-varying signals from vision and audition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe multisensory correlation detection in humans, and hence to test the MCD model, five human observers performed a psychophysical forced-choice task (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On each trial we presented a complex sequence of five auditory and five visual impulses (that is, sequences of clicks and flashes) with random temporal structures (Fig 2a,b and Supplementary Video 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants had to report both whether the visual and auditory sequences appeared to share a common cause (causality judgment), and which of the two sequencesvision or auditioncame first (temporal order judgments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal structures of the visual and auditory signals were generated independently, and varied randomly across trials (n=1890).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such stimuli were selected because they emphasize the role of cross-correlation for solving the correspondence problem, while the experimental tasks were selected because they directly probe the detection of multisensory correlation (causality judgment) and lag (order judgment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stochastic nature of the signals implies the lack of a ground truth on which to devise an optimal classifier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, given that there were five randomly placed impulses per modality on each trial, there was no univocal way to decide about the relative temporal order or about the common causal structure of the signals, hence rendering the task fundamentally subjective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Stimuli, reverse-correlation analyses and results of the psychophysical experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants sat in front of a white fabric disc covering an LED and a speaker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Examples of stimuli used in the experiment (left side), and their cross-correlation (right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magenta and green lines represent visual (SV(t)) and auditory stimuli (SA(t)), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top row shows an audiovisual stimulus eliciting high  responses;

Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More generally, these results demonstrate that the underlying neural processes are sensitive to the correlation of the signals; otherwise no clear pattern would have emerged in the classification images calculated from the cross-correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Having determined the precise shape of the empirical classification images, we can now assess how closely the MCD matches human performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, we feed the same signals used in the experiment into the model, and perform reverse-correlation analyses on the model responses just as we did with human responses (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, we can determine the temporal constants of the models low-pass filters by fitting them to maximize the similarity between empirical and predicted classification images (three free parameters, see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As can be seen in Fig 2d,f, this produces an excellent agreement between human data and model responses, which demonstrates that the MCD accurately captures some fundamental aspects of the neural computation underlying human perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model can near-perfectly reproduce the shapes of both empirical classification images (Fig 2d,f): Pearsons correlation between empirical and predicted classification images is =0.97 for the causality judgment, and =0.99 for the temporal order judgment, respectively (see Supplementary Fig 2A,C for individual participants results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the different temporal constants of vision and audition, the model could also reproduce the same negative lobe in the classification image of the causality judgment on the sound-first side.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that due to additional noise in the neural processing, the empirical classification images were shallower than those predicted by the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This additional noise was taken into account by scaling the classification images produced by the MCD, thereby highlighting the similarity between the simulation and the empirical findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further test the predictive power of the MCDbesides reverse-correlation analyseswe investigated whether, using the same fitted parameters determined from the classification images, the model (equations 6 and 7) could predict human responses when given the same stimuli as input (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both tasks we found a strong monotonic mapping between predicted and empirical responses (Fig 2e,g; Spearmans rank correlation between model output and human responses: =0.96 for causality judgments; =0.99 for temporal order judgments; see Supplementary Fig 2BD for individual participants results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous attempts to model multisensory temporal perception lack the flexibility to concurrently deal with the tasks and the complex signal streams used here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, both Sternberg and Knoll18 and Cai et al.19 proposed models that describe human performance in temporal order judgment tasks given the delay between two signals as input.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has never been explained how such delays are detected in the first place, particularly in the presence of complex time-varying signal streams (as they occur in the natural world).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Burr et al.6 proposed a model for audiovisual duration discrimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this model can also be used to process the current stimuli, it cannot account for the current results (see Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding correlation (but not lag) detection, Fujisaki and Nishida5 proposed a rudimentary descriptive scheme, that hold some similarities to the MCD model, in form of a correlator between the visual and auditory signals (see Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the working principle of this correlation detector has not been formally specified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the MCD model makes all such key computational steps explicit, is flexible enough to provide quantitative predictions for both causality and temporal order judgments, and can meaningfully process stimuli of any complexity, a property that is inevitable for handling real-world situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Validation of the MCD through simulation of previous results', 'Given that there is an extensive literature on multisensory perception of correlation, simultaneity, and lag5,17,20, we can validate the MCD and assess its generalizability by comparing its responses against human performance as determined in earlier experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we selected a series of studies that employed parametric manipulations of the temporal structure of the signals, we simulated the stimuli, and we used the MCD model (with fixed filter parameters) to predict human performance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, it is important to stress that in the following predictions we used the temporal constants of the MCD that we determined in the previous experiment, such that now there are no free parameters of the MCD to fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The output of the model was related to a response probability by assuming that the model response is corrupted by late noise, and that perceptual judgments are based on a decision criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As standard practice in psychophysics, we modelled this stage using a general linear model (GLM) with two free parameters (that is, noise and criterion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the MCD is the basic computational unit for multisensory temporal processing, we should be able to reproduce all of the earlier findings on the perception of multisensory temporal attributes with this constrained MCD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Audiovisual correspondence detection', 'To measure the determinants of multisensory correspondence detection, Denison et al.17 presented streams of audiovisual events with random temporal structures that were sometimes correlated, and they systematically varied lag, rhythmicity and rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a forced-choice task, participants had to detect audiovisual correspondence (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, participants had to report which of two visual stimuli had the same temporal structure as the auditory stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their results demonstrate that correspondence detection systematically depended on the temporal properties of the signals and their complexity: performance decreased with lag, rhythmicity and rate (Fig 3a,b, dots, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17, Experiments 1 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feeding these stimuli to the model demonstrates that, in line with human behaviour,  (equation 6) responses also decrease with lag, rhythmicity and rate, effectively replicating all the patterns in the original data set without the need to adjust any of the time constants (Fig 3a,b, lines;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Overall, these results strongly suggest that the MCD may represent the elementary unit for multisensory processing: individual units solve the correspondence problem, by detecting correlation, lags and synchrony across the senses, and integrate only those signals that are likely causally related; larger populations of MCDs perform optimal multisensory integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, these diverse phenomena have only been partially explained with separate ad hoc models5,24,25,26,28,29,33, or have never been explained at all (like the detection of temporal order across the senses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MCD parsimoniously captures all such perceptual challenges, and provides a common explanation to both the spatial and the temporal aspects of multisensory integration with a simple neural architecture whose biological plausibility is supported by a vast literature on the physiology of motion perception14 and stereoscopic vision11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What is more, the MCD might help bridging the gap between physiology and behaviour, as it can also be used to model the responses of multimodal neurons, just like the HassensteinReichardt detector has been used as a model for motion-sensitive neurons14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although correlation detection provides obvious behavioural benefits such as solving the correspondence problem and integrating related signals, it is not equally clear why the nervous system should have a dedicated detector to constantly monitor lags across the senses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multisensory signals, however, often reach our senses with some relative lags (e.g., due to differences in the generation process of the signals in each modality, the speed of propagation, which is slower for sound, or the neural latencies during transduction and transmission).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the nervous system must quickly detect and actively compensate for such delays (i.e., temporal recalibration, see refs 34, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, a lag detector would provide the necessary information to drive temporal recalibration and restore perceptual synchrony.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the analogies between motion perception and multisensory temporal processing, it would be reasonable to hypothesize that the same mechanisms underlying visual motion adaptation36 might also serve multisensory temporal recalibration19,34 (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Correlation detection has often been advocated as a universal computational mechanism, which simultaneously operates in multiple sensory systems (for example, visual motion, binocular disparity and binaural hearing) throughout the animal kingdom37, including mammals, avians and even invertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study suggests that the brain parsimoniously implements analogous principles of sensory processing also to combine signals across the senses, not just within.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of its biologically inspired nature and its effectiveness in predicting psychophysical results, the MCD provides a unified general theory of multisensory processingone that is capable of generating quantitative predictions at many different levels, from neurons14,38 to behaviour32.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

finding, given that in the model we did not consider the detrimental effects of noise, which would naturally arise at any stages of the detector, including late noise occurring at the decision stage, and which would be additive to the detectors outputs  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since noise is unlikely to be correlated across the senses, it would only reduce the cross-correlation between the streams of sensory information, and corrupt perceptual decision-making, hence reducing the overall amplitude of the empirical classification images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the predicted classification images in Fig 2df and Supplementary Fig 2AC are vertically scaled for graphical clarity in order to better highlight the similarity in shape of the predicted and empirical results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To demonstrate how model output can systematically predict human responses, we partitioned all trials into 30 bins (315 responses for each bin, 63 per participant) based on the output of the model ( for the causality judgment, and  for the temporal order judgment task).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each bin, we calculated the average response of the model and plotted it against the mean response of our participants in these same trials (Fig 2e,g and Supplementary Fig 2bd), while the monotonicity of the relationship between model and human responses was assessed using Spearman correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Psychophysical task', 'The experiment consisted of a force-choice dual task, whereby on each trial a train of five impulses was presented to the visual and auditory modalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stimuli consisted of sequences of five visual and five auditory impulses randomly presented over an interval of 1 s (average temporal rate 5 Hz, Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each impulse consisted of a single sample with a value of 1 in an array of samples with a value of 0 (sampling frequency 44.1 kHz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants (four naive and C.V.P., age range 2235 years, one female) observed the stimuli and had to report (1) whether or not the visual and auditory sequences appeared to be causally related and formed perceptual unity (causality judgment, also known as relatedness task17), and (2) the relative temporal order of the two sequences (temporal order judgment).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To instruct participants on what we meant by causally related, we told them to imagine that clicks and flashes were all little explosions, and their task was to tell whether the same underlying sequence of blasts caused the clicks and the flashes, or whether light and sound were generated by independent generative processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that we collected a large number of trials (overall n=9,450), and that we performed the analyses both at the group level and at the level of the individual participants, a pool of five participants is large enough to provide reliable estimates of the effects under study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess whether the dual-task paradigm could qualitatively alter observers responses, we also performed an additional control experiment in which the causality judgment and temporal order judgment tasks were performed in separate sessions (see Supplementary Note 4 and Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall the results from both experiments were in good agreement with those of the dual-task paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The experiment was performed in a dark anechoic chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visual stimuli consisted of a white disk (rad=6.5°) of sound-transparent fabric backlit by a white-light-emitting diode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Auditory stimuli were presented from the same location as the visual stimuli by means of a small loudspeaker hidden behind the sound-transparent screen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the light-emitting diode and the loudspeaker were operated via a computer soundcard to ensure near-perfect timing of the multisensory signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment was controlled by custom-built software based on the Psychtoolbox39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The experiment was self-paced, and participants had to press a key to initiate each trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal structures of the signals were identical across participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After stimulus presentation, participants responded by pressing one of four keys arranged in a 2 × 2 matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vertical axis of this arrangement represented the response to the causality judgment (top=single cause, bottom=different causes), while the horizontal axis represented the response to the temporal order judgment (left=vision first and right=audition first).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were instructed to give an answer even if unsure, taking their time and guessing if necessary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment took place in four sessions of 2 h each (including breaks).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Every 45 trials, there was a break and a dim table-light was smoothly turned on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants were allowed to rest for as long as they wanted, and to minimize boredom they were entertained with a booklet of short jokes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants had to press a key to restart the experiment, after which the table-light smoothly turned off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout the experiment, participants head was constrained with a chin- and a head-rest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiment was conducted in accordance to the Declatation of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics committee of the University of Bielefeld.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Participants received 6 Euro per hour, and they provided written informed consent before participating to the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Reverse-correlation analyses', 'To calculate visual classification images, we first sorted the stimuli presented in the experiment according to participants (or models, c.f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modelling) classification responses (single cause vs. multiple causes in the causality judgment, CJ; light vs. sound lead in the temporal order judgment, Fig 2c; see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each class we calculated the mean cross-correlation across the visual and auditory signals (SV(t)SA(t)) and combined them to obtain the classification images for audiovisual correlation (KCorr) and lag (KLag, Fig 2c) according to:', '', '', 'Classification images (KCorr and KLag) were temporally smoothed by convolution with a temporal low-pass Gaussian filter (=20 ms).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reverse-correlation analyses were performed individually for each participant (Supplementary Fig 2), and on the averaged observer (Fig 2d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the stimuli were identical across participants, the response of the averaged observer on each trial was calculated as the mode of the individual responses (that is, if the three out of five participants responded vision first on a given trial, then the response of the average observer was also vision first).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Simulation of audiovisual correspondence detection', 'We simulated visual and auditory signals with statistically the same temporal structures described in Denison et al.17 (Experiments 1 and 3), and fed them into

categorical responses in the following way: Given that the behavioural task consisted of a two-alternative forced-choice (that is, participants had to report which of two visual stimuli temporally matched the auditory stimulus17), we assumed the underlying decision variable to be the ratio between the  (equation 6) response to the two visual stimuli (match/non-match).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, we divided the  response to the matching stimulus by the response of the model to the non-matching stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a variable was then transformed into the proportion of correct responses via a general linear model with a probit link function (assuming additive Gaussian noise).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linear coefficients were fitted over the whole data set (proportion of correct responses, which we computed from the original d measures) included in Fig 3a,b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given that Denison et al.17 used random temporal structures that changed across trials, we could not faithfully reproduce the exact stimuli used in the original experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore for each data-point, we simulated 500,000 random temporal structures for the auditory stimuli, other 500,000 for the matching visual stimuli, and the same amount for non-matching visual stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decision variable was eventually calculated as the ratio of the median MCD response to the two visual stimuli (that is, median  response to the matching visual stimuli divided by the median response to the non-matching visual stimuli).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Simulation of synchrony detection', 'The experimental task used by Fujisaki and Nishida5,20 consisted of a two-alternative forced-choice task, whereby participants reported on the perceived synchrony of auditory

see Fig 3c) and Fujisaki and Nishida20 (Experiment 1, see Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was done by generating stimuli as described in Fujisaki and Nishida5 (Experiment 1) and Fujisaki and Nishida20 (Experiment 1), and calculating  (equation 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the previous simulation, we carefully replicated the temporal structures of the stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for simplicity the exact visual and auditory events were replaced by impulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used standard procedures to transform the responses of the model into binary responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was done by assuming that the response on each trial depended on the ratio between the models responses for the asynchronous signal, to the models response for the synchronous signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a

correlation and the coefficient of determination between the empirical and the predicted responses (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the statistical significance of a linear regression relationship between empirical and predicted responses, we used the F-test (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F-test requires the residuals of the linear regression to be normally
