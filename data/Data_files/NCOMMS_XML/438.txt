NFATc1 supports imiquimod-induced skin inflammation by suppressing IL-10 synthesis in B cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Epicutaneous application of Aldara cream containing the TLR7 agonist imiquimod (IMQ) to mice induces skin inflammation that exhibits many aspects of psoriasis, an inflammatory human skin disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that mice depleted of B cells or bearing interleukin (IL)-10-deficient B cells show a fulminant inflammation upon IMQ exposure, whereas ablation of NFATc1 in B cells results in a suppression of Aldara-induced inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro, IMQ induces the proliferation and IL-10 expression by B cells that is blocked by BCR signals inducing NFATc1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By binding to HDAC1, a transcriptional repressor, and to an intronic site of the Il10 gene, NFATc1 suppresses IL-10 expression that dampens the production of tumour necrosis factor- and IL-17 by T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate a close link between NFATc1 and IL-10 expression in B cells and suggest NFATc1 and, in particular, its inducible short isoform, NFATc1/A, as a potential target to treat human psoriasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects 23% of the population in Western countries1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is characterized by the uncontrolled hyperproliferation of keratinocytes (KCs) in the epidermal skin layer that gives rise to erythematous scaly patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The classical cellular reaction of psoriasis is versatile and involves KCs, dendritic cells (DCs), T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages and mast cells2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since B cells are hardly detected in psoriatic skin, until recently3 their role in psoriasis remained unregarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been assumed that the pathogenesis of psoriasis includes a decrease in tolerance towards self-antigens4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A genetic predisposition to injury-induced activation of KCs may trigger psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stressed KCs release cytokines (for example, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-18 and tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-)) and antimicrobial peptides that recruit macrophages and neutrophils to sites of evolving inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytokines lead to abnormal KC maturation and activation of DCs5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmacytoid DCs that are known to be involved in antiviral responses have been implicated in the psoriasis reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmacytoid DCs contribute to the psoriatic events through endosomal TLR7 and TLR9 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monocyte-derived mDCs activate different subsets of T cells, most importantly Th1, Th17 and Th22 cells7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These activated T-cell subsets release TNF-, IL-17 and IL-22 that recruit more inflammatory cells and generate an exaggerated state of KC proliferation leading to the clinical picture of psoriatic skin6,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Imiquimod (IMQ) is a potent agonist of TLR7 in mice and TLR7 and TLR8 in humans that has initially been introduced for the treatment of genital warts9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the development of psoriasis-like skin inflammation was reported as a side effect of IMQ application, IMQ-induced skin inflammation was applied as a mouse model to study human psoriasis10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skin of mice treated with IMQ shows many albeit not all characteristics of psoriatic skin, for example, acanthosis, papillomatosis, inflammatory cell infiltrates and altered dermal vascularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is now widely accepted that the topical application of IMQ-containing Aldara cream to the skin of mice is a rapid and cost-effective model for studying early events of psoriasis11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The immunosuppressant cyclosporin A (CsA) is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By blocking the activity of the Ser/Thr-specific phosphatase calcineurin (CN), CsA prevents dephosphorylation and, thereby, activation of cytosolic NFAT proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although NFATs are not the only proteins that are dephosphorylated by CN, it is commonly accepted that CN/NFAT complexes are the predominant molecular targets through which CsA blocks the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NFATs represent a family of five transcription factors that share a common DNA-binding domain of approximately 300 amino-acid (aa) residues, the Rel homology (or similarity) domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In lymphocytes, three out of the four genuine NFATc members, NFATc1, c2 and 3 (which are also known as NFAT2, 1 and 4, respectively), are expressed and controlled by signals emerging from immune receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation of immune cells via their immune receptors leads to the release of Ca++ from intracellular stores, the influx of Ca++ through calcium release-activated channels and the rapid activation of CN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon complex formation with Ca++, calmodulin and further co-factors CN binds to NFAT factors and dephosphorylates their regulatory domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereby, the nuclear localization sequences of NFATs are exposed that drive cytosolic NFAT factors into the nucleus14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to the rapid nuclear translocation of preformed NFAT factors, immune receptor stimuli also induce the massive generation of NFATc1/A, a short NFATc1 isoform lacking the C-terminal domain of approximately 250 aa that is common to most other NFAT proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NFATc1/A is the most prominent NFAT protein in nuclei of peripheral T and B lymphocytes activated by immune receptor signals16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the ability of NFATc1 to bind to multiple NFAT-binding motifs within a remote intronic enhancer and to composite B/NFAT sites within the P1 promoter region, the appearance of NFATc1/A is auto-regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This keeps constant high NFATc1/A levels in lymphocytes during persistent stimulation by immune receptors16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to other NFATc proteins that support the induction of anergy and activation-induced cell death of lymphocytes, NFATc1/A supports the survival of lymphocytes and, thereby, their effector functions16,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These and further lines of evidence suggest that in the control of the immune systemincluding the generation of autoimmune diseasesNFATc1/A exerts a particular function that differs from that of (most of the) other NFATc factors19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By ablating NFATc1 expression in B cells we show here that NFATc1 supports the development of skin inflammation upon repetitive epicutaneous application of IMQ-containing Aldara cream on the skin of mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is mediated by IL-10 since mice bearing B cells double-deficient for IL-10 and NFATc1 show no suppression but a fulminant Aldara-mediated skin inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aldara application to the skin of mice for 1 week leads to an increase in IL-10-producing B10 cells, a decrease in inflammatory cytokines by T cells and to a massive differentiation of splenic B cells to Ab-producing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro, IMQ treatment of splenic B cells induces IL-10 RNA synthesis within 13 days that can be suppressed by the induction of NFATc1 through B cell receptor (BCR) signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In B cells, NFATc1 binds to the Il10 gene and dampens, in association with HDAC1, the expression of IL-10 upon IMQ stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that targeting NFATc1 induction in B cells might be a novel therapeutic approach to treat psoriasis in humans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether the increase in B10 cells in Aldara-treated Nfatc1f/f x mb1-cre mice affects the cytokine production of effector CD4+ T cells, we determined the number of CD4+ T cells expressing TNF, IL-17, interferon- (IFN-) and IL-2 in those mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To elucidate the IL-10 dependency of cytokine production, we also determined the cytokine levels of mice containing B cells deficient for IL-10, or for both IL-10 and NFATc1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As compared with the WT situation the numbers of TNF- and IFN--producing CD4+ T cells were slightly increased (or

dramatically in those mice as compared with WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely and in line with the moderate inflammatory phenotype, the numbers of CD4+ T cells expressing TNF, IL-17, IFN- and IL-2 were largely reduced in Nfatc1f/f x mb1-cre mice when compared with WT as well as to Il10f/f x mb1-cre and Nfatc1f/f × Il10f/f x mb1-cre mice (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data strongly suggest that

from Nfatc1f/f x mb1-cre mice turned into B10 cells (Supplementary Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In co-culture, such B10 cells reduced the proliferation as well as the production of IFN- and, more prominently, TNF- by CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Fig 4BD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon adoptive transfer of B10 cells into mice, a strong suppressive effect on Aldara-induced skin inflammation was detected,

differentiation of splenic B cells', 'NFATc1 might affect Aldara-mediated IL-10 production of B cells in two ways that are not mutually exclusive: (i) by interfering with the differentiation of splenic B cells to B10 cells; or (ii), more directly, by inhibiting the synthesis of IL-10 in B10 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To elucidate whether and how Aldara affects the differentiation of B cells, we immunoblotted protein lysates obtained from splenic B cells of mice treated for 1, 3 or 7 days with Aldara with Abs raised against murine IgM, IgG, IgE or IgA (Fig 4a and Supplementary Fig 5).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Among the numerous mouse models used for studying human psoriasis32, the repetitive epicutaneous application of IMQ-containing Aldara cream to the shaved mouse skin represents a versatile and efficient experimental regimen to study early events of human disease10,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results of our study confirm the data of an earlier report on the important role of IL-10 produced by B cells in Aldara-induced skin inflammation3 and extend these observations by demonstrating the suppressive effect of NFATc1 on IL-10 production by B cells and on Aldara-mediated skin inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In mice, CD5+CD1dhi B cells have been described as regulatory B cells (Bregs) that control experimental skin inflammation through the secretion of IL-10 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Tregs, Bregs tune immune reactions through affecting the release of cytokines34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They exert a regulatory influence on monocytes, T cells (on conventional CD4+T, Th1 and Th17 cells) and other B cells35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is currently unclear and a matter of dispute whether similar to regulatory T (Treg) cells expressing Foxp3, Breg cells correspond to a particular subset of B cells with a specific developmental fate and function, or whether any B cell can be converted to IL-10-producing Breg/B10 cells by inflammatory signals36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those signals play a major role in the differentiation to B10 cells that show, otherwise, often features of plasmablasts or plasma cells37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While our study deals with the role of NFATc1 in controlling IL-10 production and skin inflammation by B cells, it is likely thatin addition to B cellsthe enhanced expression of NFATc1 in other cells of psoriatic skin contributes to the induction and/or maintenance of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In T cells, NFATc1 stimulates the expression of several genes that are highly expressed during psoriasis, as the Ccl3 and Ccl4 chemokine genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several S100 Ca++-binding proteins that are strongly expressed in psoriatic skin38,39 are NFAT targets, or controlled by the Ca++/CN network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NF-B is constitutively activated in psoriatic epidermis, and we showed recently that NF-B factors support the induction of NFATc1/A in murine lymphocytes16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, one may speculate that this event, that is, the NF-B-mediated support of NFATc1/ induction, plays also a role in the development of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In KCs of human skin, both NFATc1 and c2 are expressed40,41,42, and NFATc1 was shown to exert a strong stimulatory effect on the proliferation of KCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is exemplified by RNAi-mediated knockdown of NFATc1 in an organotypic skin equivalent model leading to reduced epidermal thickness41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The epicutaneous application of IMQ-containing Aldara cream to the murine skin does not only induce pathways downstream of TLR7 but also numerous other signalling events that induce inflammatory events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the first events following Aldara/IMQ application is the massive induction of epidermal cell death25, and apoptotic cells were shown to induce IL-10 in a large proportion of splenic B cells43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, necroptosis seems also to play an important role in the death of KCs, and it is likely that by the release of numerous damage-associated molecular patterns, necroptotic KCs are potent triggers of inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By their disintegration, necroptotic cells release many damage-associated molecular patterns, such as cytokines of the IL-1 family, the S100 proteins S100A8 and A9, nucleic acids, nucleoproteins, histones and heat-shock proteins44,45 that are able to induce inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although so far, the role of necroptosis in psoriasis has not been investigated45, the results of several murine models of the disease suggest necroptosis as a potent trigger of inflammation46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Aldara-induced skin inflammation, the massive death of KCs appears to induce the activation and differentiation of the murine immune system, including splenic B cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within 13 days of emollient application we observed the induction of NFATc1/A in splenic B cells (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, application of Aldara cream for 3 days and longer did not lead to a further increase but to a decrease in NFATc1 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Persistent Aldara application led to a switch in IgM proteins and Ig heavy chains, and the differentiation of splenic B cells to Ab-producing cells (Fig 4a and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, with the onset of massive and persistent inflammation of KCs in vivo, splenic B cells become unresponsive to IgM signals, as it is documented in the inability to induce NFATc1/A by -IgM (Fig 4b and Supplementary Fig 7B,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, signals other than those mediated by -IgM control the fate of such plasmablast-like B cells which, however, have the capacity to induce NFATc1/A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reflected by the ability of splenic B cells from Aldara-treated mice to induce NFATc1/A upon TPA+ionomycin treatment (Supplementary Fig 7D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The interplay between NFATc1 activity and IL-10 production is not only restricted to the generation of psoriasis-like symptoms but also involved in other autoimmune diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For CD4+ T cells from pediatric lupus patients high NFATc1 levels were detected that are correlated with an increased and prolonged CD154/CD40 ligand expression and glomerulonephritis49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar data were reported for the CD4+ T cells of MRL/lpr mice50, a murine model of human systemic lupus erythematosus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased CD154 expression on CD4+ T cells affects both B-cell differentiation51 and supports strongly the induction of NFATc1 in B cells16 that might result in repression of IL-10 production, which is characteristic for B cells of systemic lupus erythematosus patients52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inactivation of NFATc1 in B cells led to an increase in IL-10 production and amelioration of symptoms of MOG-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis21, and inactivating both Nfatc1 and Nfatc2 genes in T cells abolished the generation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis symptoms53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These and further data suggest that the NFATc1-mediated inhibition of IL-10 expression might be of general impact for the development of autoimmune diseases and a novel target how to treat them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the CN and NFAT inhibitors CsA and FK506 have been used for many years to treat autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, their numerous side effects restrict their prolonged application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the selective inhibition of NFATc1 induction, in particular of NFATc1/A, might specifically affect the (hyper-) activity of lymphoid cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data presented here suggest that such a therapy could lead to an increase in IL-10 levels that, as shown in earlier studies, is of benefit for psoriasis patients54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Albeit there is currently no IL-10 therapy that passed clinical phase III studies55, enhanced IL-10 levels certainly support other therapies, such by antibodies raised against IL-17, IL-17 receptor and IL-23 that showed promising therapeutic results in phase III studies with psoriasis patients56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains a challenging task to elucidate whether the manipulation of NFATc1 and IL-10 activities, alone or together with those of IL-17 and IL-23, will be of benefit for patients suffering from psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
