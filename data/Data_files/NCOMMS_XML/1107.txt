Towards colloidal spintronics through Rashba spin-orbit interaction in lead sulphide nanosheets  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Employing the spin degree of freedom of charge carriers offers the possibility to extend the functionality of conventional electronic devices, while colloidal chemistry can be used to synthesize inexpensive and tunable nanomaterials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, in order to benefit from both concepts, we investigate Rashba spinorbit interaction in colloidal lead sulphide nanosheets by electrical measurements on the circular photo-galvanic effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lead sulphide nanosheets possess rock salt crystal structure, which is centrosymmetric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symmetry can be broken by quantum confinement, asymmetric vertical interfaces and a gate electric field leading to Rashba-type band splitting in momentum space at the M points, which results in an unconventional selection mechanism for the excitation of the carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect, which is supported by simulations of the band structure using density functional theory, can be tuned by the gate electric field and by the thickness of the sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spin-related electrical transport phenomena in colloidal materials open a promising pathway towards future inexpensive spintronic devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Though in the last decades developments in semiconductor device engineering led to constantly improved performances, nowadays it is very difficult to keep this pace1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further challenges in terms of manufacturing cost, flexibility, power consumption and device functionality are ahead, for example, for the internet of things2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent ideas try to address these issues by the introduction of new materials as the active semiconductor channel or new mechanisms of information processing2,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One solution is replacing the electron charge by its spin as an information carrier4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, materials with strong spinorbit coupling (SOC) are particularly interesting since in these materials spin orientation can be manipulated by an external electrical field5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In semiconductors, SOC can originate from bulk inversion asymmetry (Dresselhaus SOC) or from structural inversion asymmetry (Rashba SOC)5,6,7,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since Rashba SOC can be influenced by customizing the structure (for example, by confining the material) or by a gate voltage, it is being studied comprehensively5,6,7,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a further development in data processing, the concept of valleytronics has been introduced for materials with multiple valleys (multiple extrema with equal energies) in the band structure11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By controlling the number of carriers in each valley, a so-called valley-polarized current can be produced, which leads to an additional degree of freedom4,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of spinvalley coupling in these materials, it has been shown that the valleys can be also populated selectively based on the spin of the carriers11,12,13,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Up to now, spin/valley-dependent transport phenomena have been investigated mostly in two-dimensional nanostructures prepared by industry-incompatible methods (for example, mechanical exfoliation) or by cost-intensive instruments such as molecular-beam epitaxy6,9,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we demonstrate the presence of easily accessible SOC in nanomaterials synthesized by colloidal chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solution-based synthesis of colloidal nanomaterials offers enormous opportunities in the production of inexpensive and high-quality crystals for electronic and, as we will show, spintronic devices17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colloidal lead sulphide (PbS) nanosheets as continuous 2D crystals with promising properties do not suffer from tunnel barriers like other colloidal systems, such as thin films of nanoparticles17,18,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their rock salt crystal structure is centrosymmetric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to break the inversion symmetry, we apply an electric field (gate) to the crystal as well as different boundaries underneath and above the PbS nanosheet (SiO2 and vacuum)6,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination with strong SOC, this suggests Rashba-type band splitting, which is confirmed by Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In PbS nanosheets, the band splitting occurs in momentum space at the four M points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon illumination with circularly polarized light, the circular photo-galvanic effect (CPGE) leads to a net current that can be explained by an unconventional selection mechanism, depending on the spin orientation of the carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed effect is precisely tunable by changing the gate voltage or by changing the confinement (thickness of the sheets).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Circular photo-galvanic measurements on the nanosheets', 'We synthesized PbS nanosheets with lateral dimensions of up to 5 m and tunable thickness of 220 nm by introducing different amounts of oleic acid to the synthesis19,20,22 (for crystallographic characterization see Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The height of the nanosheets directly determines the band gap of the material by confinement23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tunability is of advantage for the performance of applications such as transistors, photodetectors and solar cells17,18,20,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthesis of the nanosheets is independent of the fabrication of the devices, which makes it practical for industrial applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanosheets were spin-coated on Si/SiO2 substrates and contacted individually with Au electrodes by electron-beam lithography (see Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contacts were placed in  less_than 110 greater than  direction of the crystal (corresponding to the M point direction in k-space) which is also the lateral growth direction of the nanosheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In order to evidence the possibility of spin manipulation in PbS nanosheets, we performed measurements on the CPGE as a function of light polarization6,7,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, photo-excited charge carriers with preferred spin orientation were prepared by illumination with circularly polarized light produced by a linearly polarized laser beam (=627 nm) through a quarter-wave plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The helicity of the exciting light was determined by the angle of the quarter-wave plate, which controls the spin orientation of the carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beam was pointed to the sample obliquely in the yz plane (x is the direction of the current flow, z is normal to the nanosheet and y is perpendicular to these two).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1a schematically illustrates the experimental setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This configuration provides the required inversion asymmetry (including the gate electric field and asymmetric vertical boundaries) in order to detect the CPGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bulk PbS with a rock salt crystal structure obeys the Oh point group symmetry which is inversion symmetric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By confining the material in z direction (height of the nanosheets), the symmetry is reduced first to the D4h point group and then, by application of asymmetric vertical interfaces on top and underneath (SiO2 and vacuum) as well as by the gate electric field, to C4v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this symmetry group, the inversion centre is absent, which supports the band splitting by SOC (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1c depicts the variation of the photocurrent with changing the angle of the quarter-wave plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows that illumination of the unbiased devices can yield a non-zero helicity-dependent photocurrent whose direction can be reversed by changing the light polarization from right-handed to left-handed, which is a sign for a spin-polarized current, generated as a consequence of spin injection into a spinorbit coupled system5,6,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to that, other polarization-independent currents are detected which should be distinguished from the spin-related current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Circular photo-galvanic effect in lead sulfide nanosheet

small non-zero incidence illumination angle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fitting the results shows the existence of a non-zero CPGE current, suggested to originate from Rashba SOC in PbS nanosheets (LPGE: linear photo-galvanic effect).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrows show the quarter-wave plate angles, in which the light is circularly or linearly polarized.Full size image', 'The generated photocurrent is described by the expression', '', 'which can be employed for fitting the measurement results to determine the contribution of each effect5,9,10,11,12,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the equation, J0 is the background current, resulting from, for example, photovoltaic effects, the Damber effect or hot electron injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This component is independent of the helicity of the light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JLPGE is the amplitude of the linear photo-galvanic effect which is due to asymmetric scattering of electrons along the conduction path.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the LPGE is a function of the quarter-wave plate angle, it is equal for the right-handed and left-handed polarized light, which implies its independency from the helicity or respectively the spin orientation of the carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oscillation period of the LPGE is equal to 90°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eventually, JCPGE is the amplitude of the CPGE, the current which is attributed to the population of the conduction band with spin-polarized charge carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the LPGE, the CPGE oscillates with a period of 180°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is maximum at a helicity of +1 (45° and 225°), minimum when the helicity is 1 (135° and 315°) and zero when the light is linearly polarized (0°, 90°, 180° and 270°) (refs 11, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Origin of the effect', 'Generally, different phenomena can lead to the existence of a CPGE in a 2D material, including Rashba/Dresselhaus SOC5,6,9, orbital interactions16, spinvalley coupling11,12 or topological surface states24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even in centrosymmetric materials with negligible SOC, in silicon or graphene for instance, this effect has been detected due to the asymmetry at the edges or contacts16,25 (in-plane asymmetries).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lead sulphide as a crystal including high atomic-number Pb atoms (Z(Pb)=82) can be considered as having strong SOC15,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the band structure of 2D PbS consists of a rectangular Brillouin zone with four equal valleys at the corners, the M points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By selectively exciting the carriers in each valley, a valley-polarized current might occur11,12,13,15,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such effects can be detected by the CPGE current since the angular momentum of circularly polarized photons couples to the spin or valley index of the carriers, or leads to asymmetric scattering of the carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, an inversion asymmetry must be present in the structure, which results in an asymmetric distribution of carriers in momentum space or asymmetric movement of the carriers in a certain direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a net CPGE current can be observed5,6,9,10,11,12,16,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As the first step to explain the effect, we show that it mainly originates from the imposed vertical asymmetry to the crystal and not from the contacts/edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we measured the CPGE current while we shadowed different parts of the device, to control the position of the beam and to intentionally enhance the asymmetry between the contacts/edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a shows the measured CPGE according to the position of the shadow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurements were done with a high incidence angle (about 15 degrees, the max.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  incidence angle due to the size of the view port of the vacuum chamber) and a lower one (around 6 degrees).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By moving the shadow from one side of the device to the other one under the low incident angle, it is possible to reverse the direction of the in-plane asymmetry12,16,24,25, expressed by a sign change of the shadowed CPGE current Ishadow (Fig 2a, positions C and E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the function shows an offset which implies that a part of the current is independent of the in-plane asymmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, this part will be shown to be the current originating from the vertical asymmetry (Ivertical), caused by the two interfaces and the gate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By increasing the incidence angle, firstly it can be observed that the unshadowed current (Ifull) increases, which shows that the vertical asymmetry is an effective factor for generating Ifull.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, to observe the CPGE based on in-plane asymmetry (Iin-plane), illumination should be perpendicular to the surface of the nanosheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a vertical asymmetry, such illumination leads to a zero CPGE current, and Ivertical increases with increasing the incidence angle6,12,16,24,25,26, which explains the increase of the measured Ifull with the larger angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the shadow is applied, the imbalance of Ishadow (difference between the currents in positions C and E) becomes more pronounced with the higher illumination angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows that Ivertical has a larger part in Ishadow, while Iin-plane is almost constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By shadowing, we cover half of the device, which decreases the effective part of the crystal to generate Ivertical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, it leads to a higher Iin-plane, as we magnify the asymmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the share of Ivertical is larger now, Ishadow becomes less than Ifull (for the ideal contribution of Ivertical and Iin-plane see Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these observations prove that the vertical asymmetry is indeed able to generate a net CPGE current by changing the distribution of the carriers in the band structure, although they do not exclude the possibility of local in-plane asymmetries, such as contacts or edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Origin of the circular photo-galvanic effect in lead sulfide nanosheets.

further investigate the origin of CPGE in PbS nanosheets, we calculated the band structure of clean PbS (001) slabs (with 15 atomic layers) including an external electric field using DFT based on the general-gradient approximation, employing the PerdewBurkeErnzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional28 (see Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SOC was taken into account by using fully relativistic projector-augmented-wave (PAW) potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be pointed out that when SOC is considered, general-gradient approximation functionals are known to underestimate the band gap in bulk PbS and even predict a band inversion29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The usage of hybrid functionals (for example, HeydScuseriaErnzerhof) or many-body corrections like the GW approximation were shown to improve the agreement with experimental band gaps, but they are much more computationally demanding than pure DFT29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qualitative trend of the influence of an external electric field on the band structure is expected to be described well enough by PBE to get reliable results, as this functional was already used to describe Rashba systems31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Without an external electric field, inversion symmetry is maintained, and no Rashba spin splitting can be observed along the MX path (see Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the band gap (M point), the two highest filled bands split in direction of the  point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding an external electric field along the surface normal breaks the inversion symmetry, and Rashba spin splitting occurs at the M point (see Supplementary Fig 5b), which is confirmed by a spin texture typical for the Rashba effect (see Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Rashba spin splitting of the highest filled band differs from the splitting of the second highest filled band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rashba spin splitting can be also observed for the conduction band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The calculated band structure implies that by exciting the material with right-handed (left-handed) polarized light, that is photons with angular momentum of +1 (1), some of the possible transitions between the valence and conduction bands are forbidden since energy and angular momentum must be conserved during the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possible excitation mechanism of the carriers over the band gap is illustrated schematically in Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bands are split around the M point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in contrast to other multi-valley materials, the splitting occurs in momentum space and the split bands, corresponding to the two opposite spin orientations, have equal energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For materials with rectangular Brillouin zone, both valleys (M and M) represent similar orbital characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, they are not selectively populated by adjusting the angular momentum of the exciting photons (which is done by selecting the handedness of the circular polarization)27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, by splitting the bands in momentum space, the angular momentum of the split bands becomes different for each spin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As it can be observed in Supplementary Fig 6, total angular momentum of the valence band and the conduction band are respectively 3/2 and 1/2 with spin-angular momentum of 1/2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By controlling the helicity of the exciting light, carriers can be selectively excited based on their spin orientation12,14,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon illumination with circularly polarized light and population of the conduction band with spin-polarized electrons, the number of excited carriers is equal in the M valley and in the M valley, but the linear momentum differs, since splitting is asymmetric at these two points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the spin-up band is shifted away from the Gamma point (to higher momentum) at the M point, but towards the Gamma point (to lower momentum) at M. Therefore, spin-up electrons at the M point have higher momentum compared to those at the M point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in the generation of the spin-polarized CPGE current based on Rashba SOC which splits the valleys of the band structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The current generated by the CPGE in the direction of a specific crystal orientation () can be expressed by', '', 'where  is one of the different crystal orientations (x, y, z),  is the CPGE second-rank pseudo tensor which is directly affected by the crystal asymmetry, E0 is the electric field (complex amplitude) of the light wave, Pcirc is the helicity of the circularly polarized light (degree of polarization), e=q /q is the unit vector for the light propagation, and q is the wave vector of the light in the medium5,6,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the C4v point group, the pseudo tensor  has non-zero elements, which results in a non-zero CPGE current35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Gate dependency of the effect', 'Having introduced confinement and symmetry breaking by the gate electric field as the factors influencing the SOC, we separately studied these elements under the low illumination angle in order to tune the band splitting in the PbS nanosheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3 shows the dependence of the CPGE current on the gate voltage (see also Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changing the gate voltage can influence the photocurrent in two ways: First, it affects the band splitting by modification of the inversion asymmetry5,6,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the band alignment of the material with the contact metals is altered, which results in changing the extraction probability and the recombination rate of all the excited carriers including the spin-polarized ones37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former is observable only for the CPGE current, whereas the latter is a general effect and can govern all three components of the photocurrent (J0, JCPGE, JLPGE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, comparable responses to the gate can be observed for these components (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to extract the pure gate dependence of SOC, the change in the band alignment or any other spin-independent effect should be excluded from the results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be done by normalizing the CPGE current by the background current6,9,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normalized value represents the internal tunability of the band splitting by the gate voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Dependency of the effect on the back-gate voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Dependence of different components of the photocurrent on the gate voltage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar gate dependencies can be observed for J0, JLPGE and JCPGE (background current, linear photo-galvanic effect and circular photo-galvanic effect).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The measured CPGE current and its normalized value as a function of back-gate voltages for an 18 nm thick sheet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Calculated (DFT) valence and conduction bands at the M point with application of different external electric fieldsmodelling the gate (15 layers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  denotes the path from  to M.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A CPGE has been observed in colloidal PbS nanosheets, which could be assigned to Rashba SOC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inversion symmetry in the rock salt crystal of bulk PbS was broken by quantum confinement, by asymmetric interfaces on two sides of the material, and by a gate electric field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of these parameters was investigated experimentally, and the results were substantiated by DFT simulations of the band structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter shows a splitting of the bands in momentum space, which results in an unconventional selection mechanism based on the spin of the photo-excited carriers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are consistent with a higher Rashba SOC in thinner sheets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of spin-related electrical transport phenomena in colloidal materials is promising in terms of future industrial applications, which supports the recently emerging spintronic approaches with simplicity, inexpensiveness and scalability of the colloidal synthesis of nanomaterials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
