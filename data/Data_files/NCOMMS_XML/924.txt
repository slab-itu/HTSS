Endocannabinoid signalling modulates susceptibility to traumatic stress exposure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Stress is a ubiquitous risk factor for the exacerbation and development of affective disorders including major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms conferring resilience to the adverse consequences of stress could have broad implications for the treatment and prevention of mood and anxiety disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilize laboratory mice and their innate inter-individual differences in stress-susceptibility to demonstrate a critical role for the endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in stress-resilience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, systemic 2-AG augmentation is associated with a stress-resilient phenotype and enhances resilience in previously susceptible mice, while systemic 2-AG depletion or CB1 receptor blockade increases susceptibility in previously resilient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, stress-resilience is associated with increased phasic 2-AG-mediated synaptic suppression at ventral hippocampal-amygdala glutamatergic synapses and amygdala-specific 2-AG depletion impairs successful adaptation to repeated stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate amygdala 2-AG signalling mechanisms promote resilience to adverse effects of acute traumatic stress and facilitate adaptation to repeated stress exposure.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Stress is a major risk factor for neuropsychiatric disease, particularly major depression and anxiety disorders, and is etiologically causal in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)1,2,3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stress-resilience is associated with reduced risk of psychopathology and is an active process of adaptation, not merely the absence of maladaptive changes induced by stress exposure8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the biological mechanisms promoting stress-resilience could lead to novel treatments for stress-related psychiatric disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we elucidate a role for endogenous cannabinoid (eCB) 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in promoting resilience to acute traumatic stress and successful adaptation to repeated homotypic stress exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The eCB system is composed of the presynaptic cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R), its endogenous ligands including anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamine; AEA) and 2-AG, and enzymes mediating eCB turnover14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neuronal 2-AG is synthesized postsynaptically primarily by diacylglycerol lipase  (DAGL)16,17, while AEA can be generated via multiple enzymatic cascades18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After release from the postsynaptic compartment, eCBs travel retrogradely to the presynaptic terminal where they bind CB1Rs, which when activated reduce vesicular neurotransmitter release from the synaptic terminal15,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2-AG is primarily degraded presynaptically by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), while AEA is degraded postsynaptically by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)15,18, and pharmacological inhibition of MAGL or FAAH can increase 2-AG or AEA-mediated eCB signalling, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'eCBs have been implicated in modulating anxiety, fear learning and stress responsivity20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological augmentation of AEA signalling reduces unconditioned anxiety and reduces stress-induced increases in anxiety-like behaviour, corticosterone release, and dendritic remodelling20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AEA augmentation also facilitates extinction learning in mice20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, stress exposure can decrease brain AEA levels, which are inversely correlated with severity of stress-induced anxiety-like behaviours23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although compelling evidence suggests that AEA signalling buffers against stress-related affective pathology20,24, the role of 2-AG signalling in stress-modulation is only now becoming appreciated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, pharmacological augmentation of 2-AG signalling can reduce unconditioned anxiety and prevent emergence of stress-induced anxiety-like behaviours25,26,27,28,29, while genetic 2-AG deficiency results in increased anxiety-like behaviours16,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, chronic homotypic stressors increase 2-AG levels within the amygdala and prefrontal cortex31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these findings, whether 2-AG signalling within these regions regulates resilience to traumatic stress exposure has not been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To directly address this critical question, herein we develop and validate a model for rapid evaluation of inter-individual differences in stress-resilience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then utilize pharmacological and circuit-specific electrophysiological approaches combined with a novel conditional genetic model to demonstrate a key role for 2-AG signalling in promoting stress-resilience and successful adaptation to repeated stress exposure.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Augmenting 2-AG reduces stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour', 'To begin to elucidate the role of 2-AG signalling in modulating stress-resilience, we first determined the effects of systemic pharmacological 2-AG augmentation on stress-induced anxiety-like behaviours using the novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test, which is highly sensitive to acute traumatic stress and eCB manipulation23,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acute administration of the MAGL inhibitor JZL-184 (8 mg kg1) increased 2-AG and decreased its metabolite, arachidonic acid (AA), without significantly affecting AEA in several limbic brain regions (Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JZL-184 significantly reduced anxiety-like behaviour two hours after administration, measured as a reduction in latency to consume palatable food in the NIH test 24 h after one or five days of foot-shock stress, but not in unstressed mice (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JZL-184 also increased consumption following one day of stress (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CB1R inverse agonist Rimonabant blocked the effects of JZL-184 after five days of stress (Fig 1d,e, diagonal stripes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Visual inspection of the cumulative distribution curves of feeding latency for vehicle vs. JZL-184 revealed larger separation at higher latencies (Fig 1fh), suggesting JZL-184 preferentially reduced the number of mice exhibiting high feeding latencies after stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rimonabant alone significantly increased latency and reduced consumption after one or five days of stress (Fig 1ik).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data suggest bidirectional modulation of stress-induced anxiety states by enhancing versus inhibiting 2-AG-CB1R signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Modulation of stress-induced

assay independent of appetitive motivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, JZL-184 significantly increased light-time, light-distance, and % light-distance, and decreased latency to enter the light-zone, without significantly altering dark-distance in the light-dark test 24 h after acute stress (Fig 1l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, JZL-184 treatment did not affect food consumption 24 h after acute stress under less aversive (low light) NIH testing conditions, or increase weight gain over 10 days of treatment (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JZL-184 also did not significantly impact locomotor behaviour in an open-field test at baseline or after five days of stress (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that the ability of JZL-184 to reduce stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour in the NIH test is not related to enhanced appetitive or consummatory drive per se, or a result of altered locomotor activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '2-AG augmentation promotes a stress-resilient phenotype', 'Our data thus far indicate that 2-AG-CB1R signalling modulates stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour; however, whether 2-AG signalling affects susceptibility to the development of stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour is still unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explicitly test this hypothesis, we developed a repeated NIH testing paradigm, which allowed for the detection of inter-individual differences in stress susceptibility (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six days after baseline novel-cage testing, mice were foot-shock stressed and, 24 h later, evaluated in a 2nd novel-cage test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in each individuals latency between baseline and post-stress testing is shown in the population distribution in Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of the population distribution of stress-induced changes in latency revealed a bimodal distribution, with data significantly better fit to two independent Gaussian distributions (resilient n=77, susceptible n=43, F(3,144)=112.3, P less_than 0.0001 Extra Sum-of-squares F test, Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into consideration the observed anti-node between the two distributions in Fig 2b, our aim to generate a meaningful susceptible group (i.e., not affected by low responders), and previous studies indicating that a difference in feeding latency on the order of 13 min represents a biologically relevant difference in anxiety-like behaviour35, we empirically divided the population into susceptible and resilient groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Susceptible mice were defined as having a stress-induced change in latency 120 s, while those with a change in latency  less_than 120 s were categorized as resilient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The means of the major and minor distributions after this categorization were 21 and 168 s, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2c,d illustrate this cutoff, splitting individuals into stress resilient and susceptible populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retrospective examination of baseline NIH latencies of the two groups revealed that their distributions overlapped considerably (resilient mean 258 s, susceptible mean 203 s), indicating that baseline anxiety-like behaviour does not predict stress susceptibility (Fig 2e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, specifically for the resilient subpopulation, there was a significant correlation between baseline latency and post-stress reduction in latency, such that the mice exhibiting the highest baseline latencies showed the largest decrease after stress, confirming the resilient nature of this group (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no correlation between baseline latency and stress-induced increase in latency for susceptible mice (n=43, r2=0.0097, P=0.529, linear regression).

latency changes, one cohort of mice was categorized as resilient or susceptible and tested 7 days later in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open-field test (OFT) 24 h after a 2nd stress exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, susceptible mice exhibited higher stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour than resilient mice in the EPM and OFT (Fig 2h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a separate cohort, EPM and OFT were conducted before stress, and mice classified post hoc as susceptible or resilient using the procedure described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we show conclusively that baseline (pre-stress) anxiety-like behaviour does not significantly differ between groups before stress exposure (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, to be certain that our results were not due to differences in sensory processing of the foot-shock itself we measured foot-shock sensitivity thresholds and behavioural responses to foot-shock stress exposure and found no differences between resilient and susceptible groups (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fear learning and recall also did not differ between groups, as indicated by percent freezing across two foot-shock sessions with week one tone 6 (T6) freezing indicative of within-session learning, week two baseline (BL) freezing indicative of between-session context recall, and week two tone 1 (T1) freezing indicative of context+tone recall (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if susceptibility was primarily due to differential HPA axis responsivity, we also measured stress-induced corticosterone immediately following the week two foot-shock stress session and found no group differences or correlation between stress-induced corticosterone and either NIH susceptibility or foot-shock responsivity (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support the segregation of two populations of mice without differences in basal anxiety-like behaviour or acute shock-responsivity, but with differential sensitized anxiety-like behavioural sequelae of stress exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next wanted to determine if systemic 2-AG augmentation could promote stress-resilience in this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this experimentally, baseline feeding latencies were obtained, followed seven days later by 24 h-post-stress novel-cage testing with JZL-184 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  JZL-184 treatment before the stress-test shifted the distribution of stress-induced changes in latency toward resilience, nearly eliminating the susceptible subpopulation (Fig 2jm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the overall distribution of stress-induced changes in latency between JZL-184 and vehicle treatment revealed a dramatic increase in the resilient proportion at the expense of the susceptible population (Fig 2b,c versus j,k, and see ratios in 2m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, JZL-184 treatment strengthened the correlation between baseline latency and post-stress reduction in latency observed in naturally resilient mice (naturally resilient r2=0.34; total population after JZL-184 treatment r2=0.81; Fig 2g versus n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that JZL-184 promotes the expression of a stress-resilient phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '2-AG augmentation converts susceptibility into resilience', 'Although our data demonstrate that increasing 2-AG can prevent the emergence of stress-susceptibility at a population level, these results could be due to either a profound reduction in latencies specifically of mice that if untreated would have been susceptible to stress, or by an unbiased anxiolytic effect on the entire population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish between these possibilities, we determined the effect of systemic 2-AG augmentation in pre-identified stress-susceptible and resilient populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we first established that stress-susceptibility was a relatively stable trait across at least two stress exposures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extending our data above, we show that two stress exposures 1 week apart both significantly increase latency relative to baseline specifically in mice categorized as susceptible based on the first stress novel cage test (Fig 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NIH novel-cage test consumption did not significantly change after or between stress exposures across the whole population or in either subpopulation (Fig 3df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3g shows an explicit comparison between the latency change from baseline after the 1st and 2nd stress exposures; importantly, in the stress-susceptible subpopulation there was no significant habituation between the first and second stress-test exposures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the difference trended downward from the 1st to the 2nd stress-test in both subpopulations, suggesting the possibility of a slight habituation, the decrease was not significant and the latency delta from baseline remained significantly different between the subpopulations after both stress exposures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data also argue against statistical anomalies such as regression to the mean confounding subsequent drug effect studies (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further exclude the possible confound of between-test habituation, we plotted 1st stress-test latency against the change in latency between the 1st and 2nd stress-tests for the susceptible mice and found that there was no correlation between degree of habituation and latency after the 1st stress exposure (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the degree of stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour did not predict the magnitude of habituation to the second stress-test exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, we analysed the duration of behavioural dysregulation induced by acute foot-shock stress exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In stress-susceptible mice, feeding latency in the NIH assay decreases from 1 day to 3 days, and from 1 day to 14 days after stress exposure; but remains significantly higher at 3 days and 14 days after stress compared with baseline (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Latencies for the stress-resilient subpopulation do not differ at any time point after stress (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Stress susceptibility is a stable trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Home cage training (blue lines) and novel cage

however, we found no correlation between novel-cage latency and consumption further arguing against changes in appetite driving changes in latency measurements with vehicle or JZL-184 treatment (Fig 4k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were not able to detect an anxiolytic-like effect of JZL-184 in the EPM in the context of the repeated testing paradigm, however this may be due to the reduced sensitivity of this assay to 2-AG augmentation (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a recent study found that MAGL inhibition was not effective in reducing anxiety-like behaviour in the EPM in high anxiety rats36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: 2-AG augmentation promotes resilience to acute stress-induced anxiety-like behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Home cage training (blue lines) and novel cage (NC) latencies and (b) consumption before (NC-V) and after (NC-FS-V) foot-shock stress with vehicle (V), JZL-184, and JZL-184+Rimonabant (RIM) treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Resilient subgroup latencies separated from a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Resilient individuals baseline and post-stress latencies and consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Susceptible subgroup latencies separated from a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Susceptible individuals baseline and post-stress latencies and consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Direct comparison of changes in latency from baseline between the 2nd stress test with JZL-184 (NC-FS2-JZL) and the first stress test with vehicle (NC-FS1-V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (h) Correlation between stress-test latency and change in latency between JZL-184 and vehicle treatment for susceptible individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) Stress-susceptibility ratios for the same cohort of mice across three weeks after vehicle, JZL-184, or JZL-184+Rimonabant treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (j) Home cage testing latency (left) and consumption as % of previous days home cage/no stress consumption (right) 24 h after stress exposure with resilient (black circles) and susceptible (red circles) individuals treated with vehicle (VEH) or JZL-184 (blue) one week after susceptibility categorization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (k) Whole population correlations between post-stress novel cage test feeding latency and consumption with vehicle and JZL-184 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue arrows indicate foot-shock stress exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  F and P values for one-way (ac,e) or two-way (g) ANOVA shown above individual panels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values for pairwise comparisons derived from Holm-Sidak multiple comparisons test after ANOVA, unpaired two-tailed t-test (j), or paired two-tailed t-test (d,f) shown in panels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R2 and P value for linear regression shown in h,k.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values from chi-squared tests reported in i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are presented as mean±s.e.m.Full size image', 'Female mice displayed similar stress-susceptibility and JZL-184 efficacy (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in this case baseline NIH consumption significantly differed between susceptible and resilient mice, and at a population level moderately predicted stress-induced changes in latency (n=51, r2=0.12, P=0.017, linear regression;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Given the prominent role of stress in the development and exacerbation of affective disorders including major depression and PTSD1,2,4,7, understanding the biological mechanisms contributing to inter-individual differences in stress-susceptibility could lead to the development of susceptibility biomarkers, novel treatments, and preventative approaches8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide converging pharmacological, physiological, and genetic evidence supporting increased 2-AG-CB1R signalling as an endogenous stress-resilience factor that buffers against adverse consequences of stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data further support pharmacological 2-AG augmentation as a viable approach for the treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Utilizing individual differences in stress responsivity to elucidate biological mechanisms subserving stress-resilience/susceptibility has been of increasing interest in recent years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, using chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), Krishnan et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  showed that stress-resilience is an active process of adaptation associated with a multitude of changes in gene expression and neural signalling rather than merely an absence of maladaptive changes induced by stress13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While social interaction measures after CSDS distinguish subpopulations expressing anhedonia and other depressive-like phenotypes, equivalent levels of anxiety-like behaviour are observed in susceptible and resilient groups13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The learned helplessness model of depression has also produced important insights about the mechanisms underlying differential susceptibility to the development of depressive-like phenotypes at both synaptic and circuit levels47,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we developed a novel model combining traditional conditioned fear-training (foot-shock+cue/context exposure) and the well-established NIH test of anxiety35 to examine individual differences in the generalized anxiety-like response to stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall 1/3 of mice show a susceptible phenotype, defined as a 120 s increase in feeding latency 24 h after foot-shock stress relative to baseline latency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be important to note that testing was performed on young adult mice and it is possible that stress responsivity could differ in either younger or older populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stress-susceptible subpopulation defined using this approach also exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviour in the EPM and OFT, further validating our paradigm, without showing changes in depressive-like measures (not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, while the key phenotype in our model has almost completely decayed two weeks following stress exposure it consistently renews following an additional stress exposure which provides a unique opportunity to examine drug effects and manipulate susceptibility in pre-defined populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lastly, consistent with the CSDS model13, susceptibility in our assay appears to be a latent trait, as neither baseline NIH latencies nor anxiety-like behaviour in the EPM or OFT differed between groups before stress exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the emerging role of 2-AG signalling in the regulation of anxiety and stress-responses30, we utilized this novel behavioural paradigm to test the hypothesis that 2-AG promotes resilience to stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that acute systemic 2-AG augmentation robustly increases the proportion of mice exhibiting resilience to adverse consequences of acute stress, and promotes resilience in previously susceptible mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, acute systemic pharmacological 2-AG depletion and CB1R blockade render previously stress-resilient mice susceptible to the development of anxiety-like behaviour after acute stress exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data provide causal evidence that 2-AG-CB1 signalling promotes resilience to the adverse effects of acute traumatic stress exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another important aspect of stress responsivity is habituation or adaptation to repeated homotypic stress exposure, which we have previously suggested may involve 2-AG signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our previous hypotheses, we found that BLA-specific DAGL deletion significantly impairs adaptation to repeated stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although BLA-specific DAGL deletion minimally impacts baseline anxiety-like behaviours, it increases the proportion of mice showing anxiety-like behaviour after repeated stress exposure and the severity of the anxiety-like phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The preferential effect of BLA-deletion of DAGL after repeated stress is somewhat surprising in light of the strong converging pharmacological data indicating 2-AG-CB1R modulation of resilience to acute traumatic stress exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, consistent with previous work in other stress models50,51,52, it is likely that endogenous 2-AG plays a more important role in stress modulation after multiple homotypic stress exposures, thus region-specific loss-of-function manipulations may show larger effects after repeated stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, other brain regions besides those tested may be more critical for the modulation of acute stress-induced anxiety or compensatory changes could occur in the weeks after DAGL deletion that counteract potential increases in acute stress-susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this issue, these data overall are consistent with previous clinical and preclinical data suggesting 2-AG deficiency could contribute to the development of stress-related psychiatric disorders16,53,54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A primary function of 2-AG signalling is the retrograde synaptic suppression of afferent neurotransmitter release within limbic nodes including the amygdala and PFC15,19,56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While dysfunction of multiple limbic regions has been implicated in stress-related psychiatric disorders, hyperactivity of the amygdala, in particular, has been highly associated with affective disorders58,59,60,61, and stress increases BLA neuronal activity in rodents62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the anxiolytic effect of low-dose cannabinoid agonist treatment is mediated through CB1Rs on forebrain glutamatergic, but not GABAergic, terminals64,65, and deletion of CB1Rs from forebrain glutamatergic terminals produces increased fear behaviours66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these data suggest that pharmacological 2-AG augmentation may exert its anxiolytic and resilience-promoting effects by reducing BLA glutamatergic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we show that resilient mice have a larger difference in BLA sEPSC frequency between maximal 2-AG-CB1R signalling (JZL-184 incubated) and abolished 2-AG-CB1R signalling (Rimonabant incubated), compared with susceptible mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest resilient mice utilize 2-AG signalling to regulate BLA afferent glutamatergic transmission within a broader dynamic range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest this broader dynamic range of 2-AG-signalling could represent part of the adaptive response to traumatic stress that characterizes stress-resilience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, we also find that stress resilience is associated with enhanced phasic, but not tonic, 2-AG-mediated suppression of glutamatergic transmission at vHIP-BLA synapses, and that relatively impaired 2-AG signalling at these

successful adaptation to stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with the known role of the vHIP in relaying contextual information to limbic output structures to generate appropriate behavioural responses to changes in environmental context, and with the anxiogenic function of vHIP-BLA circuits67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data clearly show that systemic 2-AG augmentation promotes resilience to stress, and that stress-susceptible mice have relatively impaired synaptic 2-AG signalling at vHIP-BLA glutamatergic synapses which can be normalized by JZL-184 application ex vivo.

2-AG augmentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that stress-resilience is associated with enhanced 2-AG-CB1R mediated synaptic suppression of vHIP-BLA glutamatergic transmission, and that BLA 2-AG signalling is required for successful adaptation to repeated traumatic stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data suggest that pharmacological augmentation of 2-AG signalling could represent a novel approach for the treatment of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders20,24,68, and that 2-AG deficiency states could represent a stress-susceptibility endophenotype predisposing to the development of affective pathology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
