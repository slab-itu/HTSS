Optical manipulation of single flux quanta  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Magnetic field can penetrate into type II superconductors in the form of Abrikosov vortices, which are magnetic flux tubes surrounded by circulating supercurrents often trapped at defects referred to as pinning sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the average properties of the vortex matter in superconductors can be tuned with magnetic fields, temperature or electric currents, handling of individual Abrikosov vortices remains challenging and has been demonstrated only with sophisticated scanning local probe microscopies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce a far-field optical method based on local heating of the superconductor with a focused laser beam to realize a fast and precise manipulation of individual vortices, in the same way as with optical tweezers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This simple approach provides the perfect basis for sculpting the magnetic flux profile in superconducting devices like a vortex lens or a vortex cleaner, without resorting to static pinning or ratchet effects.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Early experiments showed that the average properties of the vortex matter can be tuned with magnetic fields1, temperature or electric currents2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first step towards the controlled manipulation of vortices has been achieved by moving magnetic Bloch walls of a ferrite garnet film used to image single vortex locations3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, handling of individual vortices has been performed only with magnetic force4,5, superconducting quantum interference device6,7,8 or strain-induced9 scanning local probe microscopies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these techniques are slow and heavy to implement in cryogenic environments, new approaches to provide a large-scale and versatile basis for sculpting the magnetic flux profile in superconductor devices are required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce a far-field optical method based on local heating of the superconductor with a focused laser beam to realize a fast and precise manipulation of individual Abrikosov vortices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since a single vortex can induce a Josephson phase shift10,11, our method paves the way to fast optical drive of Josephson junctions, notably in superconducting elementary circuits with potential large parallelization of operations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the possibility to induce a global vortex flow by thermal gradients in superconductors (SCs) was experimentally demonstrated almost 50 years ago12,13, thermal manipulation of individual Abrikosov vortices has not yet been achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early observations of vortex flows in weak thermal gradients were interpreted on the basis that vortices behave as entropy-carrying particles, which obey general thermal diffusion laws and therefore are in search of colder places in the superconductor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, theoretical investigations revisiting the problem of entropy transport in superconductors show that the vortex superconducting current does not carry entropy14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the limit of a London magnetic penetration depth  much larger than the coherence length , the vortex core is very small and its contribution to the energy can be neglected15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The free energy per unit length of an isolated vortex is thus proportional to the density of Cooper pairs and is given by', '', 'where 0 is the flux quantum and 0 the vacuum permeability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It linearly grows as TcT when reducing the temperature T down from the superconducting critical temperature Tc (refs 15, 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, a temperature gradient in the superconductor will generate a thermal force per vortex unit length given by', '', 'where 0 and 0 are the values of  and  at zero temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This force will therefore drive vortices towards higher temperature regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we show that a tightly focused laser beam inducing a strong thermal gradient can be used to manipulate single flux quanta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The laser locally heats the superconductor and creates a micron-sized hotspot with a temperature rise in the Kelvin range, while keeping the temperature below Tc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large thermal gradient can easily be tuned with laser power, so that the generated thermal force overcomes the pinning potential and induces a vortex motion towards the laser focus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the laser beam acts as optical tweezers that move single flux quanta to any new desired positions in the superconductor.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Vortex manipulation', 'The experimental set-up used for single vortex optical manipulation and magneto-optical imaging is depicted in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 90 nm-thick niobium film was cooled below its critical temperature Tc=8.6 K under a weak external magnetic field Hext applied perpendicular to the film, to set the SC in the mixed state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b is a magneto-optical image of a spontaneous vortex distribution obtained at T=4.6 K and for Hext=0.024 Oe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vortices are located at pinning sites that are randomly distributed in the SC sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vortex after vortex, they are then optically dragged and repositioned into an artificial pattern forming the letters A V for Abrikosov vortices, as shown in Fig 1c (see also the vortex rearrangement movie in the Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Single vortex manipulation with a focused laser beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The concept of vortex attraction in a thermal gradient induced by a laser spot is illustrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magneto-optical imaging of individual vortices is based on the Faraday rotation of light polarization in a Bi:LuIG garnet layer placed onto the superconductor, in a crossed-polarizer beam path configuration30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PBS, polarizing beam-splitter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CCD, charge-coupled device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local heating of the niobium film is performed with a tightly focused continuous wave laser (wavelength 561 nm) from which 40% of the optical power is absorbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vortex manipulation is performed by moving the laser beam with galvanometric mirrors (GMs) placed in a telecentric system (TS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Magneto-optical image of a field-cooled vortex structure in the niobium film under Hext=0.024 Oe at T=4.6 K.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The performed experiments unveil new aspects of the interaction between laser radiation and the vortex matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the concept of attractive thermal force exerted on an isolated vortex is new, further theoretical investigations are required to gain a deeper understanding of all contributions of this force, including the contribution of the vortex core and of the supercurrents around the core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By choosing the appropriate laser parameters, we showed that one can perform a safe and efficient manipulation of single vortices, with a 100% rate of success.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, the distance over which a vortex can be dragged is only limited by the field of view of the microscope objective, which is of the order of a millimetre in our case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We realized various regimes of vortex manipulation, from the precise and rapid positioning of individual vortices to the generation of tight vortex bunches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present work we implemented a proof-of-principle vortex broom and aimed at recording the vortex broom at work, using our magneto-optical imaging system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Supplemental Movie 2, we chose a low manipulation speed to image the movements of vortices with a sufficient contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete cleaning displayed in this movie took 420 s, corresponding to an average vortex speed of 10 m s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actually, the laser scanning system, including galvanometric mirrors and the driving electronics, limits the cleaning speed in our set-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An area of 70 × 70 m could be cleaned in 350 ms, corresponding to 6 mm s1 for the vortex drive speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faster scanners would increase the vortex driving speed, up to a maximal speed which should be given by the ratio of the hotspot size (1 m) to the thermal response time of the sample (1 ns), of the order of 1 km s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We foresee that the versatility of our optical method of vortex manipulation will fuel fundamental investigations of the vortex matter and vortex dynamics in Abrikosov lattices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the interplay between photons and single flux quanta should open up novel research directions in quantum computation based on braiding and entanglement of vortices, Josephson switches of electric current28, or optically controlled elements of Rapid Single Flux Quantum logics29a new research field that could be called optofluxonics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
