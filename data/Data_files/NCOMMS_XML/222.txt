Genomic insights into the Ixodes scapularis tick vector of Lyme disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ticks transmit more pathogens to humans and animals than any other arthropod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe the 2.1 Gbp nuclear genome of the tick, Ixodes scapularis (Say), which vectors pathogens that cause Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, babesiosis and other diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large genome reflects accumulation of repetitive DNA, new lineages of retro-transposons, and gene architecture patterns resembling ancient metazoans rather than pancrustaceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Annotation of scaffolds representing 57% of the genome, reveals 20,486 protein-coding genes and expansions of gene families associated with tickhost interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report insights from genome analyses into parasitic processes unique to ticks, including host questing, prolonged feeding, cuticle synthesis, blood meal concentration, novel methods of haemoglobin digestion, haem detoxification, vitellogenesis and prolonged off-host survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify proteins associated with the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, an emerging disease, and the encephalitis-causing Langat virus, and a population structure correlated to life-history traits and transmission of the Lyme disease agent.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Ticks (subphylum Chelicerata: suborder Ixodida) are notorious ectoparasites and vectors of human and animal pathogens, transmitting a greater diversity of infectious agents than any other group of blood-feeding arthropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ticks are responsible for serious physical damage to the host, including blood loss and toxicosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tick-borne diseases result in significant morbidity and thousands of human and animal deaths annually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genus Ixodes includes multiple species of medical and veterinary importance, most notably serving as vectors of Lyme borreliosis in North America, Europe and Asia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the northern hemisphere1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the USA, 22,014 confirmed human cases were reported in 2012 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2), with 10-fold more infections suspected3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Europe, 65,500 Lyme borreliosis patients are documented annually4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the USA, Ixodes scapularis also vectors the infectious agents that cause human babesiosis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, tick-borne relapsing fever and Powassan encephalitis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased incidence and distribution of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases5 necessitates new approaches for vector control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Subphyla Chelicerata (includes ticks and mites) and Mandibulata (includes insects) shared a common ancestor 543526 million years ago (Myr ago)6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tick life cycles differ in many aspects from those of insects (Fig 1) and include long periods of host attachment and blood feeding, as well as months living off-host without feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three-host ticks such as I. scapularis require a host blood meal at each life stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Feeding occurs over several days and involves a period of slow feeding followed, after mating and insemination, by rapid consumption of a large blood meal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthesis of flexible new cuticle is a unique feature that permits the engorgement of ixodid ticks during feeding7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moulting occurs off-host, and the subsequent developmental stage will quest for a new host from vegetation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  I. scapularis exhibits a wide host range including small, ground-dwelling vertebrates, birds, white-tailed deer and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Genes associated with the unique parasitic lifestyle of Ixodes scapularis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Host detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ticks spend long periods off-host and locate hosts by questing from vegetation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hallers organ, located on the first pair of tarsi, is the major sensory appendage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tick has a relatively small repertoire of visual and chemosensory genes and an expansion of detoxification genes, presumably to counteract environmental toxicants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Attachment and blood feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tick creates a wound cavity and injects saliva containing cement, vasodilators, pain inhibitors, anticoagulants and immune-suppressing factors to facilitate long periods of attachment and blood feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Engorgement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood engorgement takes place over days to weeks and includes slow and rapid phases (dotted lines indicate increase in body volume).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New cuticle is putatively synthesized to accommodate ingestion of the large (100-fold increase in body weight) blood meal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tick has an expansion of neuropeptide receptors to regulate diuresis and concentrate the blood meal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The processes of haemoglobin digestion in intracellular vesicles of midgut cells and haem sequestration involving specialized storage proteins are unique to ticks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haemolyzed erythrocytes are absorbed by midgut epithelial cells by pinocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Digestion is accomplished by fusion with lysosomes containing digestive enzymes (see text) and sequential breakdown of proteins (1) liberating haem and 811 kDa peptide fragments, (2) 57 kDa fragments, (3) 35 kDa peptides and finally (4) dipeptides and free amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amino acids are transcytosed from the digestive cells into haemolymph and haem is transported by haem-binding proteins to haemosomes for detoxification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absorbed nutrients are converted to storage proteins (CP) throughout development or to vitellogenin in adult females for yolk provisioning of the egg just before oviposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AMP, antimicrobial peptide;

'The first genome assembly for a tick vector of disease', 'The assembly, IscaW1, comprises 570,640 contigs in 369,495 scaffolds (N50=51,551 bp) representing 1.8 Gbp, including gaps (Table 1, Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ab initio annotation of 18,385 scaffolds 10 Kbp in length and representing 1.2 Gbp (57% of the genome) predicted 20,486 protein-coding genes, and 4,439 non-coding RNA genes (Supplementary Figs 16 and Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ixodid ticks typically have haploid genomes that exceed 1 Gbp (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the 90 Mbp genome of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, a horticultural pest, is the smallest of any known arthropod, and contains 10% transposable elements9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repetitive DNA is estimated to comprise 70% of the I. scapularis genome10, reflecting an extreme case of tandem repeat and transposable element accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Summary of the Ixodes scapularis genome assembly and annotation statistics.Full size table', 'The I. scapularis genome possesses 26 acrocentric autosomes and two sex chromosomes (XX:XY)11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)-based physical mapping was used to develop a karyotype and physical map12 (Fig 2; Supplementary Tables 12 and 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping revealed that tandem repeat accumulation in centromeric or peri-centromeric regions, also noted in some other arthropods13, is high in I. scapularis and comprises 40% of genomic DNA10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low complexity tandem repeat families, ISR-1, ISR-2 and ISR-3, account for 8% of the genome12 (Supplementary Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most abundant ISR-2 (9599 bp; 7% of the genome) is localized at the near-terminal heterochromatic regions of the chromosomes (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Organization of DNA on the Ixodes scapularis chromosomes.Families of tandem repeats (TRs) comprise approximately 40% of the genome and were localized by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to ISE18 cell line mitotic chromosome spreads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative FISH image of Cot-1 DNA (green) at the heterochromatic terminal region of the DAPI-stained chromosomes (blue), presumed to represent the centromere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Representative FISH of a telomeric repeat probe (TTAGG)n.

Tables 13 and 14 and Supplementary Text).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, 41 well-represented elements (that is, comprising a full-length canonical and/or consensus sequence (Supplementary Figs 7 and 8)) of the long-terminal repeat (LTR) retro-transposon family, estimated to make up 1% of the genome, were identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thirty-seven members of the Ty3/gypsy group were identified, with the remainder being Pao/Bel-like.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two (Mag and CsRn1) of the six well-known insect Ty3/gypsy lineages were confirmed in the tick and two new clades, Squirrel and Toxo, are likely specific to the subphylum Chelicerata (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural characterization of elements belonging to these lineages revealed shared features that include the CCHC gag and GPY/F integrase domains, and two ORFs matching gag and pol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LTRs possess the TG..CA pattern14 and their integration generates a duplication of 4 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Non-LTR retro-transposons comprise about 6.5% of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence conservation and transposable element copy number suggest recent activity in the I. scapularis CR1, I and L2 clades; these elements are also abundant in birds, mammals and lizards, and the possibility of horizontal transposable element transmission warrants further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The R2, RTE and LOA non-LTR retro-transposon clades found in mosquitoes and Drosophila were not identified in the tick.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seemingly intact mariner and piggyBac transposable elements were identified, indicating possible recent or active transposition, and 234 miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) were annotated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These MITEs range in copy number from 50 to 14,500 and occupy 5% of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings suggest a genome permissive to high repeat accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Approximately 60% of tick genes have recognizable orthologs in other arthropods, about half of which are maintained across representative species of the major arthropod lineages (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 50% of the remaining genes have homologs and 1/5th of tick genes appear unique (T. urticae has a similar proportion of unique genes); these provide an important resource to understand tick-specific processes and develop highly selective interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of gene models and 20,901 tentative consensus sequences (the Gene Index Project; compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi) compiled from 192,461 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) identified 22% of I. scapularis genes as paralogs (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Table 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with estimates for Homo sapiens (15%)15 and the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans (20%)16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complementary analyses of paralogs17 suggest two duplication events in I. scapularis, involving hundreds of genes that took place within the last 40 million years, consistent with the radiation of ticks through Europe, America and Africa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tick mitochondrial genome retains the inferred ancestral arthropod organization as predicted by its phylogenetic position18 (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The genome-scale quantitative molecular species phylogeny (Supplementary Text) inferred from single-copy orthologs from OrthoDB19, confirms the expected position of Chelicerata as basal to crustaceans and insects (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rate of molecular evolution of I. scapularis genes is slightly slower than that of other representative arthropods, and considerably slower than the rapidly evolving dipterans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of shared intron positions (Fig 3b) and lengths (Fig 3c) among orthologs reveals that I. scapularis shares greater than 10 times more intron positions exclusively with the non-arthropod species compared with the crustacean Daphnia pulex (Supplementary Figs 1114 and Supplementary Tables 710).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The species tree topology is reconstructed using only intron presence/absence data, but its branch lengths reveal that I. scapularis intron positions are more similar to those of the outgroup species, than to the other arthropods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This distinction is underscored by the contrasting length distributions of shared introns; I. scapularis lengths are most similar to those of mouse and other vertebrates, and an order of magnitude greater than in D. pulex and the representative insect species analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ancestral eukaryotic genes likely possessed high intron densities similar to those of modern mammals20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tick genome, therefore, supports an intron-rich gene architecture at the base of the arthropod radiation and more similar to that of ancestral metazoans than extant pancrustaceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Molecular and intron evolution of Ixodes scapularis orthologs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The species phylogeny computed from the concatenated alignment of single-copy orthologous protein-coding genes confirms the position of the Subphylum Chelicerata at the base of the arthropod radiation, an outgroup to the clade Pancrustacea that contains crustaceans and hexapods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average rate of I. scapularis molecular evolution is slower than that in the fast-evolving dipterans (Anopheles gambiae and Drosophila melanogaster), comparable to other representative arthropods for which genome sequences are available, and faster than that of vertebrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Quantification of the proportions of shared and unique intron positions from well-aligned regions of universal orthologs reveals that, compared with the crustacean, Daphnia pulex, I. scapularis shares more than 10 times as many introns exclusively with at least one of the five outgroup species (from Cnidaria and Vertebrata) (dotted box, 13.8% versus

the dermis of the host (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tick saliva consists of a complex mixture of peptides and other compounds that facilitate attachment and disarm host haemostasis, inflammation and immunity, thereby enabling prolonged blood feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antimicrobials in the saliva21 presumably prevent bacterial overgrowth within the ingested blood and/or feeding lesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptome analyses indicate that tick saliva is exceptionally diverse compared with that of haematophagous insects22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, genes encoding salivary gland products are evolving rapidly in comparison with other gene families, possibly due to the immune pressure imposed by the host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the genome reveals an expanded repertoire (74, 0.4% of the predicted proteome) of proteins containing a Kunitz domain (Supplementary Table 16), implicated in protease inhibition and channel-blocking activity, with roles in inhibiting coagulation, angiogenesis and vasodilation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tick genome is the richest source of this gene family identified to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, only 0.05% of human and 0.1% of bovine proteins have this signature domain23, while the mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae have only five, eight and four proteins with this domain, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other tick gene expansions of note include the lipocalins (40 genes), linked to anti-inflammatory activity in other systems24, and the metalloproteases (34 genes), which are involved in fibrin degradation and inhibition of angiogenesis25', 'Ticks have evolved a novel mechanism for haemoglobin digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haemolysis of host erythrocytes occurs in the midgut but the digestion of blood meal proteins takes place within specialized vesicles of midgut epithelial cells following internalization by pinocytosis (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haemoglobin digestion occurs via a cascade of proteolytic enzymes resulting in dipeptides and free amino acids that are transcytosed into the haemolymph (Supplementary Text and Supplementary Table 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orthologs of Ixodes ricinus haemoglobinolytic enzymes26 were identified in the I. scapularis genome that contains multiple genes for cathepsin D (three genes), cathepsin L (three genes), and serine carboxypeptidase (four genes), suggesting the relative importance of these enzymes in haemoglobin digestion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haemoglobinolytic enzymes have also been identified in other tick species27,28, suggesting that this mode of haemoglobin digestion is widespread throughout the Ixodida.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liberated haem is transported from the digestive vesicles by transport proteins to haemosomes, unique storage vesicles where haem is detoxified by formation of haematin-like aggregates29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, haemoglobinolysis in ticks is similar to that in endoparasitic flatworms and nematodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, tick-specific intracellular digestion in midgut epithelial vesicles and haem detoxification in specialized haemosomes could offer novel acaricide targets (Supplementary Text and Supplementary Table 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Haem is associated with multiple essential functions as it complexes with proteins that perform oxygen transport and sensing, enzyme catalysis and electron transfer30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ticks are incapable of de novo haem synthesis, and it has been proposed that they rely on haem recovery from the diet31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of orthologous genes in I. scapularis for the enzymes hemF, hemG and hemH associated with the production of protohaem (Supplementary Fig 15 and Supplementary Table 20) suggests these may be remnants of a once functional haem synthesis pathway that became redundant following adaptation to a blood diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of de novo synthesis, haem storage in ticks is likely essential, especially during the extended periods that occur between blood feeding and during egg development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ticks, two families of storage proteins ensure haem availability and protect against the toxicity of a haem-rich diet: haemlipoglyco-carrier proteins (CPs) and the yolk proteins, vitellogenins (Vgs)32 (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPs are predominant in all tick developmental stages except the embryo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Vg is produced in the fat body and midgut of adult females during vitellogenesis (Fig 4), and is transported via the haemolymph to the developing oocyctes where it is stored as vitellin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vitellin is the main protein in the egg and the likely source of haem for developing embryos33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten putative CP genes, the most described from a tick to date, and two Vg genes were identified in the I. scapularis genome (Supplementary Fig 16 and Supplementary Table 22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Model of neuroendocrine processes controlling mating and egg production in Ixodes scapularis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (1) Mating takes place off or on the host (before or during blood feeding), but is required for rapid blood feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The male attaches to the genital pore of the female via its mouthparts (evidence suggests the potential involvement of female specific cuticular lipids and a non-volatile mounting pheromone in I. scapularis), then transfers sperm and gonadotropins (unidentified at present), among other seminal components, including the spermatophore, (2) Gonadotropins initiate the synganglion to release EDTH, stimulate rapid engorgement, initiate synthesis of neuropeptides which in insects regulate moulting and synthesis of new cuticle (tick functions unknown), and release of allatostatins and allatotropins (which may stimulate or inhibit the mevalonate-farnesal pathway), (3) EDTH initiates production of ecdysteroids by the epidermis, (4) High ecdysteroid titres activate transcription factors for VgR in the ovaries, are stored in developing eggs and, as 20-E, activates transcription factors for Vg in the fat body and specialized cells of the midgut, (5) Vg is taken up via VgR-receptor mediated endocytosis by developing oocytes and incorporated into the yolk as vitellin, and (6) The female produces a single batch of 3,000 mature eggs from the genital pore that are passed forward to the mouthparts for coating with wax released from the Genes organ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical and genomic evidence suggests that

hardening and tanning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orthologs involved in insect moulting34, that is, corazonin, eclosion hormone, cardioactive peptide and buriscon  and , were identified (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional novel putative neuropeptide genes were identified based on the presence of tandem repeats in conserved C-terminal sequences, including the canonical sequences for amidation and dibasic (or monobasic) cleavage signals (Supplementary Table 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ESTs matching corazonin, eclosion hormone and bursicon  and  were found in the synganglion transcriptome of adult Dermacentor variabilis35, which do not moult, suggesting previously unrecognized roles for these neuropeptide hormones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Companion analyses36 identified major differences in gene expression between I. scapularis and the soft tick, Ornithodoros turicata (Argasidae) in response to feeding that may explain how synganglion neuropetides regulate different life styles of the two tick families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of orthologs of neuropeptides known to regulate insect moulting provides a much needed starting point to understand the regulation of development in ticks and in the modification of cuticle to accommodate the approximately 100-fold increase in size that occurs during blood feeding (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In ticks, over-hydration from large blood meals is counterbalanced by hormonally controlled salivary secretion into the host, presumably regulated by neuropeptides and their G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The homologs of many insect neuropeptides, protein hormones, biogenic amines and associated GPCRs37 (Supplementary Tables 2528) that steer processes such as diuresis, behaviour, reproduction and development38, were identified in I. scapularis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the neuropeptide genes identified encode multiple neuropeptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note is the extreme number of copies (19) of the kinin gene, which ranges from one to eight in other arthropods38 (Supplementary Table 28), suggesting that high peptide copy number is also needed for effective diuresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, four kinin GPCRs are present (Supplementary Table 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tick has 20 GPCRs for five biogenic amines, a number similar to that for all other sequenced arthropods37, suggesting an early evolutionary origin of these molecules and a core set of highly conserved arthropod signalling molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically in insects, each neuropeptide interacts with one, or at most two, GPCRs37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the numbers of some neuropeptide GPCRs have expanded significantly (up to 10-fold) in I. scapularis (Supplementary Tables 26 and 28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes the GPCRs for AKH/corazonin-related peptide, allatostatin-A, diuretic hormones (calcitonin- and CRF-like), inotocin, kinin, pigment-dispersing-factor, sulfakinin, and tachykinin (Supplementary Table 28)37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In insects, these GPCRs are involved in regulating meal size (kinin), satiety (sulfakinin) and diuresis (kinin, tachykinin and calcitonin-like diuretic hormone)38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ticks, the increased efficacy and fine regulation of diuresis may be accomplished through an increased repertoire of diuretic GPCRs rather than via corresponding neuropeptides, emphasizing their potential as targets for tick control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Blood feeding is essential for reproduction in adult female ticks (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In lower insects, reproduction is largely regulated by juvenile hormone III.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biochemical evidence suggests that ticks do not synthesize juvenile hormone III and instead employ ecdysteroids to initiate vitellogenesis (Fig 4, reviewed in33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In insects, the final hydroxylations for the synthesis of ecdysteroids are performed sequentially by cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) encoded by the Halloween genes (Supplementary Fig 17 and Supplementary Table 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes for all steroidogenic CYP450s except for phantom were identified in the I. scapularis genome and putative gene duplications were identified for disembodied and the spook/spookier clades, suggesting conservation of ecdysteroid regulated processes between ticks and insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes for seven of the nine enzymes in the insect mevalonate pathway that produces the juvenile hormone precursor, farnesyl-pyrophosphate (farnesyl-PP), were identified in the tick genome (Supplementary Fig 18 and Supplementary Table 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are five insect enzymes involved in the conversion of farnesyl-PP to juvenile hormone III.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the gene for farnesol oxidase in the juvenile hormone branch was found in the I. scapularis genome (Supplementary Table 18) and is transcribed in the synganglion of I. scapularis and D. variabilis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tick genome reveals a striking expansion of the methyl transferase family (44 genes) and EST data indicate that at least 26 of these are transcribed (Supplementary Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the I. scapularis methyl transferases studied so far lack the juvenile hormone binding motif.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ortholog of the insect cytochrome P450 (CYP15A1) that adds the epoxide to methyl farnesoate to produce juvenile hormone III was not found in either the tick genome (Supplementary Table 18) or synganglion transcriptomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The neuropeptides, allatostatin and allatotropin, which perform a variety of functions in insects, including the regulation of juvenile hormone biosynthesis, were also identified in the tick (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Important questions remain as to the role of the mevalonate-farnesal pathway in tick reproduction and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a complementary study, transcripts for genes in the mevalonate-farnesal pathway were identified from the synganglion of two hard and one soft tick species39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The I. scapularis genome reflects a parasitic lifestyle requiring detoxification of multiple xenobiotic factors (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a

haem-containing enzymes that catalyse biological oxidation reactions, many of which detoxify xenobiotics, including acaricides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the body louse, Pediculus humanus, also an obligate blood-feeding ectoparasite, has 36 CYPs, the fewest known in an animal40, while the plant feeding mite, T. urticae has 81 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carboxylesterases are also associated with metabolic detoxification in animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the function of these enzymes is not known, the abundance of these genes in I. scapularis may reflect the need to detoxify large blood meals from diverse hosts and toxicants encountered during off-host stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a parasite that lives largely off-host, I. scapularis has developed unique mechanisms for host detection that are reflected in the genome (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensory system in ticks includes setiform sensilla for chemo-, mechano-, thermo- and hygroreception, non-setal sensilla and dorsal light-sensing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemoreception occurs presumably through the unique Hallers organ located on the tarsi that are presented when ticks quest for a host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In insects, smell and taste are mediated by families of membrane receptors and extracellular ligand-binding proteins41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemoreceptor genes identified in the tick genome belong to the gustatory receptor and ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR)-related ionotropic receptor families.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sixty-two gustatory receptors were identified that fall into three major clades (Supplementary Fig 20, Supplementary Table 29 and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest of the clades (43 genes) is exclusive to I. scapularis and the relatively short branch lengths compared with those for other representative species, suggest a recent lineage-specific expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although phylogenetically distant, this clade is related to the Dipteran sugar receptors and a set of three distinctive D. pulex gustatory receptors42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second clade includes 16 tick gustatory receptors, also more closely related to the sugar receptors than to other representative gustatory receptors, with branch lengths suggesting an early diversification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining clade (three genes) clusters with the largest D. pulex expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 29 IR/iGluR genes identified, 15 are likely of the chemosensory type (ionotropic receptor) and 14 are canonical iGluRs (Supplementary Fig 21 and Supplementary Tables 30 and 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of the insect odorant receptor, odorant-binding protein (OBP) and chemosensory protein B families43 were not identified in the tick and only one member of the chemosensory protein (CSP) family was found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the origin of insect odorant receptors and OBPs occurred after the split of the lineages Hexapoda and Crustacea (470 Myr ago)42,44; the CSPs, however, are predicted to appear before the split of the Chelicerata and Pancrustacea lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylogenetic analyses indicate that odorant receptors belong to a divergent lineage originated from gustatory receptors, while OBPs could have derived from a CSP-like ancestor44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both events may have occurred concomitantly as an adaptation of ancestral hexapods to the terrestrial environment (380450 Myr ago).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chelicerate olfaction may, therefore, rely exclusively on ionotropic receptors, which are expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia45, although it is also possible that some gustatory receptors have been recruited to this sensory function, as in Drosophila melanogaster46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative transcriptomics has identified putative GPCRs, ionotropic receptors, odorant turnover enzymes and other transcripts specific to the Hallers organ in ticks47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence suggests the potential involvement of female specific cuticular lipids and a non-volatile mounting pheromone in I. scapularis during mating48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data and morphological studies provide an emerging model for research on tick chemical communication and new control methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The tick possesses a small repertoire of photon-sensitive receptors compared with most insects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes for three opsin GPCRs were identified (Fig 1a, Supplementary Table 26) and include orthologs of the insect putative long-wavelength sensitive visual opsins, the honey bee non-visual pteropsin likely involved in extraocular light detection and regulation of circadian rhythm49, as well as the D. melanogaster Rh7 opsin50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orthologs of the insect UV and short wavelength receptors were not identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates a reduced visual system as compared with other blood-feeding arthropods (Supplementary Text) that rely heavily on visual processes during flight for location of mates, hosts and oviposition sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During host detection, olfactory, mechano- and thermoreception may offset limited visual acuity and wavelength detection in the tick.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ticks as vectors of pathogens and parasites', 'Ticks are biological vectors of viruses, bacteria and protozoa that are typically acquired via the blood meal and transmitted through saliva during feeding (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tick immune system has several mechanisms to fend off pathogen invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most components of the Toll, IMD (Immunodeficiency), JAK-STAT (Janus Kinase/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) immune pathways and the RNA interference-antiviral signalling pathways were identified in the

Increasingly, research is focused on interactions with Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae), the causative agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis prevalent in the USA and Europe52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The I. scapularis proteins P11, SALP16, 1, 3-fucosyltransferases and the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis E3 ubiquitin ligase are required for A. phagocytophilum infection and transmission, and modification of the tick cytoskeleton by A. phagocytophilum increases infection53,54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish infection, A. phagocytophilum inhibits apoptosis in midgut and salivary gland cells through the JAK/STAT and intrinsic pathways56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In response, the extrinsic apoptosis pathway is induced in tick salivary glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All known components of these pathways were identified in the tick with the exception of the Perforin ortholog (Supplementary Table 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systems biology analyses56 revealed that the generalized responses of tick cells to A. phagocytophilum infection include changes in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein misfolding is increased in infected tick cells, a possible strategy by which A. phagocytophilum evades the cellular response to infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent activation of protein targeting and degradation, reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress and prevents cell apoptosis, and may also benefit the pathogen through provision of raw materials critical for an obligatory intracellular parasite with reduced biosynthetic and metabolic capacity57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, A. phagocytophilum can induce an increase in expression of antifreeze glycoproteins, enhancing I. scapularis survival in cold temperatures58, and downregulate Porin expression to inhibit apoptosis, increasing tick colonization55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tick cells respond to pathogen infection by decreasing glucose metabolism and
