Immobilization of single argon atoms in nano-cages of two-dimensional zeolite model systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The confinement of noble gases on nanostructured surfaces, in contrast to bulk materials, at non-cryogenic temperatures represents a formidable challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, individual Ar atoms are trapped at 300 K in nano-cages consisting of (alumino)silicate hexagonal prisms forming a two-dimensional array on a planar surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trapping of Ar atoms is detected in situ using synchrotron-based ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The atoms remain in the cages upon heating to 400 K. The trapping and release of Ar is studied combining surface science methods and density functional theory calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the frameworks stay intact with the inclusion of Ar atoms, the permeability of gasses (for example, CO) through them is significantly affected, making these structures also interesting candidates for tunable atomic and molecular sieves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings enable the study of individually confined noble gas atoms using surface science methods, opening up new opportunities for fundamental research.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Immobilizing single atoms of noble gases at room temperature within a two-dimensional (2D) array of nano-sized cages is both fundamentally interesting and technologically relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could allow the vast artillery of surface science tools to study with exquisite level of detail the behaviour of individual unreactive atoms and molecules in nano-confinement, as well as the mechanism by which they enter and exit the cages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the knowledge gained using this approach could provide guidelines for the design, selection and improvement of adsorbent materials and membranes for gas separation1,2 and reprocessing of used nuclear fuel3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Excellent candidates for these cages are found in 2D (alumino)silicate bilayer frameworks, consisting of an array of polygonal prisms forming a 2D self-containing structure, that interacts weakly with a single crystal metal substrate onto which is grown5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These frameworks have been proposed as surface science zeolite models given their similar chemical behaviour8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to other 2D materials such as graphene with only one atomic carbon layer, the cages in the 2D zeolite model systems allow the possibility of hosting atoms and molecules within the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The passage of single Pd and Au atoms through the cages onto the interface with the underlying metal substrate has been previously explored9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While previous work on these novel 2D materials focused on their study as catalysts11, their study for non-cryogenic trapping and separation of gases is also of critical importance12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An industrially relevant application is the separation of unreactive volatile species such as noble gases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trapping noble gases on surfaces and especially within nano-sized cages similar to those of zeolites can provide an unprecedented level of detail on the adsorption processes when surface science tools are used, which may further stimulate the manipulation of these trapped gases with atomic precision.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that trapping of noble gases has been previously achieved using three-dimensional porous materials13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface immobilization of noble gases can be typically achieved by condensation at cryogenic temperatures16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, immobilizing noble gases on a surface at room temperature and above is challenging, and to our knowledge it has only been achieved by ion implantation17 by accelerating ions onto a surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrostatic trapping of Xe has been reported but still at cryogenic temperatures18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Aside from the cages within the framework, a second type of confined spaces is located between the 2D framework system and the metal support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also allows the size selective diffusion of small molecules to intercalate at this interface19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the intercalation of molecules at the interface pushes the weakly bound 2D framework further away from the metal support.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports show that the 2D silica film is permeable to small molecules, such as H2, CO and O2 (refs 19, 20, 21, 22), with a diffusion energy barrier of 0.5 eV for CO to go through the hexagonal prisms recently calculated from density functional theory (DFT)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note here the analogy with 3D zeolites, readily used as adsorbents and molecular sieves13,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another noble gas, xenon, has been shown to adsorb on zeolite chabazite, which is composed of the same secondary building block (the hexagonal prism) that makes up the 2D (alumino)silicate framework used here24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we show that the aforementioned 2D-zeolite models can trap individual Ar atoms in the nano-cages that make the surface, providing a new playground for the fundamental study of isolated noble gas atoms in confinement with surface science methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is demonstrated by ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and by infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the experimental data with DFT calculations provides more detailed fundamental insights, as discussed below.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Trapping argon in nano-cages', 'Well-ordered 2D silica (SiO2) and aluminosilicate (Al0.16Si0.84O2) frameworks were grown on a Ruthenium(0001) surface, as described in detail elsewhere5,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trapping of Ar atoms in the frameworks is demonstrated in situ by Ambient Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (AP-XPS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D framework is first exposed to 0.5 mbar Ar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AP-XPS spectrum in Fig 1a shows a strong Ar 2p3/2 peak at 243.55 eV (P1) and a weak Ar 2p3/2 peak at 241.85 eV (P2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the Ar pressure is lowered, the P1 peak gradually decreases and eventually disappears, while the P2 peak still remains even after evacuating the gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P1 can then be assigned to gas phase Ar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reference experiments carried out on a clean Ru(0001) surface show the gas phase Ar peaks only (Supplementary Fig 1) and no evidence of Ar on the surface after evacuation, indicating conclusively that P2 in Fig 1a corresponds to Ar trapped by the silica framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that Ar atoms are trapped only when the silica film is exposed to modest Ar pressures ( greater than 0.2 mbar) during the XPS experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) experiments described later, higher pressures ( greater than 2 mbar) are needed to trap Ar, indicating that the X-ray beam plays a role in facilitating the capturing of the atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is very likely related to the ionization of Ar atoms by X-rays as part of the measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Careful analysis of P2 after evacuation (dark blue in Fig 1a,b) shows that this peak has a main component at 241.90 eV and a shoulder at 240.90 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Angle dependent XPS experiments were carried out to qualitatively determine the relative depth at which these Ar atoms are located.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1b, the shoulder at lower binding energies becomes comparatively weaker at the larger =40° photoelectron emission angle (with respect to the surface normal) when compared to spectra taken at =20°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the shoulder corresponds to Ar atoms at a deeper location and are assigned to the interface between the silica framework and the Ru(0001) surface (Arinter) (Fig 1d), while the main peak is assigned to Ar atoms within the hexagonal prism cages (Arcage).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak assignment is confirmed by DFT calculations at =0.25 ( is the total coverage of trapped Ar per nano-cage), where the Ar 2p3/2 binding energy (EBE) of Arcage is 1.12 eV higher than that of the Arinter (see Supplementary Table 1 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Ar trapping in the silica bilayer.XPS core level spectra of (a) pressure dependent Ar 2p, (b) angle dependent Ar 2p, (c) temperature dependent Ar 2p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Schematic illustration of the trapped Ar atoms in the bilayer silica/Ru(0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Colour code: Si (yellow), O in silica films (red), O chemisorbed on Ru(0001) (pink), Ru (silver) and Ar (cyan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) IRRA spectra of as-prepared silica bilayer and Ar-containing silica bilayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The black spectrum in a is obtained in UHV prior to the Ar exposure, while the dark blue spectra in (a) and (b) are obtained in UHV after the Ar exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Photon energy, hv=1000, eV;

It was then exposed to 3 × 106 mabr O2 at 1,200 K in order to form a chemisorbed 3O-(2 × 2)-Ru(0001) overlayer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The silica and aluminosilicate bilayers were grown on the oxygen pre-covered ruthenium surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, Si (and Al) was thermally evaporated onto the 3O-(2 × 2)-Ru(0001) surface at room temperature under 2 × 107 mbar of O2, followed by oxidation at 1,200 K in 3 × 106 mbar O2 for 10 min and slowly cooled down in O2 environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Characterization', 'AP-XPS measurements were carried out at the beamline X1A1 of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) and the Coherent Soft X-ray Scattering and Spectroscopy beamline (CSX-2) of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main chamber (base pressure 2 × 109 mbar) of the end-station was equipped with a differently pumped hemispherical analyser (Specs Phoibos 150 NAP), which was offset by 70° from the incident synchrotron light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless otherwise stated, the sample surface normal is 20° off the axis of the electron analyser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ar gas was introduced into the main chamber through precision variable leak valves for the trapping studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the spectra in Fig 3 has broader peaks given the lower resolution at beamline X1A1 of NSLS where these were taken, as opposed to the rest of the XPS spectra, which were taken at beamline CSX-2 of NSLS-II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The IRRAS measurements were performed in a separate UHV system (base pressure 5 × 1010 mbar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IRRA spectra were collected at 4 cm1 resolution using a grazing angle of 85° to the surface normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High purity CO and Ar exposure was carried out in a separate cell sealed from the UHV chamber by a Viton O-ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Computational methods', 'DFT calculations were performed using plane-wave basis set and the projector augmented wave formalism implemented in the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP)34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis benchmark calculations on constituents of the system (bulk ruthenium and silica)28, the consistent exchange van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF-cx)36,37 was used to describe the non-local vdW interactions in the Ar-silica/O/Ru(0001) system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ru(0001) substrate was modelled by a five-layer Ru slab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The silica/O/Ru(0001) heterojunction was modelled as bilayer silica films (SiO2) physisorbed on O/Ru(0001) with the unit cell size defined by a=5.392 Å and b=9.339 Å. Si atoms in the bilayer were chosen to sit on hollow sites of Ru(0001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of chemisorbed oxygen atoms on Ru(0001) corresponds to the coverage of p(2 × 1)-O/Ru(0001)38, which is similar to the experimentally estimated oxygen coverage of 0.5 ml.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Ar-(SiO2)8/4O/Ru(0001), the unit cell was used with 50% of the nano-cages of silica films or the corresponding inter-space filled with Ar atoms (=0.50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Ar-(SiO2)16/8O/Ru(0001), a 2 × 1 supercell was used with a 25% filling (=0.25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the surface normal direction, c=27 Å was chosen to ensure the vacuum region to be at least 10 Å thick, except for nudged elastic band calculation where the minimum of vacuum region was 7.5 Å in the initial state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A kinetic energy cutoff of 800 eV was used to meet the required numerical convergence for vdW-DF-cx with hard pseudopotentials39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K-point grids of 8 × 4 × 1 and 4 × 4 × 1 were used to sample the Brillouin zone of Ar-(SiO2)8/4O/Ru(0001) and Ar-(SiO2)16/8O/Ru(0001), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ar atoms, silica films and top two layers of the Ru substrate were allowed to relax during the structure optimization until forces were smaller than 0.01 eV Å1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dipole correction method40 was used due to the existence of sizable surface and interface dipole moments28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core-level binding energies (EBE) were calculated using the transition state model41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are extrapolated to the infinite supercell size limit, as described in our previous work28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All EBE values of Ar 2p were given relative to that of Ar 2p at the interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'All data that support the findings of this study are available from the authors on request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
