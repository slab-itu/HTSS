Phase diagram for the transition from photonic crystals to dielectric metamaterials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Photonic crystals and dielectric metamaterials represent two different classes of artificial media but are often composed of similar structural elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The question is how to distinguish these two types of periodic structures when their parameters, such as permittivity and lattice constant, vary continuously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we discuss transition between photonic crystals and dielectric metamaterials and introduce the concept of a phase diagram, based on the physics of Mie and Bragg resonances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that a periodic photonic structure transforms into a metamaterial when the Mie gap opens up below the lowest Bragg bandgap where the homogenization approach can be justified and the effective permeability becomes negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our theoretical approach is confirmed by microwave experiments for a metacrystal composed of tubes filled with heated water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis yields deep insight into the properties of periodic structures, and provides a useful tool for designing different classes of electromagnetic materials with variable parameters.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The concepts of phase transitions and phase diagrams are among the most fundamental concepts in physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we reveal and analyse a rather unusual type of phase transitions between two classes of artificial electromagnetic structures: photonic crystals (PhCs)1,2 and metamaterials (MMs)3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapidly growing attention to the study of PhCs and MMs is due to their unique electromagnetic properties and the exciting new physics these structures may offer for novel applications in photonics5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resonant properties of PhCs are driven by the familiar Bragg scattering from a periodic structure when the lattice constant becomes comparable with the wavelength of light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MMs are regarded as effective media with averaged parameters which in turn can be engineered by changing the properties of their subwavelength elements modifying the propagation of electromagnetic waves with the wavelengths much larger than the lattice constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Many properties of conventional MMs are usually defined by the optically induced magnetic response of metallic wires or split-ring resonators, which has been demonstrated experimentally in many studies for both microwave and near-infrared spectral regions10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the scaling of such MMs to higher frequencies encounters many problems, including strong absorption of electromagnetic radiation in metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently suggested electromagnetic periodic structures composed of high-permittivity dielectric elements12,13,14 can avoid these problems, while still delivering an effective magnetic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main physics underlying the properties of such all-dielectric MMs is based on the resonant modes of the Mie scattering15 supported by dielectric particles16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mie resonances provide a mechanism for the generation of an optically induced resonant magnetic response based on the displacement current, and they offer a simpler and more versatile route towards the fabrication of isotropic MMs and metasurfaces operating at optical frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PhCs and all-dielectric MMs can be composed of the similar structural elements arranged in the similar geometries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such structures offer a unique opportunity to study a transition from PhCs to MMs when their parameters, such as dielectric permittivity and lattice period, vary continuously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition we describe here can be mapped onto a phase diagram; however, it is quite different from phase transitions well known in other fields such as thermodynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thermodynamical phase transitions appear as transformations of a system from one state or phase to another with changing external variables such as pressure, temperature, chemical potential and so on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we reveal and analyse a rather unusual type of phase transitions between two regimes of light propagation, that is, the regime where the propagation of light is mainly influenced by the interference between multiple Bragg scattered (PhC phase), and the regime where the propagation of light is mainly determined by the properties of each single element of the materials (MM phase).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, we identify two different scenarios for the transition of a two-dimensional (2D) square lattice of dielectric rods from PhC to MM (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first scenario that has never been discussed previously occurs when the lattice constant a decreases in comparison with the fixed radius of rods r and dielectric permittivity .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This transformation leads to an increase of the filling ratio r/a, and it makes possible the homogenization18 of the periodic dielectric structure with the negative effective permeability ( less_than 0) at higher values of  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19, 20, 21, 22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Transition from photonic crystals to metamaterials.Schematic illustrates two possible transformations of the PhC (b) to MM (a,c) through the competition between the Bragg and Mie scattering wavelengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To satisfy the classical homogenization condition in the low-frequency long-wavelength limit (Bragg less_than Mie), one may decrease the lattice constant and increase the filling ratio r/a (r/a-scenario) or, alternatively, increase the rod permittivity  (-scenario).Full size image', 'The second scenario occurs when the dielectric permittivity of rods  varies in a fixed square lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This transformation leads to an increase of the Mie scattering wavelength, and it can also provide the conditions for the homogenization approach with negative .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While photonic structures with varying  were studied earlier theoretically24,25, the transition between PhCs and MMs has never been analysed previously to our best knowledge, especially in terms of the phase diagram, as discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We notice that the aim of both scenarios is the same: to tune the wavelength of the Mie mode Mie higher than the Bragg wavelength Br that can be achieved by either decreasing the Bragg wavelength or by increasing the Mie wavelength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Decreasing the Bragg wavelength means decreasing the lattice constant (building block size) a, which will be smaller than the operating wavelength for the MM behaviour, Mie.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we integrate both scenarios and introduce a novel concept of a phase transition between all-dielectric PhC and MM and suggest the corresponding phase diagram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase diagram PhCMM is represented on the plane filling ratio versus dielectric permittivity for an example of 2D structure composed of dielectric circular rods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our theory is confirmed by very careful experimental design and analysis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'An interplay between Bragg and Mie resonances', 'To analyse the PhCMM phase transition, we investigate theoretically electromagnetic properties of the dielectric periodic medium depending on the dielectric contrast, filling ratio and incident wave polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an illustrative example, we consider here 2D square lattices of parallel dielectric circular rods infinitely long in the z direction with the radius r and real frequency independent permittivity .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rods are embedded in air (air=1) and the arrays can be characterized by the filling ratio r/a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have derived three key sets of spectroscopic data, namely: (i) spectra of the Mie scattering by an isolated rod; (ii) photonic band structure of an infinite 2D square lattice composed of rods; and (iii) transmittance of a 2D square lattice of 10 layers in length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All data sets have been calculated for a wide range of the rod permittivity  with the step of =1 (-scenario) and in the range of filling ratio  with the step of 0.01 (r/a-scenario).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the r/a-scenario cylinder radius is supposed to be as a fixed parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that at r/a=0.5 all rods touch each other and at r/a greater than 0.5 the rods penetrate into each other and the structure appears as inverted one of air holes in a dielectric matrix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, we consider the Mie scattering by an isolated rod.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The far-field scattering can be expanded into orthogonal electromagnetic dipolar and multipolar modes, described by circular LorenzMie resonant coefficients an (transverse-electric (TE) polarization) and bn (transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization) corresponding to electric and magnetic moments, respectively15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2 presents the numerically calculated spectra of the Mie scattering efficiency  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26) for the dipole TE0 and multipole TEn  modes in the range of dimensionless frequencies a/ from 0 to 0.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each mode consists of an infinite set of quasi-equidistant modes TEnk (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Mie modes of the rod are denoted as TEnk, where n is integer related to the symmetry of the mode, and  identifies resonance number for the modes with fixed symmetry n. The calculations reveal a strong decrease of the Mie eigenfrequencies and narrowing of the resonant Mie bands with  increasing, as can be clearly seen for the lowest TE01 magnetic Mie resonance in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Numerical calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a), (d), (g), (j), (m), (p) Calculated Mie scattering efficiency Qsca,n for an isolated dielectric circular rod for TEn (n0)

precisely the evolution of the low-frequency region of the photonic band structure formed by a complicated mixture of the dispersion curves originating from Mie and Bragg resonances and propagating modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our goal is to discuss the PhCMM transition, we concentrate on the TE polarization where the lowest TE01 magnetic dipole resonance of the rods results in a negative

with the results of our calculations, we verify our concept experimentally by engineering a metacrystal composed of plastic circular tubes filled with water and forming a 2D square lattice with

r/a-scenario was realized using a special construction of the metacrystal that makes it possible to change the distance between tubes synchronously in x and y directions keeping the 2D square symmetry

perpendicular to the tube axis z, the two transverse polarizations appear decoupled and the vector wave problem can be reduced to two independent scalar equations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the modes of 2D PhCs can be classified as either TE modes (Ex, Ey and Hz) with the electric field confined to the xy plane and the magnetic field polarized along the axes of the rods (Fig 4) or TM modes (Hx, Hy and Ez) for which the magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to the rod axis z.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the TM polarization, such structures can not show any magnetic activity31, so we only

remarkable shift towards high-frequency region, then nearly almost disappears at r/a0.09 when it approaches the unchanging TE01 Mie gap from the low-frequency side, and finally appears again at

MM phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, for the -scenario, the Bragg gap position changes very slowly as opposed to the strong shift of the TE01 Mie band that finally leads to the same general result

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Figure 6a shows our main result: the PhCMM phase diagram for the 2D square lattice of circular rods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The axes represent the dielectric permittivity  and filling ratio r/a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phase diagram was obtained based on 50 gap maps (such as in Fig 3a) calculated in the permittivity region  with the step r/a=0.01 for TE polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diagram is divided into two areas, which represent the PhC and MM phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition from PhC phase to MM phase can be identified by critical points, which are defined by a special combination of permittivity  and filling ratio r/a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The curvature of the second dispersion curve around the  point decreases and finally becomes perfectly flat along the X path (at =19.5, r/a=0.25, Fig 2k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With future increase in  or change in r/a, the TE01 Mie gap completely splits from complicated coupled MieBragg band becoming the lowest gap in the spectrum and the MM phase appears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this Mie gap, the magnetic permeability is negative and all waves in the medium are evanescent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since all the Bragg gaps are located at higher frequencies, any diffraction losses in the vicinity of the Mie resonance are absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transition from the PhC phase to the MM phase is completed and the medium is classified as the MM with  less_than 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A phase transition is usually characterized by an order parameter that basically arises from symmetry breaking but can also be defined for non-symmetry-breaking transitions32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here for the unusual phase transition PhCMM, we define the order parameter  as a measure of splitting in the energy scale between the TE01 Mie and Bragg gaps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is zero in the PhC phase and nonzero in the MM phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6b presents the order parameter depending on both external variables  and r/a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: PhCMM phase diagram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) PhCMM phase diagram for a square lattice of dielectric circular rods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TE polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue circles indicate the points where the TE01 Mie gap splits from Bragg band becoming the lowest gap in the spectrum (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimentally investigated regions are marked by red.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dielectric permittivities  of different materials are marked by horizontal lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The dependence of the order parameter  on the dielectric permittivity  and the filling factor r/a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The order parameter is defined as a difference in the energy between the TE01 Mie and Bragg gaps in the MM phase.Full size image', 'Now, we review some features of the PhCMM phase diagram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low filling ratio r/a less_than 0.05, the concentration of the completely isolated rods in the lattice is too small for achieving negative average permeability at reasonable values of .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, when distance between rods become very small (r/a greater than 0.45), the inter-rod interaction become strong and the hopping of the Mie photons from one rod to another dominates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that Mie resonances are not localized anymore and they finally exhibit the character of propagating Bloch waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All requirements for the appearance of the MM phase are broken and the PhC phase extends its region of existence to very high .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We notice that for the metacrystals with a small lattice constant a, the frequency of the Mie resonance is increasing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, there is no transition to the MM phase in this limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identification of candidates for dielectric low-loss materials is critical for designing a practical MM for applications in different ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an example, in Fig 6a, we mark the regions of the MM phase for water in the microwave range (region )31, the chalcogenide glass Ge2Sb2Te5 (30)33 and tellurium (25)34 in infrared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the well-studied 2D square lattice of germanium (16) and silicon (13)34 rods has only PhC phase.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Conclusion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have studied a metacrystal composed of dielectric circular rods and introduced the concept of a phase diagram in the permittivity-filling ratio plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The boundaries of the MM phase have been obtained theoretically and confirmed experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the proposed approach, one can obtain different PhCMM phase diagrams by altering the dimension, symmetry, composition, size and geometry of the structural elements within a unit cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying mechanism of the PhCMM transition provides unique criteria for goal-oriented search of novel low-loss MM with a wide range of applications at infrared and visible frequencies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
