PARP9 and PARP14 cross-regulate macrophage activation via STAT1 ADP-ribosylation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite the global impact of macrophage activation in vascular disease, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show, with global proteomic analysis of macrophage cell lines treated with either IFN or IL-4, that PARP9 and PARP14 regulate macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In primary macrophages, PARP9 and PARP14 have opposing roles in macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PARP14 silencing induces pro-inflammatory genes and STAT1 phosphorylation in M(IFN) cells, whereas it suppresses anti-inflammatory gene expression and STAT6 phosphorylation in M(IL-4) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PARP9 silencing suppresses pro-inflammatory genes and STAT1 phosphorylation in M(IFN) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PARP14 induces ADP-ribosylation of STAT1, which is suppressed by PARP9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations at these ADP-ribosylation sites lead to increased phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Network analysis links PARP9PARP14 with human coronary artery disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PARP14 deficiency in haematopoietic cells accelerates the development and inflammatory burden of acute and chronic arterial lesions in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that PARP9 and PARP14 cross-regulate macrophage activation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite medical advances, the global burden of ischaemic heart disease is increasing1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pro-inflammatory macrophage activation plays key roles in the pathogenesis of many disorders, including arterial disease3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some pathways associated with macrophage activation may contribute to the shared mechanisms of inflammatory diseases, as demonstrated previously11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite potent therapies such as cholesterol-lowering by statins, substantial residual cardiovascular risk remains7,13,14, which drives the active search for novel solutions against pro-inflammatory macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dissecting complex and intertwined mechanisms for macrophage activation requires well-defined mechanistic models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evidence suggests that distinct types of macrophage activation are functionally different in disease pathogenesis, a classification that has helped to assess the heterogeneity of macrophages15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes can oppose one another, develop in response to distinct cytokines, differ in the activating stimuli and produce different cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recently proposed nomenclature suggests that each macrophage subpopulation can be called based on a specific stimulator, for example, M(IFN), M(LPS), M(IL-4), M(IL-10)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This established paradigm demonstrates clear relationships between classical stimuli and their respective responsesinterferon gamma (IFN) for pro-inflammatory activation in settings such as atherosclerotic vascular disease and interleukin (IL)-4 for activation that can counter that of M(IFN) or M(LPS) macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we used this paradigm as a starting point to explore novel regulators through global proteomics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Proteomics screening and bioinformatics in mouse and human data sets found that poly ADP-ribose polymerase 14 (PARP14), also known as ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria toxin-like 8 (ARTD8), and PARP9/ARTD9 both increased in M(IFN) and decreased in M(IL-4) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The network analysis associated these PARP family members with human arterial disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence similarity to the PARP catalytic domain, which transfers ADP-ribose moieties from NAD to protein acceptors, characterizes the PARP family proteins23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best-characterized member, PARP1/ARTD1, represents poly-ADP-ribosylation enzymes, which processively catalyse long and branching polymers of ADP-ribose additions starting from an initial post-translational modification, commonly of glutamate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent evidence also validates proteins that execute mono-ADP-ribosylation as having various functions24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PARP14/ARTD8 is an intracellular mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous reports indicated that PARP14 enhances IL-4-induced gene expression by interacting with the cytokine-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) in B and T cells, thereby functioning as a transcriptional co-activator25,26 that may mediate this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study reported that PARP14 regulates the stability of tissue factor mRNA in M(LPS) in mouse27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Less information exists regarding the molecular function of PARP9/ARTD9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although PARP9 appears to lack catalytic activity28, it increases IFN-STAT1 signalling in B-cell lymphoma29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study employed a multidisciplinary approach, including proteomics, systems biology and cell and molecular biology to explore new mechanisms for modulating the functional profile elicited after macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse and human cell lines as well as primary macrophages were used for complementary analyses of PARP14-deficient mouse and human tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, the analyses led to evidence that expression of PARP14 in haematopoietic cells restrains vascular inflammation in mouse models, which are not solely regulated by either IFN or IL-4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest a novel mechanism for regulating the balance of macrophage phenotypes in vascular disease, and potentially other disorders in which macrophage activation has an impact on outcomes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Proteomics screening for regulators of macrophage activation', 'We used the tandem mass tagging (TMT) quantitative proteomics to identify regulators of pro-inflammatory and non/anti-inflammatory activation in mouse RAW264.7 and human THP-1 macrophage cell lines (Supplementary Fig 1ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paradigm of macrophage heterogeneity, IFN and IL-4 promote distinctive subpopulations15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pilot TMT proteomic study (Supplementary Figs 1d and 2) analysed the changes in the proteomes at 0, 12 and 24 h, and observed the expected increase and decrease in STAT1 in M(IFN) and M(IL-4) cells, respectively, as determined by hierarchical cluster analysis (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within this pilot study, we first noted that PARP14 co-clustered with STAT1 in the M(IFN) and M(IL-4) data (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ascertain whether any changes in the M(IFN) and M(IL-4) proteomes were not because of cell culture conditions, we performed a second, more in-depth study that included an unstimulated macrophage control for both RAW264.7 and THP-1 experiments, and extended the stimulation period to up to 72 h, sampling six time points for a more detailed time-resolved proteomic study (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this latter proteomic study, we quantified 5,137 and 5,635 proteins in RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells, respectively, across the three conditions: unstimulated control, IFN-stimulated macrophages and IL-4-stimulated macrophagesM(-), M(IFN) and M(IL-4), respectively (Fig 1a and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An overview of the protein intensities across the three conditions revealed that the magnitude of protein abundance levels for each of the IFN and IL-4-stimulated RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells were generally higher than those of unstimulated cells (Fig 1b), indicating that each stimulation promoted changes in protein abundance beyond those due to cell culture conditions alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Bioinformatics to identify candidate regulators of macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Venn diagrams showing the distribution of quantified proteins from mouse RAW264.7 and human THP-1 cells in unstimulated control, IFN-stimulated and IL-4-stimulated macrophages: M(-), M(IFN) and M(IL-4), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Data

proteins whose abundances exceed the M(IFN) threshold (+0.13, maximum protein abundance in unstimulated control at 8 h, dashed line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these M(IFN)-filtered traces, those that decreased in IL-4 stimulation when compared with their unstimulated control are plotted to the right for RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Hierarchical clustering of 38

regulators based on protein abundances, we used the following criteria: proteins exhibited (1) an early increase in M(IFN) (within 24 h) followed by sustained levels until the later time points (up to 72 h), (2) a decrease in abundance in M(IL-4) and (3) no significant change in M(-).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We employed two distinct informatics methods to explore proteins with such behaviours: data filtering (Method 1) and model-based clustering (Method 2; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Method 1, the M(-) data set permitted a subtraction of the background signal at all time points and thus facilitated data filtering (Fig 1b upper panels and Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three proteins in the data set from mouse RAW264.7 cells and 12 proteins in human THP-1 cells (Fig 1b lower panels) met the three criteria above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PARP14 emerged from both data sets, and PARP9 appeared in the THP-1 data set (Fig 1b lower panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, Method 2 (Supplementary Fig 3c) produced 15 and 20 clusters for the RAW264.7 and THP-1 data sets, respectively (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clusters mined for proteins whose abundances increased in M(IFN) but decreased in M(IL-4) with respect to M(-) revealed 490 proteins in the RAW264.7 data set and 414 proteins in THP-1 fulfilling these criteria (Supplementary Fig 4b and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteins were short-listed to those with similar time-resolved changes in both in human and mouse data sets, resulting in 38 candidate proteins (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both RAW264.7 and THP-1 data sets identified PARP9 and PARP14 (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, while Method 2 identified PARP9 and PARP14 in RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells, PARP14 was the only common protein that both Methods 1 and 2 identified among over 5,000 proteins in mouse and human data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The PARP9 and PARP14 network and coronary artery disease', 'To understand the influence of PARP9 and PARP14 in a global interaction network (interactome) and predict their potential clinical impact in disease mechanisms, we applied a network-based analysis (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing evidence suggests that disease genes are not distributed randomly on the interactome but work together in similar biological modules or pathways30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, gene products (for example, proteins) linked to the same phenotype likely interact with each other and cluster in the same network neighbourhood31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus postulated that, if PARP9 or PARP14 influences the network neighbourhood of a disease, its immediate neighbours should be close to a disease module compared with random expectation30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the random-walk method, we defined a set of genes as a human disease module for each of the cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and IFN-related diseases (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then measured the average shortest distance of the immediate neighbours of the PARP9PARP14 network to each disease module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An interactome mainly describes a set of physical or functional associations between proteins and does not provide cell or tissue specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, we thus examined the genes of immediate neighbours reported in macrophages in the public databases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We included IFN-related autoimmune diseases as positive controls, as we used this cytokine to promote pro-inflammatory macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PARP9PARP14 network is significantly close to systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, as expected (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PARP9PARP14 network had significantly greater proximity to the human coronary artery disease gene module compared with other cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (Fig 2 and Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis also linked PARP9PARP14 with osteoporosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we quantified the closeness of PARP9PARP14 to autoimmune diseases, coronary artery disease and other diseases in the form of the distribution of shortest distances (Supplementary Fig 5c) and demonstrated a clear separation between the distribution of diseases inside and outside the circle (Fig 2), indicating an enrichment of shorter distances (d=1 and 2) for IFN-related autoimmune diseases (yellow) and coronary artery disease and osteoporosis (blue), compared with other cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (red; Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results may indicate the potential impact of PARP9 and/or PARP14 on the pathogenesis of arterial disease or the onset of its clinical complications.

expectation is indicated by P values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The random expectation was same size-connected components of PARP9PARP14 module and a disease module drawn randomly from the network.

were less abundant in human carotid arteries with no apparent atherosclerotic changes (Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemistry localized PARP9 and PARP14 expression in the majority of macrophages (CD68) of human atherosclerotic plaques, while few if any smooth muscle cells (SM-actin) and endothelial cells (CD31) stained positively for these PARPs (Supplementary Fig 7b).

(for example, IL-1) and in the M(IL-4) phenotype (for example, MRC1) gauged the downstream effects of PARP silencing using small interfering RNA (siRNA) first in macrophage-like cell lines RAW264.7 and THP-1 since the original screening was performed in these cells, and then in human and mouse primary macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In mouse RAW264.7 cells, PARP14 silencing enhanced the induction of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by IFN, and suppressed the response of MRC1 to IL-4 (Supplementary Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human THP-1 cells, PARP14 silencing also increased TNF and IL-1 mRNA induction in response to IFN and decreased MRC1 induction by IL-4 (Supplementary Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased levels of TNF and IL-1 proteins in the supernatant of IFN-treated THP-1 cells with PARP14 silencing (Supplementary Fig 8c) supported these data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silencing of PARP9 suppressed the induction of TNF, IL-1 and

and PARP14 in macrophage activation, we extended the in vitro validation studies to mouse and human primary macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human primary macrophages derived from CD14+ peripheral

4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, PARP14 silencing accelerated the induction of TNF, IL-1 and CCL2/MCP-1 by IFN, and suppressed MRC1 in IL-4-treated macrophages (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), silencing PARP9 and PARP14 exerted the effects similar to those in human primary macrophages (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, siRNA experiments provided consistent results in macrophage-like cell lines and primary macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither PARP14 nor PARP9 showed significant effects on viability, proliferation or apoptosis of mouse primary

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The present study provides new evidence that PARP9 and PARP14 regulate macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specific novel findings demonstrated in this report include the following: (1) PARP9 promotes IFN-induced responses in mouse and human macrophages; (2) PARP14 suppresses IFN responses in mouse and human macrophages; (3) PARP14 induces IL-4-triggered responses in mouse and human macrophages; (4) PARP9 and PARP14 appear to have physical and functional interactions; (5) PARP9 and PARP14 closely interact with components of IFN signalling in macrophages; (6) PARP14-induced mono-ADP-ribosylation of STAT1 inhibits its phosphorylation; (7) the PARP9 and PARP14 interactomes have significant proximity to the coronary artery disease module; (8) PARP14 deficiency indeed accelerates macrophage activation and lesion development in mouse models of acute and chronic arterial diseases; (9) PARP14 in the haematopoietic lineage exerts protective effects against arterial diseases; and (10) single-cell analysis revealed that IFN-stimulated human primary macrophages derived from CD14+ PBMC contain subpopulations, in which PARP9 and PARP14 are closely associated with genes of IFN signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide insight into new mechanisms for macrophage activation that play a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arterial diseases, a global health burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We aimed to establish the unambiguous evidence for the role of PARP9 and PARP14 in macrophage activation using in vitro and in vivo studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, M(IFN) and M(IL-4) as two multidimensional models of macrophage heterogeneity were used in an unbiased proteomics approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then validated our key results on the functionality of PARP9 and PARP14 in mouse and human primary macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioinformatic analysis of single-cell gene profiling in human primary macrophages revealed close links among PARP9, PARP14 and IFN pathway-related molecules (for example, JAK1, JAK2, STAT1 and STAT6), suggesting that these PARP family members contribute critically to the process of M(IFN) activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We took advantage of the availability of a well-characterized paradigm of macrophage heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The balance of diverse macrophage phenotypes (for example, pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory subsets) may regulate normal homeostasis and disease mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effective and safe anti-inflammatory therapies may require the fine-tuning of the imbalance of diverse macrophage phenotypes (for example, suppressing excessively activated pro-inflammatory macrophages without compromising protective functions or with enhancing anti-inflammatory activation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our major goal was to identify molecules or pathways that may regulate the delicate balance of macrophage heterogeneity using global proteomics of M(IFN) and M(IL-4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus used stringent criteria to choose proteins that increased during M(IFN) activation and decreased in M(IL-4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro experiments indicate that the interplay between PARP9 and PARP14 may indeed regulate the M(IFN)/M(IL-4) balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further validated the in vitro results in human arterial lesions and mouse models of arterial disorders, neither of which is solely regulated by IFN or IL-4, to provide clinically translatable evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human and mouse atherosclerotic plaque macrophages express PARP9 and PARP14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified four macrophage subpopulations in human lesions: PARP9+/PARP14+; PARP9+/PARP14; PARP9-/PARP14+; and PARP9/PARP14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-cell gene expression analysis further revealed that IFN-stimulated human primary macrophagesM(IFN)are heterogeneous, which may support an emerging concept of the multidimensional model of macrophage activation21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, subpopulations within these IFN-stimulated cells may have different functions, as shown by associations with MMP-9, CD36, TLR2 and TLR4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies addressing the functional significance of the heterogeneity in human primary macrophages may lead to the development of personalized medical solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To explore the evidence for the anti-atherogenic role of PARP14 beyond in vitro assays, we used PARP14/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic deletion of PARP14 indeed promoted macrophage activation and accumulation in the intima of mechanically injured arteries, offering in vivo proof of concept.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, significant acceleration of acute arterial lesion formation and chronic atherosclerosis was observed in the mice reconstituted with PARP14/ bone marrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that haematopoietic PARP14 plays a central role in arterial disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study further revealed the new biology for understudied members of the PARP familyPARP9 and PARP14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ADP-ribosylation assays demonstrated that PARP14 has the ability to mono-ADP-ribosylate STAT1 and mass spectrometric analysis identified two ADP-ribosylation sites proximal to its key phosphorylation site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, PARP9 suppresses PARP14-dependent mono-ADP-ribosylation of STAT1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, mutations of STAT1 ribosylation sites for PARP14 enhanced its phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interplay of PARP9 and PARP14 in STAT1 ADP-ribosylation and phosphorylation may in part explain why PARP9 and PARP14 exert opposing effects on IFN- and IL-4-induced macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 16 demonstrates an overview of regulatory mechanisms for the IFN-STAT1 and IL-4-STAT6 pathways by PARP9 and PARP14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, unbiased global proteomics and bioinformatics of IFN- and IL-4-treated macrophages implicated PARP9 and PARP14 in novel mechanisms of macrophage activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subsequent network-based prediction of the close relationship between the macrophage PARP14PARP9 module and human coronary artery disease genes supported the premise that our proteomics screen would effectively identify regulators of macrophage activation in the context of cardiovascular diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach was then followed by a series of in vitro and in vivo analyses on mouse and human cells/tissues that demonstrated the novel concept that PARP9 promotes and PARP14 suppresses IFN-induced activation of macrophages (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present study also represents our strategy of target discovery research assisted by global proteomics screening and subsequent validation studies (Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our discoveries indicate that inhibition of PARP9 and/or activation of PARP14 may attenuate macrophage-mediated vascular diseases, and also provide new insight into the development of effective therapies for other inflammatory disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

To extract the proteins that increase in IFN-stimulated (M(IFN)) but decrease in IL-4-stimulated condition (M(IL-4)), we applied a simple filtering logic that exploited the available unstimulated control data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, unstimulated control, M(-), serves as a control for the biological signal owing to the cell culture condition; that is, protein traces M(IFN) and M(IL-4) that exceed the edges of the baseline are more likely to be bona fide IFN- and IL-4-specific responses (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein profiles whose abundances surpassed the

sets (unstimulated control, IFN-stimulated and IL-4-stimulated) for both RAW264.7 and THP-1 cells, with the purpose of identifying proteins whose profiles increased in IFN-stimulated condition and decreased in IL-4-stimulated, but maintained at basal levels in unstimulated control condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We inspected all clusters looking for an increase in the relative abundance of proteins
