Observational evidence for enhanced magnetic activity of superflare stars  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Superflares are large explosive events on stellar surfaces one to six orders-of-magnitude larger than the largest flares observed on the Sun throughout the space age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the huge amount of energy released in these superflares, it has been speculated if the underlying mechanism is the same as for solar flares, which are caused by magnetic reconnection in the solar corona.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we analyse observations made with the LAMOST telescope of 5,648 solar-like stars, including 48 superflare stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations show that superflare stars are generally characterized by larger chromospheric emissions than other stars, including the Sun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, superflare stars with activity levels lower than, or comparable to, the Sun do exist, suggesting that solar flares and superflares most likely share the same origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very large ensemble of solar-like stars included in this study enables detailed and robust estimates of the relation between chromospheric activity and the occurrence of superflares.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The largest known solar flare was the Carrington event in AD 1859 (refs 1, 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This flare and the associated coronal mass ejection were so large that they caused world-wide auroras and allowed telegraphs to operate on the currents induced by the accompanying geomagnetic storm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we have no X-ray measurements of the Carrington event, it is not clear how large it was compared with the largest flares observed during the space age, which are classified according to their peak X-ray flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Estimates based on magnetometer traces predict that the Carrington event, with a total energy of up to 5·1032 erg, was likely larger than any solar flare observed in the space age4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, it is clear that the hazard caused by the Carrington event was minimal compared with that potentially posed by, for example, a 2·1034 erg superflare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifteen years ago, Schaefer et al.5 identified nine so-called superflares, defined as flares with energies ranging from 1033 to 1038 erg, on nine ordinary solar-type stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We call these stars superflare stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Superflares on solar-like stars may arise from at least three different mechanisms, apart from coronal magnetic reconnection: (i) starstar interactions, as is the case for RS CVn systems, where a close binary companion tidally spins up an F or G main-sequence star.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that this tidal interaction can be accompanied by large co-rotating flux tubes that temporarily may connect the two stars and thus cause superflares when the interconnecting field lines subsequently disrupt6; (ii) stardisk interactions, where the dipole magnetic field of the central star is connected to the co-rotating disk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The twist imposed on the dipole magnetic field can thus lead to disruption and superflares7; (iii) starplanet interactions, which can take place in two different ways, either similar to the starstar mechanism through disruption of interconnecting field lines8,9 or through tidal interaction between the star and the planet, which can lead to enhanced dynamo action10 and thus greater magnetic reconnection events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the main differences between the starstar and the starplanet mechanisms is that where RS CVn-type stars generally have activity levels many times higher than those found in even the most active single solar-like stars11, stars hosting Jupiter-like planets have activity levels comparable to average solar-like stars12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three mechanisms were analysed theoretically by Shibata et al.13 along with the possibility for a Sun-like star to generate a superflare through coronal magnetic reconnection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was found that it would take the Sun 40 years to generate a sunspot large enough and with a magnetic field strong enough to produce a 1035 erg superflare.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Shibata et al.13 conclude that the coronal magnetic reconnection hypothesis is the most like scenario, they were not able to rule out other scenarios, such as enhanced dynamo action through tidal interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using 120 days of high-precision, high-cadence photometric observations from NASAs Kepler mission14, Maehara et al.15 identified 365 superflares on 148 solar-type stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study was updated by Shibayama et al.16 using 550 days of observations to include 1,547 superflares on 279 G-type stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nature of these has been investigated by a number of authors who analysed periodic brightness modulations in their Kepler light curves15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these studies show that fast rotating stars are more likely to host superflares, but in general, the measured rotation periods have to be handled with great caution as: it has been shown using simulations that Kepler observations cannot be used to extract rotation periods for stars where the spot life-time is comparable to or shorter than the rotation period, as is the case for the Sun20; the Kepler light curves are heavily affected by artefacts on time scales longer than 20 days21; a large fraction of the apparently rapid rotating (a few days) stars are likely ellipsoidal binaries22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Instead of looking at the rotation rates, the activity levels can be measured as emission in the Ca II H and K spectral lines at 396.8 and 393.4 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity of the emission scales with the amount of non-thermal heating in the chromosphere, making these lines a useful proxy for the strength of, and fractional area covered by, magnetic fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was first suggested by Eberhard and Schwarzschild24 and has subsequently been used extensively to measure stellar activity since Olin Wilson started regular observations at the Mount Wilson Observatory25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emission in the Ca II H and K lines is measured by the canonical S index, which intensive research over the last 4 decades has shown is related to magnetic activity26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Stellar activity can also be measured using, for example, the Ca II infrared triplet or the H line28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notsu et al.31 used the Subaru telescope to measure activity levels, using the Ca II line at 8,542 Å, of 27 superflare stars, which all show activity levels larger than the Sun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strong correlation was observed between the photometric modulation of the Kepler light curves over the rotation period and the measured activity levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, however, not clear from these observations if all superflare stars have activity levels higher than the Sun, as the Ca II line at 8,542 Å is insensitive to activity at activity levels lower than or compared with the activity level of the Sun31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we use observations from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST, also called the Guoshoujing Telescope at Xinglong observatory, China)33 to show that superflare stars are generally characterized by larger chromospheric emissions than other stars, including the Sun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, superflare stars with activity levels lower than, or comparable to, the Sun do exist, suggesting that solar flares and superflares most likely share the same origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very large ensemble of solar-like stars included in this study enables detailed and robust estimates of the relation between chromospheric activity and the occurrence of superflares.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Superflare stars are characterized by enhanced activity', 'Using observations from LAMOST, we have measured the S index of 5,648 main-sequence, solar-like stars with effective surface temperatures

activity levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all, 48 of these 5,648 stars have been categorized as superflare stars by Shibayama et al.16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare the distribution of the measured activity levels of all the 5,648 solar-like stars with the distribution of the 48 stars that show superflares (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two distributions are clearly different, with the activity levels of the superflare stars shifted to higher values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A KolmogorovSmirnov test shows that the two distributions are different at the 99.999999983% significance level, comparable to 6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result shows that superflare stars generally exhibit stronger activity levels than other solar-like stars, indicating that the superflare stars have larger dynamo actions and thus that the superflares may be caused by a mechanism similar to the one generating solar flares.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also supported by a bootstrap test, which shows that the mean S index of the superflare stars falls within the top 0.002% of the distribution of mean S indices when 48 stars are repeatedly selected at random from the 5,648 main-sequence stars (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

observe that 30 out of 30 stars have activity levels larger than 0.169, whereas 26 out of 30 have activity levels larger than 0.205 (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of stars hosting superflares with total energies larger than 2·1034 erg is shifted to higher activity levels, and none of these superflare stars display activity levels significantly lower than the Sun (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is noteworthy that 12 of 48 of superflare stars and 4 of 30 superflare stars with superflares above 2·1034 erg have chromospheric emission levels comparable to the Sun.

signal-to-noise ratio do not allow the S index to be measured with the required accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal-to-noise ratio is measured as described in Luo et al.35 and shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The risk associated with using signal-to-noise ratios down to 10 is that the activity measurements may become unreliable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we have compared our activity measurements (S index) with activity measurements based on the residual flux in the core of the infrared Ca II 8,542 line (r0) by Notsu et al.31 (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The clear correlation between the measured activities indicates that the S index we measure with the LAMOST observations is a reliable measure of chromospheric emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also tested the reliability of the measured activity levels by only analysing spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this lowered the number of analysed stars dramatically, it did not change any

uncertainties associated with the estimated magnetic fluxes are relatively large in both cases (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uncertainties are in both cases calculated based on the transformation to magnetic flux  less_than fB greater than  using solar data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore not clear how the accuracy of the two sets of activity measurements compare with one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, the Subaru spectra have higher resolution and higher signal-to-noise ratio than the LAMOST spectra, but, on the other hand, the S index is a better activity indicator than the residual flux in the core of the infrared Ca II line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main difference between the Subaru and the LAMOST observations is the much larger (5,648) sample size of the LAMOST observations, which allow us to conclude that superflare stars are generally characterized by higher activity levels than other solar-like stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Comparison to star spot coverage', 'Chromospheric emission, as measured with the S index, is one manifestation of stellar magnetic fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another manifestation is star spots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notsu et al.31 compared the so-called mean stellar brightness variation with the residual flux in the core of the infrared Ca II line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stellar brightness variation is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum of the stellar flux measured with Kepler within a given 3-months period (after outlier removal)31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparison shows a strong correlation between these two quantities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 5, we thus compare our measured chromospheric emission with the stellar brightness variation measured by Notsu et al.31 Again, we see a strong correlation for the 11 stars that have been observed with both the Subaru and LAMOST telescopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, 9 out of these 11 stars show both larger chromospheric emission, residual flux in the core of the infrared Ca II line and stellar brightness variation than the Sun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to test the relation between chromospheric emission and star spot coverage over a larger parameter range, we compare the measured S indices with the periodic photometric variability amplitude (Rper) measured by McQuillan et al.36 (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The periodic photometric variability amplitude is calculated as the range between the 5th and 95th percentile of the normalized flux36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indications of a correlation between the S index and the periodic photometric

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Based on activity measurements of 5,648 solar-like stars, including 48 superflare stars, we show that superflare stars are generally characterized by higher activity levels than other stars, including the Sun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, superflare stars with activity levels lower than, or comparable to, the Sun do exist, but none of the stars hosting the largest superflares ( greater than 2·1034 erg) show activity levels lower than the Sun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed above, superflares on solar-like stars may result from at least three different mechanisms apart from coronal magnetic reconnection: (i) starstar interactions, (ii) stardisk interactions and (iii) starplanet interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our activity measurements show that superflare stars generally have S indices between 0.15 and 0.35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this is higher than solar-like stars in general and higher than the Sun, it is lower than typical RS CVn-type stars, which usually have S indices higher than 1.00 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore unlikely that a large fraction of the superflares can be explained by RS CVn-type starstar interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although we cannot evaluate if the stardisk and the starplanet hypotheses may be correct, it is likely that the magnetic field of the superflare stars should be significantly larger than what we observe on the Sun for these mechanisms to operate8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that the lower part of the distribution of the measured activity of the superflare stars overlap with the range observed for the Sun indicates that these mechanisms most likely are not the main cause of superflares.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, given the transit probability for a hot Jupiter in a 4-day circular orbit37 and because none of the superflare stars are known to host hot Jupiters, the starplanet mechanism is unlikely to be the main mechanism responsible for superflares15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study provides observational (although non-exclusive) support for the coronal magnetic reconnection hypothesis, as we show that superflare stars generally exhibit higher chromospheric emissions than the Sun and other solar-like stars, although there is an overlap between the two distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coronal magnetic reconnection hypothesis can explain the observations via the notion that superflares and solar flares share the same origin and that the two activity distributions therefore are within similar range, but that superflares mainly take place on stars with activity levels larger than the Sun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the observations had shown two different and non-overlapping ranges of activity levels in superflare (red curve) and non-superflare stars (black curve), for example, centred on S indices around 1.00 and 0.18, respectively, it would have favoured the starstar, stardisk or starplanet mechanisms, but this is not the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The observations also make it possible to renew the evaluation of the frequency of solar superflares (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we have compared the frequency of solar flares with the frequency of superflares on solar-like stars as a function of the flare energy (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If only the superflare stars with activity levels comparable to or smaller than the Sun are considered, then the frequency of 2·1034 erg superflares is reduced with almost an order-of-magnitude compared with solar-like stars in general.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Comparison of occurrence rates of flares on the Sun and of superflares on solar-like stars.The solid line shows the power-law distribution of solar flares64, which is compared with the power-law distribution of superflares on the 279 G-type main-sequence stars found by Shibayama et al.16 (dotted line) and the power-law distribution of those of these stars that have activity levels lower than the Sun at solar cycle maximum (dashed line, Methods).

1035 erg, although the observations suffer from detection limit effects below energies of 5·1034 erg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extension of the power-law to energies below 5 × 1034 erg is, however, supported by Maehara et al.68 The coloured regions mark where one flare per year (blue), decade (green), century (yellow) or millennium (red) is expected.Full size image', 'This result confirms the result by Shibayama et al.16, who found that 1,150 out of 1,547 superflares occurred on fast rotating stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined, the two results indicate that although superflares on solar-like stars with Sun-like rotation and chromospheric emission are an order-of-magnitude less likely than superflares on solar-like stars in general, they still occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do, however, have to be careful with the definition of Sun-like stars here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shibata et al.13 suggested that a sunspot with a radius around 30% of the solar radius would be needed in order for the Sun to produce a superflare with an energy above 1035 erg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although such a large spot has never be observed on the Sun, it is clear that the Sun would likely fall outside our definition of Sun-like, if such a large spot was observed, as such a large spot would likely result in large chromospheric emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The downward adjustment of the flare frequency based on the activity measurements leads to a better agreement between astrophysical activity observations of superflare stars and the frequency of solar flares recorded in geological archives (see Fig 7 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Geological archives, in particular cosmogenic nuclides (10Be and 14C) in ice cores and tree rings, can be used to evaluate the flare frequency through so-called solar particle events, where protons are accelerated in connection with large solar flares to energies sufficiently high to produce cosmogenic nuclides when they reach the Earths atmosphere (see Schrijver et al.38 for a recent review).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The raw flare frequency estimated from the Kepler data, calculated without weighting for activity, seems to roughly follow the power-law distribution of solar flares16,17,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To some extent, this contradicts results from a number of geological archives, which indicate a break, or roll-over, in the distribution of solar particle events at energies around 1033 erg (refs 39, 40, 41, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discussion of this roll-over effect has received renewed attention with recent discoveries based on studies of 14C in Japanese tree rings, indicating that the Sun hosted a superflare with an energy larger than 1033 erg in AD 775 (refs 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solar origin of the AD 775 event was recently questioned due to the lack of simultaneous aurora observations49, but evidence from a new study based on multi-radionuclides suggest a solar origin50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar event might have taken place in AD 993 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 7, the AD 775 and the AD 993 events are shown with a diamond, assuming that such events take place every 620 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper-limit flare frequency weighted for activity lies over the AD 775 and AD 993 events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This does not contradict the roll-over scenario, but it does not place tight constraints on the occurrence of such events either.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indications of a roll-over effect in the flare frequency weighted for magnetic activity is also in agreement with recent theoretical estimates, which predict that sunspot groups larger than historically reported would be needed in order for the Sun to produce a superflare with an energy larger than 6·1033 erg (ref.

#@NEW_LINE#@#  This is confirmed by a KolmogorovSmirnov test, which shows that the two distributions are identical between 0.1 and 0.3 at the 93% significance level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the stars in the Isaacson and Fischer56 sample, we define main-sequence stars as stars with absolute visual magnitude within 1 magnitude of the main sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective temperatures are calculated from the B-V colour index using the formulation by Alonso et al.57 The ensemble thus consists of 60 main-sequence stars with effective temperatures between 5,100 and 6,000 K and with S

carried out using 2 minimization, yelling a reduced 2 of 0.45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the calculation, we assume that the measurements are not independent measurements of the same quantity, in which case we should have used the uncertainty of the mean value of the S indices as the uncertainty instead of the standard deviation of the different measurements of the S indices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is done to achieve conservative estimates of the uncertainty and because we expect that the intrinsic chromospheric emission of the stars change between observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the

fundamental stellar parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the stars in our study thus have updated parameters by Huber et al.59 We show the updated values of the effective temperatures and surface gravity

chosen to use the KIC values, as Huber et al.59 explicitly stress that their updated values are only accurate for large ensembles and not suitable for scientific analysis on a star-by-star basis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, we want to note that KIC 11197517 and KIC 11241343 could have evolved off the main-sequence, based on the updated surface gravities from Huber et al.59 Asteroseismic studies have previously shown that superflares are not uncommon on stars that have evolved off the main-sequence60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The updated effective temperatures imply that 13 out of the 48

histogram of the activity distributions, would look if the effective temperature and surface gravity values were taken from Huber et al.59 It is clear from this figure that this would not change the

calculate the chromospheric flux instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chromospheric flux can be calculated from the S index and some colour information like B-V and or effective temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precision on the calculated chromospheric flux therefore depends on the precision of the colour information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the effective temperatures from KIC to calculate the B-V colour

levels lower than, or comparable to, other solar-like stars do exist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Figs 6 and 7 do, however, indicate that the noise in the chromospheric flux measurements is larger than in the S index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely due to both noise in the effective temperature from KIC and in the conversion from effective temperature to the B-V colour index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A

energy and stellar activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except for the absence of any high-energy flares with weak stellar activity, no clear correlation is seen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not unexpected, as stars with strong stellar activity are expected to host both medium and larger superflares.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Kepler photometry of the three stars with S index below 0.13 (KIC 2850378, KIC 11197517

of the superflare stars and thus the total bolometric flare energy would be larger) and the S index (as the light entering the fibre would likely be contaminated and the observed emission in the H and K lines would therefore be relatively small).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, we do not have any prime indications that these stars are contaminated by background stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the spectra did not show any signs of binarity or artefacts, so although these three superflare stars with low S index are hard to explain with any of the proposed scenarios, we do not find any observational bias that can remove them from the sample population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low activity of these three stars could indicate that these stars are in a grand activity minimum, similar to what the Sun went through during the Maunder Minimum63, but the observations at hand do not allow us to confirm or reject this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as discussed above, the explanation could also be that at least KIC 11197517 and KIC 11241343 have evolved off the main-sequence, based on the updated surface gravities from Huber et al.59', 'The magnetic flux density', 'Notsu et al.31

the magnetic fluxes calculated from the Subaru observations generally seem to be larger than the magnetic fluxes calculated from LAMOST observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for this could be that

Sun-like stars with magnetic activity levels similar to the Sun, one should be very careful with such analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason is that Kepler would not be able to measure the rotation period of the Sun, as sunspots have lifetimes much shorter than the rotation period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can therefore not assume that the stars that do not show rotational modulation in the Kepler observations rotate as slow or slower than the Sun.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could also be that the reason why we cannot see any rotational modulation in the Kepler observations is because the starspots of

measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we use the slope of 2.62 to estimate the likelihood of the Sun hosting a superflare, we therefore implicitly assume that the Suns chromospheric emission does not change dramatically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the Sun, on the other hand, is capable of producing the large () spot suggested by Shibata et al.13, then this assumption is likely violated, as the

possibility that the observed superflares do not originate from the stars we assigned them to, but from background stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This problem was discussed by Balona66, who used an analysis
