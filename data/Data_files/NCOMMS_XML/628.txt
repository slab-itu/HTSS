Neutralization mechanism of a highly potent antibody against Zika virus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV), which causes microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, signals an urgency to identify therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent efforts to rescreen dengue virus human antibodies for ZIKV cross-neutralization activity showed antibody C10 as one of the most potent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the ability of the antibody to block fusion, we determined the cryoEM structures of the C10-ZIKV complex at pH levels mimicking the extracellular (pH8.0), early (pH6.5) and late endosomal (pH5.0) environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 4.0 Å resolution pH8.0 complex structure shows that the antibody binds to E proteins residues at the intra-dimer interface, and the virus quaternary structure-dependent inter-dimer and inter-raft interfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At pH6.5, antibody C10 locks all virus surface E proteins, and at pH5.0, it locks the E protein raft structure, suggesting that it prevents the structural rearrangement of the E proteins during the fusion eventa vital step for infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests antibody C10 could be a good therapeutic candidate.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Zika virus1 (ZIKV) is a member of the flavivirus genus that includes dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV cryoEM structures2,3 show its surface proteins (envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins) are organized similar to DENV4 except with a tighter packing, making the virus more thermally stable2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The virus surface consists of 180 copies of E protein2 arranged in icosahedral symmetry with 60 asymmetric units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each asymmetric unit, there are three individual E proteins  molecules A, B and C. The E proteins exist as dimers; three dimers lie parallel to each other forming a raft containing two asymmetric units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are in total 30 rafts arranged in a herringbone pattern on the virus surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An E protein contains three domainsDI, DII and DIII5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known for other flaviviruses that DIII contains the receptor-binding site and plays an important role in fusion of the virus with the endosomal membrane during cell entry6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tip of DII contains a fusion loop that interacts with the endosomal membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DI is the central domain linking DII and DIII together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DI-DII hinge is highly flexible allowing DII to expose its fusion loop during the fusion event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DI-DIII hinge was thought to be more rigid but it was observed to change in conformation in the post-fusion E protein trimeric structure6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fusion event is hypothesized to occur in this sequence: (1) virus E protein binds to cell receptors, (2) it is endocytosed, (3) the low pH environment of the endosome causes the E proteins to flip up exposing their fusion loops, allowing them to interact with the endosomal membrane, (4) the E proteins rearrange to trimeric structures, (5) the DIIIs of the E protein trimers change in conformation twisting the trimers leading to the fusion of viral membrane with the endosomal membrane, before the release of the viral genome into cell cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The recent explosion of the number of ZIKV cases, together with the association of ZIKV with the development of microcephaly in fetuses8 and Guillian-Barré syndrome in adults9, ignite a pressing need for the development of therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently there are no published human monoclonal antibodies (HMAb) generated against ZIKV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To hasten the process of therapeutics development, DENV HMAbs were rescreened10,11,12 for those that cross-neutralize ZIKV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One group of antibodies has recently been shown to be highly neutralizing to ZIKVthe envelope dimer epitope binding antibodies10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these HMAbs, C10 is one of the most potent plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50=0.024 g ml1), as demonstrated recently in ZIKV infected cell culture11,13 and mouse model13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it can prevent antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of ZIKV infection in myeloid cells induced by dengue human sera10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this ADE model, the myeloid cells are mostly resistant to direct ZIKV infection, suggesting that its specific receptor is lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When sub-neutralizing concentrations of dengue human serum was added to ZIKV, cell infection was enhanced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because antibodies, which are attached to ZIKV, bind to the Fc receptor on myeloid cells thus bypassing the need for ZIKV to directly interact with its specific receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When HMAb C10 is added to this mixture, it neutralizes the ADE effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since HMAb C10 is also an antibody that would likely facilitate attachment to Fc receptor on myeloid cells, it likely neutralizes the virus at a post-attachment step of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated the ability of Fab C10 to prevent virus surface protein rearrangement during fusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed Fab C10 is able to lock the entire virus surface at pH6.5, and at pH5.0, the E protein raft thereby preventing structural rearrangement necessary for fusion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The ZIKV-C10 complex intra-dimer epitope is located on the DII (at and around the fusion loop) on one E protein and on DIII and DI of the other E protein in the dimer (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A plot of electrostatic charges of interacting residues on the E protein intra-dimer epitope and the Fab paratope showed complementary charges (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison with the previously published crystal structure of DENV recombinant E protein dimer complexed with Fab C10 (ref .14) (Supplementary Fig 6b) shows their epitopes largely overlap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved residues between ZIKV and DENV C10 intra-dimer epitope mainly cluster on DII near the fusion loop (Supplementary Fig 6a and b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a comparison of the C10 intra-dimer epitope to the crystal structures of other EDE antibodies, Fab C8 and A11 complexed with ZIKV recombinant E protein11 (Supplementary Fig 6c and d) shows overlapping epitopes, the C10 intra-dimer epitope spans a wider area covering larger parts of DI and DIII.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our cryoEM structure also shows the interactions of Fab C10 with other virus quaternary structure-dependent epitope at the inter-dimer or inter-raft interfaces which are not observed in the crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions result in the E proteins on virus surface being locked together and could be critical for its neutralization mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A comparison of the cryoEM maps of pH5.0 complex to the pH8.0 complex shows that the E protein layer has moved to a larger radius (Fig 4a), whereas the radii of the lipid bilayer membranes are similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pH5.0 complex cryoEM map was interpreted by fitting separately the Fab:A-C dimer and Fab:B-B dimer structures from the pH8.0 complex structure into their respective densities (Fig 2c, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the E proteins in an asymmetric unit of the pH5.0 and pH8.0 complex by superimposing their molecules A shows a slight shift (3.5 Å) between the B molecule with respect to the A-C dimer (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This motion has only slightly changed the distance of the interacting residues on the Fab with that on the E proteins at the inter-dimer interface (Supplementary Table 2) suggesting the Fab retains its binding capability across this interface at pH5.0 and thus the E proteins within the raft are locked by Fab C10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: The radial movement of the E protein rafts in the ZIKV-C10 complex structure at pH5.0 compared to pH8.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Comparison of a quarter of the cross-section of the pH8.0 and pH5.0 complex cryoEM maps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pH8.0 complex cryoEM map is low-pass filtered to look similar to pH5.0

radius.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Radial movement of A-C (top panel) and B-B (bottom panel) dimers in the pH5.0 complex structure compared to that at pH8.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Side views of the dimers at pH5.0

The E protein inter-raft interactions of the pH5.0 complex structure are disrupted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One E protein raft of the pH8.0 and pH5.0 complex structures is coloured in blue and red, respectively, other surrounding rafts in grey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the pH5.0 complex, the rafts are further apart from each other compared to the pH8.0 complex.Full size image', 'Comparing the pH8.0 and the pH5.0 complex structures (Fig 4b) shows that the maximum radial movement of the E protein outwards is at one end of the A-C dimer near the five-fold vertex (15 Å).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests the membrane associated stem regions of the E protein need not be fully extended (up to 65 Å in length) for this movement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sharp contrast, a previous study18 describing a very low resolution cryoEM map of a DIII-binding Fab E16:WNV complex at pH6.0 showed the E protein layer moved radially outwards by 60 Å, even though the E protein density was not interpretable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our pH5.0 complex structure here shows a smaller radial expansion of the E protein layer and therefore may be an even earlier event of fusion process involving the dissociation of the E protein layer from the lipid membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another low resolution cryoEM structure of antibody E104 complexed with DENV was shown to inhibit another stage of the fusion process, possibly the open trimeric E protein conformation19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely a step prior to the formation of the closed trimeric E protein structure6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the E protein raft structure stays mostly intact in the ZIKV-C10 pH5.0 complex structure, the inter-raft interactions are disrupted (Fig 4c), even though the Fab C10 in the pH8.0 complex structure forms inter-raft interactions at two sites (Fig 3a, Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A calculation of the E protein electrostatic charges at pH8.0, 6.5 and 5.0 at the intra-dimer, inter-dimer and inter-raft interfaces (Supplementary Fig 8) shows the residues becoming increasingly positively charged with decreasing pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that at pH5.0, the E proteins may have the tendencies to repel each other, consistent with the 2D class average of the uncomplexed ZIKV particles at pH5.0 (Fig 1 insets), showing that the compact E protein layer is disrupted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises a question of why the Fab inter-raft interaction in the pH5.0 complex structure is disrupted, whereas the inter-dimer interaction remains intact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that the two Fab molecules at the inter-raft interface (Fig 3a) identified in the pH8.0 complex structure may not form strong enough contacts to resist the large surface area of electrostatic repelling force at this interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, at the inter-dimer interface, the two Fabs in this region could still hold the dimers together, as the surface area of repelling force is much smaller.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All antibodies can cause ADE at some concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HMAb C10, similar to other potent antibodies, causes ADE at a much narrower range of concentrations compared to the other weakly neutralizing antibodies10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase the safety of HMAb C10 as a therapeutic antibody, its ability to cause ADE could be eliminated, by mutating its Fc region (LALA mutants) abolishing its interaction with the myeloid cells Fc receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flavivirus such as DENV has been shown to be able to use different receptors to gain entry into different cell types20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV may also behave the same, as it has been shown to bind to DC-SIGN and also TAM receptors22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since different parts of the E proteins interact with different receptors, it is unlikely that any single type of antibody could inhibit virus attachment to all cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ZIKV may also enter by ADE caused by pre-existing DENV antibodies in individuals, thus completely bypassing the need for virus to attach to a specific receptor for infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, regardless of how the virus gets into the cell, fusion is a vital step for productive infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This emphasizes the potential of HMAb C10 as a therapeutic agent, since it can prevent structural rearrangements necessary for virus-endosomal membrane fusion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
