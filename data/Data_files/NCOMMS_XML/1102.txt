Francisella requires dynamic type VI secretion system and ClpB to deliver effectors for phagosomal escape  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Francisella tularensis is an intracellular pathogen that causes the fatal zoonotic disease tularaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critical for its pathogenesis is the ability of the phagocytosed bacteria to escape into the cell cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, the bacteria use a non-canonical type VI secretion system (T6SS) encoded on the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that in F. novicida T6SS assembly initiates at the bacterial poles both in vitro and within infected macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T6SS dynamics and function depends on the general purpose ClpB unfoldase, which specifically colocalizes with contracted sheaths and is required for their disassembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T6SS assembly depends on iglF, iglG, iglI and iglJ, whereas pdpC, pdpD, pdpE and anmK are dispensable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, strains lacking pdpC and pdpD are unable to escape from phagosome, activate AIM2 inflammasome or cause disease in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that PdpC and PdpD are T6SS effectors involved in phagosome rupture.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Francisella tularensis is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes the zoonotic disease tularaemia in human and animal host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The severity of tularaemia varies depending on the route of infection and the type of strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Francisella tularensis subsp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tularensis is the most virulent strain and aerosol transmission of a few bacteria can cause lethal pneumonia in humans1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the low infectious dose and the severity of the infection, subsp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tularensis has been classified as Tier 1 select agent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The related strain Francisella tularensis subsp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  novicida (F. novicida) has in contrast low virulence in humans, but is highly virulent in mice and thus often used as a laboratory model for tularaemia2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathogenicity of both Francisella species is linked to their ability to replicate in the cytosol of phagocytes, such as macrophages or dendritic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After phagocytosis, the bacteria shortly reside within a membrane-bound phagosome, but subsequently disrupt the phagosomal membrane and escape into the host cell cytosol, where they replicate3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While phagosomal escape is essential for Francisella intracellular replication and virulence in vivo, it also allows the host to mount anti-microbial and innate immune defenses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these are the production of type I interferons (type I IFNs) via the cGAS-STING-IRF3 axis, the production of antimicrobial guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) and the activation of the AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasome, which controls the release of mature IL-1 and IL-18 as well as the induction of host cell death through pyroptosis4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interferon production and inflammasome activation require the recognition of bacterial DNA in the cytosol, and have been linked to the lysis of cytosolic Francisella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice deficient in these responses fail to control bacterial replication, resulting in a fatal disease4,5,6,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Francisella virulence and the escape from the phagosomal compartment requires a gene cluster referred to as the Francisella Pathogenicity Island (FPI)12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two nearly identical copies of the FPI are found in subspecies tularensis, holarctica and mediasiatica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The F. novicida genome contains only a single FPI copy13, but features a related island called Francisella novicida Island (FNI)14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FPI has been suggested to encode a non-canonical type VI secretion system (T6SS)16,17, which based on gene content and phylogeny is proposed to represent a unique T6SS subtype (T6SSii)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'T6SS is a nanomachine capable of delivery of effector proteins across target cell membranes of both bacterial and eukaryotic cells and thus is often required for bacterial competition and pathogenesis19,20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the hallmarks of this system is its highly dynamic assembly that can be visualized by live-cell fluorescence microscopy24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assembly of T6SS starts by formation of a membrane complex formed of TssJ, TssL and TssM26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is followed by assembly of a baseplate complex from TssE, TssF, TssG, TssK and also VgrG, PAAR spike as well as TssA in some organisms27,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseplate complex then initiates assembly of a long Hcp tube and TssB, TssC (or VipA, VipB) sheath wrapped around the tube32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both spike and Hcp tube can associate with effectors and are delivered together into target cells upon rapid sheath contraction33,34,35,36,37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Even though the F. novicida sheath is structurally similar to the sheath of canonical T6SS of V. cholerae40,41, it is unclear to what extent the canonical T6SS assembly mechanisms apply to Francisella.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason is that Francisella T6SS is highly divergent and clear homologues of several core components are missing, such as TssE, TssF and TssG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, many components such as TssK, VgrG, Hcp and PAAR have only low primary sequence homology to the canonical T6SS components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, IglG was recently shown to be structurally similar to PAAR proteins, which are required for T6SS function15,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the FPI cluster contains many genes of unknown function, such as iglF, iglI, iglJ, pdpA, pdpC, pdpE, pdpD and anmK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PdpA, PdpC and PdpD were identified by mass-spectrometry as secreted by Francisella T6SS and PdpC/PdpD were proposed to be effectors required for phagosomal escape, intracellular growth and virulence42,43,44,45,46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the FPI cluster lacks a homologue of an unfoldase ClpV, which is present in all canonical T6SS clusters and recycles contracted sheaths14,24,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the non-canonical gene composition suggests a unique mode of action of the Francisella T6SS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that F. novicida T6SS sheath cycles between assembly, contraction and disassembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the vast majority of T6SS sheath assemblies initiate close or at the cell pole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that ClpB colocalizes with contracted sheaths and is required for sheath disassembly, however, is dispensable for sheath assembly and contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T6SS dynamics and function depends on iglF, iglG, iglI and iglJ, while pdpC and pdpD are specifically required for phagosomal escape and virulence in a mouse model of tularaemia, but also for the engagement of the host innate immune response.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Francisella T6SS is dynamic and assembles on the cell pole', 'Francisella T6SS has a non-canonical gene composition and lacks ClpV suggesting unique mode of action (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand Francisella T6SS assembly and function, we searched for conditions that would allow us to image subcellular localization of TssB homologue IglA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have serendipitously discovered that F. novicida iglA-sfGFP grown to an exponential phase in BHI media induced expression of IglA-sfGFP upon prolonged incubation on an agarose pad under a glass coverslip.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the increase in expression correlated with an increase in number of IglA-sfGFP structures detected in the bacteria (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Time-lapse imaging at a rate of 20 frames per minute showed that IglA-sfGFP structures extended across the bacteria within 30 and 120 s with assembly speeds between 5 and 15 nm s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After full assembly, the IglA-sfGFP structures immediately contracted to approximately half of their original length and became brighter (Fig 2c; Supplementary Fig 1a; Supplementary Movies 1 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After contraction, the sheath structures were disassembled during the next 23 min (Fig 2c; Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average fluorescence intensity of the bacteria before and after one cycle of assembly, contraction and disassembly was similar, suggesting that IglA-sfGFP remained stable and folded during this cycle (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, no IglA-sfGFP structures were detected in the bacteria lacking the TssM homologue encoded by pdpB (Fig 1), suggesting that assembly of IglA-sfGFP structures is dependent on the function of the whole T6SS (Fig 2d; Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dynamics of IglA-sfGFP localization is similar to that of VipA-sfGFP in V. cholerae and is consistent with the fact that IglA and IglB form a structure closely resembling V. cholerae T6SS sheath25,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: A schematic overview of Francisella T6SS genes.Assignments for gene functions are based on previous studies cited in the main text and our observations: Blackstructural components;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We show here that Francisella T6SS sheath is under certain conditions highly dynamic and ClpB is necessary for sheath disassembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since ClpB-mCherry2 specifically colocalizes with the contracted sheaths, our data suggest that ClpB is directly involved in Francisella sheath disassembly similarly to ClpV in canonical T6SS (refs 24, 49, 50, 56, 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Francisella ClpB was also shown to alter the immune response in vivo58 and to be required for heat shock survival52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we show here that T6SS activity is dispensable for heat shock survival (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that, in contrast to canonical T6SS where ClpV is apparently solely dedicated to sheath disassembly, Francisella ClpB has a dual role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the question how ClpB recognizes different substrates and whether a specific adaptor protein is required to recognize contracted sheaths similarly to adaptor proteins that recognize substrates for AAA+-mediated unfolding59,60,61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that ClpB is important for F. novicida virulence, which is consistent with what was shown previously52,53,54,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since all virulence related phenotypes of clpB-negative strain correlated with the phenotypes of the other strains with impaired T6SS dynamics (Fig 3; Supplementary Figs 2 and 3), we propose that in vivo ClpB is mainly important for T6SS sheath disassembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, refolding of substrates unrelated to T6SS may be required to survive certain stresses, which Francisella encounter during pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Detailed analysis of subcellular localization of dynamic T6SS sheath shows that Francisella T6SS assembles on the bacterial cell poles both in vitro as well as during infection of macrophages (Figs 2e,f and 3c; Supplementary Fig 5e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, similarly to what we show here for Francisella, ClpV-5 from T6SS-5 of Burkholderia thailandensis was found to preferentially localize to spots on bacterial poles63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those spots were however less dynamic than ClpB spots in Francisella and thus it remains to be directly tested if assembly of T6SS-5 of B. thailandensis indeed initiates at the poles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, both T6SS-5 of B. thailandensis and Francisella T6SS are required for manipulation of the eukaryotic cells after bacterial internalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike in Francisella, T6SS-5 of B. thailandensis is only required for formation of multinucleated giant cells after bacteria escape from endosomes using T3SS63,64,65,66,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since T6SS sheaths almost always assemble as long as the bacteria, one possible advantage of the polar localization could be that the sheaths assembled from the pole in rod shaped bacteria would be generally longer than the sheaths assembled from the side of the cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the T6SS sheaths only contract to about half of their extended size25, longer sheaths may increase the distance to which T6SS can deliver effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, restricted subcellular localization was shown to decrease T6SS efficiency in inter-bacterial competitions despite increased overall activity51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since F. novicida is completely surrounded by phagosome membrane, restricted directionality of T6SS assembly should have no consequences for delivery of effectors to the host cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, polar localization of T6SS may increase chances of puncturing phagosomal membranes, as those may be physically closer to the bacterial poles when bacteria are in a tight membrane compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As it was shown previously for inter-bacterial interactions, proper aiming of the T6SS apparatus at the target bacteria increases efficiency of substrate translocation37,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The primary function of the Francisella T6SS is to promote the escape of Francisella from the phagosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that phagosome escape depends entirely on PdpC and PdpD, which are dispensable for T6SS assembly and dynamics (Fig 6a,b; Supplementary Movie 1), suggesting that these proteins function as effectors necessary for phagosomal escape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that PdpD and PdpC are required for activity or secretion of yet uncharacterized T6SS effectors to promote phagosomal escape, however previous work by Eshraghi et al.42 has shown that F. novicida PdpC and PdpD are released by the T6SS in an in vitro secretion assay, supporting the hypothesis that these proteins function as secreted effectors in the target cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, F. tularensis and F. holarctica lacking pdpC are unable to escape from the phagosome, induce cytotoxicity and replicate intracellularly, and they are avirulent in a mouse model of tularaemia43,44,46,47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations support our conclusions that PdpC contribute to Francisella virulence, independent of the Francisella tularensis subspecies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas pdpC is conserved in all subspecies of Francisella tularensis, pdpD is differentially encoded45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, PdpD might have subspecies-specific virulence related functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PdpC and PdpD share no homology with known effectors or pore forming toxins, such as Listeriolysin O, type C phospholipases or phenol-soluble modulins, that allow other cytosolic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, Burkholderia thailandensis or Staphylococcus aureus) to escape from the phagosome, and thus might represent a novel class of effectors with membranolytic function68,69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact mechanism of how these effectors destabilize the phagosomal membrane and if this results in the recruitment of galectin-8, a marker of ruptured vacuoles that recruits antimicrobial autophagy70, remains to be analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Francisella O-antigen allows the bacteria to avoid ubiquitination and uptake into LC3-positive compartments71, but whether Francisella can actively inhibit or escape autophagy by injected effectors, as reported for Listeria and Shigella is unknown72.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PdpE and AnmK, which are dispensable for T6SS assembly and phagosomal escape (Fig 6a,b), might be effectors whose function is required once the bacteria enter the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their contribution to overall bacterial replication and virulence in vivo is minor (Fig 6d,e; Supplementary Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, OpiA and OpiB, encoded outside of the FPI cluster, were recently identified as T6SS secreted proteins, however, their contribution to intracellular replication is also minimal in comparison to the effects of a pdpC or pdpD deletion42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that these effectors have tissue-specific functions, or that they are required for Francisella replication in amoeba or within arthropod hosts73,74.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Live-cell imaging of T6SS sheath dynamics suggests that IglF, IglG, IglI and IglJ are putative structural components required for T6SS assembly in Francisella (Fig 5a; Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins could be homologues of components of canonical T6SS baseplate, which are difficult to identify using homology modelling14,75 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is also conceivable that some of these proteins may be secreted effectors or be required for effector secretion, because deletion of certain effectors decreases T6SS function in V. cholerae37,76.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our finding that the dynamics of Francisella T6SS is possible to image in vitro will help to dissect the assembly of this non-canonical T6SS and to differentiate between structural components and translocated substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis of the structural components will reveal principles of T6SS evolution and defining the molecular mechanisms by which Francisella effectors modulate host cell signalling will significantly contribute to our understanding of Francisella virulence.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
