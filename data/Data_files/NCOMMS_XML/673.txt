IL-12 protects from psoriasiform skin inflammation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Neutralization of the common p40-subunit of IL-12/23 in psoriasis patients has led to a breakthrough in the management of moderate to severe disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aside from neutralizing IL-23, which is thought to be responsible for the curative effect, anti-p40 therapy also interferes with IL-12 signalling and type 1 immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we dissect the individual contribution of these two cytokines to the formation of psoriatic lesions and understand the effect of therapeutic co-targeting of IL-12 and IL-23 in psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a preclinical model for psoriatic plaque formation we show that IL-12, in contrast to IL-23, has a regulatory function by restraining the invasion of an IL-17-committed T (T17) cell subset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discover that IL-12 receptor signalling in keratinocytes initiates a protective transcriptional programme that limits skin inflammation, suggesting that collateral targeting of IL-12 by anti-p40 monoclonal antibodies is counterproductive in the therapy of psoriasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory skin disease that develops in genetically predisposed individuals after an unknown initial environmental, pathogenic or internal trigger.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is characterized by thickened epidermis (acanthosis), a result of keratinocyte hyper-proliferation, dysregulated keratinocyte differentiation (for example, parakeratosis), increased vascularity and accumulation of inflammatory infiltrates of T cells, neutrophils and dendritic cells1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As T helper (TH)-17, TH22 and TH1 cells are found in psoriatic lesions2, current understanding of the disease pathogenicity proposes a model in which activated dendritic cells and macrophages express IL-12 and IL-23, which polarize autoreactive T cells into their subsequent effector phenotype3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As IL-12 and IL-23 are detected in psoriatic lesions4,5, targeting both cytokines concomitantly (through neutralization of the common IL-12/23p40 subunit) may have a synergistic therapeutic effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, two anti-IL-12/23p40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; ustekinumab and briakinumab) have been effective in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris, and ustekinumab is now registered for clinical use6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, data from mouse models as well as clinical studies demonstrates the IL-23/IL-17 axis to be the dominant pathway in the pathogenesis of the disease10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repeated intradermal injections of IL-23 in mice led to development of a psoriasiform inflammatory phenotype11, and IL-23-driven effector cytokines, IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22, have been described as important factors in psoriatic plaque formation12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, genome-wide associated studies point at several genes of the IL-23 pathway, such as IL23R, IL12b and IL23a, as risk factors for psoriasis14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although TH17 cells are implicated as effector cells in psoriasis, data generated in the Aldara-induced psoriatic plaque formation model show that psoriatic lesion development can be independent of T cells, but relies on the activity of a specific subset of T17 cells discriminated by their V4+ T-cell receptor (TCR) (nomenclature according to Heilig and Tonegawa)15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In concert with type 3 innate lymphoid cells, T cells are the major source of IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 in the inflamed skin16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Innate-like lymphocytes constitutively express high levels of the IL-23 receptor12,17, making them immediate responders to IL-23 and therefore suggesting a potential role in lesion formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-17A-neutralizing antibodies ixekizumab and secukinumab, as well as an IL-17A receptor-blocking antibody, brodalumab, have successfully been tested in psoriasis patients18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First published results showed strong clinical improvement and strengthen the notion that the IL-23/IL-17 axis is essential in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a clinical study on anti-IL-23p19 mAb (guselkumab) confirmed a pathogenic role for de-regulated IL-23 in psoriasis21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whereas IL-23p19 and IL-23p40 transcripts have been shown to be increased in psoriatic lesions, IL-12p35 was not22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-12 and IL-23 are structurally related and mainly expressed by activated dendritic cells and macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their similarities, both cytokines trigger vastly divergent immunological pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-12 is an important factor for the differentiation of naive T cells into interferon- (IFN-)-producing TH1 cells, whereas IL-23 plays a role in sustenance of TH17 responses23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that neutralization of IL-12 leads to the amelioration of psoriasis-like skin disorder in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the antibody used was targeting the common p40 subunit, thus neutralizing both IL-12 and IL-23 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The therapeutic activity of the p40-specific antibody is possibly due to the inhibition of IL-23 signalling pathway and not IL-12 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the presence of IL-12 and IL-12-induced factors has been reported in human psoriatic lesions, which suggests their potential involvement in disease pathology27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The collateral inhibition of IL-12 and its potential affect on psoriasis is currently under discussion, but the actual contribution of IL-12 to the formation of psoriasiform lesions has never been addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical studies suggest a superior efficacy through neutralization of the IL-23/IL-17 axis over blockade of IL-12/23p40 (refs 29, 30, 31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The aim of this study is to compare the individual roles of IL-12 and IL-23 in the pathophysiology of psoriatic plaque formation in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that IL-12 opposes the pathogenic function of IL-23 in psoriatic plaque formation by signalling to the local stroma thereby restricting the cellular niche for type 17 T-cell accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings correct the prevailing view that IL-12 serves a primarily pro-psoriatic function during psoriatic plaque formation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Divergent roles of IL-12 and IL-23 in psoriatic inflammation', 'Equally to the human disease, psoriatic lesions induced by topical Aldara treatment of mice can be reduced by application of neutralizing anti-p40 mAbs16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Psoriatic plaque formation is also greatly decreased in mice deficient in p40 (Il12b/) (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, critical markers of psoriasiform inflammation in this model, such as neutrophil invasion and the accumulation of IL-17A-secreting V4+ T cells in the lesions were reduced (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clarify the individual contributions of IL-12 and IL-23 to plaque formation we monitored the clinical disease course in mice deficient in the subunit specific to IL-12 (p35, Il12a/), its receptor (Il12rb2/) and IL-23 (p19, Il23a/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas IL-12 is critical for type 1 immune responses, which in turn are thought to contribute to plaque formation, Il12a/ mice (unaltered IL-23 signalling) developed significantly more severe inflammation compared with wild-type (WT) mice (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice lacking the IL-12-specific receptor subunit (Il12rb2/), likewise, developed more severe lesions (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 1), pointing towards a regulatory role of IL-12 in psoriasiform lesion formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, when we compared the skin pathology of IL-23-deficient mice, Il12b/ (lacking IL-12 and IL-23) and Il23a/ (only lacking IL-23), we also observed a trend towards a protective effect of IL-12 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Psoriatic plaque formation in Aldara-treated IL-12- and IL-23-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) WT, Il12a/, Il23a/ and Il12rb2/ mice were treated with Aldara for 6 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Back skin lesions during peak disease (day 4) represented as per cent change in skin thickness compared with untreated skin on day 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cumulative representation of (a) four independent experiments, (n=12 per WT, 13 per Il12a/ and 7 per Il23a/, average mean±s.e.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and (b) nine independent experiments (n=26 per WT and 27 per Il12rb2/, average mean±s.e.m.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Representative photos taken on day 3 post Aldara treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Measurement of TEWL in Aldara-treated back skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cumulative graph of four independent experiments (n=9 per WT and 10 per Il12rb2/, average mean±s.e.m.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Back skin sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin on day 4 post treatment; scale bar, 200 m.

(b) enhanced uniformly between the genetic groups (cluster 3); and (c) differentially regulated between the genetic groups (clusters 1, 2 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes related to general cell metabolism and cell cycle (cluster 3) were hardly affected by IL-12 signalling in keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Processes related to type 17 inflammation are drastically enhanced in the absence of IL-12 receptor (enriched in cluster 4;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Treatment of most chronic inflammatory diseases used to imply broad immunosuppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the treatment of plaque-like psoriasis this has categorically changed in the last 10 years, as we are currently experiencing a rapid evolution of cytokine-blocking drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial milestone achievement was blocking of TNF, set-up to counter a number of different auto-inflammatory disorders, psoriasis being one of them51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst effective, drug-induced TNF depletion retains to some extend the disadvantage of former approaches of a generalized immunosuppression, as well as a quota of one-third of eventual non-responders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A critical step towards better therapeutic specificity was led by early preclinical data showing that targeting of IL-12p40 successfully prevents or curbs pathology in numerous models of chronic inflammatory disease, which resulted in the development of neutralizing mAbs for clinical application25,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shortly after the discovery of IL-23 in 2003, however, it became apparent that the anti-p40 therapeutic approach inadvertently counteracted two major inflammatory pathways in parallel, IL-12 and IL-23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predominant role of IL-23 in the pathogenesis of some chronic inflammatory disease, which was formerly claimed by IL-12, was first discovered in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) a disease model for multiple sclerosis53,54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, anti-p40 mAb therapy performed with unprecedented efficacy in treatment of plaque-like psoriasis for which it became FDA approved in 2009 (ustekinumab).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the treatment of psoriasis there is an on-going effort to increase the focus on the blockade of the type 17 inflammatory response, for example, by inhibition of IL-23p19 (refs 21, 56) or IL-17 (refs 18, 19, 20), which in recent clinical trials exhibiting even higher efficacy than ustekinumab30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As predicted from the findings in preclinical models, all clinical data available to date point towards a particularly monomorphic patho-mechanism behind psoriatic plaque formation dominated by an unrestrained IL-23/17 effector response in the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequentially, it seems that blocking IL-23 or even single IL-23 downstream effector molecules should be sufficient to effectively treat psoriatic lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, at present, anti-p40, inhibiting IL-12 and IL-23 signalling, is applied as standard care (ustekinumab) for moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris in adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therapeutic blocking of IL-12/23p40 is well studied, and corresponding indications have been monitored in the clinical studies of the two anti-p40 mAbs, ustekinumab and briakinumab57,58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken the long-term treatment perspective of those patients and in general the delicate line between beneficial immune-modulation and detrimental immunosuppression it is imperative to delineate all aspects of the drugs biological effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One concern of particular importance, considering the continuous treatment regime in psoriasis, is the prominent role of IL-12 in tumour control60,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, briakinumab, although very effective and overall positively evaluated, showed a conspicuously increased rate of cancer in different clinical studies6,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, it was hypothesized that blocking of IL-12 could extend the drugs anti-inflammatory effectiveness, as presence of TH1 cells and IFN- in psoriatic lesions has been reported27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But data on a causal relationship of either IL-12 or IFN- and psoriasis wasuntil nowmissing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time data presented from past and on-going comparative clinical studies of mAbs targeting solely the IL-23/IL-17 axis versus the share subunit of IL-23 and IL-12 attested a higher efficacy to the formed approach29,30, which is in conflict with the notion of a dominant pro-psoriatic role of IL-12 in the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concordant with the correlative data from patient skin biopsies we found IFN- to be produced within the Aldara-induced psoriatic lesions (data not shown) and confirmed the pro-psoriatic function of IFN-.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we found IL-12, which generally drives type 1 immune responses, to not only act independent of IFN-, but instead to suppress inflammation in the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although surprising at first sight, a protective role of IL-12 in an inflammatory condition has been observed in other tissues, for example, in organ-specific autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There, likewise to the clinical findings in our psoriasis model, IL-12 restrains part of the inflammatory response53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in EAE a dual role of IL-12 is debated, as type 1 immunity is partially considered to be instrumental in disease progression and central nervous system pathology, but on the other hand the net effect of IL-12 is clearly anti-inflammatory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanistic underpinning of this in EAE, however, remains largely unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is only in the past few years that the significant contribution of T cells in type 17-driven diseases has been explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in psoriatic lesions their contribution has been noted12,63,64,65, but the precise nature of their action in human inflammatory disease, as well as the translation of functional T cell subset identities remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Invariant T cells, like any innate lymphoid cell type, are low in frequency and their analysis in humans is hampered by the typically small sizes of tissue biopsies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the data available to date it is hard to predict whether a homologue or functional orthologue of V6+ T17 cells exists in humans and if accumulation of such cells is affected by IL-12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice, the presence of IL-12 prevents the unbridled accumulation of V6+ type 17 cells, independent of V4+ T17 cells, resulting in a net surplus of IL-17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, IL-12 did not affect skin-invading T17 cells directly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whereas TNF or IL-1 have long been recognized to interact with both haematopoietic and stromal cells, here we describe that IL-12 too can directly communicate with the stromal microenvironment, independent of its function in immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to mediators such as TNF or IL-1, which exacerbate epithelial inflammation66, IL-12 initiates a tissue-protective response in keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, IL-12 counter-regulated the psoriatic transcriptional signature in both murine and human keratinocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IL-12 specifically modifies transcriptional programmes affecting tissue structure remodelling, which in turn could affect immune cell accumulation and recruitment allowing available pathogenic lymphocytes to populate the tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Aldara-induced psoriasis model, the cells accumulating in IL-12-deficient tissue are predominantly V6+ type 17 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in net IL-17 activates the local stroma (for example, keratinocytes) amplifying the type 17 signature in the tissue, which can explain the drastic increase in neutrophil influx and epidermal micro-abscesses in Il12a/ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, while our data causally relate psoriasis to be a bona fide type 17 inflammatory disorder with minor contribution of type 1 effector response, we additionally demonstrate that IL-12 mediates an autonomous regulatory programme in the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether these preclinical findings can be fully translated to human patients remains to be established, however, it does offer a lead towards understanding the higher clinical efficacy of anti-p19 and anti-IL-17 drugs compared with ustekinumab (anti-p40) in psoriasis vulgaris patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed anti-psoriatic effect of IL-12 may not be exclusively mediated through its impact on the keratinocyte compartment, and additional IL-12-responsive cell types may contribute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, we conclude that collateral targeting of IL-12 with anti-p40 mAbs in the treatment of psoriasis might carry more risk than benefit and even be counterproductive, which warrants further translational investigation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
