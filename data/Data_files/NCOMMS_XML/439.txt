Intermolecular biparatopic trapping of ErbB2 prevents compensatory activation of PI3K/AKT via RASp110 crosstalk  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Compensatory mechanisms, such as relief of AKT-ErbB3-negative feedback, are known to desensitize ErbB2-dependent tumours to targeted therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe an adaptation mechanism leading to reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway during trastuzumab treatment, which occurs independently of ErbB3 re-phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signalling bypass of phospho-ErbB3 operates in ErbB2-overexpressing cells via RAS-PI3K crosstalk and is attributable to active ErbB2 homodimers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated by dual blockade of ErbB2/RAS and ErbB3 by means of pharmacological inhibition, RNA interference or by specific protein binders obstructing the RASp110 interaction, both routes must be blocked to prevent reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying these general principles, we developed biparatopic designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) trapping ErbB2 in a dimerization-incompetent state, which entail pan-ErbB inhibition and a permanent OFF state in the oncogenic signalling, thereby triggering extensive apoptosis in ErbB2-addicted tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these novel insights into mechanisms underlying network robustness provide a guide for overcoming adaptation response to ErbB2/ErbB3-targeted therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (ErbB2/HER2/neu) is an orphan receptor adopting a constitutively extended conformation, which serves as preferred heterodimerization partner for the ligand-activated receptors of the ErbB family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physiological function of this non-autonomous co-receptor is thus to act primarily as an amplifier of ErbB signalling1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, under the conditions of pathological overexpression of ErbB2, as it occurs in 20% of invasive breast cancer and, to a lesser extent, in gastric or ovarian cancers2, ErbB2 drives tumorigenesis by spontaneously forming signalling-competent homodimers, ligand-independent heterodimers with ErbB3 as well as larger receptor clusters3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As for many other signalling, genetic or metabolic networks, the ErbB network displays two steady states, that is, bistability, with ligands transiently switching it from the OFF to the ON state1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the pathological ERBB2 amplification maintains ErbB signalling constitutively active, thereby fixing the ON state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, scale-free networks frequently evolve reliance on few highly connected nodes, entailing increased system fragility, as blockade of these central hubs may cause the entire network to fail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since malignant diseases efficiently hijack key regulatory elements of the host networks, these essential hubs can consequently become their Achilles heels7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a vulnerability of cancer cells, also referred to as oncogene addiction, may thus provide valuable opportunity for targeted therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In fact, knockdown of ERBB2 expression triggers apoptosis in ErbB2-addicted breast cancer cells, while barely having an effect on cells that do not overexpress this gene8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogously, blockade of the canonical PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway by small-molecule inhibitors elicits apoptosis in ErbB2-overexpressing tumour cells that become addicted also to PI3K signalling, as it conveys proliferation and survival signals downstream of ErbB2/3 receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, activating PIK3CA mutations make the tumours refractory to ErbB2-targeted therapy, and the response may be restored by co-inhibition of PI3K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the possibility to induce tumour cell death by incapacitating critical nodes of the oncogenic network provides a strong rationale for targeting the ErbB2/3 oncogenic unit and the downstream signalling in ErbB2-addicted tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nevertheless, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for ErbB2 target only few epitopes and show rather poor clinical efficacy in overall long-term survival even as part of combination therapy regimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The humanized mAb trastuzumab is directed against the membrane-proximal domain IV of ErbB2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It specifically inhibits the growth of breast cancer cell lines addicted to ErbB2, inducing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it was thought earlier that trastuzumab inhibits ErbB2 signalling, more recent studies have shown that trastuzumab does not decrease ErbB2 phosphorylation10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, other conceivable mechanisms, such as dissociation of the ligand-independent ErbB2ErbB3 heterodimers and consequently dephosphorylation of ErbB3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3), are a likely component of the enigmatic mode of action of trastuzumab in ErbB2-overexpressing tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another approved ErbB2-binding antibody, pertuzumab, binds adjacent to the domain II dimerization arm, thereby disturbing the heterodimerization of ErbB2 with the other ligand-bound epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pertuzumab thus abrogates solely the ligand-stimulated growth without affecting the proliferation of tumour cells driven by ErbB2 overexpression3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the antibodies neutralizing or locking ErbB3 in a tethered conformation have failed to raise a cytotoxic response in ErbB2-overexpressing tumours, even though ErbB3 is thought to be indispensable for ErbB2 oncogenic signalling12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, none of the therapeutic ErbB2/3-targeting mAbs can fully exploit the addiction to ErbB2 as a tumours fragile point for therapeutic intervention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from the moderate activity, multiple mechanisms of innate or acquired resistance have also been described that often neutralize the anti-tumour effect of trastuzumab15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acquired resistance arises due to permanent alterations such as PI3K-activating mutations16, PTEN loss17, expression of truncated ErbB2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15), or long-term adaptive changes comprising upregulated expression of ErbB family receptors, cognate RTKs, the respective ligands10, or activation of co-operating signaling proteins such as Src and CDCP1 (refs 18, 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A series of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) blocking the ErbB intracellular kinase domains have also been developed, comprising both reversible and irreversible inhibitors with specificity ranging from mono- or dual-specificity EGFR and ErbB2 inhibitors to broad-spectrum inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TKIs elicit stronger and faster biological responses in vitro than the highly specific yet less potent ErbB2-targeting antibodies5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these responses tend to be short-lived because of rapid emergence of adaptive resistance caused by the reactivation of ErbB3 signalling20,21 and, consequently, the rebound of AKT activity due to relief of a negative feedback loop with the downstream effector FoxO3a22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such phenomena resulting from the robustness of ErbB oncogenic signalling also translate to low clinical efficacy, as was illustrated by rather sobering data from clinical trials, demonstrating limited activity of lapatinib either as single agent or in combination with trastuzumab23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Therefore, other approaches comprising inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, as support of ErbB2 blockade, are currently being explored, showing encouraging results in preclinical models and ongoing clinical trials26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These approaches, based on understanding of the compensatory mechanisms, are aimed at preventing the emergence of resistance in tumours, which show an initial response to blockade of ErbB2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elucidation of the feedbacks and crosstalks within signalling pathways underlying the adaptive response thus hold promise to assist the development of new rational combination strategies with improved short-term clinical efficacy27 as well as long-term prevention of development of acquired resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, we describe yet another important adaptation mechanism operating in ErbB2-dependent tumour cells, which causes the reactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway even in the presence of de-phosphorylated ErbB3 receptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism of PI3K/AKT activation bypasses ErbB3 via crosstalk with the ErbB2-bound small-GTPase RAS, explaining the rapid desensitization to trastuzumab even in the absence of pathway-activating mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some compensatory mechanisms involving elevated expression of potent activators of RAS such as EGFR, IGF-1R or c-Met have been described15, thus anticipating a non-oncogenic function of RAS in mediating resistance to ErbB2 blockade, the mechanistic explanation is still overdue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide for the first time a direct signalling evidence linking RAS to evasion of apoptosis in ErbB2-dependent tumours, particularly under the conditions where ErbB2 does not become efficiently inhibited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Applying these new insights, we improved upon the traditional concepts of ErbB2 targeting by designing and mechanistically dissecting new biparatopic agents that trap ErbB2 in a dimerization-incompetent state thereby entailing the pan-ErbB inhibition in ErbB2-addicted tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This targeting approach was shown to disarm all compensatory mechanisms, resulting in apoptosis induction by enforcing the permanent OFF state in the ErbB2-driven oncogenic network.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We constructed biparatopic proteins which specifically bind to the ectodomain of ErbB2 (ErbB2_ECD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are composed of two designed ankyrin repeat proteins28 (DAPRins).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biparatopic DARPins with highest anti-tumour activity, referred to as 6L1G and 9L1H (Supplementary Experimental Procedures), were fusions of a subdomain I-binding DARPin29 followed by a subdomain IV-binding DARPin30, which are connected through a short (Gly4Ser) linker (called L1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal structures of the DARPins in complex with their target ErbB2 subdomain31 allowed detailed structural modelling, and together with binding analyses, revealed that both binding units are intermolecularly engaged in binding to two ErbB2 receptor molecules on the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a crosslinking of ErbB2 receptors by biparatopic DARPins was inferred to induce trapping of ErbB2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31), enforcing a geometry of the ErbB2_ECD that is incompatible with receptor dimerization or alternative associations, such as tetramers or higher oligomers6, as well as with trans-activation of receptor kinase domains32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By now dissecting the mechanism of action of these potent biparatopic agents as compared with ErbB2-targeting mAbs, we could elucidate compensatory responses upon blockade of ErbB2/ErbB3, which mediate adaptive resistance in ErbB2-overexpressing cancers towards mAb treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Apoptosis requires dephosphorylation of both ErbB2 and ErbB3', 'Since ErbB2 remained continuously expressed in a panel of breast cancer cell lines treated with either agent (Fig 1ac; Supplementary Fig 1A,B), and no substantial increase in internalization nor degradation of ErbB2 was observed (Supplementary Fig 1CF), we inspected the phosphostatus of ErbB2 as well as of ErbB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with biparatopic DARPins reduced p-ErbB2 levels, as indicated both by a decline of total p-Tyr content in immunoprecipitated ErbB2 (Fig 1a) and a progressive and uniform reduction of ErbB2 Tyr phosphorylation at specific tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail of ErbB2 (Y1139, Y1169, Y1221/1222 and Y1248) and kinase domain (Y877) (Fig 1b,c; Supplementary Fig 1A,B) of ErbB2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, and in agreement with previous findings3,10, the treatment with trastuzumab did not affect total p-ErbB2 level (Fig 1a) nor the individual p-Tyr sites (Fig 1b,c; Supplementary Fig 1A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the recruitment of p-Tyr-binding adaptor proteins such as Grb2, propagating the cell survival and proliferation signals was impaired by 6L1G but not by the rather ineffective trastuzumab.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Dynamic signalling responses to ErbB2 blockade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Biparatopic anti-ErbB2 DARPin (6L1G) inhibits phosphorylation of both ErbB2 and ErbB3 while trastuzumab (TZB) attenuates only p-ErbB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ErbB2-overexpressing cell lines were treated with 100 nM of 6L1G or TZB; ErbB2 or ErbB3 was immunoprecipitated and total phosphotyrosine content (p-Tyr) was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-IP analysis of Grb2 binding to ErbB2 is also shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Sustained inhibition of both AKT and ERK signalling pathways after 6L1G treatment versus transient decrease of p-AKT after 6 h of TZB treatment and consecutive p-AKT rebound after 72 h.

Supplementary Fig 1A,B), and in most ErbB2-depended cancer cells there was a permanent reduction of p-ErbB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slow re-phosphorylation of ErbB3 occurred solely in trastuzumab-treated SKBR3 cells (Fig 1d), possibly due to autocrine ligand activation as reported earlier10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, the dephosphorylation of ErbB3 resulting from ErbB2 blockade correlated with proliferation arrest, as seen for cytostatic compounds such as trastuzumab, whereas the induction of cell death also required a complete inhibition of ErbB2, as achieved by biparatopic DARPins (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sustained inhibition of AKT is prerequisite for apoptosis', 'As shown in Fig 1e, p-AKT level decreased rapidly upon treatment with 6L1G and trastuzumab, correlating with the fast dephosphorylation of ErbB3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, 6L1G caused more potent and, importantly, a sustained dephosphorylation of AKT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, trastuzumab induced a significant but transient AKT dephosphorylation, lasting up to 612 h in both BT474 and SKBR3 cells, and AKT became progressively re-phosphorylated thereafter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This p-AKT rebound occurred without re-phosphorylation of ErbB3 in most cell lines (Fig 1b), hinting to an additional upstream stimulus feeding into the AKT pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since ErbB2 and EGFR are known to signal to the ERK pathway, we carried out time course analyses of p-ERK in response to receptor blockade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1f, initiation of elevated p-ERK levelsnotably in the absence of any elevated p-ErbB2was detected 15 min after addition of trastuzumab or 6L1G.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying mechanism of this transient pulse is unclear, but it may be attributable to the suspended feedback regulation of RAF/MEK1/ERK leading to ERK stimulation, particularly in a low PTPase background34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, after 612 h of trastuzumab treatment, ERK phosphorylation returned to steady-state level in both BT474 and SKBR3 cells, while 6L1G further reduced the p-ERK level below the basal steady-state level, thus following the net decline of p-ErbB2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To assess the relative contributions of the AKT and ERK pathways as safeguards against apoptosis upon ErbB2 blockade, we used selective kinase inhibitors as depicted in Fig 1g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that AKT inhibition by MK2206, but not the MEK1/p-ERK inhibition by AZD6244, induced upregulation of ErbB3, again most likely by releasing the AKT-FoxO3a-ErbB3 negative feedback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1h,i and Supplementary Fig 1G, MK2206 exerted a cytostatic activity on BT474 cells, inducing G1 arrest without signs of apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the inhibition of AKT alone is not sufficient to elicit apoptosis in this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, inhibition of MEK1 by AZD6244 entirely failed to inhibit cell growth, but it enhanced significantly the anti-proliferative activity of MK2206.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, even the combination of the two inhibitors could not trigger a full apoptotic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a potent apoptotic response could be induced by combining MK2206 with trastuzumab, whereupon the p-ERK level remained normal (Fig 1g,i; Supplementary Fig 1G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the combination with AZD6244 did not enhance the activity of trastuzumab, probably due to the inability to prevent the p-AKT rebound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the ERK pathway exerts merely a modulatory function and other survival pathways must also operate under the control of ErbB2/3 oncogenic unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the sustained inhibition of AKT seems to be the prerequisite for eliciting apoptosis in ErbB2-overexpressing tumours and signifies the importance of preventing the p-AKT rebound for the potency of anti-ErbB2/ErbB3-targeting agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intermolecular trapping of ErbB2 elicits cytotoxic response', 'To assess the cytotoxic activity of biparatopic DARPins in vitro, we treated a panel of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines (BT474, HCC1419, HCC2218, SKBR3, AU565 and ZR75-30) with wild-type PI3K activity and a range of EGFR, ErbB3 and PTEN expression levels (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All cancer cell lines showed, without exception, the highest sensitivity to treatment with 6L1G and 9L1H, reflecting their cytotoxic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, application of trastuzumab resulted in an intermediate and highly variable cytostatic response, and pertuzumab only had minute effects on the growth of these refractory, ligand-independent ErbB2-overexpressing cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The qualitative differences between biparatopic DARPins and trastuzumab in the induction of cell death, as determined by clonogenic assays (Fig 2b), demonstrates the irreversible cancer cell damage inflicted solely by 6L1G or 9L1H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Induction of apoptosis upon trapping of ErbB2 by biparatopic agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Inhibition of proliferation of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines (XTT assay).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were treated for 96 h with 6L1G or 9L1H, non-binding DARPin control (OL1O), trastuzumab (TZB), pertuzumab (PZB) or PBS alone (mock);

conversely, the inhibition of Src alone or in combination with trastuzumab does not trigger apoptosis in the 3D tumour model and does not induce PARP cleavage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, Src inhibition does not reduce p-AKT nor prevents p-AKT rebound upon trastuzumab treatment in the models investigated here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In stark contrast, apoptosis also progressed in the presence of active Src under conditions of simultaneous RAS inhibition and an incomplete ErbB2 blockade (achieved by coincubation with tipifarnib and trastuzumab (Supplementary Fig 6A)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, expression of constitutively active Src did not lead to elevated p-AKT levels after the inhibition of ErbB3 and RAS by the trastuzumab/tipifarnib combination or by 6L1G (Supplementary Fig 6EG).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the Co-IP analysis of ErbB2Grb2 and ErbB2Src complexes under several treatment conditions revealed that Src inhibition did not affect integrity of the ErbB2Grb2 complexes and only had a small effect on the phosphorylation of ErbB2 (Supplementary Fig 6H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altogether, this argues for the existence of two distinct apoptotic programmes that are executed (i) upon complete ErbB2 blockade in ErbB2-addicted tumours and (ii) during anoikis in the development of normal mammary epithelium without ErbB2 addiction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter employs indeed primarily the Src/Erk/BIM axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in ErbB2-addicted tumours induction of apoptosis occurs independently of Src status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, as shown in this study, apoptosis necessitates complete and sustained blockade of the PI3K/AKT pathway for preventing p-AKT rebound, and thus requires an intervention at both the ErbB3/p85 and the ErbB2/RAS/p110 routes feeding into PI3K/AKT.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although trastuzumab- and TKI-treatment provide clinical benefit with respect to improved progression-free survival, the persisting problem in therapy is that even patients who initially respond to these substances invariably develop resistance while progressing towards advanced disease23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antagonistic monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases or intracellular pro-survival pathways can lower the apoptotic threshold and thus increase the tumour-specific cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, an effective treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast tumours necessitates strategies that not only rely on rapid induction of cell death, but also counter the tumour escape mechanisms leading to a long-term adaptation to the treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, such agents should ideally interfere with the multiple compensatory mechanisms that would otherwise minimize the drug potency by generating a new steady state of the oncogenic network27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By targeting two distinct epitopes of ErbB2 with appropriately designed biparatopic binding DARPins31 that completely disengage ErbB2 from its signalling network, we developed powerful agents with cytotoxic activity against ErbB2-addicted breast cancer cells and no measurable effects on normal cells with physiological ErbB2 levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cytotoxic activity was overall retained in cells with an additional p53 deficiency or low PTEN expression and even in cells bearing PIK3CA activating mutations, these biparatopic anti-ErbB2 agents still displayed significant anti-proliferative activity, although the pro-apoptotic activity has been significantly reduced, indicating the central role of PI3K/AKT pathway in mediating resistance to ErbB2 blockade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For optimal antitumor effects of therapeutic agents acting on overexpressed ErbB2, a sustained and complete inhibition of ErbB3 phosphorylation and the downstream signalling to PI3K/AKT is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of the relieved negative feedback loop operating in tumours with elevated PI3K/AKT signalling, however, there is typically upregulation and marked increase of ErbB3 in the plasma membrane, accompanied by re-phosphorylation of ErbB3 due to residual ErbB2 activity22,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ErbB3 signalling is buffered as long as inhibition of the ErbB2 kinase is incomplete, and this applies particularly to the small-molecule kinase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such adaptive capabilities of the ErbB oncogenic signalling network reveal fundamental limitations of monotherapy for inhibiting feedback-regulated pathways (Fig 10ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, alternative strategies are required to silence oncogenic ErbB2/3 signalling effectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 10: Model of induction of apoptosis and adaptive resistance in response to ErbB2 blockade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Overexpression of ErbB2 is sufficient to activate ErbB2 and ErbB3 in the absence of ligands and drives tumour growth predominantly via the ErbB2/ErbB3/PI3K/AKT signalling axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signalling route constitutively suppresses negative feedback regulation between AKT and ErbB3, which is however relieved upon blockade of ErbB2/3 receptors or the downstream signalling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Trastuzumab treatment induces partial ErbB2 blockade by selectively interfering with the ligand-independent ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimers, thereby uncoupling ErbB3 from PI3K/AKT reactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identified a novel adaptation response that emanates from ErbB2/RAS and bypasses ErbB3 for the activation of PI3K/AKT signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Biparatopic DARPins obstruct all ligand-dependent and ligand-independent complexes of ErbB2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a pan-ErbB2 inhibition blocks PI3K/AKT signalling cascade and consecutive adaptive responses, leading to a stable OFF state of the ErbB oncogenic network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, intrinsic apoptosis is induced which prevents emergence of adaptive resistance.Full size image', 'In the present study, we describe a new adaptive response leading to reactivation of PI3K/AKT signalling during trastuzumab treatment, which occurs even under circumstances when ErbB3 remains de-phosphorylated as a consequence of ErbB2 blockade (Fig 10b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signalling pathway, bypassing ErbB3, operates in the majority of examined ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, and it is clearly distinct from other mechanisms of adaptive resistance to trastuzumab such as upregulation of ErbB family receptors and cognate RTKs, or increased expression of the respective ligands27,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that PI3K/AKT evades sustained inhibition, because trastuzumab fails to induce dephosphorylation of ErbB2 itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the lack of ErbB2 dephosphorylation had been previously postulated to be one of the key reasons why a longstanding trastuzumab treatment leads to development of acquired resistance in ErbB2-addicted cells10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet the precise compensatory mechanisms leading to reactivation of PI3K/PKB in the absence of functional ErbB2ErbB3 complexes had not been understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In fact, we have now identified the ErbB2RAS interaction as a crucial regulatory switch determining whether the AKT pathway becomes inhibited persistently upon ErbB2/3 targeting or only transiently with a subsequent reactivation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation of the PI3K pathway via RAS is well characterized; Grb2, an adaptor protein binding the phosphorylated tail of ErbB2, associates with SOS, which then activates RAS that, in turn, triggers allosteric activation of p110 independently of p85 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, p110 is a critical effector for RAS-driven tumorigenesis in several tumour types and animal tumour models46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ras mutations are rare in breast cancer, aberrant activation of the RAS protein and its downstream effectors is common and occurs as a result of amplification of KRAS47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ras mutations are rarely found together with PI3K mutations in breast tumours39, again indicating engagement of overlapping signalling pathways during tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There is an increasing number of observations hinting at the possible role of aberrant RAS signalling also in the emergence of innate and acquired resistance against ErbB2 targeting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, modified SKBR3 cells overexpressing HRAS or harbouring the oncogenic allele HRAS V12 displayed reduced susceptibility to lapatinib, in analogy to what was observed with activating PIK3CA mutations or the constitutively active form of AKT48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in vitro and in silico evaluations have uncovered ras mutation as a dominant predictor of resistance to PI3K inhibitors in cancers of different origin including breast tumours overexpressing ErbB2 (refs 49, 50, 51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although the clinical relevance of the RAS-mediated resistance against ErbB2 blockade still needs to be proven, promising results from phase I studies of the RAS FT inhibitor lonafarnib, administered in combination with trastuzumab plus paclitaxelshowing a respectable objective response rate of 58% in treatment of advanced ErbB2-overexpressing breast canceror regimens combining AKT inhibitor MK2206 with trastuzumab, underscore the potential of therapeutic intervention at the RAS-PI3K-AKT axis in the treatment of ErbB2-addicted breast cancers52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the absence of external perturbations, the growth of ErbB2-dependent tumours occurs with operational AKT-ErbB3-negative feedback, that is, leading to lower ErbB3 levels, as a result of continued stimulation of AKT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, RAS inhibitor treatment, which interferes with the RAS-PI3K/AKT crosstalk, induces relief of this feedback and leads to upregulation of ErbB3, gradual re-phosphorylation of AKT and, consequently, to desensitization to RAS inhibitors, since then the relative flux through the ErbB3/PI3K/AKT pathway increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if RAS inhibitors are combined with agents antagonizing the ErbB3 phosphorylation, such as trastuzumab, the outcome of RAS inhibition becomes substantially potentiated and comparable to the cytotoxic effects of RAS inhibitors observed for RAS-driven tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As outlined above, the dephosphorylation of ErbB3 receptor, even if persisting for periods of days, is not sufficient to induce complete and sustained inhibition of AKT, explaining why all currently available anti-ErbB3 compounds failed to induce apoptosis as single agents13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we and others showed that even the ErbB3 depletion by siRNA was not enough to elicit an apoptotic response in ErbB2-dependent tumours, although it potently inhibited proliferation of tumour cells21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the targeting of ErbB3 alone is not sufficient despite the indisputable role of ErbB3 in ErbB2-driven oncogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same accounts for prototypical ErbB2-targeting agents such as trastuzumab or pertuzumab, which only exert their effect on decoupling of ErbB3 from ErbB2, but leaving the phosphorylated ErbB2 unaffected (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, TKIs targeting solely ErbB2 usually suffer from the aforementioned reactivation of ErbB3, due to relief of the negative feedback with AKT, so that ErbB2/3 signalling is buffered against a nearly two-log inhibition of ErbB2 catalytic activity43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The close mechanistic linkage between ErbB2 and ErbB3 thus entails the necessity to inhibit both ErbB2 and ErbB3 for an efficient targeting and silencing of ErbB2/3 signalling (Fig 10c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be achieved by disassembly of all ErbB2-dependent complexes in a pan-ErbB approach, accompanied by inactivation of the receptor tyrosine kinases, as described in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By targeting two distinct epitopes of ErbB2 with appropriately designed biparatopic DARPins31 that completely disengage ErbB2 from the signalling network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, our study has untangled the mechanism underlying cancer cell-specific apoptotic response in ErbB2-addicted cells, revisited the individual roles of ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors in tumour targeting and defined a new, as yet disregarded adaptive response operating via RAS-PI3K/AKT crosstalk, which leads to a desensitization towards current therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new insights arising from this study can thus translate to improvement of current therapeutic modalities and aid in the rational design of a novel class of cell-specific extracellular receptor-targeting therapeutics with improved tumoricidal activity, low side effects and potential to avoid development of drug resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, an optimal targeting format of the biparatopic anti-ErbB2 DARPins31, with improved PK/PD profile while retaining the high pro-apoptotic activity, is still to be defined in ongoing in vivo studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, it will have to be ascertained in future preclinical and clinical experiments whether the induction of apoptosis in tumours during DARPin monotherapy is rapid and potent enough in order to eliminate cells that otherwise would acquire new cancerous mutations, bearing, for example, constitutively active PI3K, and to what degree cells from heterogeneous breast tumours, harbouring preexisting mutations, would have a selective growth advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe, however, that the structure- and mechanism-based engineering of ErbB2 ligands, which potently induce cell-specific apoptosis and diminish adaptive response, may provide a foothold for development of truly effective combination therapies to combat resistant tumours.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
