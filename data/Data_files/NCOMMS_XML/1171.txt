Inverse barocaloric effect in the giant magnetocaloric LaFeSiCo compound  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  


Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The need for environmentally friendly cooling technologies has boosted research in solid-state refrigerant materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, refrigeration relies on the temperature change caused by the adiabatic application (or removal) of an external field (caloric effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under normal circumstances, temperature changes are small, but when the material is close to a phase transition, moderate variations in the external field can provoke temperature changes of several degrees and give rise to so-called giant caloric effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tuning parameter for the caloric effect (external field) can be any generalized thermodynamic force, provided that the change in the conjugated generalized thermodynamic displacement is large enough.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, giant caloric effects have already been reported for magnetic field (magnetocaloric effect)1,2,3, electric field (electrocaloric effect)4,5, uniaxial stress (elastocaloric effect)6 and hydrostatic pressure (barocaloric effect)7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In a recent work7, we postulated that most giant magnetocaloric materials would also exhibit large barocaloric effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This claim is also supported by recent theoretical studies9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on the barocaloric effect of the giant magnetocaloric material LaFe11.33Co0.47Si1.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  La(Fe,Si)13, and the derived quaternary compounds are considered nowadays to be the most promising working materials for magnetic refrigeration technology11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They feature relatively large entropy changes with a very low hysteresis and do not contain toxic materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Materials with reduced hysteresis are highly desirable because irreversibilites associated with such a hysteresis cause a reduction in the refrigerant capacity13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LaFe13xSix compounds are stable with the cubic NaZn13 structure (space group ) in a concentration range 1.2  x  2.5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below the Curie temperature TC in the range 200260 K, the compound orders ferromagnetically, and above TC an itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition is induced by an external field16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an itinerant-electron metamagnetic transition originates from a magnetic-field-induced change in the density of states of the 3d electrons at the Fermi level17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A strong magnetovolume effect originates from the existence of a peak in the electronic density of states, close to the Fermi level, that yields a negative contribution from spin fluctuations to the magnetostriction, resulting in a volume increase on cooling from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two alternative methods have been reported to bring the transition temperature to values close to room temperature without significant modification in the magnetocaloric properties11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One method is to add interstitial hydrogen that expands the crystalline lattice and modifies the exchange interaction between iron atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another method is to replace some Fe atoms by other magnetic transition metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been found that replacing Fe by only a few percent of Co enables a fine tuning of the critical temperature, and it has already been possible to produce industrially meaningful quantities (kilograms) of LaFeCoSi material with good magnetocaloric properties around room temperature18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paramagnetic to ferromagnetic transition in LaFeSi (and Co-doped) compounds is accompanied by a sizeable volume change of about 1% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no change in the crystal symmetry, but the sample isotropically expands as it transforms from the high-temperature paramagnetic to the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a volume change makes the compound highly sensitive to the application of an external hydrostatic pressure; and indeed the effect of pressure on the magnetic and magnetocaloric properties has been reported16,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume change reported for LaFeSi is one of the largest for magnetocaloric materials undergoing magnetostructural transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this compound is an excellent candidate for exhibiting large barocaloric effects associated with its magnetostructural transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have used calorimetry under hydrostatic pressure to obtain the pressure-induced entropy change, and direct temperature measurements to obtain the adiabatic temperature change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are the two key parameters characterizing a caloric effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are complemented by the measurement of the magnetic field-induced temperature and entropy changes associated with the magnetocaloric effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The giant barocaloric effect for the material is inverse: that is, we find that the sample warms when pressure is adiabatically released (the entropy decreases under isothermal conditions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetocaloric effect is conventional (the sample warms up when magnetic field is applied and cools down when it is removed).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In LaFeSi (and doped compounds), the total entropy is due to the magnetic contribution from the itinerant 3d electrons and a contribution from the lattice (the electronic contribution from the sp conduction electrons is smaller).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been established that hydrostatic pressure affects both contributions: on the one hand, pressure increases the width of the effective 3d bands, thus opposing to the onset of the ordered magnetic state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, lattice contribution is also affected by pressure through a strong magnetoelastic coupling that modifies phonon frequencies, which can be expressed in terms of a renormalized Debye temperature9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In systems undergoing a phase transition involving interplay between different material properties (volume and magnetization in the case of present study), caloric effects associated with each of these properties may be of opposite sign.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actually, in the absence of frustration effects, the primary property providing the dominant change in entropy at the transition should be associated with a conventional caloric effect whereas secondary properties may provide conventional or inverse effects depending on specific features of their coupling to the primary property.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, on cooling, NiMnIn magnetic shape-memory alloys undergo a structural transition which involves changes of symmetry and volume and is accompanied by a decrease of the magnetization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in this material, the barocaloric effect must be conventional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decrease in magnetization is a consequence of the interplay of magnetism and structure and originates from the antiferromagnetism associated with the change of distances between Mn atoms induced by the structural transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature explains the well-known inverse magnetocaloric effect in these materials22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in the LaFeSi compounds, the transition is essentially of magnetic nature, and, therefore, the magnetocaloric effect is conventional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because spin fluctuations induce a volume increase at the transition, the barocaloric effect in this material is inverse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A good parameter to assess the usefulness of a given material for refrigeration purposes is the relative cooling power (RCP) that quantifies the energy absorbed in a refrigerating cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A suitable estimation of RCP is provided by the area below the S vs T curve (see Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The computed values for the magnetocaloric (45 Jkg1 T1) and barocaloric (90 Jkg1 kbar1) effects compare well with data for the best giant magnetocaloric materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although magnetic fields stronger than 1 T are difficult to implement, pressures much larger than those used here can be applied (using clamp cells, for instance), and, therefore, the barocaloric effect appears more advantageous because RCP is expected to substantially increase, as a result of a much broader peak resulting from the shift in the transition temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have identified the occurrence of the barocaloric effect in one of the technologically most promising giant magnetocaloric materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The barocaloric effect has been found to be inverse, and direct temperature measurements prove that the material heats up on removal of hydrostatic pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of the barocaloric effect for moderate pressures is larger than the magnetocaloric effect for magnetic fields reachable with permanent magnets, and, therefore, the reported effect is potentially useful for eco-friendly solid-state refrigeration purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, it is worth mentioning that the inverse barocaloric effect arises from the volume increase on cooling through the phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a volume increase gives rise to a negative thermal expansion (NTE) within a certain temperature range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Materials exhibiting colossal NTE resulting from phase transitions are receiving considerable interest23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From thermodynamic arguments, it can be expected that these materials with NTE will also exhibit inverse barocaloric effects.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

At constant pressure, application of a magnetic field will reduce entropy in those systems for which magnetization decreases with increasing temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As this is the most commonly found situation, this effect is termed as conventional magnetocaloric effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in those materials where magnetization increases with increasing temperature, application of a magnetic field will increase the entropy, resulting in an inverse magnetocaloric effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equivalent reasoning also holds for hydrostatic pressure: materials for which volume increases with increasing temperature give rise to a conventional barocaloric effect (entropy decreases with application of pressure) whereas those with a decreasing volume with increasing temperature show an inverse barocaloric effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is also worth noticing that at constant magnetic field, materials with negative thermal expansion () will exhibit inverse barocaloric effect (equation (1)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Experimental details', 'Ingots were prepared by arc melting the pure elements under argon atmosphere in the stoichiometric ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composition was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray photoluminiscence analysis to correspond to LaFe11.33Co0.47Si1.2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was annealed at 1,323 K for 15 days and quenched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Room temperature powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a Bruker AXS diffractometer (Cu K radiation, 2 range from 20° to 80° with a step size of 0.02°).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature-dependent high-resolution X-ray powder diffraction measurements were performed on a transmission mode diffractometer using DebyeScherrer geometry equipped with horizontally mounted INEL cylindrical position sensitive detectors containing 4,096 channels (0.029° 2 step) and by using monochromatic Cu K radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature was controlled by means of a liquid nitrogen 700 series Oxford Cryostem Cooler.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heating rate between the measurements was 1.3 K min1 and, before data collection, the sample temperature was stabilized for 15 min.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Magnetization measurements were carried out using a superconducting quantum interference device magnetometer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these data, the magnetic-field-induced entropy change was numerically computed, taking into account the procedures described in (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24), to avoid undesired overestimated values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific heat was measured using a modulated differential scanning calorimeter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hydrostatic pressure calorimetry was carried out in a purpose-built calorimeter described in (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From calorimetric curves at selected values of the hydrostatic pressure p, the entropy change (referenced to a given state at T0) is computed as:', '', 'where  is the heat flux and  is the heating/cooling rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For direct adiabatic temperature measurements, a chromelalumel thermocouple was embedded into the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In pressure measurements, the sample was placed into the calorimeter and it was first cooled down under applied pressure to a temperature low enough to ensure that the whole sample was in the low-temperature phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, it was heated (keeping the applied pressure) up to the measuring temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After thermalization, the pressure was rapidly released and the output of the thermocouple was recorded at a rate of 1 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure was repeated for each measuring temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of thermal losses to the surroundings was quantified by performing experiments at temperatures well above and well below the transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For magnetic measurements, the device described in (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25) was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample was first brought to a temperature high enough to ensure that it was on the high-temperature phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, it was cooled down to the desired temperature, allowed to thermalize, and magnetic field was rapidily applied (at a rate 1 T s1) while the output of the thermocouple was recorded at a rate 0.5 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 30 s, the field was removed (at a rate 1 T s1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure was repeated for each measuring temperature.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
