Radiocarbon evidence for enhanced respired carbon storage in the Atlantic at the Last Glacial Maximum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The influence of ocean circulation changes on atmospheric CO2 hinges primarily on the ability to alter the ocean interiors respired nutrient inventory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we investigate the Atlantic overturning circulation at the Last Glacial Maximum and its impact on respired carbon storage using radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope data from the Brazil and Iberian Margins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data demonstrate the existence of a shallow well-ventilated northern-sourced cell overlying a poorly ventilated, predominantly southern-sourced cell at the Last Glacial Maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that organic carbon remineralization rates in the deep Atlantic remained broadly similar to modern, but that ventilation ages in the southern-sourced overturning cell were significantly increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Respired carbon storage in the deep Atlantic was therefore enhanced during the last glacial period, primarily due to an increase in the residence time of carbon in the deep ocean, rather than an increase in biological carbon export.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Numerous proxies suggest that ocean circulation at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was different from modern, especially in the Atlantic Ocean1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this, a consensus has yet to emerge on the LGM ocean circulation5, primarily because of limitations associated with the various proxies, as well as a paucity of data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with stable oxygen isotope data6, 13C (stable carbon isotopic ratio) and Cd/Ca data suggest that North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) shoaled by up to 1,000 m during the LGM relative to today3,4,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the combination of conservative and non-conservative impacts on nutrient proxies has permitted alternative interpretations, such as greater nutrient accumulation along the flow path8 (because of greater export production or longer transit times), or variable contributions from northern- and southern-sourced waters between 2 and 4 km water depth9 (without a complete elimination of NADW in the deep Atlantic).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although 231Pa/230Th has been used to reconstruct past rates of overturning circulation10,11, its interpretation presents difficulties, as it represents an integrated flow speed across the water column and may be affected by scavenging12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Additional proxy data are therefore needed to reconstruct the pattern and rate of ocean circulation at the LGM, and to assess its impact on the marine carbon cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiocarbon-based ventilation ages could prove particularly useful in this regard as they provide an indication of the mean timescale for carbon exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere, including the effects of airsea gas (and isotope) exchange in the regions of origin of a given parcel of water, and the mean time elapsed since that water was in the mixed layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, by combining ventilation ages with indicators of respired carbon accumulation, such as stable carbon isotopes, changes in the efficiency of the biological carbon pump can be estimated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not possible using reconstructions of flow rates or respired/total nutrient levels alone, as the efficiency of the biological carbon pump is controlled by both the export productivity (that is, the flux of carbon into the deep ocean) and the leakage of this carbon out of the deep ocean (via all the processes that contribute to mass transfer from the deep ocean interior to the surface ocean mixed layer where airsea exchange occurs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we investigate the Atlantic Ocean overturning circulation at the LGM using both radiocarbon and stable carbon isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find a shallow well-ventilated northern-sourced cell overlying a poorly ventilated, predominantly southern-sourced cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we find that the storage of respired carbon in the deep Atlantic Ocean was enhanced because of a long residence time, with a constant flux of respired carbon to the deep Atlantic.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Radiocarbon and stable carbon isotopes', 'Here we present new radiocarbon-based ventilation ages along with stable carbon isotopes from 1,000 to 3,500 m on the Brazil Margin and from 1,100 to 4,700 m on the Iberian Margin (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ventilation ages are based on benthic-planktonic (B-P) radiocarbon age offsets, to which the estimated surface reservoir age is added to provide an estimate of the deep ocean versus atmospheric radiocarbon age offset (B-Atm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the proximity of cores in each of our study regions, surface reservoir ages are expected to be very similar for all cores in each transect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, despite some uncertainty in the surface reservoir ages, vertical gradients in ventilation ages within each transect will remain accurate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Radiocarbon-based ventilation ages provide an indication of the extent of isotopic disequilibrium between the marine- and atmospheric carbon reservoirs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More radiocarbon-depleted waters (indicated by higher radiocarbon ventilation ages) will reflect less efficient radiocarbon (and therefore CO2) exchange between the ocean interior and the atmosphere on average, and therefore a longer carbon sequestration time in the ocean interior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For continuous export of biologically fixed carbon to the ocean interior, a greater radiocarbon ventilation age and a longer carbon sequestration time (that is, relative to the atmosphere) should in turn reflect enhanced accumulation of respired carbon in the ocean interior and a more efficient (since less leaky) soft-tissue carbon pump13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ventilation of the Brazil Margin', 'On the Brazil Margin, the radiocarbon ventilation age-depth profile for the LGM is significantly different from that of the modern ocean (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the shallowest core (1,000 m), has a similar ventilation age to that of the modern ocean, the deeper cores have considerably higher ventilation ages, with the deepest core being offset from the surface ocean by up to 1,700 years, compared with just 400 years today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: LGM depth profiles for the Brazil Margin and the Iberian Margin.The benthic-planktonic radiocarbon age offset (B-P; a, c) and the stable carbon isotopic ratio, 13C (b, d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern B-P values (calculated by subtracting the modern surface reservoir age from the bottom water ventilation age) are show in grey (GLODAP38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern 13C of DIC is also shown in grey (GEOSECS38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are given in Supplementary Table 3.Full size image', 'Stable carbon isotopes also had a distinctly different profile at the LGM compared with the modern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13C shows a significant decrease with depth, ranging from 1.1 at 1,000 m to 0.2 in the deep ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steepest gradient (0.5/1,000 m) is seen between 2,300 and 3,550 m, whereas in the modern ocean the gradient is  less_than 0.02/1,000 m between these depths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ventilation of the Iberian Margin', 'The Iberian Margin also shows a very different ventilation age depth-profile at the LGM compared with the modern ocean (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the intermediate ocean ( less_than 2,100 m) was well ventilated, the deep ocean was poorly ventilated, with B-P age offsets more than 1,000 years greater than in the modern ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shallowest core (1,127 m) has a negative B-P age offset suggesting that the surface was more poorly ventilated than the intermediate ocean (likely influenced by Mediterranean Outflow Water14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beneath this, the B-P age offset increases with depth in the water column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A relatively steep gradient (950 years/1,000 m) is seen for the upper 2,600 m, with a smaller increase in B-P age offset with depth below (200 years/1,000 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar profile is also seen in 13C with a steep gradient (0.4/1,000 m) between 2 and 3.7 km but with relatively little change ( less_than 0.1/1,000 m) with depth below 3,700 m. The range of 13C (00.8) at the LGM is significantly greater than the range in the modern North Atlantic (1.01.1) between 2 and 4.7 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13C at 4.7 km are more than 0.9 lower at the LGM than in the modern ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, extremely low 13C, previously observed in both the deep South Atlantic ( less_than 0.8)15,16 and in the abyssal western North Atlantic (0.3 to 0.5)17,18, are not observed in any of the Iberian Margin cores.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We combined our new ventilation ages with available published data in order to tentatively reconstruct the distribution of radiocarbon in the Atlantic Ocean during the LGM18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25 (Fig 2 and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These radiocarbon-based ventilation ages show that, regardless of the uncertainties in LGM surface reservoir ages, the entire deep Atlantic Ocean ( greater than 2 km) was less ventilated during the LGM than the modern ocean (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Today, the deep North Atlantic is well ventilated by newly formed NADW, whereas the deep South Atlantic is primarily influenced by southern-sourced waters (Lower Circumpolar Deep Water, LCDW, and Antarctic Bottom Water, AABW), which have greater ventilation ages because of reduced airsea gas exchange in the AABW formation regions26 and because of mixing and entrainment of pre-aged circumpolar deep water into AABW27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the LGM this NorthSouth ventilation age gradient in the deep Atlantic was significantly reduced or even eradicated (in the abyss), suggesting a distinctly different circulation must have prevailed (Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the apparent northward expansion of poorly ventilated deep waters from the glacial South Atlantic to the deep equatorial and North Atlantic, the LGM circulation appears to have been characterized primarily by a greatly reduced influence of NADW in the deepest Atlantic ( greater than 2,000 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is notable that abyssal waters in the western North Atlantic and on the northern Brazil Margin had a similar ventilation age to that of the abyssal South Atlantic (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of an increase in ventilation age along the flow path between the South Atlantic and the equatorial and North Atlantic suggests that neither the deep eastern Atlantic nor the deep western Atlantic contained pure southern-sourced waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A persistent, albeit greatly reduced, northern source of radiocarbon was therefore provided to depths of at least 4.7 km, either via mixing with an overlying well-ventilated water mass or via direct episodic input of dense well-ventilated (for example, overflow) waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Map of core locations.Map showing core/dredge locations with modern background 14C (GLODAP38), using Ocean Data View71.Full size image', 'Figure 3: Atlantic radiocarbon-based ventilation age depth profiles.Triangles: modern ventilation ages (dotted lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Squares: LGM ventilation ages (solid lines)18,19,20,21,22,23,24,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars indicate the analytical error on the radiocarbon measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shaded area represents the uncertainty of the surface reservoir age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue, East Atlantic;

Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, this change in nutrient distributions could have been driven by enhanced export productivity and/or longer ocean interior residence times.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As indicated above, our combined radiocarbon and stable isotope data indicate that the latter mechanism was dominant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our interpretation that this change in circulation was primarily associated with an expansion of southern-sourced waters in the deepest Atlantic is further supported by Nd data, which indicate an increase in southern-sourced waters at depth with an increase in northern-sourced waters above28 (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  231Pa/230Th ratios also display a distinct change of the opposite sign above and below 2.2 km water depth10 (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 231Pa/230Th ratios suggest that the North Atlantic overturning circulation cell was just as strong during the LGM as it is today, but that it penetrated to shallower depths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this contrasts with many numerical modelling studies that tend to find a slower overturning when NADW shoals29,30, our ventilation ages also suggest that the upper North Atlantic overturning rate was not reduced so much that it significantly decreased the supply radiocarbon to the intermediate ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radiocarbon data are therefore consistent with the proposal that a significant shoaling of NADW may not necessarily imply a major reduction in the NADW formation/transport rate at the LGM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, while our results support the existence at the LGM of a shallow NADW cell overlying an expanded, radiocarbon-depleted AABW below, they also suggest that the deep southern-sourced cell was not completely isolated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the eastern and the western North Atlantic, a northern source of relatively radiocarbon-enriched and high 13C waters was mixed into the deep cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could imply a more complex Atlantic circulation than one characterized by two completely separate overturning cells at the LGM31, where the northern overturning cell is either strong and deep or weak and shallow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As in the landmark study of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3, our stable isotope data demonstrate the existence of enhanced gradients in 13C between 2,000 and 3,500 m in the equatorial and North Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern of 13C in the Atlantic has been interpreted primarily to demonstrate a reduction in the proportion of northern-sourced waters with depth, and an increase in the total nutrient content of the deep Atlantic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our new radiocarbon data demonstrate that this did not primarily reflect an increase in preformed nutrients (that is, nutrients that were advected to the ocean interior, and that would be associated with carbon that was well-equilibrated with the atmosphere32), but rather an increase in respired nutrients (and therefore respired carbon).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, and equivalently for ocean versus atmosphere carbon inventory changes, the radiocarbon data might also indicate an increase in the disequilibrium carbon inventory of the deep Atlantic33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in this case, a very large decrease in airsea CO2 exchange efficiency would need to be invoked in parallel with an increase in preformed nutrients, in order to account for the paired stable carbon isotope (and nutrient) reconstructions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed expansion of southern-sourced deep waters at the LGM was therefore very likely associated with an increase in the efficiency of the soft-tissue carbon pump, primarily due to an increase in the residence time of carbon in the deep Atlantic, rather than an increase in biological export productivity (that is, at low/mid-latitudes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although global data coverage and better constraints on surface reservoir ages are required to assess the precise magnitude of the atmospheric CO2 drawdown that is implied by the observed ocean circulation changes, our findings support a direct contribution from the Atlantic overturning circulation via its impact on the deep oceans respired carbon inventory.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

years, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ages are consistent with the lowest estimates determined for the Iberian Margin by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22 (that is, excluding their tie-points in HS1 and the LGM where the event stratigraphy is arguably more equivocal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Age models', 'The planktonic radiocarbon ages were used to construct age models for each of the cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to do so, an estimated surface reservoir age was subtracted from each planktonic radiocarbon date before conversion to calendar ages using BChron version 3.1.5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  59) and the IntCal13 calibration curve58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These calendar ages were then used to construct sediment depth-age models using the Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method, also using Bchron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As LGM surface reservoir age estimates have not been directly estimated on the Brazil Margin, a best guess value of 750 years, based on isotope exchange constraints backed up by model simulations44,45, was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the Iberian Margin, a surface reservoir age of 900 years was used for the LGM based on the stratigraphic alignments described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For compiled data, for cores with age models that do not depend on radiocarbon data, surface and deep reservoir ages were determined by subtracting the contemporary atmospheric radiocarbon age (based on Intcal13) from the planktonic and benthic radiocarbon ages, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sites with no independent age model, the pCO2 corrected modern reservoir ages (that is, modern plus 250 years at the LGM) were used and added to the benthic-planktonic age offset to determine the deep ocean-atmospheric age offset (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Stratigraphic alignments', 'The cores were stratigraphically aligned to the Hulu speleothem 18O record55 and the NGRIP dust record57 (on the GICC05 age model56,60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NGRIP dust content changes rapidly and synchronously with changes in ice core 18O (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  61).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NGRIP dust, which is predominantly sourced from East Asian deserts62,63,64,65, increases during cold periods57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These increases are caused by atmospheric changes66,67 and/or intensified sources68, but the exact mechanism is unconstrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hulu speleothem  18O record resembles East Asian monsoon changes and is highly correlated with millennial scale Greenland temperature variations55,69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The sediment cores were aligned using elemental ratios determined using high-resolution XRF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zr/Sr ratios were used to align the Iberian Margin cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zr/Sr anti-correlates strongly with Ca/Ti in these cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Zr/Sr and Ca/Ti ratios reflect the relative input of biogenic (Ca, Sr) and detrital (Zr, Ti) material, and have been shown to correlate strongly with planktonic  18O and alkenone sea-surface temperatures on the Iberian Margin, as well as with millennial scale variations in Greenland ice core  18O (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  70).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zr/Sr values are generally higher during stadials and lower during interstadials, whereas Ca/Ti ratios show the opposite trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A master core, SHAK03-6K was selected for the Iberian Margin through which the other cores were aligned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHAK03-6K was chosen as the master core based on its high quality (no discontinuities) and age range (SHAK14-4G was also of very high quality but only reached back to 20 kyrs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SHAK03-6K was aligned to both the Hulu speleothem and the NGRIP dust record using a series of tie points (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No tie-points were used in the interval 011.4 kyrs BP because of the lack of clear signals in the records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calendar ages at tie points in SHAK03-6K were then transferred to all the other Iberian Margin cores (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'XRF data', 'The Iberian Margin cores were scanned at the University of Cambridge using an Avaatech XRF core scanner (2nd generation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface of the cores was scraped clean then covered with a 4-m SPEXCertiPrep Ultralene foil to avoid contamination and to prevent the cores drying out and cracking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each section was measured at three different voltages and currents: 10 kV and 750 A, 30 kV and 500 A, and at 50 kV and 1,000 A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The entire length of each core was analysed at 5-mm resolution with an irradiated surface length and width of 5 mm (downcore) and 12 mm (cross core), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The count time was 60 s for each measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Element intensities were obtained by post-processing of the XRF spectra using the Canberra WinAxil software with standard software settings and spectrum-fit models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',
