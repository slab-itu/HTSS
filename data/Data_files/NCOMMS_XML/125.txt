Identification of DNA lesions using a third base pair for amplification and nanopore sequencing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Damage to the genome is implicated in the progression of cancer and stress-induced diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA lesions exist in low levels, and cannot be amplified by standard PCR because they are frequently strong blocks to polymerases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe a method for PCR amplification of lesion-containing DNA in which the site and identity could be marked, copied and sequenced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critical for this method is installation of either the dNaM or d5SICS nucleotides at the lesion site after processing via the base excision repair process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These marker nucleotides constitute an unnatural base pair, allowing large quantities of marked DNA to be made by PCR amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sanger sequencing confirms the potential for this method to locate lesions by marking, amplifying and sequencing a lesion in the KRAS gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection using the -hemolysin nanopore is also developed to analyse the markers in individual DNA strands with the potential to identify multiple lesions per strand.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DNA undergoes damage caused by oxidation, deamination or alkylation leading to the formation of various base lesions, and depurination leading to abasic sites1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location in the genome in which the modification occurs is of critical interest, because it enables understanding the origin of genetic mutations resulting from these lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations in the genome are one hallmark of melanoma, hepatic and lung carcinomas; mutations increase with age, and are observed in a number of stress-induced disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A method capable of identifying the chemical identity and location in which lesions appear is crucial for determining the molecular aetiology of these diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, recent research has highlighted lesions in close proximity to one another to be a challenge to the repair machinery and potentially more mutagenic6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the low abundance of DNA modifications in the genome, it is challenging to address these questions because the damage sites display both altered base pairing and frequently are pause or stop sites for polymerases, making them unamplifiable by PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A number of methods have been developed to sequence epigenetic modifications, all of which rely on conversion of the modified base to a different, but readable base, such as the bisulfite conversion of cytosine to uracil, in contrast to the chemical stability of 5-methylcytosine7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variations of this method have been developed to sequence 5-hydoxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxycytosine using a combination of enzymatic and chemical approaches in tandem with bisulfite sequencing7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct sequencing of epigenetic modifications has been demonstrated by single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) and protein nanopores9,10,11,12; though, both direct methods are challenged when working with actual tissue samples that contain modifications in low abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast to epigenetic modifications, DNA lesions such as those resulting from oxidative stress are diverse, and selective chemistry for them has not been developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMRT sequencing13 and ligation-mediated PCR provide limited advances in identifying base modifications14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An approach that retains the lesion location while providing a detectable signal for multiple lesions in proximity would enhance our understanding of lesions in the genome and how they contribute to mutagenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An approach for mapping the precise location and identity of the lesion in DNA strands would be to label the damaged site with a marker nucleotide triphosphate during polymerase extension.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first generation of this approach attempted modified nucleotide insertion opposite an abasic site (AP)15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These approaches suffered from the inability to extend past the site at which the marker was placed and were only applicable to abasic sites (AP sites).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, outcompeting insertion of dATP opposite an abasic site (that is, the A rule) with a modified nucleotide is challenging18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a second generation for labelling lesion sites with a marker nucleotide, the Sturla laboratory demonstrated insertion and linear extension of a marker nucleotide opposite O6-benzylguanines19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this report, we developed a third generation approach for labelling lesion sites with an amplifiable marker nucleotide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method utilizes the base excision repair (BER) pathway to target lesions to yield gaps in the DNA to only insert the marker nucleotide bypassing the A rule; these markers are exponentially PCR amplifiable; and lesion identity is determined by the BER enzymes avoiding lengthy synthesis of lesion-specific markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Critical for the development of our method is utilization of a marker nucleotide that has a selective, complementary partner allowing high-fidelity PCR amplification of the marked DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we chose the dNaM or dMMO2 nucleotides base paired with d5SICS that form an established set of unnatural base pairs (UBPs; Fig 1)22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These UBPs combined with the selectivity of the BER process allow insertion of the marker at the lesion site with excellent retention during PCR amplification, as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Unnatural base pairs used for labelling of DNA lesions.The dNaM·d5SICS and dMMO2·d5SICS unnatural base pairs utilized for labelling DNA lesions with a third, amplifiable marker base pair.Full size image', 'Sequencing the UBPs is determined by a sharp stop in a Sanger sequencing chromatogram causing loss of all downstream information22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to map more than one modification site per DNA strand, the dNaM nucleotide is also utilized to install an orthogonal functional group for attaching a detectable functionality25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The readout for this adduct is achieved using the -hemolysin (-HL) nanopore that analyses individual DNA molecules while they are electrophoretically driven through the small aperture pore26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our concept is developed around common lesions found in the genome that include an abasic site (depurination lesion), 2-deoxyuridine (dU, deamination lesion), as well as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-deoxyguanosine (dOG) and spiroiminodihydantoin-2-deoxynucleoside (dSp, oxidative lesions).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Outline of labelling methodology', 'The methodology for labelling lesion sites in a DNA duplex was established in a section of the KRAS gene surrounding codon 12, and then applied for lesion detection in a plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A GT transversion in the coding strand of this gene in lung cancer is proposed to result from G oxidation28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a GA transition found in codon 12 in this gene found in colon cancer is proposed to result from dC deamination to dU4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 65-mer model system housed 30 nucleotides centred on codon 12 of the KRAS sequence flanked by two 17-mer PCR primer regions (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-lesion-containing strand was capped with 10 dT nucleotides terminated with triethylene glycol groups to prevent unwanted ligation reactions during one of the steps below due to the presence of a 5-phosphate required for radioactive labelling; these tails also allowed gel purification of one strand from the other (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The labelling protocol is a one-pot, four-step reaction sequence that harnesses the enzymes found in the BER pathway for recognizing lesion sites and replacing them with a marker nucleotide, dNaM, d5SICS or dMMO2 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The marked strand was exponentially PCR amplified with the appropriate 2-deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) to yield UBP amplicons that were sequenced to identify the location of the lesion (Figs 3a and 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete details of each step follow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: DNA sequences studied based on codon 12 of the KRAS gene.The KRAS-U duplex contains a dU in the template strand at the centre of codon 12 in the KRAS gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KRAS-OG and KRAS-Sp duplexes contain dOG or dSp, respectively, in the coding strand at the centre of codon 12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KRAS-U, KRAS-OG and KRAS-Sp duplexes are flanked by primer regions that allow their PCR amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KRAS-S strand centrally locates the KRAS sequence with a phosphorothioate at the centre of codon 12;

Figs 3a and 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As examples, four types of lesions were selected for labelling with either the dNaM or d5SICS marker nucleotides: an abasic site (AP site), a product of spontaneous depurination29; dU, a deamination product30; dOG, an oxidation product31,32; and dSp, a hyperoxidized guanine lesion31,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lesions have been implicated in the induction of DNA mutations found in liver and melanoma cancers1,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All duplexes studied included site-specific lesions incorporated at known locations by solid-phase synthesis or by literature protocols (Supplementary Methods)34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dU and AP site lesions were placed in the template strand of the KRAS sequence, while dOG and dSp were placed in the coding strand of the KRAS sequence (Fig 2), consistent with their proposed mutational profiles4,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choice of the BER enzyme used in this step provides lesion selectivity; all further steps are the same for each type of lesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BER enzymes chosen to study included uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) for processing dU (Fig 3b)35; either bacterial formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) or human OG glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) for excising dOG (Fig 4b; Supplementary Fig 1)36,37; human NEIL1 (hNEIL1) for cleaving at dSp (Supplementary Fig 2)34; whereas the AP site lesion can directly proceed to step II of this method for labelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaction times for each BER enzyme processing its substrate were optimized to achieve  greater than 99% conversion to product as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE; Figs 3c and 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reaction times were also optimized for each lesion BER enzyme combination (Figs 3b and 4b; Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical difference for each BER enzyme is whether it is a monofunctional (Fig 3a) or a bifunctional (Fig 4a) glycosylase, thus determining the precise enzyme(s) used in the next step (Figs 3a and 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Formation of a gap site at the lesion for marker insertion', 'Monofunctional glycosylases, such as UDG, yield an AP site in an intact DNA strand as the product38,39, requiring further processing by APE1 to furnish the desired single-nucleotide gap with a 3-OH on the 5-oligomer and a 5-phosphate on the 3-oligomer, ready for a polymerase to insert the marker nucleotide in the next step (step II; Fig 3a)39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intact AP sites were cleaved by adding APE1 directly to the reaction from the previous reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By following APE1 activity by PAGE, we found a 1 h incubation to yield the desired product in nearly quantitative yield (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bifunctional BER enzymes, such as Fpg40, hOGG1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39) or hNEIL1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40), the gap site was processed with Endo IV and a 3-phosphatase to yield the desired flanking functional groups for insertion of the marker nucleotide (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enzyme combination is capable of reactions on gap sites that may or may not have a sugar fragment on the 3-OH on the 5-side of the gap39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a fragment may exist if the bifunctional BER enzyme only possesses -elimination lyase activity that is characteristic of hOGG1 removal of dOG39, while Fpg and hNEIL1 both have - and -elimination lyase activity yielding a gap site without the sugar fragment39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these reactions, Endo IV and a 3-phosphatase were added directly to the reaction from step I and allowed to react for 2 h. Because bifunctional glycosylases cleave the strand in the previous step, the yield of the gap processing reactions was not directly determined by PAGE; instead, the yield of marker nucleotide incorporation in the next step (step III; Fig 4a) provides the reaction yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the yield from step III, these two enzymes furnish the desired single-nucleotide gap product in nearly quantitative yield (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Polymerase insertion of the marker nucleotides', 'Once a gap was generated at the lesion site, a polymerase that was only given dNaMTP or d5SICSTP allowed insertion of the marker in place of the lesion (step III; Figs 3a and 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because only dNaMTP or d5SICSTP exist in the reaction without any other canonical nucleotides, they will be the only nucleotides inserted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Literature precedence has demonstrated that Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I deficient in exonuclease activity (Kf exo) has the potential to react at a gap site in a duplex, as well as being capable of inserting non-natural nucleotides41,42; hence, Kf exo was selected for study of inserting either dNaMTP or d5SICSTP opposite a template dG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of PAGE analysis (Figs 3b and 4b), Kf exo with either of the marker triphosphates added to the reaction from step II could insert opposite a template dG to furnish the nicked duplex in a 1-h incubation with a nearly quantitative yield (Figs 3c and 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The efficiency of incorporating dNaMTP or d5SICSTP opposite dA, dC or dT were also evaluated and found to be  greater than 93% (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This step was the first forcing reaction in the protocol, and the high yields observed were encouraging for the ultimate success of the labelling reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sealing the marker at the lesion site via ligation', 'The duplex product from step III has a nick with a non-natural base pair on the 3 terminus of the 5 oligomer (Figs 3a and 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that this side of the nick is the most challenging to seal when a non-native base pair is present43; therefore, initial test reactions were set up to ligate either dNaM or d5SICS base paired with a dG on the 5-side of the nick (step IV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system allowed optimization of the ligation reaction to yield the desired duplex product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best conditions found to seal the nick required the addition of dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO, 20% (v/v))44, decreased ATP (0.1 mM) and a large excess of T4-DNA ligase (800 units (U)) that were allowed to react for 16 h at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conditions gave a yield up to 70%, and further refinement did not achieve higher yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To complete these studies, tests were conducted with all combinations of dNaM or d5SICS paired with the canonical nucleotides to elucidate if there are any pairing combinations that might be better or worse for ligation (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies determined that dNaM or d5SICS paired opposite a dG at the nick site led to the highest ligation yields (70%; Supplementary Table 2), and all other cases gave lower yields (5665%; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a test of the ability to label multiple lesions with this approach was conducted with two dU lesions placed nine base pairs apart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PAGE analysis found the overall ligation yield to be 45% (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because high yields ( greater than 90%) could not be achieved for the ligation step, an alternative approach was pursued to install the marker nucleotide (dNaM or d5SICS) at the gap resulting from BER activity on multiple lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Polymerase extension to seal the marker nucleotide', 'Ligation at the site of the marker nucleotide was the most challenging step in our scheme with the lowest overall yield (5672%; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the low abundance of lesions in the genome, it is preferred to maximize the yield in all steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To bypass the ligation reaction, the nicked duplex bearing a marker nucleotide at the lesion site can be subjected to polymerase extension with a strand displacing polymerase, such as Kf exo (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extension reaction will initiate from the marker nucleotide on the 3-end of the priming strand (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To conduct this extension, we simply added the four natural dNTPs after completion of step III and allowed Kf exo to perform the extension reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One limitation to this approach is that any product from step III that does not have the marker nucleotide present will also lead to full length duplexes, and a method for bypassing this issue is proposed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other limitation to this approach is that only one marker nucleotide per strand, and therefore one lesion per strand, can be detected because during the polymerase extension step any other marker present will be displaced by the polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of this limitation, polymerase extension using the strand with the marker nucleotide on the 3-end was conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of PAGE analysis (Fig 5b), the intact duplex was observed in high yield (90%), and the only impurity in this reaction was the presence of strands that failed to extend (10%;

however, the strand that does not contain the marker nucleotide will be more favourably amplified during this step than the strand with the dNaM or d5SICS marker.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For initial analysis of marker nucleotide incorporation, the two strands of the duplex were of different lengths allowing PAGE purification of the marker-containing strand away from the template strand (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, the marker-containing strand was subjected to 20 cycles of PCR following literature protocols22 to yield a population of amplicons (step V).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locating the position of the UBP within the amplified DNA was determined in the sequencing step (step VI; Figs 3a and 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For biological samples, the strands will not have different lengths, and PAGE separation of the strands will not be possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When applying this method, we envision three approaches for purification of the marker-containing strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (1) Immunoprecipitation of DNA strands containing the lesion of interest, followed by labelling and sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method is limited by the availability of immunoprecipitation grade antibodies for the lesion of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) Placement of an affinity purification tag on one of the marker nucleotides to allow purification such as the biotinylated dMMO2ssbioTP that can be substituted for dNaMTP as the UBP in this approach25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of d5SICSTP in step III followed by amplification using d5SICSTP and biotinylated dMMO2ssbioTP (Fig 6) provides the affinity purification tag25,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As demonstrated below, utilization of the d5SICS·dMMO2ssbio UBP was an excellent approach for purification of the labelled strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (3) Utilization of -phosphorothionucleotide triphosphates of dNaM or d5SICS, dNaMSTP or d5SICSSTP, respectively, during step III (Figs 3a and 4a) would incorporate a functional group into duplex DNA that has orthogonal reactivity for purification purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Literature precedence has demonstrated reacting phosphorothioate-bearing DNA with iodoacetamide functionalized biotin for labelling to conduct affinity purification25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the use of -phosphorothionucleotide triphosphates of dNaM or d5SICS during step III would provide a third approach for applying our method to in vivo samples, as has been proposed by the Romesberg laboratory24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we tested this proposal by synthesizing the -phosphorothionucleotide triphosphates of dNaM (dNaMSTP) following literature protocols24 and incorporated it into step III when Kf exo inserted the marker at the gap generated by the lesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PAGE analysis determined that dNaMSTP could be substituted for dNaMTP during this protocol (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: The dMMO2ssbioTP unnatural nucleotide utilized for affinity purification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  .Full size image', 'Sequencing of the marker base pair in place of a DNA lesion', 'Once amplicons have been generated with the dNaM·d5SICS UBP located at the lesion site in the original duplex (Figs 3a and 4a), sequencing provides the readout of the base pairs location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present iteration, the method for sequencing the UBP was conveniently achieved by the observation of an abrupt stop during Sanger sequencing45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of this method with either the dNaM or d5SICS nucleotide in the template strand correctly identified the location of the modification (Fig 3a;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Herein, a method was developed to label a DNA lesion with the dNaM·d5SICS UBP that marks the lesions location in the primary sequence of DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this goal, a four-step reaction sequence was developed followed by PCR amplification and sequencing (Figs 3a and 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall reaction yield varied between 50 and 65% (Figs 3c and 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A low reaction yield was observed when ligation was used to seal a nicked site in the DNA duplex with dNaM or d5SICS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ligation yield varied with the canonical base paired with dNaM or d5SICS (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach will label more than one lesion per strand, as long as they are not too close to prevent the reactions in steps I, II, III and IV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an alternative, polymerase extension past the incorporated dNaM or d5SICS could label a single lesion site in DNA in a nearly 90% overall yield (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This alternative approach provides a much needed increase in yield that is required when dealing with the low levels of lesions in the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The excellent retention and amplification of the dNaM·d5SICS UBP provides the ability to conduct PCR that effectively allows amplification of lesion-containing DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This step is critical in obtaining enough amplicons for performing DNA sequencing, particularly Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Sanger sequencing is only capable of identifying one dNaM·d5SICS UBP per duplex22,45, we demonstrate the use of chemical labels in tandem with the single-molecule profiling capability of the -HL nanopore to provide the ability to observe multiple markers per strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This straightforward method can be applied to DNA samples leading to lesion labelling in  less_than 24 h when ligation of the marker nucleotide is the approach taken; alternatively, if polymerase extension is used for sealing the marker nucleotide into the DNA, the process can be achieved in about 8 h. This method was developed with commercially available enzymes and instruments; while advantageous, it also limits the ability to mark lesion sites in one strand in quantitative yield, as well as to sequence the markers by single-molecule profiling at single-nucleotide resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, future engineering of ligases that efficiently accept UBP at the nick site would provide a much needed boost in the yields for labelling of multiple modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, nanopore sequencing of genomic data has made enormous strides9,54,58, and adaptation of the present labelling and PCR amplification method with these sequencers will likely be the approach applied for routinely sequencing lesions from biological sources.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The genome is under constant threat by the inherent reactivity of DNA bases and by chemical insults to which they are exposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These chemical changes lead to mutations, in which the original chemical modification is rarely known, but rather implied based on the mutagenic profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this knowledge gap, we developed a method that enables selective replacement of four types of lesionsuracil, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, spiroiminodihydantoin and abasic sites by the dNaM·d5SICS UBP in a one-pot, four-step reaction sequence (Figs 3a and 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elegance of this system lies in the ability to PCR amplify the third base pair, which effectively allows amplification of DNA lesions chosen selectively by BER enzymes for replacement with the marker nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this simple method can easily be extended to other types of lesions or modifications to the genome, as long as a BER enzyme exists to conduct step I of the method as outlined (Figs 3a or 4a,); for example, lesions/modifications with known glycosylases include thymine glycol (NTHL1)39, 3-methyladenine (ALK A)39, the T in a T·G mismatch (TDG)39 and 5-methylcytosine (ROS 1)59, all of which would also be exciting avenues for study by this method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this method avoids competition with native nucleotides to maximize labelling yields without interfering side reactions involving insertion of native nucleotides (for example, due to the A rule).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequencing protocol for the dNaM·d5SICS UBP is demonstrated by Sanger sequencing, leading to an abrupt stop in the sequence chromatogram for identification of the base pairs location (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we further developed chemistry around the dNaM·d5SICS UBP that will permit detection of more than one lesion per strand and allow population analysis of lesion location by the -HL nanopore method (Fig 8d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The labelling methodology developed can be applied to questions surrounding the underlying chemical reactions that initiate mutations in the genome leading to disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, mutations in codon 12 of the KRAS gene can be probed to determine if dOG or dU are responsible for the mutations observed in lung or colon cancer, respectively4,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information will be paramount in preventative medicine for cancers and other deleterious stress-induced diseases resulting from these mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new -HL nanopore sequencing methodology developed has the potential to become a robust approach for detecting and sequencing non-native nucleotides that is currently only achievable by SMRT sequencing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
