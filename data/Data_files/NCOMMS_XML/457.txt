A spin-liquid with pinch-line singularities on the pyrochlore lattice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The mathematics of gauge theories lies behind many of the most profound advances in physics in the past 200 years, from Maxwells theory of electromagnetism to Einsteins theory of general relativity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently it has become clear that gauge theories also emerge in condensed matter, a prime example being the spin-ice materials which host an emergent electromagnetic gauge field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spin-ice, the underlying gauge structure is revealed by the presence of pinch-point singularities in neutron-scattering measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the discovery of a spin-liquid where the low-temperature physics is naturally described by the fluctuations of a tensor field with a continuous gauge freedom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gauge structure underpins an unusual form of spin correlations, giving rise to pinch-line singularities: line-like analogues of the pinch points observed in spin-ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, these features may already have been observed in the pyrochlore material Tb2Ti2O7.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Gauge symmetries are paramount in the understanding of many of the most fundamental theories of physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent decades have seen an increasing appreciation of the role of gauge theories in condensed matter physics, emerging from the long-wavelength description of the collective behaviour of electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emergent gauge theories have proved particularly important in the study of spin-liquids, strongly fluctuating, disordered magnetic states, the description of which lies beyond the familiar territory of Landau theory1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The use of a gauge theory to describe the fluctuations of a spin-liquid is exemplified by the case of the spin-ice materials R2M2O7 (R=Ho, Dy, M=Ti, Sn) (refs 7, 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low temperatures, the spin configurations in a spin-ice are subject to a constraint directly analogous to Gauss law for a magnetic field and consequently may be described in terms of a gauge theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the many striking consequences of this is the observation of pinch-point singularities in the magnetic neutron scattering structure factor9, as observed in Ho2Ti2O7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10), cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pinch-point scattering has also been observed in the putative quantum spin-ice Tb2Ti2O7 (refs 11, 12, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in this case, the experimental scattering shows pronounced butterfly-like features in the non-spin-flip (NSF) channel and the scattering in the spin-flip (SF) channel shows narrow arm-like features extending along the 111 directions of reciprocal space, neither of which features are predicted for a spin-ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the question of whether other types of spin-liquid may be found amongst rare-earth pyrochlore magnets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Comparison of correlations in spin-ice with those of the spin-liquid discussed in this work.Predictions for polarized neutron scattering experiments are shown in the (a,b) SF and (c,d) NSF channels, as measured by Fennell et al.10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Prediction for spin-ice in the SF channel exhibiting pinch-point singularities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Prediction for scattering in the SF channel in the spin-liquid discussed in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Prediction for spin-ice in the NSF channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This channel is completely featureless in a nearest neighbour model for spin-iceas shown hereand develops smooth maxima at the zone boundaries in the presence of long range dipole interactions10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Prediction for scattering in the NSF channel in the spin-liquid discussed in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to spin-ice, the spin-liquid discussed here exhibits singular features in both SF and NSF scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are taken from classical Monte Carlo simulation of the nearest neighbour model  (equation (1)), as described in the text.Full size image', 'Here we introduce a different kind of spin-liquid on the pyrochlore lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spin-liquid arises on the phase diagram of a realistic model for pyrochlore magnets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with spin-ice, the theory of this spin-liquid contains a gauge symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nature of this theory is fundamentally different to the Maxwellian theory which describes spin-ice, but just as the emergent gauge structure of spin-ice reveals itself in pinch-point scattering, so the gauge structure of this spin-liquid has striking consequences for scattering experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will show that at low temperatures, this gauge structure leads to line-like singularities along the 111 directions of reciprocal space, which we dub pinch lines since they are extended versions of the pinch-points exhibited in spin-ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly interesting in the light of neutron scattering results on the pyrochlore magnets Tb2Ti2O7 and Yb2Ti2O7, which show strong, sharpening features along the 111 directions of reciprocal space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our theory is able to account for several features of the diffuse scattering observed in Tb2Ti2O7 (refs 11, 12, 13), which are unaccounted for by a theory based on a spin-ice model.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

robust feature of the spin-liquid, arising from the structure of its ground-state constraints, which is captured by the continuum theory derived in this work.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Thus far we have uncovered a spin-liquid described by a tensor field carrying a continuous gauge symmetry, arising in a particular limit of a realistic model for magnetism on the pyrochlore lattice (equation (1)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal feature of this spin-liquid is sharp line-like singularities along 111 directions of reciprocal space, which occur in addition to pinch-point singularities at zone centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pinch-line singularities are unique to the spin-liquid discussed in this paper and as such provide a very discriminating smoking-gun signature of this magnetic state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the light of this discovery, it is interesting to consider two known pyrochlore materials, which are often discussed in the context of spin-liquid physics: Tb2Ti2O7 and Yb2Ti2O7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tb2Ti2O7 has long been a focal point for discussion of three-dimensional spin-liquid physics22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While equation (1) alone may not constitute a complete quantitative model for the physics of Tb2Ti2O7 it is interesting to compare observations on Tb2Ti2O7 with the phenomenology of the spin-liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polarized neutron scattering experiments on Tb2Ti2O7 have shown evidence of singular scattering at Brilllouin zone centres, but the form of this scattering looks rather different to a typical spin-ice, especially in the non-spin-flip (NSF) channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the data presented in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11, shows bright, narrow features extending along the 111 directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a point of comparison to these experiments, the behaviour of the structure factor S(q) in the spin-flip (SF) and non-spin-flip (NSF) channels, appropriate to a polarized neutron scattering experiment with initial polarization n||(1, 1, 0), is shown in Fig 1, for the same set of exchange parameters as in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Narrow prominences are visible in the SF channel along the 111 directions (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also pinch points in both channels at Brillouin zone centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution, orientation and polarization dependence of the pinch points observed in (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  11) is the same as that in Fig 1b,d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we are able to reproduce the shape of the features in the NSF channel, something which cannot be done with a spin-ice-based description.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility that the theory described in this work could apply to Tb2Ti2O7 is lent weight by a recent attempt at parameterizing a pseudo-spin Hamiltonian for Tb2+xTi2xO7+y (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25) which places it close to the three-way phase boundary at which this spin-liquid emerges in our classical treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Spin-liquid behaviour at finite temperature does not rule out the possibility of an magnetic order at lower temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, recent experiments have demonstrated the presence of competing ordering phenomena in Tb2Ti2O7, with quadrupolar26,27 and short range ordered antiferromagnetic states12,28,29 being observed depending on the sample stoichiometry and experimental cooling protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the nature of the spin-liquid considered in our manuscript, which sits at the confluence of many competing orders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we note that the ground-state manifold of the spin-liquid contains states consistent with the q*=(±1/2,±1/2,±1/2) order observed under field cooled conditions12,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These states can only be connected to the other states of the spin-liquid by rotation of an  number of spins, where L is the linear size of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may suggest an explanation for the sensitivity to how the system is coolednamely that field cooling may drive the system into a state from which it is hard to reach the other parts of the ground-state manifold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The combination of spin-liquid physics and prominent features in the scattering along q||(1, 1, 1) is also strongly reminiscent of the discussion surrounding another pyrochlore: Yb2Ti2O7 (refs 30, 31, 32, 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it has recently been argued that the unusual physics of this material springs from competition between the E and T1 regions of the phase diagram in Fig 2a (refs 16, 35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, it is not unreasonable to imagine that the physics of the paramagnetic phase of Yb2Ti2O7 may be influenced by a nearby spin-liquid phase of the form described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This provides an interesting alternative scenario to quantum spin-ice physics in that material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One concern which arises, in any comparison with experiment, is the extent to which the validity of this theory depends on detailed, fine-tuning of parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At first sight, this might seem like a serious obstacle, since it is unlikely that any real material would exist exactly at the point where three different ordered phase meet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in practice, a moderate detuning of parameters is only likely to be important in determining the nature of the competing (classical) ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As long as experiments are carried out in the disordered phase, at a temperature such that violations of the constraint, equation (4), are rare, the long-wavelength physics will still be described by equation (11), and pinch lines can be observed, albeit with a finite width coming from thermal fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robustness of pinch lines against a finite density of thermally excited violations of equation (4) is evidenced by our Monte Carlo simulations (Fig 3c,f), which incorporate thermal excitations out of the spin-liquid ground-state manifold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at finite temperature, the signature features of the spin-liquid, including pinch lines, should remain observable for a finite region of parameter space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another important question is the way in which quantum fluctuations will affect the properties of the spin-liquid at low temperartures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the one case which is fully explored, quantum spin-ice, quantum tunnelling between different spin-ice configurations stabilizes a quantum spin-liquid ground state with the same U(1) gauge structure as the parent, classical spin-liquid36,37,38,39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, stronger off-diagonal exchange interactions between individual spins drive the system to order at low temperatures42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However in both cases, classical spin-liquid behaviour is still observed over long-length scales, at finite temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, studies of the quantum S=1/2 Heisenberg model on the pyrochlore lattice find similar spin correlations45,46,47 to those predicted by the gauge-theoretic description of the classical problem21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present case, the nature of the ground state in the presence of quantum fluctuations is an open problem, with both ordered and quantum spin-liquid phases a realistic possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the simplest estimate of the effect of quantum fluctuations, within linear spin-wave theory, suggests that the ground state is disordered for a finite range of parameters around the classically degenerate point16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And, given the large entropy associated with the classical spin-liquid, it seems likely that the system will retain many of its operational featuresincluding the extended pinch linesat finite temperature, regardless of its quantum ground state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The theory presented in this work provides a fundamentally different paradigm to the emergent electromagnetism known from spin-ice and possesses a gauge freedom bearing an intriguing similarity to that appearing in the linearized theory of general relativity.

the consequent singularities in their correlation functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These issues will be explored further elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The discovery of a classical spin-liquid is also a promising starting point to search for new quantum spin-liquid ground states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous experience suggests that most quantum spin-liquids are found in models close to a point of high classical degeneracy, and in the case of spin-ice the same gauge symmetry underpins both the classical and quantum spin-liquid states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore hope that this work can open the way for even richer physics to be discovered upon the inclusion of quantum fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we have demonstrated the existence of an unusual kind of classical spin-liquid
