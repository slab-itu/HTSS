Accelerated oral nanomedicine discovery from miniaturized screening to clinical production exemplified by paediatric HIV nanotherapies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Considerable scope exists to vary the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles, with subsequent impact on biological interactions; however, no accelerated process to access large nanoparticle material space is currently available, hampering the development of new nanomedicines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, no clinically available nanotherapies exist for HIV populations and conventional paediatric HIV medicines are poorly available; one current paediatric formulation utilizes high ethanol concentrations to solubilize lopinavir, a poorly soluble antiretroviral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we apply accelerated nanomedicine discovery to generate a potential aqueous paediatric HIV nanotherapy, with clinical translation and regulatory approval for human evaluation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our rapid small-scale screening approach yields large libraries of solid drug nanoparticles (160 individual components) targeting oral dose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Screening uses 1 mg of drug compound per library member and iterative pharmacological and chemical evaluation establishes potential candidates for progression through to clinical manufacture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wide applicability of our strategy has implications for multiple therapy development programmes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Nanomedicine has made significant impact to patients globally across disparate disease conditions ranging from schizophrenia and hypercholesterinemia to macular degeneration and various cancers; existing therapies include Doxil/Caelyx and Myocet for breast cancer, paliperidone palmitate for 3 monthly long-acting schizophrenia treatment, Visudyne for macular degeneration and Tricor for cholesterol management1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growing pipeline of candidate nanomedicines continues to have options at various development stages, moving towards the ranks of clinically proven medicines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanotherapies often utilize injectable nanocarriers that deliver drug cargoes directly to the bloodstream; however, daily injections are not practical in many clinical scenarios, such as chronic conditions requiring self-administration over a protracted period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such conditions render many nanomedicine approaches inappropriate, especially if disease is not restricted to targetable organs, creating a prerequisite for oral administration and requiring consideration of inter-related factors such as pharmacokinetics, patient adherence and pill burden.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these issues are exacerbated during paediatric administration where there is much less understanding4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Daily oral administration of modern antiretroviral (ARV) therapy has transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, access to ARVs is not universal and paediatric treatment formats still require improvement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The global burden of HIV continues to grow, with 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) statistics estimating 36.9 million people living with HIV, 2.6 million of which were children  less_than 15 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of 2014, an estimated 14.9 million people were receiving ARVs including only 32% of infected children.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to moderate progression of HIV to AIDS, in addition to 2 million new annual infections, places increasing demand on ARVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2015 WHO guidelines5 recommend therapy initiation for everyone living with HIV at any CD4 cell count in addition to daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis for at-risk populations, exacerbating supply pressure and stimulating therapy optimization strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although attrition processing of large drug particles down to smaller particle sizes, using techniques such as high-pressure homogenization or nanomilling2,6, has led to many Food and Drug Administration-approved oral nanomedicines utilizing solid drug nanoparticles (SDNs), there are currently no oral ARV nanotherapies available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it is not clear what chemical and physical parameters (for example, size, surface chemistry, charge, charge density and polydispersity) of SDNs will successfully achieve clinical target performance and attrition processing is labour and time intensive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While many nanotechnologies are being explored for HIV, the achievement of large-scale production, under clinical manufacturing conditions and at low cost, is often not addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In new cases of paediatric HIV infection ( less_than 3 years), a ritonavir (RTV)-boosted lopinavir (LPV) oral liquid formulation is WHO-recommended as a 4:1 LPV:RTV combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both LPV and RTV have low bioavailability with poor water solubility (1.92 and 1.26 mg l1, respectively) and substrate affinity for transporters and metabolic enzymes7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite its well-known side effects, RTV is required as a pharmacoenhancer to boost the pharmacokinetics of other ARVs that are substrates for p-glycoprotein and/or cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); a second drug, Cobicistat, is also approved as a booster for HIV therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For infants, the WHO-recommended twice-daily dose is 300 mg/75 mg LPV/RTV per m2 of body surface area, and a paediatric oral solution (80/20 mg ml1) is available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the poor water solubility of both drugs, the oral solution contains 42.4% (v/v) ethanol and 15.3% (w/v) propylene glycol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Administration may commence as early as 14 days after birth for prevention of mother-to-child transmission in HIV-positive mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, it would be preferential to avoid regular dosing of alcoholic mixtures, and viable strategies to remove RTV and/or alcohol are urgently required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanomedicine strategies may have a critical role to play in the formation of aqueous orally dosed paediatric therapies, but any strategy must allow rapid formation and evaluation of multiple SDN options and have cost and scalability at its core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recently reported emulsion-templated freeze-drying (ETFD)8, a non-attrition approach to the production of aqueous re-dispersible SDNs, and its application to the ARV efavirenz9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prototype nanomedicine exhibited higher pharmacokinetic exposure than a conventional preclinical formulation in rats after oral dosing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Herein, we describe the extension of this strategy to the accelerated discovery and translation of LPV and LPV/RTV combination SDNs with high drug loading relative to excipients (50 wt%) through a unique iterative cycle of materials chemistry and pharmacology, utilizing a novel high-throughput ETFD screening process, with scale of production subsequently achieved by clinically compliant spray-drying.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction to lead candidates with optimized drug loading, larger pilot-scale production and stability testing has enabled formation of a candidate LPV nanomedicine for imminent human clinical trials (EudraCT number 2013-004913-41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By generating a formulation library with variability in size, surface charge and surface chemistry during screening stages, the identification of optimal nanoparticle properties as they relate to the pharmacology is possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process is highly translatable and offers the rapid production, evaluation and optimization of cost-effective orally dosed drug nanoparticles to address unmet clinical needs across various diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'High-throughput screening of SDN candidates', 'SDN formation was initially studied using a miniaturized ETFD approach (Fig 1); a 160-component library screening process was developed to determine candidate polymer and surfactant combinations, focusing first on single LPV SDNs with 10 wt% drug loading relative to water-soluble excipients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oil-in-water emulsions were prepared from a chloroform (CHCl3)/water mixture with thorough emulsification utilizing externally focused ultrasonication to avoid cross-contamination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excipient stabilizers with wide chemical and structural diversity were chosen from the Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research list of inactive ingredients10, ensuring pre-existent use in clinically approved medicines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once sonicated, all volatile components were removed by freeze-drying to leave dry monolithic porous matrices of water-soluble excipients containing LPV SDNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monolith dispersion by addition of water (1 ml) led to the release of SDNs with stability derived from adsorption of the excipient polymers and surfactants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDN hydrodynamic diameters (Dz; Fig 2a), polydispersity indices (PDI) and zeta potentials (; Fig 2b) were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the serial formation of SDNs by attrition methods, the large number of SDNs successfully formed by ETFD required criteria to reduce the options to those most likely to succeed as scale-able nanomedicines including: (1) complete aqueous dispersion; (2) Dz less_than 1000, nm; (3) Dz s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  between repeated measurement  less_than 10% (n=3; Fig 2c,d); and (4) PDI less_than 0.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although varying criteria could be chosen to narrow the options for further study, these were selected to ensure investigation of monomodal distributions of stable particles in the sub-micron range, generated after rapid dispersion; larger multi-micron particles are able to be readily generated using alternative methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic of the high-throughput manufacture of LPV SDN options.Aqueous solutions containing binary polymer and surfactant combinations act as the continuous phase to stabilize oil-in-water emulsions containing LPV within the internal phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid freezing, followed by freeze-drying, forms re-dispersible solid monoliths comprising water-soluble excipients and poorly water-soluble drug nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed physical and pharmacological characterization of SDN dispersions allows identification of SDNs with clinical potential.Full size image', 'Figure 2: ETFD screening for LPV SDNs.Total solids per SDN 10 mg (10 wt% LPV, 60 wt% polymer and 30 wt% surfactant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were analysed by DLS (25 °C) after dispersion in water at 1 mg ml1 LPV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Dz measurement of initial screen (blanks=sample did not fully disperse).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Corresponding -values for successful SDNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Dz averages (n=3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) SDN reproducibility as % s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dz (n=3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Apical-to-basolateral permeation across Caco-2 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excipient combinations able to form SDNs at 50 wt% LPV loading are highlighted in red;

greater Dz variation was observed with changing surfactant across each polymer option (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and Kollicoat generated the most SDN candidates matching the selection criteria, presumably due to their surface active properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enable pharmacological evaluation, the 74 SDN candidates were each reproduced with integration of a tracer amount of 3H-radiolabelled LPV; this approach to the formation of radiolabelled SDNs is unique to ETFD to the best of the authors knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pharmacological evaluation of SDNs comprising 10 wt% LPV', 'High-throughput screening of LPV apical-to-basolateral permeation (A greater than B; gut to blood) across Caco-2 cells was utilized for selection of leads with favourable pharmacology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An aqueous LPV control showed A greater than B permeation of 3.5% per hour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the 74 LPV SDN candidates, most options showed comparable or greater A greater than B permeation (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SDNs containing PVA with either Tween 20 or Tween 80 showed  greater than 5.5-fold greater transcellular permeation (20.5% per h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, a number of LPV SDN formulations also showed reduced permeation; SDNs comprising Kollicoat and Tween 20 showed a 1.4-fold lower rate (2.7% per hour).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, accumulation and cytotoxicity in Caco-2 cells was assessed (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only two formulations showed cellular accumulation ratios (CAR) higher than the LPV aqueous solution (CAR=35.3); sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) and Brij58 (CAR=36.6), and NaCMC and hyamine (CAR=39.6), indicating that augmented intracellular drug delivery was not driving increased permeation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No increase in overt cytotoxicity was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The considerable diversity in pharmacological behaviour of the SDN library, generated from this single compound, strongly underlines the need for a wide ranging study of the multiple chemical and physical variables that dominate SDN interactions with biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only through library generation and subsequent pharmacological testing can new SDN nanomedicine options be substantially de-risked to allow the investment of time and resources for further development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Optimizing SDN candidate drug loading and excipient ratios', 'Increasing drug content within SDN lead options is critical to cost-effective production and reduction of exposure to unnecessary excipients, particularly surfactants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having established the potential for comparable or enhanced permeation through Caco-2 monolayers, and good reproducibility without compromising cytotoxicity, 49 candidates were chosen for progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A series of smaller libraries, restricted to the seven water-soluble surfactants and seven water-soluble polymers within the chosen 49 candidates, was generated with progressively increasing drug loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ETFD libraries targeting 50 wt% LPV utilized the same oil-to-water phase ratio (1:4) and polymer:surfactant wt% ratio (40:10) as initial screens; libraries targeting up to 70 wt% LPV employed a 20:10 polymer:surfactant wt% ratio and successful SDN dispersions were characterized using DLS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the initial screen containing 10 wt% LPV, libraries comprising 50 wt% LPV (Supplementary Fig 1; Supplementary Table 3) generated considerably fewer successful SDN options, with further reductions observed at a 70 wt% LPV loading (Supplementary Fig 2; Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polymers PVA, Kollicoat and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) successfully generated SDNs at 50 wt% LPV; however, Kollicoat was unsuccessful at 70 wt%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PVA proved to be the most successful polymer at high drug/excipient ratios, with HPMC also showing considerable promise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 49-component screen yielded six promising candidates at 70 wt% LPV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inability of various excipients to generate SDNs at high drug content is possibly due to a lack of interaction with particles during formation under the ETFD process or an inability to provide sufficient surface nanoparticle coverage after dispersion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each 49-component ETFD screen at 70 wt% LPV utilized 343 mg of drug, highlighting the importance of the initial 10 wt% screening process (160 mg LPV per 160-component library) to minimize drug use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The polymer:surfactant ratios within the seven most promising 70 wt% LPV SDN options were varied from a 1:2 to a 5:1 wt ratio (n=2) to minimize surfactant (Supplementary Fig 3; Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resultant SDNs varied in Dz (566984 nm) with near-neutral  values (11 to 18 mV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six 70 wt% LPV SDN formulations (Supplementary Table 6) were chosen for extended in vitro pharmacological evaluation due to their high drug loading and low surfactant content (5-10 wt%); these included binary mixtures of PVA:-tocopherol polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS), PVA:Tween 20 and PVA:sodium deoxycholate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPV SDN options containing HPMC were not progressed at this stage due to the variability that was seen when using different batches of this excipient; with robustness as a key commercial need, a detailed investigation of this variability was not conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Combination 70 wt% LPV/RTV SDN formulations', 'ETFD is uniquely able to generate multiple-component SDNs by combining two or more hydrophobic compounds within the internal oil phase11,12; other approaches to combination nanoparticle approaches have utilized lipid nanocarrier approaches for subcutaneous injection13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is of high clinical relevance for HIV due to the need for drug combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ETFD conditions for 70 wt% LPV SDNs were utilized to generate LPV/RTV dual-component SDNs through substitution of a fraction of the LPV with RTV to provide a 56:14 w/w, matching the current 4:1 w/w clinical products while maintaining relative drug:excipient wt ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we showed RTV SDNs display augmented inhibition of CYP3A4, offering the potential for RTV dose reduction14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, combination SDNs with 10:1 and 40:1 wt ratios (LPV/RTV) were also generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, very little variation in SDN formation and Dz was seen, but  values were observed to increase when substituting LPV with RTV (Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Monolith and nanodispersion characterization', 'The two lead SDN candidate formulations with good reproducibility, size and low surfactant content (70 wt% LPV and 56/14 wt% LPV/RTV, both with 20 wt% PVA and 10 wt% TPGS) were characterized in the solid state and as aqueous nanodispersions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term stability is critical to translation and stable dosing dispersions within the pharmacy would considerably enhance convenience of use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LPV has at least four known crystal polymorphs and solvates with the thermodynamically stable form (Form 1) being preferred in conventional solid dosing15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD) of the ETFD lead SDNs showed fully amorphous materials (Supplementary Fig 4a) with no observable crystallinity and no relevant variation in Dz,  or PDI was observed during the 6-month study (Supplementary Fig 4bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aqueous SDN dispersions showed good stability for 10 h after dispersion; Dz increased slightly (600 nm to 750 nm) over 3 h with no further change over 8 h, and no substantial PDI or  variation (approximately 15 mV; Supplementary Fig 4e-g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Good stability across a wide pH range 2.59.5 (Supplementary Fig 4h) was seen with the expected  variation indicating predominantly steric stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar investigations of LPV/RTV combination SDN monoliths and aqueous dispersions showed similar chemical and physical behaviour;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The treatment of HIV requires oral dosing as the only patient-acceptable daily administration option.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic oral dosing has significant complications that arise from the high pill burden experienced by many patients across populations with varying conditions leading to subsequent non-adherence to regimens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent evaluation of HIV patient groups have shown a willingness to switch to nanomedicine alternatives if benefits can be shown19 and research efforts focused on the development of long-acting subcutaneous and intramuscular injections, using SDNs produced via milling approaches, may address many oral dosing challenges20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, until long-acting combination therapies are available orally dosed ARVs will continue to be mainstay therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Orally dosed SDNs have been successfully deployed for many disease conditions and the use of appropriate SDNs for HIV is a natural progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circulating SDNs are not expected to be present after gut absorption and, in our current study, the SDN benefits are likely derived from benefits in the intestine without reliance on added solvents; as suggested by their stability at varying pH (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5), the SDNs are expected to remain as intact nanoparticles in the intestine, thereby presenting the observed benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles in rodents are very encouraging and offer the ability to provide a novel aqueous dosing format at identical dosing levels, but without the use of ethanol and with the storage benefits of a re-dispersible solid, in contrast to the current liquid product containing volatile solvents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the data are highly promising, the rat studies presented here do not necessarily correlate directly to human adult, or paediatric, PK behaviour and the full opportunities for SDNs of ARVs will only be truly seen after oral dosing to humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the single-component LPV SDNs have been progressed to clinical manufacturing scale, opportunities may also be available for the combination LPV/RTV SDNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the maintenance of Cmin with reduced LPV Cmax and reduced overall exposure to RTV observed in rat studies may be important in the context of concentration-dependent and chronic-exposure toxicities for these drugs21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also worth noting that early screening identified formulations with the potential for augmented exposure but for the purposes of this project, and simplified regulatory acceptance, a single-component LPV paediatric formulation with the potential for bioequivalence in an entirely aqueous format is being progressed to clinical evaluation (EudraCT number 2013-004913-41) due to the pressing clinical need for ethanol-free therapy options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Preliminary ESD studies to establish commercially relevant manufacture of combination SDNs were successful through simple substitution of 20 wt% of LPV with RTV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the clinical LPV/RTV solid-dose formulation (Kaletra) is processed by melt extrusion and the paediatric liquid formulation has limited shelf-life of 2 months (at 25 °C) if not refrigerated, making this option non-ideal for use in sub-Saharan Africa22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The increasing demand for ARV manufacture is a growing concern and the data generated for the SDNs studied here do not appear to offer routes to decrease oral dose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the nanomedicine options presented are cheap to produce in a simple manufacturing process, and have a demonstrated 6-month shelf-life at elevated temperature that should allow a reduction in distribution costs with a predicted decrease in waste.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The strategy described throughout this study is explicitly illustrated in Fig 4, and has a number of key benefits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, it is clear that the ETFD screening strategy allows for a large number of SDN nanoparticle options to be generated and rapidly assessed for chemical and physical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is unique within our accelerated strategy as hundreds of SDN options may be generated within days, allowing for multiple options to be removed from the evaluation process, in contrast to the relatively small number of SDN options that could be studied in an identical period using homogenization or nano-milling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, it is also clear that the libraries of SDNs behave very differently pharmacologically and it would be impossible to predict which initial combination of excipients would provide the appropriate size, surface charge, stability and permeability to provide the best options for further study; in essence, by generating and testing the large number of options, any discipline prejudice is removed and the SDNs select themselves for progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is important as a conventional serial approach is unlikely to identify optimum materials from limited data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Candidate SDN progression strategy.Accelerated approach taken to address unmet clinical needs with oral nanomedicines, from library screening through to preclinical confirmation of benefits, formulation optimization and regulatory translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid lines show the progression of candidates through the evaluation process, which incorporates preclinical pharmacology into key selection points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Areas of intense iteration between materials synthesis and pharmacological validation are shown by dashed lines.Full size image', 'The number of potential options identified does present a series of issues as seen in Fig 2e; options to enhance bioavailability were present within the initial gut-model permeation evaluation but the target within this study was the generation of bioequivalent options that would presumably avoid potential complications that can arise from fundamentally new absorption and bio-distribution as seen with some previous clinically accepted nanomedicines23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the screening process allowed multiple optimization steps to be simultaneously attempted to increase drug loading relative to excipients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If conducted in a stepwise and serial manner, this parallel approach would have taken considerably longer to achieve very high loadings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the progression to clinical manufacture through ESD has created a commercially viable nanotherapy, identified through library-based screening utilizing just 1 mg per library sample and translated to near-kg scale production ready for human trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has considerable implications for future SDN-based nanomedicine development programmes as the timescale of initial laboratory screening to human evaluation ( less_than 4 years) should provide a pathway for acceleration of a range of new therapeutic opportunities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time of manuscript preparation, the authors have received UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approval for human bioequivalence trials and will be commencing dosing to healthy volunteers in the near future.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
