Structure of the full-length TRPV2 channel by cryo-EM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins form a superfamily Ca2+-permeable cation channels regulated by a range of chemical and physical stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural analysis of a minimal TRP vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1) elucidated a mechanism of channel activation by agonists through changes in its outer pore region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though homologous to TRPV1, other TRPV channels (TRPV26) are insensitive to TRPV1 activators including heat and vanilloids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further understand the structural basis of TRPV channel function, we determined the structure of full-length TRPV2 at 5 Å resolution by cryo-electron microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like TRPV1, TRPV2 contains two constrictions, one each in the pore-forming upper and lower gates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The agonist-free full-length TRPV2 has wider upper and lower gates compared with closed and agonist-activated TRPV1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose these newly revealed TRPV2 structural features contribute to diversity of TRPV channels.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Local and global Ca2+ transients tightly regulate diverse cellular events such as gene transcription, cell motility, muscle contraction and sensory transduction1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Twenty-eight mammalian TRP homologues from six subfamilies (TRPV, TRPM, TRPC, TRPA, TRPP and TRPML) are essential Ca2+-permeable channels, many of which are activated by chemical agonists2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TRPV subfamily consists of six members (TRPV16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRPV1 is the most commonly studied TRPV channel and is activated by noxious heat, and endogenous and exogenous vanilloids3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures of a minimal rat TRPV1 construct in ligand-free and -bound states determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have provided tremendous insight into the conformational dynamics of channel opening on ligand activation5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining members of the TRPV subfamily (TRPV26) share 3050% sequence similarity with TRPV1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7); nevertheless they are vanilloid insensitive and play a minimal role in temperature sensation8,9,10,11, suggesting that minimal TRPV1 is only partly representative of the other TRPV subfamily members.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TRPV2 is a member of the TRPV subfamily and shares 50% sequence identity with TRPV1 (refs 7, 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it differs from TRPV1 in its overall cellular function7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While heterologously expressed and endogenous TRPV1 localizes to the plasma membrane (Supplementary Fig 1a,c) and is activated by noxious heat and endogenous and exogenous vanilloids3,4, heterologously expressed TRPV2 predominantly localizes to intracellular membranes13 (Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, TRPV2 does not respond to heat or vanilloids in vivo8,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In embryonic DRG neurons and other neuronal cell lines, endogenous TRPV2 shows a punctate distribution within the soma and axons and colocolizes with Rab7, a late endosomal marker, where it promotes neuronal outgrowth downstream of neurotrophin signalling14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In heterologous expression systems, TRPV2 activity was shown to be increased by exogenous small molecules such as 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and probenecid, and blocked by ruthenium red and Gd3,7,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We previously found that recombinant TRPV2 reconstituted in artificial liposomes displayed current in the presence of probenecid that was blocked by Gd16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, physiological regulators of TRPV2 and other TRPV channels remain unknown7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that post-translational modifications, lipidprotein interactions and proteinprotein interactions may regulate the function of these channels2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) levels in the membrane may modulate TRPV2 activity17, and direct phosphorylation of TRPV2 by extracellular-signal-regulated kinases has been shown to regulate TRPV2 expression and activity14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detailed structural analysis of TRPV2 may provide deeper insight into the cellular function of TRPV2, which has been elusive since its discovery7,12,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report the structure of full-length rat TRPV2 at 5 Å resolution determined by cryo-EM single particle reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our structure reveals a pore region with two constrictions or gates as observed in other TRP channels5,6,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of ligands, TRPV2 displays wider upper and lower gates compared with closed and agonist-activated TRPV1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results further our understanding of the diverse functional regulation of the TRPV subfamily of channels.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Structural determination of full-length TRPV2', 'Our previous cryo-EM structure of full-length rat TRPV2 provided a structure at 13.6 Å, which revealed the general architecture of TRPV subfamily members16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This moderate resolution structure, however, did not yield a detailed understanding of the TRPV2 channel structure and function16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent progress in direct electron-counting technology20 and statistical image processing21 has allowed us to determine the structure of TRPV2 in the absence of ligand (apo-TRPV2) to 5 Å, resolving strands in  sheets and some bulky side chains of amino acid residues (Fig 1, Supplementary Movies and Supplementary Figs 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual particles are apparent in the micrographs (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Details of the full-length channel are visible in the two-dimensional (2D) class averages (Supplementary Fig 2b) and the final 3D reconstructed map shows a tetrameric assembly (Supplementary Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the cryo-EM map, we are able to build models for all transmembrane (TM) helices (S1S6), the pore helix, the selectivity filter, the N-terminal linker and a portion of the C terminus of the channel using the previously published TRPV1 atomic models5,6 as homology models (Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 5 and see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All six N-terminal ankyrin repeats of the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) are clearly resolved, suggesting that the ARD is a rigid, stable domain in full-length TRPV2 (Fig 1; Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the expression of full-length TRPV2, density accounting for the first 73 residues of the N terminus (Met 1Asp 73), the S1S2 linker (Ile 422Gly 430), the pore turret (Glu 561Leu 594) and the last 46 residues of the C terminus (Glu 716Pro 761) are not apparent in the cryo-EM map (Fig 1a; grey), suggesting that these regions are flexible or disordered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Single particle

be similar to the structures of other TRP channels, as well as distantly related voltage- and ligand-gated channels6,19,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2D class averages and the final 3D reconstructed map of TRPV2 unambiguously show a tetrameric assembly similar to TRPV1 (Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like TRPV1 and TRPA1, the pore of apo-TRPV2 consists of two constrictions or gates5,6,19: an upper gate resides at the selectivity filter in the outer pore region of the channel and a lower gate is comprised of the distal end of S6 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more detailed structural analysis of the apo-TRPV2 pore domain unexpectedly revealed that the upper and lower constrictions are wider than the homologous sites of TRPV1 (Gly 643 and Ile 679) in the absence of ligand (apo-TRPV1) with distances of 12.4 Å and 16.1 Å when measured CC at the upper and lower constrictions, respectively (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of apo-TRPV1 was proposed to comprise a state in which both the upper and lower gates are closed6 (Fig 2b), whereas in the presence of the agonists resiniferatoxin (RTX) and double-knot toxin (RTX/DkTxTRPV1) both gates are open5,6 (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a structure of TRPV1 in the presence of capsaicin consists of a closed upper gate and partially open lower gate (Fig 2c), and may represent an intermediate conformation of the channel5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper gate of apo-TRPV2 is wider than the closed upper gate of TRPV1 (apo- and capsaicinTRPV1), as well as the open upper gate of TRPV1 (RTX/DkTxTRPV1; Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the lower gate of apo-TRPV2 has a larger CC distance compared with TRPV1 in all states, including the open lower gate in RTX/DkTxTRPV1 (14.4 Å; Fig 2bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the TRPV2 channel can accommodate partially hydrated Ca2+, Na+ and K+ ions26, as well as large organic cations27 in the apo state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

dynamics simulations based on closed and open structures of TRPV1 predicted that channel opening results from a sequence of conformational changes beginning in the intracellular ARDs, followed by allosteric changes in the upper gate then the lower gate, including a quaternary twist of the pore domain relative to the intracellular domain28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore compared the position of the apo-TRPV2 ARD with apo-TRPV1 and RTX/DkTxTRPV1 to gain further insights into the apo-TRPV2 structure (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upward shift of the ARD is apparent between apo-TRPV1 and RTX/DkTxTRPV1 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our comparison showed that position of the apo-TRPV2 ARD lies between apo-TRPV1 and RTX/DkTxTRPV1 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we compared the position of the pore helix of apo-TRPV2 relative to the central axis of the channel as it has been proposed that twist of the pore helix in the RTX/DkTxTRPV1 structure contributes to opening of the upper gate (Fig 3b)5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pore helix of RTX/DkTxTRPV1 shows a clockwise twist relative to apo-TRPV1 (Fig 3b), while the position of the apo-TRPV2 pore helix again falls between apo-TRPV1 and RTX/DkTxTRPV1 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the position of the apo-TRPV2 S5 helix resembles that of the RTX/DkTxTRPV1 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these results suggest that in our cryo-EM structure of the apo-TRPV2 channel, the positions of the ARDs and the pore helix differ from both apo-TRPV1 and RTX/DkTxTRPV1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Comparison of the ankyrin repeat

outer pore region of full-length TRPV2', 'TRPV1 and TRPV2 share high-sequence identity throughout the S5, S6, pore helix and selectivity filter (GlyMetGlyAsp/Glu).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, TRPV1 and TRPV2 are non-selective cation channels with varying Ca2+ selectivity (PCa2+/PNa+=10 for TRPV1 and PCa2+/PNa+=3 for TRPV2)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed structural divergence in the upper gates in the outer pore region between apo-TRPV1 and apo-TRPV2 (Fig 2) may explain the differences in cation selectivity between the two channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in pore architecture observed in this analysis of apo-TRPV1 and apo-TRPV2 may be due to inherent structural differences between these two proteins7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the TM domain of the proteins was stabilized in different manners during the purification process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While apo-TRPV1 and ligand-bound TRPV1 were stabilized in A835 amphipol5,6,29,30,31, TRPV2 was purified using the maltose neopentyl glycol (MNG) class of detergents16,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in the biochemical preparations may have enabled the TRPV preparations to sample different conformational states, resulting in the observed divergence in the channel architectures29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is also possible that the truncations necessary for stabilization of minimal subunit TRPV1 led to alterations in the pore architecture of the TRPV1 structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, a 30 amino acid loop connecting S5 with the pore helix, known as the pore turret (Fig 4a), has been implicated in channel gating, large organic cation permeation and pore dilation33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of key residues within the TRPV1 pore turret (Gly 618 and Ser 629), which are conserved in TRPV2 (Gly 582 and Ser 592; Fig 4a), altered the permeability of TRPV1 to large cations33, indicating that the pore turret contributes to expansion of the upper gate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stabilization of TRPV1 for cryo-EM studies required deletion of the pore turret region5,6, while in the present work we employed full-length TRPV2 where the turret region is intact, although poorly resolved due to its flexibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homology modelling predicts that deletion of the turret region in the TRPV1 structures would alter the pore region architecture34, thus possibly accounting for some of the observed differences in pore architecture between TRPV1 and TRPV2 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that truncation of the pore turret domain in TRPV2 (TRPV2 564589) at sites comparable to minimal subunit TRPV1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6; Fig 4a) had little effect on protein expression (Fig 4b, Supplementary Fig 9a), localization (Fig 4c) and cell surface levels (Fig 4d, Supplementary Fig 9b) compared with TRPV2 WT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, expression of TRPV2 564589 ablated the Ca2+ response to 2-APB, an exogenous TRPV2 activator35, compared with cells expressing TRPV2 WT (Fig 4e).

Supplementary Fig 7c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these observations, it was suggested that lipid binding in this region of the channel could play a role in modulation of channel function36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe densities in a similar region similar to that in apo-TRPV1 and RTX/DkTxTRPV1 (Supplementary Fig 7c,d), which may represent lipid molecules that were co-purified with full-length rat TRPV2 (Supplementary Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another possible lipid density was observed in the truncated rabbit TRPV2 between S4, the S4S5 linker and S6 of an adjacent subunit (Supplementary Fig 8a) located in a similar position as the RTX molecule in the RTX/DkTxTRPV1 structure (Supplementary Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a weak lipid density was observed in the apo-TRPV1 structure5,6,36 (Supplementary Fig 8c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was proposed that localization of the lipid molecules under physiological conditions in this region of TRPV1 and TRPV2 is conserved, and exchange of lipid molecules and lipophilic ligands lead to stabilization of the open state of the channels36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not observe a lipid density in this region of our structure of the full-length rat TRPV2 purified without added lipids (Supplementary Fig 8d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the positions of the S4 helix, S4S5 linker and S6 of an adjacent subunit in the full-length rat TRPV2 are different from the positions in the truncated rabbit TRPV2 (Supplementary Fig 8d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While in the full-length TRPV2, the S4 helix adopted conformation similar to that of apo-TRPV1 (Supplementary Fig 8e), the S4 helix of truncated rabbit TRPV2 favours the position of RTX/DkTxTRPV1 (Supplementary Fig 8f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observed structural difference suggests that interaction of this region of the TRPV channels with lipids (either physiological or added during purification) is dynamic and possibly affects channel function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that we observed a wider pore for full-length rat TRPV2 without added lipid is consistent with the hypothesis that added lipid promotes a desensitized state for truncated rabbit TRPV2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, differences in the structures of full-length TRPV2 and truncated TRPV2 may also be due to a number of variables, including inherent structural differences between TRPV orthologues, deletions of N- and C-terminal amino acids in addition to truncation of the pore turret and differences in biochemical protein preparation for cryo-EM.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#
