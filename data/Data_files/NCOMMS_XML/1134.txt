Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Nanophotonics is a rapidly developing field of research with many suggestions for a design of nanoantennas, sensors and miniature metadevices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite many proposals for passive nanophotonic devices, the efficient coupling of light to nanoscale optical structures remains a major challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this article, we propose a nanoscale laser based on a tightly confined anapole mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By harnessing the non-radiating nature of the anapole state, we show how to engineer nanolasers based on InGaAs nanodisks as on-chip sources with unique optical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leveraging on the near-field character of anapole modes, we demonstrate a spontaneously polarized nanolaser able to couple light into waveguide channels with four orders of magnitude intensity than classical nanolasers, as well as the generation of ultrafast (of 100 fs) pulses via spontaneous mode locking of several anapoles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anapole nanolasers offer an attractive platform for monolithically integrated, silicon photonics sources for advanced and efficient nanoscale circuitry.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In recent years, significant efforts have been devoted to realize nanoscale sources of coherent light aiming at filling the gap between photonics and electronics for both classical and quantum applications1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fundamental advances have been recently reported in semiconductordielectric heterojunctions, where nanolasers from direct bandgap materials have been demonstrated18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further progress with these materials requires to address many fundamental challenges, originating when the miniaturization of optical circuitry is pushed to the nanoscale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first problem comes from the diffraction limit of light that introduces significant radiative losses that are detrimental and severely limit the performance of nanoscale devices21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second issue is represented by the efficient coupling of light from nanophotonics sources, whose emission is strongly nondirectional22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these problems originate from the fact that conventional optical sources couple energy to classical radiating states that are all diffraction limited and difficult to control at the nanoscale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An intriguing idea is to introduce a nanolaser design concept based on states of matter with unconventional radiation properties that can overcome the aforementioned limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  States with non-conventional emission of energy have been recently demonstrated in specific types of all-dielectric nanoparticles, realized in both silicon and germanium semiconductors23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under specific conditions, the superposition of internal modes of these nanostructures can generate radiation-less states, called anapoles, that are scattering-free and invisible to the propagation of the electromagnetic fields26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A fundamental question is whether it is possible to employ a non-radiating state of matter, such as an anapole, to engineer a coherent light source based on stimulated light amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility to achieve nonlinear amplification of an anapole state is counterintuitive, due to the lack of any optical feedback from a scattering-free state that is totally invisible to a far-field observer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if such interaction could be successfully triggered, we would have at disposal a new type of source that is not limited by diffraction or any of the aforementioned problems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By using rigorous first-principle simulations on the quantum electrodynamics of photons, here we show that the lightmatter interaction in a nanolaser emitting at the anapole frequency gives rise to a surprisingly stable steady state, where light energy is strongly collected within the anapole and evanescently transmitted in a subwalength area outside the nanostructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By leveraging on tunnelling effects and mutual synchronization, we illustrate that such anapole nanolaser opens a large manifold of applications, ranging from efficient and polarization controlled energy coupling, to ultrafast pulse generation without the need of external design elements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anapole nanolasers hold the promise to be an ideal energy source for nanoscale optics in silicon-compatible platforms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Design of an anapole-based nanolaser', 'To illustrate the concept of anapole-based nanolaser (see Fig 1), we consider an all-dielectric resonator composed of a semiconductor nanodisk that is optically pumped in the same scheme of a classical laser28,29,30,31, with energy decaying in one -or more- indirect transitions to a final energy state (see Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike a conventional laser, however, in our design the stimulated emission (see Fig 1b red arrow) amplifies an anapole state, which can be identified by a dip in the scattering cross section of the structure (Fig 1c, blue line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anapole mode is generated by the superposition of electric and toroidal dipoles24, which produces an electromagnetic mode that is confined in the interior of the nanodisk and does not radiate in the far-field (see Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the scheme illustrated in Fig 1, the energy down-converted by stimulated emission at the anapole frequency excites electric and toroidal dipoles that interfere destructively in the far-field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to lasers based on dark modes, this scheme is not based on resonant states, nor does it require non-radiative energy transitions in order to allow the generation of radiation-less states in purely dielectric materials28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to bound states in the continuum (BIC) lasers recently proposed30,31, the anapole laser does not require extended structures and the radiation-less state is excited with no additional radiating components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Concept of anapole nanolaser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Three-dimensional representation of an anapole nanolaser composed by a direct bandgap semiconductor (black nanodisk) that is optically pumped from the top (green arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Energy diagram of light amplification via stimulated emission in a direct bandgap semiconductor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Amplification scheme in frequency domain of the anapole nanolaser, where the stimulated emission (solid red line) coincides with the scattering dip (solid blue line) associated to an anapole state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Spatial distribution of the electric field inside the nanodisk at the anapole frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of circulating patterns (white arrows) suppresses far-field radiation and generates a scattering-free anapole state whose energy is confined inside the nanostructure.Full size image', 'We design an integrated anapole source starting from standard InxGa1xAs semiconductor that is obtained by combining InAs and GaAs and is a direct bandgap semiconductor that is silicon compatible for monolithic integration19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the electrical or optical excitation of carriers, the materials sustain stimulated emission of radiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the optical properties and the emission frequency can be tuned by varying on the molar concentration x of InAs in the compound32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a illustrates the bandgap energy of InxGa1xAs as a function of the Indium molar fraction x.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in the figure, the emission of the material can be tuned in a large bandwidth from 873 nm in the near infrared to 3.6 m in the infrared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our analysis, we consider a molar fraction x=0.15, corresponding to an emission wavelength 0=948 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value x=0.15 is a standard concentration of InAs that allows monolithic integration directly on silicon, as reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to that, In0.15Ga0.85As is characterized by low losses in the proximity of the emission frequency 0, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Design of anapole nanolaser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Tunability of the direct bandgap of InxGa(1x)As as a function of the molar ratio x of InAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Pseudocolour plot of the scattering cross-section Csca of an In0.15Ga0.85As nanodisk for a varying disk diameter d and of the incident wavelength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The incident field is linearly polarized along the Ex direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The white dashed line highlights the region where the scattering is suppressed by the presence of anapole states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Scattering cross-section for an In0.15Ga0.85As nanodisk of diameter d=440 nm and height h=100 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these choice of parameters, the anapole wavelength coincides with the semiconductor emission wavelength 0 (red arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red shaded area shows the Lorentzian gain profile of the In0.15Ga0.85As semiconductor that is entirely contained in the scattering suppression region.Full size image', 'Figure 2b illustrates the scattering cross-section Csca33 of a nanodisk of In0.15Ga0.85As with height 100 nm and different values of diameter d.

near infrared for In0.15Ga0.85As nanodisks, is sustained by the presence of non-radiating anapole states that do not possess far-field emission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further confirmed by the multipole decomposition of the electromagnetic fields as a function of the incident wavelength for a nanodisk with diameter d=440 nm and height h=100 nm (Supplementary Figs 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2d presents the scattering cross-section spectrum for a nanodisk with diameter d=440 nm and height h=100 nm, whose anapole wavelength coincides with the emission wavelength of the

the nanodisk for the pump beam, the pump wavelength can be placed on a scattering maximum of the nanodisk (see Fig 2c, green arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the proximity of the anapole frequency, the scattering of the structure is strongly suppressed within a bandwidth of 50 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is larger than the amplification bandwidth of the In0.15Ga0.85As semiconductor that is 20 nm (see

effect is limited to few lattice sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to reduce lattice-mismatch non-idealities, the InGaAs layer can be growth by using IIIV semiconductors on a lattice-matched substrate, and then transferred on a low-refractive index substrate that is compatible with Si technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the proposed x=0.15 concentration of Indium, the InGaAs is lattice matched to both InP and GaAs that could be used as ultrathin epitaxial growth substrates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By introducing a sacrificial layer (for example, AlAs), the InGaAs/GaAs or InGaAs/InP substrate is easily transferred to a low-refractive substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such technique is widely used in the fabrication of IIIV semiconductor nanolasers on silicon platforms, as discussed in refs 35, 36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our choice of InGaAs for the anapole laser also opens the possibility to design electrically pumped systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this topic clearly falls beyond the scope of this article, some points can be highlighted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To realize an electrically pumped anapole laser, the main point is to design a semiconductor heterostructure that ensures three-dimensional (3D) confinement of the anapole mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible solution is to consider a coreshell geometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26, anapole states can be excited in coreshell structures by acting on the multilayer thicknesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By employing this strategy, an electrically pumped anapole laser can be composed of InGaAs/GaAs or InGaAs/InP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This structure, after adding top and bottom electrodes for electric carriers injection, can provide an initial setup for an electrically pumped anapole laser, where the anapole state is generated in the intrinsic layer InGaAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another important point is the optical footprint of the electrical circuitry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this extent, dielectric conductors such as indium tin oxide are preferred to metal contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of dielectric contacts helps in minimizing optical losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An intriguing possibility is the introduction of graphene-based contact layers or nanowires, such as the ones proposed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37, that is a promising design for a room-temperature electrically pumped anapole laser.

description of resonant laser cavities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resonant states are in fact observed in the spectral response as Lorentzian energy peaks with full width half maximum equal to 0/Q, with 0 being the resonant frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An anapole state does not possess a Lorentzian shape and is conversely observed in points of the spectrum where the scattering cross-section vanishes.

finite-difference time-domain (MB-FDTD) (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This technique has proven to furnish extremely realistic results that have been verified against many experiments38,39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our simulations, we modelled the exact dispersion curve of the In0.15Ga0.85As (see Supplementary Fig 1), and we assumed a Lorentzian-shaped gain profile with a dephasing time of =40 ps, whose value has been experimentally measured in refs 18, 34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3 summarizes our 3D results for a pumping beam linearly polarized along the x axis and perpendicular to the nanodisk axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these simulations we considered a nanodisk of In0.15Ga0.85As with diameter 440 nm and height 100 nm, exposed to different pumping rates that are measured through the density of carriers 0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a,b report the intensity and the linewidth of the electromagnetic field of the anapole state amplified inside the nanodisk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behaviour of the anapole amplitude versus pumping rate (see Fig 3a,b) is that of a standard laser, with a linear relationship between pumping rate and amplified intensity (see Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in plasmonic and dielectric nanoparticle lasers18,42, the amplification of anapole states directly follows from stimulated amplification as a balance between field enhancement in the gain material and the system losses, including absorption and near-field energy leakage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anapole laser also shows an equivalent SchawlowTownes linewidth (see Fig 3b) that quickly reaches a stable value of 2 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is in accordance with experiments on lasing emission from InGaAs nanostructures18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carrier threshold density to lasing, observed in Fig 3a, depends on the pumping rate 0 that is proportional to the population inversion density, or equivalently, to the input pumping rate of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By increasing the latter, we

scenario if compared with a classical nanolaser.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emitted field is in fact totally confined within the nanodisk resonator, with electromagnetic energy decaying exponentially outside the nanodisk region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of far-field emission provides a characteristic signature of the anapole state that is being amplified through stimulate emission, and is the hallmark of a new type of near-field nanolaser that does not radiate in the far field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inside the nanodisk, we observe that the electromagnetic energy distribution preserves the dipolar shape of the linear anapole state (see Supplementary Fig 7) that is perpendicular to the polarization of the pumping field Ex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the correlation between the energy distribution of the anapole state amplified in Fig 3ce and that of an ideal anapole in a lossless InGaAs structure, obtaining a correlation amplitude of 96.1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shows that the anapole laser amplifies through stimulated emission an almost ideal radiation-less anapole state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25 provide an in-depth analysis of the

applications43,44,45,46, is quite a challenging task for nanoscale sources and it is in general addressed with the introduction of metals and/or specific geometries47,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By employing anapole sources we can introduce a new design concept that can be easily integrated into two-dimensional circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4 illustrates our idea, where we consider a nanodisk of In0.15Ga0.85As with 440 nm diameter and 100 nm height placed in proximity of silicon nanowires of width 150 nm and thickness 100 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanowires are distributed in cross configuration, with the anapole nanolaser placed at the intersection point of the circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the incident beam impinges on the anapole with linear polarization (see Fig 4a), it excites the corresponding anapole state with localized dipolar field aligned perpendicularly to the pump polarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This depends on the fact that the energy distribution of the anapole, resulting from the near-field interference between electric and toroidal dipoles, is strongly asymmetric in one spatial direction orthogonal to the input polarization (please see Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the anapole is nonlinearly amplified by stimulated emission, the input pump polarization selectively excites the corresponding symmetry direction, leading to different energy distributions in the final anapole state (see Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electromagnetic field distribution of the anapole couples only into the channels that overlap with the anapole mode, routing light according to the polarization of the input field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4b reports a volumetric mapping of the spatial distribution of the electromagnetic energy at steady state and illustrate this dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The near-field characteristics of the anapole allows electromagnetic energy to be efficiently coupled inside nanowire channels even of such a small size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate this functionality more quantitatively, we considered the same scenario with a standard nanolaser, characterized by a classical spherical nanoparticle with diameter d=448 nm and resonance at 948 nm (Fig 4e, inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4c illustrates the outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the strongly radiating nature of the components amplified in the nanoparticle, light scatters almost everywhere without coupling in the nanowire channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By measuring at the light energy in the nanowire channels, we observe that with an anapole nanolaser we have four orders of magnitude more energy inside the channel with respect to the standard nanoparticle laser (see Fig 4d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such remarkable result depends on the fact that an anapole nanolaser enables by design near-field energy coupling, a mechanism that is extremely efficient in transferring energy in neighbouring structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Supplementary Fig 8 we considered in detail the comparison with another integrated lasing structure, namely a nanodisk with the same size of the anapole laser but now set to emit at 1,125 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this wavelength, the structure shows a strongly dipolar energy emission that well couples with the fundamental mode of the nanowire channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case the energy couples inside all

train of pulses, as shown in Fig 5e where we report the emitted intensity at the end of a 5 m waveguide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 5f provides a zoomed view of a single pulse, characterized by an ultrashort duration t=95 fs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectrum of the electric field (see Fig 5g) well illustrates the locking of the various emitted frequencies around the amplification band edge of the In0.15Ga0.85As semiconductor (see Fig 5g dashed line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By extracting the mode spacing =4 × 1012 rad s1 and their spectral amplitudes, it is possible to compare the emitted intensity predicted by equation (2) that shows perfect agreement with the results from first-principle calculations (see Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the mode-locking mechanism is a stable and repeatable feature of the system, as we verified by performing a statistical campaign of 50 distinct simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the stochastic properties of quantum noise, each simulation corresponds to a different set of initial conditions for the phases of the nanolasers along the chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The dynamical model described by equation (1) of the anapole chain suggests that the number of anapole that becomes synchronized can be changed by acting on the coupling matrix elements Cmn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is stimulated by the similitude of equation (1) and the dynamics of oscillatory neural networks55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simple calculations on equation (1) show that in the case where the connection matrix is suitably engineered to possess real eigenvalues  with orthogonal eigenvectors, the populations converge to the same value Nn(t)= and all oscillators tend to synchronize their phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This case is numerically illustrated in Supplementary Fig 9e,f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the anapole chain, coupling coefficients can be altered by acting on the geometric topology of the array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A thorough analysis on this topic goes beyond the scope of this article, and is deferred to a future specialized work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We will here consider a simple and illustrative case, where we shift by 6° the anapole array along the direction y (see Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this configuration the emission dynamics exhibits the appearance of a larger number of synchronized frequencies in the spectrum (see Fig 6e), and the stable emission of a pulse train of period 1.65 ps (see Fig 6c) and pulse duration 145 fs (see Fig 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6b shows a section along the z plane of the energy energy distribution in the structure, and well illustrates the mechanism of formation of the energy pulses inside the waveguide channel by the complex interactions among the different anapoles.

emission spectra of Figs 5g and 6e we observe that the dynamics of mode locking in the anapole nanolasers involve the selective locking of different spectral frequencies that vary in number and position according to the spatial configuration considered (linear in Fig 5 versus shifted array in Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result opens interesting possibilities to use complex anapole arrays as sources for future optical integrated neurocomputers55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mode-locking dynamics of Figs 5 and 6 is a characteristic feature of anapoles that is not observed in conventional nanoparticle lasers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 10 reports the results for nanoparticles with diameter 448 nm, arranged in the same geometry of Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case there is no pulse generation: the collective emission does not mutually synchronize and very little energy is coupled into the nanowire.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
