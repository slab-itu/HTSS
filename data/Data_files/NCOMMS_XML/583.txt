Nicotinamide is an endogenous agonist for a C. elegans TRPV OSM-9 and OCR-4 channel  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'TRPV ion channels are directly activated by sensory stimuli and participate in thermo-, mechano- and chemo-sensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are also hypothesized to respond to endogenous agonists that would modulate sensory responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the nicotinamide (NAM) form of vitamin B3 is an agonist of a Caenorhabditis elegans TRPV channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes, we demonstrate that NAM is a soluble agonist for a channel consisting of the well-studied OSM-9 TRPV subunit and relatively uncharacterized OCR-4 TRPV subunit as well as the orthologous Drosophila Nan-Iav TRPV channel, and we examine stoichiometry of subunit assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that behaviours mediated by these C. elegans and Drosophila channels are responsive to NAM, suggesting conservation of activity of this soluble endogenous metabolite on TRPV activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results in combination with the role of NAM in NAD+ metabolism suggest an intriguing link between metabolic regulation and TRPV channel activity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'TRPV channels are non-specific cation channels that are expressed in specialized sensory neurons as well as some non-sensory cells1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They mediate behavioural responses to exogenous chemical, mechanical and temperature stimuli3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, endogenous modulators of TRPV channel activity are also important for regulation of behavioural responses6,7, and identification of cellular metabolites that impact channel activity is of interest for revealing potential links between sensory function and metabolic state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TRPV family proteins assemble as homomeric or heteromeric tetramers, with subunit composition determining functional specificity8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  osm-9 is the most widely-expressed TRPV gene in Caenorhabditis elegans and has the most attributable functions, including roles in mechano- and odorant sensation as well as behavioural adaptation responses13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other C. elegans TRPV family genes called ocr genes (osm-9 and capsaicin receptor related) are expressed in subsets of osm-9-expressing cells, and OCR subunits are hypothesized to function in heteromeric combination with OSM-9 (refs 5, 14, 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OSM-9 and OCR-2 share the most functions13,14,16,17, and the two proteins are mutually required to achieve localization to the ciliated endings in the ASH cells, consistent with function as subunits of the same heteromeric channel14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some osm-9 functions are ocr-2 independent and vice versa14,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple attempts to demonstrate OCR-2 and OSM-9 homomeric or heteromeric channel activity in a heterologous expression system have not been successful13,14,18, leading to speculation that other unknown subunits are required for assembly of an active channel14,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While expression patterns of ocr-1, ocr-3 and ocr-4 are described14, these genes are less well characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ocr-1, ocr-2 and ocr-4 have redundant function in four neuroendocrine cells called the uterine vulval one (uv1) cells where they act to inhibit egg laying18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The uv1 cells are thought to function by responding to uterine stretching to relieve this inhibition18,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  osm-9 is expressed in uv1 cells, but is surprisingly not involved in egg laying14,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, heteromeric combinations of unknown composition are proposed to function in uv1 cells18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that OSM-9 and OCR-4 form a functional channel in the uv1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nicotinamide (NAM) is a form of vitamin B3 that is absorbed from the diet and is derived endogenously from hydrolysis of NAD+ by NAD+ consumer enzymes such as sirtuins and PARPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells use NAM to resynthesize NAD+, and in invertebrates the nicotinamidase PNC-1 catalyses the first step in this biosynthetic NAD+ salvage pathway (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of PNC-1 activity in C. elegans, NAM levels are increased as much as tenfold21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was reported that uv1 cells undergo a NAM-dependent death in pnc-1 mutants22,23.

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Two cell-types die in pnc-1 mutants', 'uv1 cell death is highly conspicuous in pnc-1 mutants because of the excessive size of the dying cells (Fig 1b), the almost complete penetrance of the phenotype (Fig 1e), and the persistence of the swollen cell corpses into early adulthood23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we speculated that one or more neurons were also dying with incomplete penetrance in the pnc-1 mutant because we observed the occasional presence of vacuoles resembling the swollen uv1 corpses in the region of the nerve ring of some young larvae (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using a panel of GFP markers to visualize specific neurons, we found that ocr-4p::gfp (psEx279), a marker of OLQ cell fate18, consistently marked the swollen cells (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the absence of GFP in older animals revealed that 22% of OLQ cells are missing by late larval stages in pnc-1 mutants (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the observed vacuoles are swollen, dying OLQ cells and that no other head neurons are affected morphologically by loss of pnc-1 because there are no corpses that lack the GFP label in the ocr-4p::gfp; pnc-1 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The morphology of the dying OLQ neurons resembles that of the necrotic uv1 cells24; the cell body swells (Fig 1b,c, arrows) and the nuclear membrane disintegrates while the nucleus moves to the periphery of the cell (Fig 1b,c, arrowheads).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OLQ dendrites first bleb (Fig 1g) and then appear fragmented by the time the OLQ cell body appears swollen (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the cell body and the neurites disappear by adulthood, although GFP positive remnants of the corpse can be seen in the head infrequently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like uv1 cell necrosis, OLQ death is not dependent on apoptotic genes ced-3 or ced-4 (Supplementary Fig 2)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that OLQ cells undergo a necrotic death similar to that of uv1 cells in the pnc-1 mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Acute NAM treatment causes OLQ and uv1 cell death', 'uv1 necrosis in pnc-1 mutants can be recapitulated in wild-type animals by supplementation of cultures with NAM (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we tested the effect of acute application of NAM to wild-type animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Application of a NAM solution to animals causes death of uv1 and OLQ cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acute application of NAM kills uv1 cells more effectively than OLQ cells (Fig 2a), and the highest concentrations of NAM result in more penetrant death of OLQ cells (Fig 2a) relative to genetic removal of pnc-1 (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAM-induced death is not a response to a change in osmolarity and is specific to the amide form of vitamin B3; 1 M nicotinic acid (NA) has no effect on uv1 or OLQ cells (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NAM-induced necrotic process is remarkably rapid, advancing to the first morphological signs of death, nuclear membrane disintegration, within 50 s of NAM application in some animals (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OLQ cell response is somewhat delayed on average in addition to being less penetrant relative to uv1 cells (Fig 2b).

subunit OCR-4 exclusively in the two dying cell types led us to investigate the functional relationship between OCR-4 and NAM-induced death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that mutation of ocr-4 completely prevents death of both uv1 and OLQ cells caused by either loss of pnc-1 or acute application of NAM (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  osm-9, ocr-1 and ocr-2 are co-expressed with ocr-4 in uv1 cells, and osm-9 is co-expressed with ocr-4 in OLQ (refs 14, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we predicted that OSM-9 might be required as the heteromeric partner for OCR-4 in NAM-induced necrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, mutation of osm-9 also completely prevents NAM-induced death (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined the other ocr genes and a related TRPA1 gene, trpa-1, for a role in mediating NAM-induced death.

degenerin mutations in C. elegans25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because OSM-9 channels mediate influx of divalent cations26, we hypothesized that NAM is an agonist for a channel containing OSM-9 and OCR-4 subunits and that excessive activation of the channel may lead to excitotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the hypothesis, we expressed OSM-9 and OCR-4 individually and in combination in Xenopus oocytes and used electrophysiology to determine whether the resulting channel could be activated by NAM (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, NAM activates a large current selectively in oocytes

laying could conceivably be indirect, caused when the swollen uv1 cell corpses interfere with egg-laying structures or processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of indirect effect is not ruled out but is

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have demonstrated that NAM, which is a form of vitamin B3 and an endogenous cellular metabolite, is an agonist of a heteromeric C. elegans TRPV channel that consists of OCR-4 and OSM-9 subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, agonist activity is evolutionarily conserved as NAM also activates the orthologous Drosophila NanIav channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that activation of the OSM-9OCR-4 channels is the trigger mechanism for NAM-induced uv1 and OLQ cell death in C. elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When NAM levels rise upon loss of the PNC-1 nicotinamidase that metabolizes NAM, the OCR-4 and OSM-9-expressing OLQ and uv1 cells likely undergo excitotoxic death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aberrant activation of TRPV channels in humans has also been associated with cell death39,40, and a gain-of-function mutation in the C. elegans TRPN protein TRP-4 causes excitatory cell death of dopaminergic neurons41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While OLQ and uv1 cells both die in response to NAM, it is unclear why the OLQ response is less robust than that of uv1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A difference in level of channel expression or access of NAM to the endogenous channels could explain these results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the multiple OCR proteins that are co-expressed with ocr-4 in uv1 cells could influence the response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we conclude from our studies that the insult is the same in both cell types but the response is likely influenced by cell-type specific factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, although the OLQ and uv1 cells die rapidly in response to elevated OSM-9OCR-4 channel agonist, a rapid cell death is not the only predicted response to elevated channel agonist levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, death in response to an acute ion imbalance is expected to be cell-type dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this prediction, function of some TRPV channel-expressing cells is disrupted by NAM without a death response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most clearly in the Drosophila chordotonal neurons, application of the agonist prevents the chordotonal neurons from responding to further stimuli without death of the neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sustained presence of agonist is predicted to interfere with functions of cells that express the TRPV channel in two ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the constitutive opening and likely desensitization of the channel would interfere with any signalling event and behavioural output for which the channel is required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario prolonged presence of agonist would mimic the genetic loss of the TRPV channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found evidence of this type of effect of NAM in the Drosophila sound-response assay and the C. elegans nose-touch phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, constitutive opening and likely desensitization of the TRPV channel might be expected to disrupt the physiology of the cell, and perhaps even kill the cell, via ion imbalance or other feedback mechanisms, thereby disrupting other cellular processes in which the TRPV channel has no direct role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, the effects of the agonist might actually be blocked by loss of the channel, protecting other cellular functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, we found evidence of this effect in the Egl and the foraging phenotypes in C. elegans where disruption of egg laying muscle function and the death of the OLQ cells results in phenotypes that are not TRPV dependent per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has proven difficult to establish channel activity for the C. elegans TRPV channels in a heterologous system13,16,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our results suggest that there is no strict requirement for other non-TRPV subunits for trafficking or activity as had been suggested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The soluble agonist NAM reveals that appropriate combinations of C. elegans TRPV channel subunits form functional channels in a heterologous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results also provide insight into NAM interaction with the channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum value of a Hill coefficient is predictive of the number of binding sites for a ligand on its receptor; therefore it is likely that there are at least two NAM binding sites on the OSM-9OCR-4 channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with our stoichiometry experiments, these data suggest that NAM might bind to only one of the subunits or to the interface of two subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of this heterologous system will provide an important tool for further structure/function studies of C. elegans TRPV channels to answer this and other structural questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have already used this discovery to show for the first time that functional OSM-9OCR-4 channels most likely have two of each subunit in the active channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Does NAM affect other TRPV channels?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that it might.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the effect of NAM is conserved between the Drosophila TRPV channel and at least one C. elegans TRPV channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of multiple OCR paralogs in C. elegans raises the question of whether all heteromeric combinations of C. elegans TRPV channels will respond to NAM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We failed to detect channel activity with or without NAM upon co-expression of OCR-2 and OSM-9, but did not yet test other OSM-9OCR combinations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nose touch experiments suggest some sensitivity of OSM-9 perhaps in combination with another subunit to NAM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the egg-laying behaviour experiments suggest intriguing differences in how this phenotype responds to mutation of osm-9 versus ocr-4, suggesting possible involvement of TRPV channels with alternate OCR subunits in this NAM-induced phenotype as well as function of OSM-9OCR-4 in a previously undetected location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, it is clear that not all osm-9 mutant phenotypes are mimicked by NAM accumulation; we examined pnc-1 mutants but found no indication of an osmo-sensation phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the 2:2 stoichiometry we detected provides for the possibility that up to two different OCR subunits could co-exist in the same channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there are clearly intriguing questions to be addressed regarding the function and NAM sensitivity of the multiple OCR paralogs in C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  elegans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Both NA and NAM are forms of vitamin B3 used for biosynthesis of NAD+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results revealed that NA is not an agonist of the OSM-9OCR-4 or NanIav channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the NA form of vitamin B3 is an apparent low-affinity agonist of mammalian TRPV channels42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our identification of another form of vitamin B3 as a potent TRPV agonist raises intriguing possibilities for metabolic regulation of channel activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of a soluble agonist for a C. elegans TRPV combined with recent identification of an insecticide as a Drosophila channel agonist44 also paves the way for closer examination of the evolution of TRPV activation mechanisms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
