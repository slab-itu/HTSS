Evidence for a palaeo-subglacial lake on the Antarctic continental shelf  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Subglacial lakes are widespread beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet but their control on ice-sheet dynamics and their ability to harbour life remain poorly characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present evidence for a palaeo-subglacial lake on the Antarctic continental shelf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A distinct sediment facies recovered from a bedrock basin in Pine Island Bay indicates deposition within a low-energy lake environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffusive-advection modelling demonstrates that low chloride concentrations in the pore water of the corresponding sediments can only be explained by initial deposition of this facies in a freshwater setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations indicate that an active subglacial meltwater network, similar to that observed beneath the extant ice sheet, was also active during the last glacial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also provides a new framework for refining the exploration of these unique environments.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Over the past decade, satellite observations and radar measurements revealed that an active, partially interconnected subglacial hydrological system of  greater than 379 lakes exists beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The periodic filling and draining of some of these subglacial lakes2,3 has been associated with transient acceleration of ice streams4, demonstrating that they are a vital component of ice-sheet dynamics, which control ice sheet mass balance and hence sea-level fluctuations5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with limited access to these unique environments, significant questions remain about the influence of subglacial water storage and transfer and its influence on ice-sheet stability and the ability of subglacial lakes to support life6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With the exception of direct access to the subglacial Lake Vostok (accreted lake ice only)7 and the ice-sheet grounding zone at subglacial Lake Whillans8,9,10, the subglacial hydrological system in Antarctica11 has been explored using remote sensing and numerical models with the latter predicting the number of potential lakes to  greater than 12,000 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent model development has largely outpaced the acquisition of geological data required for their validation13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, climate models of ice-sheet responses to global change, and hence predictions of future sea-level rise, remain incomplete without data and a reliable algorithm for simulating subglacial lake formation and drainage and its influence on ice dynamics14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One alternative to the logistical and technical challenges of in situ lake drilling16 that can address some of the objectives of subglacial lake exploration is the investigation of subglacial lakes that once existed beneath former ice sheets17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This offers significant advantages because we can obtain a more complete understanding of the bed properties (that is, geology and topography) and can sample and analyse the sediments without complex logistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modelling suggests that subglacial lakes were more widespread in Antarctica during the last glacial maximum (LGM; 2319 ka before present (BP)) when grounded ice had extended farther onto the continental shelf12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, geomorphological findings from the deep, predominantly bedrock-floored inner shelf indicate the past existence of large-scale subglacial drainage networks, possibly including lakes that stored water and evacuated it to the ice-sheet margin18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of modelling work it has been argued that outburst floods from these palaeo-lakes were associated with surging of ice streams and the erosion of the channels now observed19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite recent drilling through to Lake Whillans, an ephemeral lake under the lightly grounded down-stream part of Whillans Ice Stream8, the criteria for the identification of former subglacial lakes remain largely theoretical6,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coring at Lake Whillans recovered a soft diamicton, interpreted as a subglacial till deposited during intermittent ice-stream grounding phases that followed lake drainage events, but no subglacial lake sediments9.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

geophysical and sedimentological analyses on a marine sediment core from site PS69/288 (74° 24.94 S, 102° 59.48 W, 772 m water depth; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 9.18 m-long sedimentary succession (composed of gravity corer (GC) and giant box corer (GBC), core length of GC is 9.12 in Table 1, see Methods) was retrieved from a small bedrock basin in inner Pine Island Bay, Amundsen Sea, in an area where previous geomorphological work suggested the former existence of a network of subglacial lakes and interconnecting channels18 (Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recovered sedimentary succession consists of three lithostratigraphic units recording the transition from a subglacial lake (Unit 3) via a brackish sub-ice cavity setting (Unit 2) to a distal sub-ice shelf and seasonal open-marine environment (Unit 1) (Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed chloride ion concentration, a reliable proxy for salinity (Methods), in pore water samples of core PS69/288-3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low chloride concentrations measured in the fine-grained sediments of basal Unit 3 are interpreted to indicate freshwater conditions during its deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternative processes to explain the low chloride concentrations, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  clay mineral dewatering or opal dehydration, can be ruled out because they require temperatures in excess of 80 and 55 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20), respectively, which are not possible in such a thin sediment drape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Stations with strongly reduced and only slightly reduced chloride

To test different scenarios for the seawater incursion (that is, to investigate whether and when a phase with brackish conditions occurred), we applied diffusive-advective modelling of the chloride concentration gradient over time, thereby using previously published AMS 14C ages for core PS69/288-3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21) (Table 2) and the regional glacial history21,22 as chronological

throughout Subunit 2.2 is nearly identical to that of Unit 3, thus indicating a very similar sediment provenance and suggesting that the lake was still largely enclosed by grounded ice at that time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the chronological constraints for site PS69/288 (Table 2), our diffusive modelling approach can reproduce the modern gradient of down-core pore water chloride

of Subunit 2.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smectite content in this subunit is lower than in the underlying sediments, suggesting increased mixing with fine-grained terrigenous detritus supplied by ocean currents from a wide area in Pine Island Bay23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increasing marine influence within Subunit 2.1 is also reflected by higher chloride concentrations in the pore water (Figs 3 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coarse texture of the subunit indicates deposition from high-energy flows, probably grain flows, triggered by tidal pumping and intensified oceanic melting at the palaeo-ice stream grounding line which must have retreated landward of site PS69/288 at this time (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the ice sheet must have been close to buoyancy during this phase to allow inflow or exchange with the open ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This situation is analogous to the modern Totten Glacier in East Antarctica where seawater penetrates deep into the grounding zone through a narrow (ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 km wide) localized trough24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The subsequent decrease in transport energy at site PS69/288 is documented by deposition of Unit 1 (Fig 3), whose lower, purely terrigenous Subunit 1.2 (no diatom frustules were found) consists of horizontal, planar silty to sandy layers embedded in a muddy matrix (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the coarse-grained layers and scattered, gravelly pebbly grains that represent melt-out of glaciogenic debris from the base of an ice shelf, decrease in number towards the top of this subunit, and we infer that this indicates the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Subglacial lakes are one of the least accessible and explored environments on Earths surface, yet have the capacity to modulate ice-sheet mass balance and support viable microbial ecosystems10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Antarctica they have the potential to influence Southern Ocean geochemical and biological systems27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously it was speculated that information on the origin and longevity of subglacial lakes is contained within their sedimentary successions6 but until now this has remained largely theoretical17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings demonstrate the first sedimentological and geochemical evidence of the presence of a subglacial lake on the Antarctic shelf and its transition to a glaciomarine environment during the last deglaciation (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such lakes provide not only constraints on basal thermal regimes and basal properties of past ice sheets that need to be incorporated in numerical models but also offer an opportunity to refine approaches for subglacial lake exploration from ships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated that pore water salinity, and specifically chloride-ion concentration, together with a distinct subglacial lake sediment facies (structureless silty clay with or without mud clasts) provides a powerful set of tools for establishing the presence of palaeo-subglacial lakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronologically constrained diffusive-advective modelling confirms that low chloride concentrations can only be explained by mixing with a freshwater source, while an associated distinct sediment facies (Unit 3) indicates deposition in an enclosed, lacustrine, low-energy environment rather than any other freshwater influenced setting28 (for example, low chloride groundwater flow from below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, our results refine the criteria for interpreting subglacial lake facies6,17 that will allow an easier identification of subglacial lakes in the palaeo-record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consistency between our sediment core data and the distribution of subglacial lakes inferred from previous geomorphological studies18 (Fig 1b) offers an opportunity to advance our understanding of subglacial lakes and their sedimentary archives, which are believed to have been numerous on the Antarctic shelf during the last glacial period12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Ultimately, subglacial lakes provide evidence for a wet-based glacial regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study, which effectively ground-truths previous modelling work, has implications for ice-stream formation and flow, bed lubrication, meltwater drainage and theories about meltwater driven ice-sheet collapse19,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst future work is needed to confirm that subglacial lakes form part of an interconnected network (Fig 1b), which drains meltwater from the ice-sheet interior to its margin, our study provides a robust data set to explore how the geometry and capacity of the subglacial hydrologic system influence ice dynamics when the ice-sheet's substrate and profile are known."  #@NEW_LINE#@#
