Structure and function of the Zika virus full-length NS5 protein  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) has infected over 1 million people in over 30 countries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV replicates its RNA genome using virally encoded replication proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) contains a methyltransferase for RNA capping and a polymerase for viral RNA synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the crystal structures of full-length NS5 and its polymerase domain at 3.0 Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NS5 structure has striking similarities to the NS5 protein of the related Japanese encephalitis virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The methyltransferase contains in-line pockets for substrate binding and the active site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Key residues in the polymerase are located in similar positions to those of the initiation complex for the hepatitis C virus polymerase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polymerase conformation is affected by the methyltransferase, which enables a more efficiently elongation of RNA synthesis in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our results will contribute to future studies on ZIKV infection and the development of inhibitors of ZIKV replication.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Zika virus infection has caused human birth defects and Guillain-Barré Syndrome1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZIKV belongs in the genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family, which also includes the important human pathogens Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and the Dengues virus (DENV)3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flavivirus genome is a positive-sense RNA of 11-kb in length that contains a 5 cap structure but lacks a polyA tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RNA encodes a long open reading frame that is translated into a polyprotein that is subsequently processed by viral and host proteases into three structural and seven nonstructural proteins3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is essential for the replication of the flaviviral RNA genome4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal portion of NS5 contains a methyltransferase (MT), followed by a short linker that connects to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MT adds the 5 RNA cap structure to facilitate translation of the polyprotein and to decrease elicitation of the host innate immune response7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RdRp initiates RNA synthesis by a de novo mechanism wherein a single-nucleotide triphosphate serves as a primer for nucleotide polymerization10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein we report the crystal structure of the Zika virus NS5 protein and the structure of the RdRp domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MT was found to affect the conformation of the RdRp domain and increase RNA synthesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

synthesis by NS5 and the RdRp, we determined the crystal structure of 264 at 3.0 Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asymmetric unit contains eight RdRps that exist in two conformations (referred to as conformation 1 and 2) that vary in the locations of motif G, Loop 21 (residues 312323) and Loop 51 (residues 742750) that connect the thumb and fingers subdomains (Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two conformations are affected by residue Arg483 that lies in the template channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conformation 1, the side chain of Arg483 inserts between motifs B and F and interacts with the carbonyl backbone of Gly604 and Trp476 (Fig 5e, Supplementary Fig 8a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conformation 2, the locations of motifs B and F prevents the insertion of the side chain of Arg483.

net effect of the presence of the MT is that the RdRp has a reconfigured template channel and possesses a more open NTP channel (Fig 5f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes will likely decrease RNA

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have determined the crystal structures of the Zika virus NS5 protein and the isolated polymerase domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NS5 protein used was functional for RNA synthesis in vitro, producing RNA that initiated de novo from the 3 terminal nucleotide of an exogenously provided template and also elongated from a primed template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MT domain was shown to bind to the template RNA, and its presence increased elongative RNA synthesis by the RdRp domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RdRp alone was also competent for RNA synthesis, but was less active for RNA synthesis in vitro (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is in contrast to that of the DENV NS5 protein, where the removal of the MT was shown to increase RNA synthesis in vitro20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the NS5 proteins of the ZIKV and the DENV differ in the network of interactions and the orientations of the MT and RdRp domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences may affect RNA synthesis by the resulting recombinant proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The structure of the ZIKV NS5 protein reveals remarkable similarities with the equivalent structures of other viruses from the Flaviviridae family.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active sites for MT activity and RNA synthesis are especially well-conserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that inhibitors of viral MT activity and/or RNA synthesis can be developed to inhibit ZIKV replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, nucleoside analogues that can inhibit the polymerases of Dengue virus, West Nile virus and yellow fever virus have recently been shown to affect RNA synthesis by ZIKV NS5 (refs 5, 21, 22, 23, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sofosbuvir, which is highly effective in treating hepatitis C, also has modest inhibitory activity for the replication of the ZIKV25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elucidating additional structures of the ZIKV NS5 complexed to nucleotides and also molecular dynamic studies with the ZIKV NS5 protein with potential inhibitors could aid in the development of inhibitors with higher specificity and potency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While the Zika virus was initially detected in 1947 in the forest of Uganda Africa, serious illness associated with Zika virus infection was first recorded in Micronesia in 2011 (refs 1, 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At present, the basis for the increased illness associated with the more recent Zika virus outbreak remains to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our comparison of the recombinant NS5 proteins from Africa and from Brazil revealed similar levels of RNA synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the residues of the Brazilian ZIKV that differ from those of the MR766 virus from Africa are mostly on the surface of the NS5 protein and are less likely to affect the mechanism of RNA-dependent RNA synthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changes, however, could impact interactions with other ZIKV proteins or with cellular proteins.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
