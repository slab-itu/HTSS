Cyclophilin A stabilizes the HIV-1 capsid through a novel non-canonical binding site  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The host cell factor cyclophilin A (CypA) interacts directly with the HIV-1 capsid and regulates viral infectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the crystal structure of CypA in complex with the N-terminal domain of the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) has been known for nearly two decades, how CypA interacts with the viral capsid and modulates HIV-1 infectivity remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined the cryoEM structure of CypA in complex with the assembled HIV-1 capsid at 8-Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure exhibits a distinct CypA-binding pattern in which CypA selectively bridges the two CA hexamers along the direction of highest curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EM-guided all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and solid-state NMR further reveal that the CypA-binding pattern is achieved by single-CypA molecules simultaneously interacting with two CA subunits, in different hexamers, through a previously uncharacterized non-canonical interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide new insights into how CypA stabilizes the HIV-1 capsid and is recruited to facilitate HIV-1 infection.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Infection by retroviruses, including HIV-1, is critically dependent on the functions of the viral capsid1,2,3, which plays multiple roles during replication, including the prevention of innate sensor triggering4,5 and regulation of reverse transcription1,6 and nuclear import7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such functions are highly dependent on interactions between the viral capsid and cellular factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The host cell protein cyclophilin A (CypA) binds directly to the HIV-1 capsid and modulates capsid uncoating and viral infectivity10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interference with CypA-binding inhibits HIV-1 replication in cell culture13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, host cell proteins containing the CypA domain, including Trim-Cyp and Nup358, interact directly with the viral capsid and control HIV-1 infection8,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CypA-binding appears to stabilize or destabilize the HIV-1 capsid, depending on the cell type6,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the interaction between CypA and HIV-1 CA promotes HIV-1 infection of human cells19,20, yet, in non-human primates, the same interaction enhances the anti-HIV-1 restriction activity of Trim5 (refs 21, 22, 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, while CypA promotes HIV-1 reverse transcription in human cells, its cell-type specific effect is best correlated with nuclear entry, and probably involves an unknown CypA-dependent host restriction factor24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to this complexity, understanding the role of CypA in HIV-1 infection has been difficult, especially given the limited structural information that is available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The crystal structure of CypA in complex with the CA N-terminal domain (CANTD) shows that CA residues A88-G89-P90 and the configuration of the CypA-binding loop are important for the binding interaction11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of CypA to the CypA-binding loop of the viral capsid is essential for viral infectivity25,26, as substitutions in loop residues G89 or P90 in HIV-1 CA are deleterious to replication14,21,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CypA binding to monomeric CA can be detected at high protein concentration11, but binding is enhanced by CA multimerization10, suggesting that CypA favours binding to an assembled capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite extensive studies on the interaction between CypA and HIV-1 CA, structural information on how CypA interacts with the assembled viral capsid, and an understanding of the consequences of the interaction for capsid function, are lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To elucidate the molecular interactions between CypA and the HIV-1 capsid, we determined the structure of CypA in complex with an HIV-1 CA tubular assembly at 8-Å resolution by cryoEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density map, combined with structure-guided molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, unexpectedly revealed a novel, non-canonical, second capsid-binding site on CypA that is vital for stabilizing the viral capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding was confirmed experimentally by solid-state NMR.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Binding of CypA to wild-type (wt) CA assemblies', 'We began our studies by characterizing the binding of CypA to HIV-1 CA tubular assemblies at various CypA:CA molar ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding was measured in a high-speed centrifugation assay, after incubation of CypA with a fixed concentration of pre-assembled wild-type (wt) CA tubes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incubation of CypA with CA tubes, up to a 6:6 molar ratio, resulted in co-sedimentation of CypA and CA (Fig 1a, top), with the CypA:CA binding ratio increasing as the CypA concentration increased, up to 40 M, beyond which point, binding was saturated (Fig 1b, solid line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, while a relatively low amount of CypA (CypA:CA input ratios  2:6) slightly enhanced the amount of CA in the pelleted fraction (Fig 1a top), CypA:CA ratios above 2:6 led to a reduction in the amount of pelleted CA (Fig 1a, top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is consistent with an earlier report that high molar ratios of CypA:CA alter CA assembly in vitro28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Interaction of CypA with HIV-1 CA assemblies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Binding of CypA to pre-assembled wt CA tubes in 1 M NaCl (top) and co-assembly of CypA and CA in 2.25 M NaCl (bottom); the molar ratio of CypA:CA in each condition is indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reaction products before centrifugation (t) and after centrifugation, supernatant (s) and pellet (p), were analysed by 412% gradient gel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The binding ratios of CypA:CA were quantified for the pre-assembled sample (solid line) and for the co-assembled sample (dotted line), calibrated using the input ratio as standard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) EM images of negative stained samples of CypA-CA complexes co-assembled in 2.25 M NaCl with the indicated CypA:CA molar ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 200 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) AFM measurements of the stiffness of CA assemblies in the presence of CypA at CypA:CA molar ratios of 0:6, 1:6, 3:6 and 6:6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least 24 particles (numbers shown to the right of each data point), obtained from 23 individual assembly reactions, were measured for each stiffness value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars represent the s.e.m.Full size image', 'We also tested the effect of CypA on the process of CA assembly by including it in the CA assembly reaction under the high-salt condition (2.25 M NaCl) (Fig 1a, bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, CypA binding was consistently higher compared with when it was added to pre-assembled CA tubes (Fig 1b, dotted lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the presence of CypA during CA assembly induced marked morphological changes in the resulting CA assemblies (Fig 1c): in the absence of CypA, long CA tubes were formed; at an intermediate level of CypA, short tubes and cones were generated; and, at high CypA concentrations (6:6 CypA:CA molar ratio input), very small cones and spheres were observed, indicating a significant increase in the curvature of the assemblies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that CypA influences the curvature of CA assemblies possibly by preferentially binding to and stabilizing CA assembly conformations with a high degree of curvature, a distinctive feature that had not been previously appreciated but can be clearly explained by the structure presented here (further sections).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This influence of CypA on the capsid curvature may shed new light on the maturation process, since CypA is packaged into viral particles and may facilitate the formation of cones by stablizing a high degree of curvature at the ends during maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the pre-assembled tubes, CA was reduced in the pelleted fraction with higher CypA:CA molar ratios in the co-assembly reaction (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CypA affects the stiffness of CA assemblies', 'To determine the effect of CypA on CA stability, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) operated in the nano-indentation mode to measure the stiffness of wt CA assemblies as a function of CypA level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The point stiffness measured for CA without CypA was 0.043±0.006 N m1 (n=30) (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A gradual elevation in CypA level resulted in an increase in CA stiffness (1:6 CypA:CA ratio is 0.11±0.02 N m1 (n=31) and 3:6 is 0.14±0.018 N m1 (n=24)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stiffness value represents the amount of force that is required to deform the CA structure or, alternatively, the ability of the structure to withstand an external force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of a CA assembly, this ability is governed by the interaction strength between its building blocks, namely, CA hexamers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, higher stiffness values represent stronger interactions between the building blocks of the CA lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporation of CypA into the CA structure increased the effective interaction strength between the CA hexamers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was maximal at a 3:6 CypA:CA ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, further addition of CypA to a 6:6 ratio reduced the stiffness of CA by almost twofold (0.088±0.011 N m1 (n=45)), compared with the stiffness obtained at a 3:6 ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the CA stiffness at 6:6 remains significantly larger than CA lacking CypA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that CypA incorporation in the capsid structure strengthens the stability of capsid in a stoichiometrically dependent manner, with the efficiency of this effect being notably decreased at high (6:6) CypA to CA molar ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CryoEM structure of CypA-CA tubular complex', 'To determine the structure of the CypA-CA tubular assembly complex, we chose the CypA-CA ratio and assembly conditions that yielded homogeneous complexes suitable for cryoEM: pre-assembled CA tubes with CypA added at 2:6 CypA:CA molar ratio (Fig 1a top).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of CypA resulted in well-separated, long helical tubes with a layer of density decorating the CA tube surface (Fig 2a, inset, black arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such tubes are well-ordered to at least 13.8-Å resolution, as indicated by the Fourier transform (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We carried out three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the CypA-CA tubular complex using the iterative real-space helical reconstruction method29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining 19 high-resolution tubes belonging to a single helical symmetry of (8, 13) (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29 for information regarding helical symmetry), we determined the cryoEM structure of the CypA-CA tubular complex at 8-Å resolution, as indicated by the Fourier shell correlation of 0.5 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: CryoEM reconstruction of CypA /CA tubular assemblies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) CryoEM image of a CypA-CA tubular assembly at 2:6 CypA:CA input ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inset, radial density profile from the boxed region showing the CypA density (black arrows) decorating the CA tubular assembly (red arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Fourier transform of a CypA-CA tubular assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrow indicates a layer line at 13.8 Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) 3D density map of the CypA-CA assembly complex reconstructed at 8 Å resolution (see Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density (contoured at 2) is coloured radially from yellow-green (CA) to blue (CypA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CypA selectively binds to the CA array that has the highest curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Rigid body docking of CA hexamers (3J4F, green ribbon) into the CA region of the density map (yellow density), viewed from the side and top.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area shown is from the boxed region in C.

hexamer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is not enough space to accommodate two CypA molecules without extensive clashing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, analytical centrifugation experiments suggest that CypA is primarily monomeric in our experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, focused classification using reference-based cross-correlation to separate CypA-binding modes into distinct classes, resulted in class averages that contain monomeric CypA bound to CA hexamers (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the bridging density likely corresponds to a single-CypA molecule, in which case, one may ask why CypA only occupies one particular helical array, rather than being equally distributed along all directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that a single CypA interacts with two CA molecules that are arranged in a specific geometry, with each CA molecule recognizing a different region of the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting evidence for this idea comes from two sources: (1) a crystal structure of the CypA/CsA complex (PDB: 2RMA), in which the opposite faces of CypA each bind a molecule of CsA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31); and (2) an analysis of the inhibition of CypA-Gag interaction by CsA, showing a sigmoidal CsA inhibition curve, indicating synergy between two CsA in the inhibition12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these reasons, we suggest that a single-CypA molecule spans two CA hexamers in the tubular complex (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Computational modelling of the CypA-CA lattice', 'For the binding of a single-CypA molecule to two adjacent CA hexamers in a helical array, two binding modes are possible: (1) CypA binds more strongly to the left hexamer, extending across to the right one; or (2) CypA binds the other way around.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density map is an ensemble average of all possible binding modes from many tubes and, thus, cannot distinguish between the binding modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we carried out MD flexible fitting (MDFF) to model the interaction between CypA and the CA tubes (simulations 1and 2Supplementary Table 1), monitoring, during the simulation, the cross-correlation between the model and the experimental density (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An ensemble of 10 fully saturated CypA-CA tubular complex models (Fig 3a) was constructed as described in Supplementary Information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overlapping or clashing CypA molecules were removed with no bias from the saturated models, resulting in 10 tubular complex models with thousands of statistically independent arrangements of CypA over the CA lattice (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in all cases, clashes between CypA and adjacent CA molecules were only observed along the least curved helical direction of the tube (a typical HIV tube contains a CA lattice with three helical directions along which repeating arrays are found, each direction with different characteristic curvatures as illustrated in Fig 2c and Supplementary Fig 6), resulting in removal of CypA molecules along this direction (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the CypA-CA tubular complex models were equilibrated for 100 ns (Supplementary Fig 7, simulation 2Supplementary Table 1), and simulated electron density maps were generated for each model (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mimicking the cryoEM real-space helical reconstruction process, a final, averaged density map with helical symmetry imposed was calculated from all these models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The resulting average density map (Fig 3b) matches the experimental map remarkably well, especially the selectivity of CypA for the most curved CA lattice array, with a cross-correlation value of 0.967 (Figs 2c and 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the course of the MD simulations (simulation 2), the CA lattices remained rigid, as previously reported30, whereas the CypA-binding loops and the CypA molecules exhibited a range of motions (as calculated from root-mean-square fluctuations of the atomic positions, mapped onto the structure of the tube in Supplementary Fig 8), which can be considered a likely cause for the lower resolution of the cryoEM density map at the CypA region (Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, principal component analysis of longer trajectories of CypA-CA subsystems extracted from the MDFF-derived tube (simulations 4 and 6, Supplementary Fig 9), revealed two distinct types of motion depending on whether CypA is bridging along the most curved CA array or not (Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the bridging CypA exhibits limited motion (1°) perpendicular to the array direction and appears locked onto the curved CA lattice (Fig 3c), disjointed CypA is more mobile (20°) and inter-converts between the two conformers observed in the crystal structure of the CypA-CANTD complex (Fig 3d, Supplementary Movie 1)11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate the detailed interactions between CypA and CA, a subsystem comprising two adjacent CA subunits with a corresponding bridging CypA (Fig 3e, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MD simulation revealed, beside the first binding interface at the canonical CypA-binding site, a second binding interface between CypA and CA, comprising residues A88, G89 and P90 from CA, and A25, P29 and K30 from CypA (Fig 3f, site 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction at the second, non-canonical CypA-binding site is weaker than at the canonical binding site, as shown from pair interaction energies 16.1±7.3 and 28.9±17.0 kcal mol1, respectively, obtained from unrestrained CypA simulations (simulation 4Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the second site, properly positioned, could yield a strong binding avidity once CypA binds to the first CA through the canonical site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a similar second binding site, involving P29 and K30 on CypA, was observed in an early crystal structure of the CypA/CsA complex (PDB: 2RMA), in which two CsA molecules bind CypA (Fig 3g)31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude, therefore, that CypA likely employs both binding sites to strengthen the CA dimer interface in the CA assembly, thereby stabilizing the viral capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Solid-state NMR spectroscopy',

'A significant result from this study is the discovery of a non-canonical, second site of CypA for binding to the assembled CA lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this site, CypA bridges two CA molecules from adjacent hexamers, thus stabilizing the CA lattice (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The additional interaction interface that is established by the new site further strengthens the binding of CypA to the CA lattice through avidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CypA is known to have different effects on viral infectivity in different host cells; some are enhancive while others are restrictive24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether these effects correlate with CypAs cellular expression level or are associated with an unknown cell-specific cellular factor is still not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that CypA, via its second binding site, binds selectively along the most curved CA array (Fig 2c) and promotes curved assembly (Fig 1c), further implies that CypA and proteins containing CypA domains are best suited to interact with a conical capsid exhibiting a continuous curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found that sub-stoichiometric amounts of CypA (up to 3:6 CypA:CA) stabilize the CA assembly (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, a high level of CypA reduces capsid stability (Fig 1d) and disrupts the capsid assembly (Fig 1a)28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These seemingly contradictory observations can be explained by steric hindrance between two CypA molecules upon simultaneous binding to neighbouring CA hexamers, thus weakening, at high concentration, the dimer assembly interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is utilized by the host restriction factors Trim-Cyp and Trim5 to carry out their function34,35,36; both proteins contain stable dimeric capsid-binding motifs, CC-Cyp and CC-SPRY, in addition to the B-box domain for higher-order oligomerization, to enhance the affinity of interaction through avidity effects37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CC-SPRY dimer, not the SPRY monomer, effectively binds to and breaks the capsid between CA hexamers38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data further suggest a plausible mechanism for Trim-mediated premature uncoating and viral restriction that involves direct binding of Trim-Cyp and Trim5 at the inter-hexamer interface and subsequent destabilization of the viral capsid37,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since CypA prefers curvature and stabilizes curved assemblies, the variable curvature in the mature core would help CypA binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CypA binding may also have a greater effect on a continuously curved capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CypA binding to the HIV-1 capsid also enhances the antiviral activity of some small molecule inhibitors, such as PF74 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our observation that CypA binding hardens the capsid lattice, in our AFM experiments, we suggest that PF74, which appears to act at the uncoating step of infection, acts more effectively on CypA-stabilized capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'What are the functional consequences of CypA binding to the HIV-1 core?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lentiviruses, such as HIV-1, are differentiated from other retroviruses by having evolved the ability to traverse the nuclear pore complex, allowing replication in non-dividing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HIV-1 has been suggested to use CypA and CPSF6 to cloak its genome during migration through the cytoplasm, allowing evasion of innate immune sensing in primary human macrophages and dendritic cells4,5,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data support this notion and suggest that the second interaction interface is important for the protective role of CypA to the viral capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of previous studies by others8 and our current results, we propose a simplified model for the function of CypA in HIV-1 infection (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In permissive cells, CypA affects HIV-1 transduction in two stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first stage is within the cytoplasm during reverse transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since a single CypA bridges two CA molecules from adjacent hexamers, a sub-stoichiometric level of CypA stabilizes the capsid and protects the viral core from premature uncoating, thus promoting reverse transcription in all cell types34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the second stage, once the HIV-1 core reaches the nuclear membrane, the CA subunits that are not bound by CypA could be available for binding to Nup358 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24), thus facilitating HIV-1 infection by coordinating proper uncoating of the core in target cells6,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, a high level of CypA binding or addition of Trim-Cyp/Trim5 could destabilize the capsid18,46,47; CypA enhances Trim-mediated restriction at a stage after reverse transcription in restrictive cells48, and productive restriction can occur even when a fraction of CA in the capsid is available for Trim-Cyp binding49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results provide new insights into how CypA engages in modulating HIV-1 infectivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Model for CypAs role in HIV-1 infection.In permissive cells, sub-stoichiometric levels of CypA stabilize and protect the viral capsid moving in the cytoplasm as it moves towards the nuclear pore, where Nup358 additionally binds to the capsid and promotes uncoating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In non-permissive cells, either high levels of CypA or CypA in combination with host restriction factors such as Trim5 and Trim-Cyp facilitate premature uncoating and result in viral restriction.Full size image', 'In summary, we used an integrative multi-disciplinary approach, combining cryoEM, computer modelling and MD simulations, solid-state NMR and biochemical analysis, to investigate the interactions between the host cell factor CypA and HIV-1 capsid assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We uncovered a novel interaction interface of CypA which may provide a new avenue for the development of therapeutic interventions that target CypA interactions with the HIV-1 capsid.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
