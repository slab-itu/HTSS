In vivo correction of anaemia in -thalassemic mice by PNA-mediated gene editing with nanoparticle delivery  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The blood disorder, -thalassaemia, is considered an attractive target for gene correction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site-specific triplex formation has been shown to induce DNA repair and thereby catalyse genome editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that triplex-forming peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) substituted at the  position plus stimulation of the stem cell factor (SCF)/c-Kit pathway yielded high levels of gene editing in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in a mouse model of human -thalassaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Injection of thalassemic mice with SCF plus nanoparticles containing PNAs and donor DNAs ameliorated the disease phenotype, with sustained elevation of blood haemoglobin levels into the normal range, reduced reticulocytosis, reversal of splenomegaly and up to 7% -globin gene correction in HSCs, with extremely low off-target effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of nanoparticle delivery, next generation PNAs and SCF treatment may offer a minimally invasive treatment for genetic disorders of the blood that can be achieved safely and simply by intravenous administration.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Gene editing in haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) may provide a strategy for treatment of inherited disorders such as sickle cell disease and -thalassaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methods for gene editing include targeted nucleases such as zinc-finger nucleases1 and CRISPR/Cas9 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2), short fragment homologous recombination3 and triplex-forming oligonucleotides4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent excitement has focused on CRISPR/Cas9 technology because of facile reagent design5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, like zinc-finger nucleases, the CRISPR approach introduces an active nuclease into cells, which can lead to off-target cleavage in the genome6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an alternative, we have pursued triplex-forming peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) designed to bind site-specifically to genomic DNA via strand invasion and formation of PNA/DNA/PNA triplexes (via both WatsonCrick and Hoogsteen binding) with a displaced DNA strand7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNAs consist of a charge-neutral peptide-like backbone and nucleobases enabling hybridization with DNA with high affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNA/DNA/PNA triplexes recruit the cells endogenous DNA repair systems to initiate site-specific modification of the genome when single-stranded donor DNAs are co-delivered as templates containing the desired sequence modification10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our prior work has suggested that PNA-induced genome modification is mediated by the nucleotide excision repair and homology-dependent repair (HDR) pathways10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both nucleotide excision repair and HDR are high fidelity pathways, and the PNAs lack any intrinsic nuclease activity; together these features may account for the very low frequencies of off-target genotoxicity seen with PNA-mediated gene editing compared with nuclease based approaches12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also recently shown that tail-clamp PNAs (tcPNAs) with an extended WatsonCrick binding domain can enhance gene editing in human haematopoietic cells with increased efficiency and specificity13 and that polymer nanoparticles (NPs) can effectively deliver these molecules into human HSCs both ex vivo and in vivo in a humanized mouse model12,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we use next generation triplex-forming PNAs containing a polyethylene glycol substitution at the gamma position for enhanced DNA binding16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delivered via polymer NPs, the PNAs mediate increased gene editing in HSCs both ex vivo and in vivo in two different mouse models, one carrying a -globin/green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion transgene and the other carrying the human -globin gene replacing the mouse -globin genes and containing a -thalassaemia-associated splicing mutation at IVS2-654 (refs 17, 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that treatment with stem cell factor (SCF), the c-Kit ligand, further enhances PNA-mediated gene editing, an effect associated with increased DNA repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of thalassemic mice18 with NPs containing PNAs and donor DNAs, plus SCF, produced up to 7% gene editing in HSCs, with elevation of blood haemoglobin levels for 140 days post-treatment, reduction in reticulocyte counts and reversal of splenomegaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNA treatment also yielded gene editing in human CD34+ HSCs ex vivo at a frequency of 5% with a single treatment, with very low off-target effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that chemical advances in PNA design and in vivo delivery via polymer NPs can mediate clinically relevant levels of gene editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also identify SCF treatment as a potential pharmacologic strategy to increase gene editing that may be applicable not only to triplex-forming PNAs but also to approaches such as CRISPR/Cas9.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Triplex-forming PNA design for gene editing', 'To quantitatively assay for gene editing, we used a mouse model with a -globin/GFP fusion transgene consisting of human -globin intron 2 carrying a thalassaemia-associated IVS2-654 (CT) mutation embedded within the GFP coding sequence, resulting in incorrect splicing of -globin/GFP mRNA and lack of GFP expression19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PNA-mediated triplex-formation induces recombination of the genomic site with a 60-nucleotide sense donor DNA homologous to the -globin intron 2 sequence except for providing a wild-type nucleotide at the IVS2-654 position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correction of the splice-site mutation yields expression of functional GFP (Fig 1a)12,15, providing a phenotypic read-out of editing quantifiable by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Gene editing using PNAs in mouse bone marrow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Strategy for targeted correction of a -globin gene IVS2-654 (C-T) mutation in -globin/GFP transgenic mice using triplex-forming tail-clamp PNAs and donor DNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) tcPNA and tcPNAs designed to bind to homopurine regions within intron 2 of the human -globin gene near IVS2-654 (C-T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) DNA, unmodified PNA and MPPNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) tcPNAs and tcPNAs to bind to the positions indicated in B. tcPNA4-Scr is a scrambled version of tcPNA4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bold/underline indicates PNA residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  K indicates lysine; J, pseudoisocytosine (for c) for pH-independent triplex formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  O, 8-amino-2,6,10-trioxaoctanoic acid linkers connecting the Hoogsteen and WatsonCrick domains of the tcPNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Scanning electron microscope images of nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 2.0 m.

image', 'We designed a series of tcPNAs to bind to polypurine stretches in the -globin intron near the IVS2-654 mutation (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the tcPNAs and a scrambled sequence control were synthesized to contain partial substitution with a mini-polyethylene-glycol group at the  position (MPPNA; Fig 1c,d) within their WatsonCrick binding domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We made the substitutions in the WatsonCrick domains because in prior work PNAs have been shown to enhance strand invasion and DNA binding in the WatsonCrick binding mode due to helical pre-organization enforced by the modification16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that this would enhance the binding of the tcPNAs because strand invasion and WatsonCrick PNA/DNA duplex formation is an important component in the formation of PNA/DNA/PNA triplexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial substitution was performed because it is sufficient to improve binding affinity and to confer helical pre-organization20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  tcPNA4 matches the sequence of tcPNA1 except that it contains  units at alternating positions in the WatsonCrick domain (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scrambled tcPNA (tcPNA4-Scr) has the same base composition as tcPNA4 but a scrambled sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All tcPNA oligomers were synthesized with 3 lysines at both termini to improve solubility and increase binding affinity (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purification and characterization of the synthesized PNAs were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography analyses and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight, respectively (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gel shift assays to assess the binding of the tcPNAs to DNAs containing the respective target sequences showed that all bound specifically to their target sites (Supplementary Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No binding was seen in the case of the scrambled sequence tcPNA4-Scr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In prior work, we showed that poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs can effectively deliver PNA/donor DNA combinations into primary human and mouse haematopoietic cells with essentially no toxicity12,14,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, tcPNAs and donor DNAs, at a molar ratio of 2:1, were incorporated into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NP formulations were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the NPs exhibited sizes within the expected range (Fig 1e and Supplementary Fig 2B,C) and showed uniform charge distribution (Supplementary Fig 2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nucleic acid release profiles showed that  modifications did not impair release from NPs (Supplementary Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ex vivo gene editing in bone marrow cells', 'Bone marrow (BM) cells harvested from -globin/GFP mice were treated ex vivo with PLGA NPs containing tcPNA1/donor DNA, tcPNA2/donor DNA and tcPNA3/donor DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 48 h, the percentage of GFP+ (corrected) cells was quantified via flow cytometry (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher gene editing activity of tcPNA1 is likely due to its longer Hoogsteen binding domain, an effect that we have previously observed13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NPs containing the -substituted tcPNA (tcPNA4) and donor DNA yielded significantly higher gene modification (1.62%; Fig 1g and Supplementary Fig 3A), showing that the MP substitutions confers increased biological activity that correlates with their improved binding properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NPs with the tcPNA4Scr produced no modification (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BM cells treated with either blank NPs or NPs containing tcPNA4/donor DNA were plated in methylcellulose medium supplemented with cytokines for growth of granulocyte/macrophage colonies (colony-forming unit (CFU)-G, CFU-M and CFU-GM) or combined colonies (CFU-GEMM, granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte/macrophage and megakaryocyte).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two sets of treated cells formed myeloid and erythroid colonies at similar frequencies (Supplementary Fig 3B,C), suggesting that treatment with tcPNA4 and donor DNA does not impair the ability of the progenitor cells to proliferate and differentiate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing analysis of genomic DNA from selected GFP-positive methylcellulose colonies confirmed the presence of the targeted gene modification in the -globin/GFP transgene at the IVS2-654 base pair (Supplementary Fig 3D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, there was no induction of the inflammatory cytokines in the treated BM cells (Supplementary Fig 3E), consistent with prior work with NPs containing standard PNAs12,14,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In assays for genotoxicity, there was no detectable increase in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the BM cells treated with tcPNA4/donor DNA-containing NPs compared with blank NPs based on a single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (Comet assay; Supplementary Fig 4A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also assayed for DSBs by measuring the production of H2AX foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H2AX foci are detected in nuclei by immune fluorescence and document a chromatin modification that occurs upon DSB formation via DNA damage response signalling22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of the BM cells with NPs containing tcPNA4/donor DNA did not produce any H2AX foci above the low background that is seen in untreated cells (assayed by flow cytometry as shown in Supplementary Fig 4B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of the cells with 5 Gy of ionizing radiation (IR) was included as a positive control for induction of DSBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also used primary fibroblasts from the mice for this assay, since adherent cells facilitate more robust quantification of foci by immune fluorescence microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of the fibroblasts with NPs containing tcPNA4/donor DNA again did not produce H2AX foci above the low background in untreated or blank NP treated cells (quantified in Fig 1h as per cent of cells with more than 15 foci and in Fig 1i as average number of foci per nucleus, with corresponding immune fluorescence images of foci shown in Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, transfection of a vector expressing the Cas9 nuclease yielded an increase in H2AX foci (Fig 1h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-expression of a guide RNA designed to bind to the same sequence in the -globin gene as tcPNA4 (either via the same plasmid or via a plasmid separate from the Cas9 vector) reduced the number of induced DSBs, but to a level that was still above background (Fig 1h,i and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Elevated gene editing by tcPNAs in CD117+ cells', 'Previous work suggested that there might be increased PNA-mediated editing in colony-forming progenitors12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we treated whole BM cells with either blank NPs, NPs containing tcPNA1/donor DNA, or NPs containing tcPNA4/donor DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two days later, flow cytometry was performed to assess the frequency of GFP+ cells within selected sub-populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD117+ cells showed elevated gene editing compared with the total CD45+ cell population (Fig 2a), with 8.6% in CD117+ cells after a single treatment with tcPNA4/donor DNA NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The less potent tcPNA1/donor DNA NPs still yielded an elevated correction frequency of 2.1% in CD117+ cells compared with the total BM (although fourfold lower than tcPNA4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we sorted for CD117+ cells before treatment with the NPs (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An elevated percentage of

a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on the surface of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and other cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SCF, the ligand for c-Kit, causes dimerization of the receptor, activating its kinase activity to trigger signalling pathways that impact survival, proliferation and differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We asked whether c-Kit-dependent signalling is required for elevated gene correction or whether CD117 simply serves as a marker for the increased susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we tested for gene editing in pre-sorted CD117+ cells treated with or without the c-Kit ligand, SCF, and we observed a significant increase in tcPNA4/donor DNA-mediated gene editing (up to almost 15%) in the SCF-treated cells (Fig 2c and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next assayed for tcPNA4/donor DNA NP-mediated gene editing in pre-sorted CD117+ cells in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dasatinib, which inhibits the c-Kit kinase in addition to the BCR/Abl and Src kinases, reduced the gene editing from 7 to 2.0%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibitors of factors downstream of c-Kit, including mitogen/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK; Binimetinib; MEK162) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (BKM120), also decreased gene editing in CD117+ cells to 2.6 and 4.1%, respectively (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also tested tcPNA1 (no gamma substitutions) for gene editing in pre-sorted CD117 cells treated or not with SCF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that SCF boosted tcPNA1/donor DNA gene editing up to 5% versus about 1.5% without SCF (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While substantial, this was threefold lower than the almost 15% frequency seen with the tcPNA4/donor DNA NPs in conjunction with SCF treatment of the pre-sorted CD117 cells (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results indicate that the SCF/c-Kit signalling can enhance gene editing and identify SCF as a potential agent to stimulate PNA-mediated gene modification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the results further show that tcPNAs provide increased gene editing potential as compared with regular tcPNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Increased DNA repair gene expression upon activation of c-Kit+', 'To explain the increased gene editing in CD117 cells, we tested whether CD117 might be associated with differential uptake of the NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there were no differences in uptake across several BM cell sub-populations (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we examined gene expression patterns in the c-Kit+ cells to test the hypothesis that there might be increased DNA repair gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA from sorted CD117+ and CD117 cells from the -globin/GFP mice was analysed using Illumina arrays (Supplementary Fig 9AC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that numerous DNA repair genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, Rad51, ERCC2, XRCC2 and XRCC3, showed higher levels of expression in CD117+ cells (Supplementary Figs 10 and 11a)., The elevated expression two genes likely to play a role in PNA-induced recombination, BRCA2 and Rad51, was confirmed in CD117+ cells by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (Supplementary Fig 11B,C) and by western blot (Supplementary Fig 11D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We went on to test whether SCF treatment could further increase DNA repair gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene expression profiling showed additional up-regulation of numerous DNA repair genes by SCF treatment (Fig 2e and Supplementary Fig 12A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because SCF, as a stimulatory cyctokine, would be expected to impact the cell cycle in c-Kit+ cells and because HDR gene expression is known to be elevated in S-phase, we also measured the effect of SCF on cell cycle phase distribution in the pre-sorted CD117 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that there was a 9% increase in the per cent of cells in S-phase at 48 h after SCF treatment as compared with no SCF treatment (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, some component of the SCF effect on DNA repair genes could be an indirect effect of cell cycle changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The c-Kit pathway induces functionally elevated DNA repair', 'To test whether the above increases in DNA repair gene expression could be correlated with functional differences in DNA repair, we used a luciferase-based assay to quantify repair of DNA DSBs by HDR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this assay, repair of a DSB in a reporter plasmid via intramolecular homologous recombination creates (reactivates) a functional luciferase gene (Fig 2f), and so the assay provides a measure of HDR capacity (validation of the assay is shown in Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results show increased HDR in CD117+ compared with CD117 cells (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDR in CD117+ cells was diminished by the kinase inhibitors MEK162, BKM120 and dasatnib (Fig 2g); conversely, it was boosted by SCF treatment

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the work reported here, we developed a gene editing strategy to correct a thalassaemia-associated mutation in the human -globin gene and tested it in an established rodent model of human -thalassaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that chemically modified, triplex-forming PNAs and donor DNAs delivered intravenously via polymer NPs, and given in combination with SCF treatment, can mediate gene editing in vivo at a level sufficient to ameliorate the disease phenotype in the mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed sustained reversal of the anaemia for up to 140 days post treatment, with normalization of serum haemoglobin concentrations and suppression of the reticulocytosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also saw a morphologic improvement in RBC cytology, along with reduced extramedullary haematopoiesis and reduction in splenomegaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that our approach has the potential to yield a significant clinical response that could relieve the morbidity and mortality associated with -thalassaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are two key advances for gene editing in this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One is the incorporation of next generation PNA chemistry by substitution at the gamma position to enhance the binding properties of the PNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second is the finding that the SCF/c-Kit pathway promotes increased gene editing by triplex-forming PNAs and donor DNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon ex vivo treatment of BM cells with PNAs, the gene editing frequency in c-Kit+ cells was as high as 8%, 34-fold higher than with unmodified PNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of SCF treatment with the PNAs yielded even higher frequencies in the c-Kit+ cells, with just over 15% in a single treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, treatment of transgenic mice carrying a -globin/GFP reporter transgene by i.p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection of SCF followed by intravenous administration of NPs containing PNAs and donor DNAs yielded gene editing in CD117+ cells at frequencies up to 1% in a single treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the thalassemic mouse model, simple intravenous injection of PNA/donor DNA NPs, plus SCF given i.p., resulted in a gene editing frequency of almost 4% in total BM cells (and 6.9% in Lin-Sca1+ cKit+ CD150+ CD135- cells, representing a sub-population of putative HSCs) and produced sustained amelioration of the disease phenotype, achieved in a minimally invasive manner without the need for stem cell harvest or transplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similarly, we achieved a frequency of 5% gene editing at the endogenous -globin gene in human CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells treated once with SCF and PNA/donor DNA NPs ex vivo, and we showed that these cells can engaft into NOD-scid IL2rnull mice with persistent evidence of gene editing, supporting the eventual translatability of our approach to individuals with thalassaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, in a series of assays for haematopoietic colony formation, for induction of inflammatory cytokines, for generation of strand breaks and for off-target mutagenesis, there was essentially no measurable cellular toxicity and very low off-target effects from the PNA-containing NPs in either the mouse or human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the human CD34+ cells, the frequency of off-target mutations at the 6 most closely homologous sites was 0.000012%, a value more than 400,000-fold lower than the gene editing frequency of 5%, providing a possible safety advantage relative to other gene editing approaches6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two recent publications used either TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing in cell culture of human iPS cells carrying the same IVS2-654 thalassaemia-associated -globin mutation site as studied here24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These publications achieved higher editing frequencies of 33% by TALENS and 12.3% by CRISPR/Cas9 in one report24 and 16.7% by CRISPR/Cas9 in the other25, compared with our editing frequency in human CD34+ cells of 5% (albeit a different cell type).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to off-target effects, these publications used a PCR-based T7E1 assay, and so quantitative comparisons with our deep sequencing results are not possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, these publications did not test their approaches in vivo, and so we cannot make comparisons to our in vivo results in the thalassemic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CD117 is the product of the c-Kit gene and is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates downstream signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that activation of this pathway promotes gene editing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, we observed elevated DNA repair gene expression in CD117 cells, including factors that may play a role in triplex-induced gene editing4,10,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that CD117+ cells show functional increases in DNA repair and that treatment with SCF produces further increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The 4% frequency of gene editing in total BM cells (and 6.9% in Lin-Sca1+ cKit+ CD150+ CD135- putative HSCs) achieved in the thalassemic mice was sufficient to achieve a clear improvement in phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That gene correction at these frequencies could confer a phenotypic impact is consistent with transplantation studies in thalassemic mice and in patients in which mixed chimerism at one ratio of wild-type donor to thalassemic recipient cells in the marrow has produced much higher proportions of donor RBCs in the periphery28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect has been attributed to increased survival of genetically corrected erythroblasts during erythropoiesis, decreased ineffective erythropoiesis and increased survival in the circulation of corrected erythrocytes relative to thalassemic RBCs30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, our results provide motivation for further development of NP-mediated delivery of PNAs and donor DNAs as a possible therapeutic strategy to achieve in vivo gene editing for treatment of human genetic disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work here demonstrates gene editing in BM, but other work from our group has shown that NP delivery of PNAs to lung airway epithelia is also possible to achieve correction of the CFTR gene mutation associated with cystic fibrosis31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, the effect of SCF on gene editing in BM raises the possibility that other cytokines or growth factors could similarly serve to boost gene editing potential not only in BM but also in other tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the ability of SCF (which is an established activator of HSCs and is in clinical use) to stimulate gene editing by triplex-forming PNAs may also be applicable to other editing methods, such as CRISPR/Cas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further improvements in PNA-mediated gene editing are still possible via additional PNA chemical modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most encouraging at this point, however, is that even though PNAs show improved gene editing potency, the off-target effects in the genome remain extremely low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in accordance with the lack of intrinsic nuclease activity in PNAs, and reflects the mechanism of triplex-induced gene editing, which creates an altered helix that engages endogenous DNA repair pathways.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
