A squalene synthase-like enzyme initiates production of tetraterpenoid hydrocarbons in Botryococcus braunii Race L  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The green microalga Botryococcus braunii is considered a promising biofuel feedstock producer due to its prodigious accumulation of hydrocarbon oils that can be converted into fuels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  B. braunii Race L produces the C40 tetraterpenoid hydrocarbon lycopadiene via an uncharacterized biosynthetic pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural similarities suggest this pathway follows a biosynthetic mechanism analogous to that of C30 squalene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confirming this hypothesis, the current study identifies C20 geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) as a precursor for lycopaoctaene biosynthesis, the first committed intermediate in the production of lycopadiene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two squalene synthase (SS)-like complementary DNAs are identified in race L with one encoding a true SS and the other encoding an enzyme with lycopaoctaene synthase (LOS) activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, LOS uses alternative C15 and C20 prenyl diphosphate substrates to produce combinatorial hybrid hydrocarbons, but almost exclusively uses GGPP in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discovery highlights how SS enzyme diversification results in the production of specialized tetraterpenoid oils in race L of B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  braunii.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Microalgae are a promising next-generation source of feedstocks for biofuel production with the potential to serve as a practical alternative to petroleum-based transportation fuels1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the microalgal species, the oils produced vary from triacylglycerols to hydrocarbons2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrocarbon-based fuels are preferred over other biofuels, as they are highly compatible with existing petroleum infrastructures and possess superior fuel properties4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colony-forming green microalga B. braunii is an exciting candidate for biofuel feedstock production, as it produces up to 61% of its dry weight as liquid hydrocarbon oils6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hydrocarbons are produced inside the cells of the colony, seen as intracellular oil bodies and secreted into the colony extracellular matrix where the majority of the hydrocarbons are stored6 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, catalytic hydrocracking of hydrocarbons from this alga results in petroleum-equivalent fuels of gasoline, kerosene and diesel7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, geologic evidence also shows a direct contribution of this alga to the formation of currently used fossil fuel deposits around the globe8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the aforementioned advantages of B. braunii, its use for biofuel feedstock production is hindered by a slow growth rate and the lack of transformation systems to achieve targeted genetic modification3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the identification of B. braunii hydrocarbon biosynthetic pathways and associated genes/enzymes can provide options for metabolically engineering these pathways into heterologous hosts with better growth characteristics and the ability to be genetically manipulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would then allow the development of improved versions of hydrocarbon biosynthetic enzymes, to direct production towards the most commercially desirable products13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Background information on lycopadiene biosynthesis in B. braunii race L.(a) Confocal microscopy image of an L race colony of B. braunii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shown are hydrocarbon oils stained using the neutral lipid-binding stain Nile red (false coloured green) and chlorophyll autofluorescence (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indicated are intracellular hydrocarbon oil bodies, hydrocarbon oil in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and an individual cell as defined by chlorophyll autofluorescence from the single chloroplast in each cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Image is an overlay of Nile red signal, chlorophyll autofluorescence signal and a bright-field image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 20m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Two possible pathways for lycopadiene biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possibility 1: GGPP reduction to PPP followed by condensation of two PPP molecules, to directly produce lycopadiene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possibility 2: condensation of two molecules of GGPP to form lycopaoctaene, which would then be reduced to lycopadiene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Two-step reaction catalysed by single SS enzyme: two molecules of FPP are condensed to squalene through the PSPP intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In b and c, enzyme names are coloured blue.Full size image', 'There are three different races of B. braunii based on the hydrocarbons synthesized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Race A produces fatty acid-derived C23C33 alkadienes and alkatrienes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Races B and L produce isoprenoid-derived hydrocarbons: methylsqualenes and C30C37 botryococcene triterpenoids in race B and the C40 tetraterpenoid lycopadiene, the focus of this study, in race L6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Green algae have been shown to possess only the plastid-localized methyl erythritol phosphate pathway to supply isoprenoid precursors for terpene production14,15, and thus lycopadiene is predicted to be generated from C5 precursors via this route.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the exact mechanism of lycopadiene biosynthesis from C20 prenyl diphosphate intermediates has been a mystery and two possible biosynthetic routes have been suggested (Fig 1b)16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first entails C20 geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) reduction by GGPP reductase to produce C20 phytyl diphosphate (PPP; Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two molecules of PPP would then undergo head-to-head condensation (1-1 linkage) to produce lycopadiene (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second possibility is the head-to-head condensation of two GGPP molecules to produce lycopaoctaene, followed by stepwise enzymatic reduction to produce lycopadiene (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using either proposed route, the condensation of PPP or GGPP is predicted to proceed in a reaction mechanism similar to that carried out by the enzyme squalene synthase (SS), which forms C30 squalene, a precursor required for sterol biosynthesis in eukaryotes17 and hopanoids in some prokaryotes18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SS enzymes catalyse a two-step reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the condensation of two C15 farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) molecules yields the cyclopropyl intermediate presqualene diphosphate (PSPP; Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, PSPP undergoes NADPH-dependent reductive rearrangement to form squalene with a 1-1 linkage between the two FPP molecules (Fig 1c)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein we report the elucidation of the first committed step in the lycopadiene hydrocarbon biosynthetic pathway in B. braunii Race L, which is catalysed by a new SS-like (SSL) enzyme.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'L race hydrocarbon content and related enzyme activity', 'Previous studies reported trans,trans-lycopadiene as the predominant hydrocarbon (98% of total hydrocarbons) produced by race L, with a small amount of lycopatriene also documented16,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the lycopatriene structure was not determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we first set out to ascertain and refine the hydrocarbon profile of B. braunii Race L, to provide a baseline for our biosynthetic models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of purified hydrocarbons by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS) showed that lycopadiene accounts for 95% of the total hydrocarbon pool (Fig 2a (I)), with six other minor compounds constituting the remaining 5%: lycopatriene, lycopatetraene, lycopapentaene, lycopapentaene isomer, lycopahexaene and a C35H64 molecule (Fig 2a (IIVII) and Supplementary Figs 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ozonolysis experiments suggested lycopatriene and lycopapentaene share an identical reduced C20 moiety with lycopadiene (Supplementary Figs 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to confirm identity and structure, including double bond positions, of each molecule (Fig 2a, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figs 815).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first report of lycopatetraene, lycopapentaene and lycopahexaene hydrocarbons from B. braunii race L. The lack of detectable amounts of lycopaoctaene and lycopaheptaene in the total hydrocarbon fraction could be due to rapid conversion of these metabolites into more highly saturated homologues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the unique C35H64 isoprenoid hydrocarbon detected contains seven isoprene units and thus is assigned to the recently named C35 terpene class sesquarterpenes22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Hydrocarbon composition and hydrocarbon-related enzyme activities in B. braunii race L.(a) Representative GCMS profiles of purified hydrocarbons and their corresponding names and structures (IVII).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures of hydrocarbons were determined by 1H- and 13C-NMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lycopadiene carbon numbering (I) is used for numbering all C40 hydrocarbons of race L. Percentage next to the name of each hydrocarbon corresponds to its average amount present in total hydrocarbon pool from three independent culture cycles (n=3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Radioactive enzyme assays were conducted using different protein fractions of race L cell lysates to test the two possible lycopadiene biosynthetic pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enzyme activities were calculated based on the incorporation of 3H-GGPP into lycopaoctaene, 3H-PPP into lycopadiene and 3H-FPP into squalene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SS enzyme activity is used as a positive control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values shown are the meanÂ±s.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  obtained from three independent experiments (n=3).Full size image', 'To gain more insight into the mechanism of lycopadiene biosynthesis and assess the validity of the two possible lycopadiene biosynthetic routes (Fig 1b), a cell-free in vitro enzyme assay was developed using total, soluble and microsomal protein fractions with 3H-labelled PPP and GGPP substrates for potential incorporation into lycopadiene and lycopaoctaene, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Squalene production by SS enzyme activity with 3H-labelled FPP as substrate was used as a control23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lycopadiene production from PPP was not detected in any protein fraction tested, whereas lycopaoctaene biosynthesis from GGPP was easily observed, mainly in the microsomal fraction (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates a lycopaoctaene synthase (LOS) activity is localized to a membrane system, possibly the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as is seen for SS24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tellingly, LOS activity in these assays was detected when using the same cofactor and divalent metal cation as those used for SS activity measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest direct lycopadiene biosynthesis from PPP is not a significant contributor to C40 hydrocarbon production in race L, whereas conversion of GGPP into lycopaoctaene occurs readily, as proposed in the second hypothetical route (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, LOS enzyme activity directly correlated with lycopadiene accumulation over the growth cycle, suggesting this activity is related to hydrocarbon biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection of LOS activity from an algal homogenate in an assay similar to that of SS supports the notion that an LOS enzyme may be similar to a typical SS enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identification of an LOS enzyme', 'To identify the gene(s) responsible for lycopaoctaene biosynthesis, we generated and computationally screened an L race transcriptomic database for SSL sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two SSL cDNAs were identified and named based on the function of their encoded proteins as detailed below: SS from race L (LSS) and LOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the LSS and LOS proteins contain all five conserved activity domains, the transmembrane domain and the NADPH-binding residues found in typical SS enzymes (Supplementary Figs 17 and 18)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the encoded amino acid sequences showed 57.5 and 49.2% identity to SS from race B (BSS)25 for LSS and LOS, respectively (Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, comparison of LOS with other SS and SSL enzymes showed 52.5% identity to LSS, 47.3% identity to the Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) SS (SlSS), 44.6, 61.7 and 44.1% identity to the SSL-1, -2 and -3 from the B race of B. braunii, and 33.9% identity to the human SS (HSS; Supplementary Fig 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies17,26,27,28, including the recent determination of the crystal structure of HSS29, have elucidated the catalytic mechanism of the SS reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies have shown the FLAP domain, domains IV and the JK loop of HSS form the SS active site29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, several HSS residues (Ser51, Sr53, Tyr171 and Gln212), two DXXED motifs in domains II and IV, and the NADPH-binding residues were determined to be key for catalytic activity (see Supplementary Fig 18)29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these catalytic residues and motifs are also conserved in both the LSS and LOS enzymes (Supplementary Fig 18), making it difficult at this time to determine which domains/residues are specific for LOS activity in a comparison of LSS and LOS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For initial characterization of the enzymatic activity of LSS and LOS, both proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant proteins tested for enzyme activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LSS was shown to yield squalene as its sole product in an in vitro assay with FPP as the substrate, as expected (Fig 3a,b (I)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, purified recombinant LOS incubated with GGPP in an in vitro assay showed lycopaoctaene as the sole reaction product (Fig 3a,b (II)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As LOS may have arisen from an SS paralogue that evolved to accept GGPP as substrate for lycopaoctaene production, we considered that LOS may have retained the ability to use FPP to produce squalene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, squalene production was detected when LOS was incubated with FPP in an in vitro reaction (Fig 3a,b (III)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More surprising, LOS incubation with PPP yielded lycopadiene, albeit at levels much lower than lycopaoctaene or squalene (Fig 3a,b (IV)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar in vitro incubations of LSS with GGPP or PPP did not result in lycopaoctaene or lycopadiene production (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As LOS can use three different substrates, steady-state kinetic experiments were performed with FPP, GGPP and PPP, to analyse LOS substrate specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LOS enzyme shows higher substrate affinity (Km) for GGPP compared with that of FPP and PPP, and the turnover number (kcat) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for PPP are an order of magnitude less than for FPP and GGPP (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Functional characterization of SSL enzymes from race L in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Diagram of reactions showing substrates and products for the analysis in b and c.

however, subsequent studies determined lycopaoctaene could not be an intermediate in carotenoid biosynthesis35,36, raising the possibility that lycopaoctaene production in these studies was an in vitro artefact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more relevant study reported the ability of purified yeast SS to use GGPP for lycopaoctaene production in vitro, at levels much lower than native squalene production32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we did not detect any lycopaoctaene production when AtGGPPS11 was expressed alone in wild-type yeast (Fig 3c (II)), suggesting that yeast SS does not use GGPP in vivo under the conditions employed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the ability of LOS to catalyse the conversion of PPP to lycopadiene may not have biological significance as we did not detect lycopadiene production using PPP as the substrate ex vivo in race L cell lysates (Fig 2b) and the efficiency of LOS to use PPP as a substrate is quite low (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results suggest that the relevant in vivo route to lycopadiene production is unlikely to involve the condensation of two PPP molecules by LOS, but rather, as we contend, the condensation of two GGPP molecules to form lycopaoctaene, for eventual conversion to lycopadiene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'LOS is promiscuous towards prenyl substrates', 'The LOS enzyme was further characterized using combinations of FPP, GGPP and PPP as substrates in in vitro reactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in the presence of FPP and GGPP, LOS produced significant amounts of squalene and a C35H58 molecule, and lesser amounts of lycopaoctaene (Fig 4a (I)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C35H58 molecule is a chimera produced from head-to-head condensation of one FPP molecule and one GGPP molecule, and its identity was confirmed by GCMS (Supplementary Fig 20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, when LOS was supplied with FPP and PPP, squalene production predominated with small amounts of C35H64 and lycopadiene (Fig 4a (II)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C35H64, also a chimeric hydrocarbon, is produced as a result of head-to-head condensation of one molecule each of FPP and PPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, LOS incubation with GGPP and PPP produced lycopadiene and lycopapentaene as minor products and lycopaoctaene as the major product (Fig 4a (III)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Characterization of substrate use for SS and SSL enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Diagram of reactions showing substrates and products, and GCMS profiles of LOS enzyme assay products with: I, FPP and GGPP substrates to produce squalene (1), C35H58 (3) and lycopaoctaene (6);

however, without NADH or NADPH only the reaction intermediate PLPP accumulated32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we showed that LOS is strongly inhibited by squalestatin (Fig 5c), a potent SS inhibitor that mimics PSPP binding23,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we identified PLPP as a reaction intermediate by conducting a GGPP-based LOS assay in the absence of NADPH, followed by acid phosphatase treatment to convert PLPP to prelycopaoctaene alcohol (PLOH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis by GCMS showed the presence of PLOH (Fig 5d) with a fragmentation pattern consistent with previous reports of PLOH (Supplementary Fig 21)32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results are consistent with a two-step LOS reaction to produce lycopaoctaene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analogy to SS, LOS catalyses the condensation of two GGPP units in the first half reaction to form the cyclopropylcarbinyl diphosphate intermediate PLPP, with concomitant release of one molecule of inorganic pyrophosphate (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second half reaction, the PLPP cyclopropyl ring is cleaved and rearranged to form a 1-1 linkage and further reduction by NADPH forms lycopaoctaene (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Characterization of the LOS reaction intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Proposed LOS reaction mechanism to produce the PLPP intermediate and lycopaoctaene final product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Radioactive LOS enzyme assays conducted with 3H-GGPP substrate with or without NADH or NADPH reducing agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values shown are the meanÂ±s.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  obtained from three independent measurements (n=3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) GCMS profiles of LOS enzyme assay with GGPP as substrate to produce lycopaoctaene (1): I, in the absence, or II, in the presence of 20ânM squalestatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) GCMS profile of products from LOS enzyme assay with GGPP substrate in the absence of NADPH to produce PLPP, which was hydrolysed by acid phosphatase to yield PLOH for GCMS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data shown in c and d are representatives from three different experiments (n=3).Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our studies identified the first committed step in lycopadiene biosynthesis in race L of B. braunii and describe a new SSL enzyme, LOS, which carries out this reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this enzyme may be used to engineer the effective production of hydrocarbon biofuel feedstocks in other photosynthetic or heterotrophic organisms in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This novel enzyme produces the tetraterpenoid lycopaoctaene from GGPP in a reaction analogous to that of SS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lycopaoctaene would then undergo sequential reduction by a yet-to-be identified reductase enzyme(s) to form lycopahexaene, lycopapentaene, lycopatetraene, lycopatriene and finally lycopadiene as the major hydrocarbon product of the pathway (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show that the wild-type LOS enzyme displays remarkable substrate flexibility and can use at least three different, naturally occurring C15 and C20 prenyl diphosphate substrates in vivo and in vitro for the combinatorial biosynthesis of hydrocarbons belonging to three terpene classes: triterpenes, sesquarterpenes and tetraterpenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Proposed pathway for lycopadiene biosynthesis.LOS uses GGPP in a two-step reaction to produce lycopaoctaene, which is further reduced by a yet unknown enzyme(s) to produce lycopahexaene, lycopapentaene, lycopatetraene, lycopatriene and finally lycopadiene.Full size image', 'When used under artificial reaction conditions, other SSL enzymes have been described to show relaxed substrate flexibility and to yield products of varying lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such enzyme is CrtM, a dehydrosqualene synthase from Staphylococcus aureus that is involved in C30 carotenoid biosynthesis41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In S. aureus and also when overexpressed in E. coli, CrtM uses two FPP molecules to produce dehydrosqualene, a C30 squalene-like molecule with a cis double bond at the 1-1 linkage of the two FPP molecules44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of a GGPP synthase in E. coli also expressing CrtM led to the depletion of FPP and the overproduction of GGPP41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, CrtM was found to generate its native C30 product, a C35 homologue and C40 phytoene, indicating the ability of CrtM to accept GGPP as a substrate when the natural FPP substrate is limiting41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CrtM was further engineered through mutations to accept C25 farnesylgeranyl diphosphate, yielding C40, C45 and C50 homologues of dehydrosqualene in the presence of FPP, farnesylgeranyl diphosphate and GGPP42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In another study, SSs from yeast, pig and rat have been shown to accept non-natural derivatives of FPP, to generate several unnatural terpene products in vitro45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, yeast SS has been shown to yield alternative products in vitro from FPP as a substrate under various non-physiological reaction conditions, such as in the absence of NADPH with extended incubation times or in the presence of an unreactive NADPH analogue47,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Irrespective of these examples, the promiscuity of LOS is still remarkable, considering that the wild-type LOS enzyme is able to accept three naturally occurring prenyl diphosphate substrates and produce the chimeric hydrocarbons described here without the need for mutations or altered, non-physiological reaction conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such remarkable intrinsic substrate promiscuity has not been documented for any other eukaryotic SS or SSL enzyme up until now.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ours and other studies37,50 raise the question about how SSL enzymes arise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LSS and LOS from B. braunii share  greater than 50% sequence identity and both contain the important catalytic residues and conserved domains of SS enzymes (Supplementary Fig 18), but they still have different substrate preferences and product formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesize that an ancient SS gene may have undergone gene duplication in race L. The paralogue that gave rise to LSS maintained the ability to produce squalene as its sole product to support sterol biosynthesis for primary metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the paralogue that yielded LOS developed the use of alternative substrates for hydrocarbon oil production, while also preserving SS activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar scenario has been suggested as a possible mechanism for generating new secondary metabolites that may provide a fitness benefit to the host organism42,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For B. braunii, it has been proposed that hydrocarbon oils and their derivatives increase the buoyancy of colonies for increased exposure to sunlight50,52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar gene diversifications have also been proposed in the B race of B. braunii for botryococcene production, and in some bacteria for squalene generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For botryococcene production, SS duplications gave rise to the SSL-1 and SSL-3 genes/enzymes responsible for botryococcene production, while retaining a residual ability to produce squalene37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bacteria, a three-enzyme system for squalene production arose from successive gene duplication events50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'LOS produces a variety of terpenes in vitro when offered a mixture of substrates and may likely also do so in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the in vitro mixed substrate assays with LOS (Fig 4a), a C35H64 molecule was observed from FPP and PPP condensation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This product has the exact same GC retention time and mass spectrum as the C35H64 hydrocarbon detected in the total hydrocarbon pool (Fig 2a (VII) and Fig 4a (II)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that LOS is also promiscuous in B. braunii cells, but at best has limited access to the FPP and PPP pools, as the C35H64 product only comprises 0.15% of the total hydrocarbons (Fig 2a (VII)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FPPGGPP condensation product C35H58 seen in these in vitro assays (Fig 4a (I)) is not detected in the total hydrocarbon pool, possibly because this molecule is reduced to C35H64 in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that two previous studies described several C35 squalene-like isoprenoids from Methanococcus jannaschii and Thermococcus barophilus, including the C35H58 and C35H64 molecules identified here54,55, although the enzymatic basis for the biosynthesis of these products remains uncharacterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the ability of LOS to produce lycopapentaene as an observed in vitro condensation product of GGPP and PPP (Fig 4a (III)) may indicate the existence of an alternative in vivo biosynthetic route to this molecule and may be partially responsible for the relative prevalence of lycopapentaene (3% of total hydrocarbons; Fig 2a (IV)) among the minor hydrocarbons of race L. This would suggest that LOS can also use PPP in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, LOS does not appear to use PPP as a single substrate for lycopadiene production in vivo, as we were not able to detect lycopadiene synthesis activity in cell fractions using PPP as substrate (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The promiscuous LOS described in this work is nevertheless used by B. braunii Race L to produce lycopaoctaene preferentially over squalene, as shown by the large amounts of hydrocarbon oils produced by this alga and the absence of detectable amounts of squalene or non-sterol squalene derivatives in the total hydrocarbon pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, accumulation of the non-sterol squalene derivatives methylsqualenes in race B are thought to arise from squalene produced by the additional enzyme SSL-2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, detection of non-sterol squalene derivatives in race L would be expected if LOS was producing squalene in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hypothesize that the observed preference of LOS for C40 lycopaoctaene biosynthesis over C30 squalene production in vivo may result from an increased flux from GGPP over FPP due to metabolic channelling, to form a biosynthetic metabolon specific for lycopadiene production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of such metabolons is common in plants and is used for channelling substrates and intermediates required for the biosynthesis of different classes of plant natural products, including isoprenoids56,57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When expressed in yeast, LOS may produce squalene presumably due to a lack of this proposed metabolon, thus giving LOS access to the FPP pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore conclude that LOS is responsible for synthesizing lycopaoctaene as the first committed step towards lycopadiene hydrocarbon biosynthesis in race L of B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  braunii.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
