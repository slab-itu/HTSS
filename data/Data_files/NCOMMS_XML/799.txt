Rapid generation of hypomorphic mutations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hypomorphic mutations are a valuable tool for both genetic analysis of gene function and for synthetic biology applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, current methods to generate hypomorphic mutations are limited to a specific organism, change gene expression unpredictably, or depend on changes in spatial-temporal expression of the targeted gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a simple and predictable method to generate hypomorphic mutations in model organisms by targeting translation elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding consecutive adenosine nucleotides, so-called polyA tracks, to the gene coding sequence of interest will decrease translation elongation efficiency, and in all tested cell cultures and model organisms, this decreases mRNA stability and protein expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that protein expression is adjustable independent of promoter strength and can be further modulated by changing sequence features of the polyA tracks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These characteristics make this method highly predictable and tractable for generation of programmable allelic series with a range of expression levels.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Manipulation of gene activity is a standard genetic approach to gain insight into gene function in single and multicellular organisms1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many cases, complete loss of gene function (null allele or knockout of the locus) will provide the most valuable information about gene function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for essential genes, complete loss of function leads to lethality, which usually precludes obtaining functional information for later cellular or developmental stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, for genes that function in multiple cellular/developmental processes and have pleiotropic null mutant phenotypes, it can be difficult to distinguish primary from secondary effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many of these cases, however, partial loss of function or hypomorphic mutations can overcome lethality and pleiotropy, allowing later stage cells and organisms to be examined for phenotypic consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, hypomorphic mutations, because they retain residual gene activity and partial phenotypes, are used in suppressor or enhancer genetic screens to identify other genes that act in the same biological process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One example of a hypomorphic condition is a 50% reduction in gene activity from heterozygosity for a null allele, which for some genes can display mutant phenotypes (called a haploinsufficency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for other genes a 50% reduction in gene activity is sufficient for normal function, and thus hypomorphic mutations with a further reduction are required to observe a phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these reasons, it is important to have the ability to generate hypomorphic mutations with a range of loss of gene activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hypomorphic mutations are traditionally obtained in forward genetic chemical mutagenesis screens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hypomorphic allele needs to be isolated, identified, and then genetically and biochemically characterized in order to be further used in analysis to deduce gene function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, this process is time consuming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, because of evolution, discovered alleles can be species specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These difficulties and the importance of hypomorphic alleles have prompted the development of several methods to generate hypomorphic mutations directly in various model organisms2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these methods again are usually specific to one organism, can have unpredictable alterations in gene activity (separation of function, gain of function), or can change other aspects of regulation that affect interpretation of phenotype, such as spatial-temporal gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the rise of gene editing systems, such as CRISPR/Cas9 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) or TALEN technology13, and more extensive use of synthetic and systems biology approaches14,15, there is an increasing interest in generating hypomorphic mutations of a target gene through simpler, more systematic and rapid approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we present a method for the generation of hypomorphic mutations that produces a range of reduced levels of nearly wild type protein through the use of disrupted translational elongation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method is based on polyA tracks, a novel cis regulatory element that decreases gene expression by disrupting messenger RNA (mRNA) translation16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of consecutive adenosine nucleotides into the open reading frame of an mRNA will decrease protein expression by decreasing the efficiency of the translation elongation phase leading to diminished production of protein and mRNA destabilization, and thus to diminished mRNA levels.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Use of polyA tracks to generate hypomorphic mutants', 'We have recently identified polyA tracks as a regulator of gene expression16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is used endogenously in most eukaryotic genomes and regulates 2% of human genes16,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polyA track causes ribosomal stalling and frameshifting during translation elongation, leading to mRNA instability and degradation of nascent protein products16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The translation elongation cycle is an ideal target for a universal method of gene regulation because it is the most highly conserved step in protein biosynthesis between bacteria and eukaryotes19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we reasoned that polyA tracks, because of their versatility in lengths and sequence composition, can be used as a system to create programmable hypomorphic mutants and regulate gene expression in a wide variety of model organisms (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Design and mechanism of polyA track tag regulated gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Scheme of inserted polyA tracks in the reporter genes used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hemagglutinin (HA) tag (grey) and polyA tracks (red) were introduced in the coding region of the reporter genes next to the start AUG codon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exon boundaries as well as termination codon (Stop) are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Proposed correlation between gene products levels, mRNA and protein, and the length of inserted polyA track tags.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction in levels of both reporter protein and mRNA is dependent on increasing length of consecutive adenosine nucleotides in the coding sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Scheme of translation of eukaryotic reporter mRNA with or without inserted polyA tracks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of inserted polyA track tag determines the protein output of the regulated reporter gene as indicated by the number of globular protein structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Features of the eukaryotic mRNAs (m7GpppGcap, AUGstart codon, Stoptermination codon and polyA tail), as well as HA-tag, position of the polyA track tag, ribosome and nascent polypeptide chain are illustrated in the scheme.Full size image', 'We have generated a fluorescent reporter gene that has an insertion of defined polyA tracks in order to control the amount of expression (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reporter consists of either a constitutive or inducible promoter driving expression of the mCherry fluorescence and other reporter proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A double HA-tag was added at the beginning of the coding sequence for detection through western blot analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polyA track is inserted directly after the HA-tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length of the polyA track varies from 9 to 36 consecutive adenosine nucleotides, adding 312 lysine residues to the protein sequence (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the effects of polybasic peptide arising from sequential lysine residues20,21, we also generated control reporters with consecutive lysine AAG codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that as the length of the polyA track is increased, expression of the reporter gene products will decrease (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These reporters can be transiently transfected, recombined or inserted into the genome of cell cultures or whole organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, endogenous genes can be edited to include a polyA track in their open reading frames (ORFs) using genome editing methodology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PolyA tracks can regulate gene expression in Escherichia coli', 'We first tested whether polyA tracks can be used in single-cell model organisms to attenuate gene expression from a defined reporter gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous attempts to control gene expression in Escherichia coli cells have used degeneration of ribosome binding sequence2 (rbs) or spacer sequence between rbs sequence and starting AUG codon22, but did not focus on the coding sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To show that polyA tracks can be used to control gene expression in E. coli cells, we created a set of reporters with increasing length of polyA tracks under the arabinose-inducible promoter pBAD (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We transformed E. coli cells with plasmids expressing HA-mCherry, HA-(AAG)n-mCherry or HA-(AAA)n-mCherry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All E. coli cell cultures were induced at the same optical density and monitored for both cell growth and fluorescence of the mCherry constructs during induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While E. coli containing wild type and LysAAG controls (6 × , 9 × and 12 × lysine AAG codons) show no significant differences in the amount of mCherry fluorescence, cell cultures containing constructs with polyA tracks show progressively less fluorescence with increasing length of the polyA track (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of 9 and 12As in a row (3 or 4 LysAAA codons) consistently reduced fluorescence of mCherry reporter by 1535%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further additions in the length of the polyA track resulted in continuing decreases in mCherry reporter fluorescence to the point where 36 consecutive adenosine nucleotides resulted in barely visible expression of the reporter ( less_than 5% of wild type).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analyses of equal amounts of E. coli cell lysates expressing different polyA track and control reporters were consistent with the mCherry fluorescence data and indicated again that protein abundance of reporter proteins strongly depends on the length of the polyA track (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reporters with 9 and 12As in a row (3 and 4LysAAA codons, respectively) show reduction in protein abundance in the range of 2040% of the wild type mCherry, and constructs with  greater than 27As in a row (9 and more LysAAA codons) were nearly undetectable by western blot analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Regulation of reporter gene by polyA tracks in the

gene with polyA tracks, we tested whether insertion of non-lysine codons in the middle of long polyA tracks (33As, 11 AAA codons) would result in change of the reporter accumulation in E. coli cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, addition of such codons did not change levels of the fluorescent reporter drastically but fine-tuned them to the fluorescent values between constructs with 30As or 33As in a row (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional analysis of XAA and AAY codons, where X and Y denote C/G or T/C/G nucleotides respectively, for programming the length of polyA tracks revealed that gene attenuation by polyA tracks does not depend necessarily on lysine codons but other codons can contribute to the overall length and effects of polyA tracks (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar manner endogenous genes with different arrangement of Arich codons (mainly lysine encoding AAA and AAG codons) have shown differential gene regulation in our previous study17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PolyA tracks can be used in protozoan T. thermophila', 'We previously showed that polyA tracks can influence expression of the reporter genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether polyA tracks can regulate gene expression in another model, single-cell eukaryotic organism, we monitored the effect of various length tracks on YFP expression in the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genome of T. thermophila has extremely high AT content ( greater than 75%) and has been extensively used as a microbial animal model23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our T. thermophila reporter contained the coding sequence of a Macronucleus-Localized Protein of unknown function (MLP1, TTHERM_00384860) fused to eYFP protein (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fusion with MLP1 directed YFP to Tetrahymena macronuclei to allow easier quantification of YFP levels (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two proteins were fused, separated by linkers containing an HA-tag (MLP1-HA-YFP (WT)) and polyA tracks of 18, 27 or 36As, (AAA)6, (AAA)9 or (AAA)12, respectively, or 12 LysAAG (AAG)12 codons inserted as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All constructs were expressed upon cadmium-induction of the upstream MTT1 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Just as in our E. coli experiments with mCherry reporter, the YFP gene containing increasing lengths of polyA tracks exhibited a progressive decrease in total protein accumulation, measured by fluorescence, relative to the HA-linker fusion or LysAAG insertion controls (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The construct with 18As in a row (6LysAAA) showed 50% reduction in protein fluorescence, while constructs with 27 and 36As exhibited nearly undetectable levels of fluorescence and required 20 times longer exposure for detection of YFP by microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The construct with 12LysAAG codons showed fluorescence that was 45 fold lower than the WT construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect was comparable to the polybasic peptide stalling that was observed earlier in S. cerevisiae cells17,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further supported our fluorescence results by western blot analyses (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MLP1-HA-YFP-fusion (WT) was readily visible, whereas the polyA track-YFP fusions exhibited attenuated expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of 18As (6LysAAA) showed expression levels that were 35% of the HA-YFP control, while 27 and 36As (9 and 12LysAAA) constructs were at the limit of detection (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of 12LysAAG codons in the fusion protein resulted in a 6- to 8-fold reduction in expression of fusion protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the different fusion proteins were all transcribed from the MTT1 promoter under identical induction conditions we reasoned that the amount of mRNA produced for each construct should be equivalent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used qRT-PCR to quantify the steady-state level of YFP mRNA for each fusion (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steady-state mRNA levels of polyA track-YFP constructs reflected the decreasing YFP protein accumulation relative to the WT consistent with earlier reports in S. cerevisae17,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of 18As (6LysAAA codons) reduced mRNA levels to approximately 3035% of WT levels, while insertion of 27 and 36As (9 and 12LysAAA codons, respectively) reduced mRNA levels to  less_than 5% of the HA-YFP construct (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, while attenuation at the protein level was stronger for the insertion of 12LysAAG codons than for 6LysAAA codons, the trend was not consistent at the mRNA level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed discrepancies between the protein levels and mRNA degradation in the case of polybasic peptide (12 AAG codon) are likely attributed to the two distinct pathways employed in regulation of polybasic peptide stalling and polyA track induced stalling and frameshifting in eukaryotic cells16,17,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the effects of polyA tracks on regulation of the reporter gene showed a consistent relationship between mRNA levels and protein accumulation levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, we were able to control expression of reporter genes using polyA tracks in T. thermophila, a single-cell AT-rich protozoan, as we previously reported in S. cerevisiae and the above-mentioned E. coli cells17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PolyA tracks can regulate gene expression in plant tissues', 'To test whether polyA tracks can attenuate gene expression in plants, we transiently co-expressed HA-(AAA)n-mCherry with an YFP construct as an internal control in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of mCherry and YFP was assessed by fluorescence imaging (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like cell cultures, N. benthamiana epidermal cells showed attenuated mCherry fluorescence proportional to the length of the polyA tracks (6,9 and 12 LysAAA codons) compared with the HA-mCherry and 12 LysAAG control constructs (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence data for each construct revealed the same trend of gene expression regulation as in T. thermophila cells (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As fluorescence in this assay was not quantifiable, protein abundance was determined by semi-quantitative western blot analysis of N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with the HA-(AAA)n-mCherry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The levels of HA-mCherry proteins were normalized to levels of the cis-linked selectable marker phosphinotricin acetyl transferase (BAR) in the same sample (Fig 3b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The addition of a polyA track with 18As (6 LysAAA) decreased protein accumulation to 70% of HA-mCherry levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further reduction of mCherry protein accumulation, to 30% and below the detection limit was observed in 9 LysAAA and 12 LysAAA constructs, respectively (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of 12 LysAAG codons displayed 50% reduction in the reporter expression compared with WT construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parallel analyses of steady-state mRNA levels of transcripts with increasing lengths of polyA tracks showed progressively reduced levels of polyA track mRNAs when compared with transcript levels of the HA-mCherry and AAG-containing control constructs (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mRNA levels were reduced to 5055% of WT expression for 6LysAAA transcripts, while 9 and 12LysAAA constructs had reduced mRNA levels to 30 and 20% of control, respectively (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of 12 LysAAG codons exhibited marginal effects on mRNA levels and again showed the already observed discrepancy between mRNA levels and protein accumulation as a result of polybasic peptide stalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these results indicate once again that polyA tracks affect both mRNA and protein levels more consistently and can be used to regulate gene expression in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Regulation of reporter gene by polyA

expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein abundances were assessed by western blot analyses 24 h after electroporation (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in our previous study on expression of endogenous and synthetic polyA tracks in various human tissue cultures16, constructs with increasing length of polyA tracks (6, 9 and 12 LysAAA) were expressed at lower levels than control constructs and the reductions in protein expression were proportional to the length of polyA track.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The construct with 18As (6LysAAA) displayed an 3-fold reduction in expression compared with the WT construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of 27 and 36As (9 and 12LysAAA, respectively), exhibited a 6- and 25-fold reduction of HA-mCherry expression compared with WT (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control construct with 12LysAAG codons did not show any reduction in protein levels compared with the WT construct (Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results again argue for differences between translational stalling induced by polybasic peptides16,17,20,21, which seems to be cell- or organism-specific and unpredictable, and polyA track-induced ribosomal stalling and frameshifting16,17, which is clearly dependent on the length of polyA tracks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this latter pathway appears to be conserved between multiple organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether with our previous study16, our results indicate that polyA tracks can readily be used to regulate expression of reporters or genes transiently transfected in diverse eukaryotic tissues and cultured cell systems, such as N. benthamiana and human cell cultures, as well as other mammalian or insect tissue culture systems16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PolyA tracks can regulate gene expression in model organisms', 'We next sought to test whether polyA tracks can be used to regulate reporter gene expression in complex, multicellular organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose the fruit fly, Drosophilla melanogaster, because of the

of mCherry in all assayed tissues to 20 and 10% of wild type levels, respectively (Fig 4bd; Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analyses on cell lysates produced from five fruit fly larvae for each independent construct were consistent with our quantification of fluorescence imaging data (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in the previous experiments with T. thermophila and

and observed hypermutability of short tandem repeats (STRs) and homopolymeric sequences that was previously observed in different systems22,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control for the cell population heterogeneity that may arise from hypermutability of polyA tracks, we have analysed the mutation rate of a single locus insertion of our longest polyA track insertion (36As) in the D. melanogaster genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence of the mCherry reporter gene from genomic DNA isolated from a whole adult fly after more than a year of homozygote crosses, approximately 30 generations of fruit

regions from the transgenic fruit fly genome and original DNA vector revealed differences between two data sets (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 8% of the cases by Illumina sequencing we have observed loss of the polyA track because of the possible recombination event indicated by the similarity of the amplified sequence to the genomic sequence located on the chromosome X and 3L of the fruit fly genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Illumina sequencing was not reliable enough to show differences in the polyA tracks length because of the difficulty associated with sequencing of the homopolymers.

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The dose-dependent response of the doxycycline-inducible CMV promoter for both the polyA track and control mCherry transcript ranged over two orders of magnitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, relative expression of the polyA track construct was constant; 1217% expression relative to the control construct based on the western blot analysis (Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, relative mRNA levels of control and polyA track constructs did not change under different transcriptional regimes (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The steady-state amount of the polyA track construct mRNA was consistently in a range between 1 and 3% of the normalized control construct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same results are obtained using stable cell lines that express HA-tagged human haemoglobin (delta

function as well as cell homoeostasis24,31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We tested our ability to regulate gene expression of functional proteins in both the bacterial and eukaryotic cell systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In E. coli, the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene confers resistance to the broad spectrum antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAM) in a dose-dependent manner34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the CAT protein is functional only as a homotrimer which has a rather complex protein structure (PDB: 3CLA)35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, regulation of this gene and subsequent protein folding could be challenging because of the additional lysine residues introduced either by polyA track or control AAG constructs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To show that we can regulate expression of CAT protein by insertion of polyA tracks, we assessed E. coli survival under increasing concentrations of CAM in comparison with the wild type CAT gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control for the influence of additional lysine residues in the N-terminus of the CAT protein, we also inserted 10LysAAG codons in the N-terminus of CAT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of WT-CAT, (AAG)10-CAT and (AAA)n-CAT constructs was driven by the inducible arabinose promoter (pBAD, Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All E. coli cultures were pulse induced, with addition of 0.1% arabinose, and growth was monitored on LB plates using different concentrations of CAM in the media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT-CAT and AAG10-CAT control constructs were able to survive CAM selection to the same extent (75 mg ml1 CAM, Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the function of CAT protein is not affected by the addition of 10 consecutive Lys residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, polyA track constructs led to increased CAM sensitivity of E. coli cells which correlated nicely with the length of the polyA tracks inserted in the CAT gene (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the majority of constructs could grow on minimal addition of CAM in the media (15 mg ml1), constructs with 24, 27 or 30As (8, 9 and 10LysAAA) were unable to grow on LB-plates with a CAM concentration of 30 mg ml1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, survivability of E. coli cells with CAT constructs having 15, 18 and 21As (5, 6 and 7LysAAA) on one hand, and 9 and 12As (3 and 4LysAAA) on the other hand, was impaired when cells were grown on LB-plates with final CAM concentrations of

Therefore, addition of polyA tracks to functional genes in both E. coli and S. cerevisiae preserved protein structure and function but regulated protein abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While behaviour of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have presented a rapid method of generating hypomorphic mutations in a reporter or gene of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of a polyA track into a coding sequence exhibits predictable and robust attenuation of gene expression in all tested cell culture and model organism systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The length and the sequence of the polyA track can be manipulated to achieve full range of expression levels, allowing for the generation of an allelic series from the level of a complete knockout to wild type expression for the study of gene function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method can also be used in synthetic biology applications that require precise gene control and modelling of metabolic and signalling networks14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The use of polyA tracks overcomes many of the challenges present in current methods of generating hypomorphic mutations and controllable gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, an approach tested for attenuating gene expression in E. coli involves mutagenesis of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (ribosome binding sequence, rbs) in the gene of interest2,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression levels from all possible six-mer Shine-Dalgarno sequences were experimentally determined and the information is available in the EMOPEC database2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this valuable resource would have to be generated anew to use this approach in other bacteria and it cannot be applied to eukaryotic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, many orthogonal translation systems that are used to perturb gene networks rely on modified rbs (refs 40, 41, 42, 43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of an orthogonal translation system would prohibit use of the rbs for expression regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar method has overcome this problem by using tandem repeats to change the distance between the rbs and starting ATG codon and, thereby, controlling gene expression levels22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the restricted use in one system, E. coli cells, still limits application of this method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polyA track system of gene regulation that we describe here for the creation of hypomorphic mutations overcomes these issues because of its dependency on regulation of translation elongation cycle which is well conserved between bacteria and eukaryotes19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hypomorphic mutations have been generated in eukaryotic cell systems by insertion of an antibiotic resistance gene into an intron10 or the 3-untranslated region of a gene3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of the neomycin resistance gene (neo) into an intron introduces a cryptic splice site that results in aberrant splicing of transcripts, effectively reducing gene expression10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reliance on stochastic cryptic splicing events leads to unpredictable changes in transcript expression and is rather gene dependent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insertion of neo in various genes have resulted in expression of a functionally null allele44, hypomorphic expression10,45 or no change in expression46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our system of polyA tracks gives predictable gene expression attenuation in a variety of different eukaryotic systems, and furthermore shows similar relative gene expression attenuation efficiencies in different tissues of the same organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have primarily introduced polyA tracks at the N-terminal regions of reporter genes because of the uniformity of the construct design and to reduce potential frameshifting effects16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not anticipate this to be a major limitation of this method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Tetrahymena reporters place the polyA tracts at the N-terminus of YFP, but at the C-terminus of the linked Tetrahymena gene (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, insertion of polyA track in the second exon of the human beta globin gene (HBD) gene, an unstructured loop of the protein, argue that polyA tracks can be effectively introduced at various positions in the gene (Supplementary Figs 1113).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have shown previously that naturally occurring polyA track sequences exist in the human genome and that potential frameshifted products are efficiently degraded by non-sense mediated decay mechanisms16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The addition of a polyA track to the target gene will result in additional lysine residues in the protein product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like any protein tag, it is important to consider the effects of the additional residues when studying the functionality of the protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that the function and stability of two structurally diverse proteins, CAT and Ade1, are not affected by up to 12 additional lysine residues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To control for possible effects of the poly-lysine tracks, investigators can create an allele with the same number of lysine residues encoded by AAG codons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AAG codons will have minimal effect on expression levels while encoding a synonymous protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the flexibility in polyA track placement within the coding sequence allows investigators to choose the most suitable insertion site for the protein of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The conservation of the polyA track sequences in the multiple genes across vertebrates as well as our analysis of mutation rates of polyA tracks (36As) inserted in the defined locus of D. melanogaster genome argue that polyA tracks can be used to create stable hypomorphic gene alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are in the range of already described hypermutability (8%) of the short tandem repeats (STRs) and BAT-40 microsatellite (40As) located in the second intron of the 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinction is that our data show general mutation rates for the whole fruit fly after  greater than 30 generations, while in the case of the mentioned study28 the mutation rate is dependent on the cell type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An additional study found that the mutation rate in polyA region, 10As in this case, is in the range of 104 per cell per generation29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the authors argue that 1% of cells will be affected by a polyA region mutation in 100 generations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar rates were observed in the other studies with 106102 mutation rate for the different lengths of homopolymeric regions or STRs (refs 22, 47, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PolyA tracks used in our study tend to operate on the shorter side of the length distribution of STRs and as such should have similar if not even lower rates of mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PolyA tracks that are used endogenously in eukaryotic genomes are typically interrupted by other nucleotides at various positions within the A-rich sequence, which further reduces potential hypermutability effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have observed that the position of the interrupting nucleotide or codon, in combination with the length of the A-rich sequence, modulates gene expression (Supplementary Fig 2)16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that polyA-mediated regulation can be further developed for even more precise control of gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, 2% of human genes are endogenously regulated by polyA tracks, including many well-studied, disease-associated genes, such as BRCA1, TCOF1 and MTDH among others16,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we showed in our previous study, synonymous mutations of the internal polyA track of such genes can allow investigators to dramatically change expression levels of these genes without manipulation of protein sequence or gene regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of our method is not restricted only to these genes, and we feel that the synthetic biology field will benefit from this application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control of biosynthetic pathways for production of useful secondary metabolites49, antibiotics50 or recombinant antibodies51, as well as introduction of controllable retrosynthetic and fully engineered pathways52 or ultimate control of metabolic pathways in the modelling of diseases are just a few among the multiple possible applications of this method in the future.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
