Amine synthesis via iron-catalysed reductive coupling of nitroarenes with alkyl halides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'(Hetero)Aryl amines, an important class of organic molecules in medicinal chemistry, are most commonly synthesized from anilines, which are in turn synthesized by hydrogenation of nitroarenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amine synthesis directly from nitroarenes is attractive due to improved step economy and functional group compatibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these potential advantages, there is yet no general method for the synthesis of (hetero)aryl amines by carbonnitrogen cross-coupling of nitroarenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the reductive coupling of nitroarenes with alkyl halides to yield (hetero)aryl amines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple iron catalyst enables the coupling with numerous primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl halides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broad scope and high functional group tolerance are demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistic study suggests that nitrosoarenes and alkyl radicals are involved as intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This new CN coupling method provides general and step-economical access to aryl amines.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Amines are among the most important organic compounds for the chemical, materials, pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, aromatic and heteroaromatic amines occupy a privileged position in the medicinal chemistry3,4, as exemplified in the top-selling drugs such as Abilify, Crestor, Gleevec and Lidoderm5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most general methods to prepare aryl and heteroaryl amines are amine-carbonyl reductive amination6 (Fig 1a), direct alkylation of amines with alkyl halides7 (Fig 1b), and BuchwaldHartwig8,9,10 and Ullman-type carbonnitrogen (CN) cross-coupling reactions11,12 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These amination methods employ amines, especially anilines, as the nitrogen source, which are usually prepared in advance by the hydrogenation of nitroarene derivatives13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amine synthesis using directly nitro(hetero)arenes is attractive as it eliminates the hydrogenation step, saving time and cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, functional groups such as amine, hydroxyl and thiol have orthogonal reactivity to the nitro group, so they may be tolerated without protection14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, in amine synthesis using anilines, these groups have to be protected to avoid undesirable alkylation or arylation14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Baran and co-workers14 developed a novel and elegant hydroamination approach to synthesize (hetero)aryl amines from nitro(hetero)arenes and olefins using an iron salt as catalyst, phenylsilane as hydrogen donor, and zinc (Zn) as reductant (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, this approach was mostly efficient for the synthesis of (hetero)aryl amines substituted by a tertiary alkyl group15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  General methods for amine synthesis from nitroarenes remain underdeveloped despite their potential advantages14,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Different approaches to (hetero)aryl amines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Reductive amination; (b) N-Alkylation of amine; (c) BuchwaldHartwig and Ullmann-type coupling; (d) Barans hydroamination with nitro(hetero)arenes; (e) Current work using reductive coupling of nitro(hetero)arenes with alkyl halides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fe(acac)3, iron(III) acetylacetonate; PhSiH3,phenylsilane; Zn, zinc; TMSCl, chlorotrimethylsilane.Full size image', 'Here, we report (hetero)aryl amine synthesis via iron-catalysed reductive coupling of nitro(hetero)arenes with alkyl halides (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This single-step cross-coupling approach allows the liaison to various types of carbon groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, not only tertiary alkyl halides, but also secondary and primary alkyl halides could be coupled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method tolerates a large number of functional groups, including those that require protection under conventional amine synthesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Fig 2a), which is then able to activate an alkyl halide to give an alkyl radical and regenerate Fe(II) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18; Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, nitroarene is reduced by zinc to form nitrosoarene21,22 (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alkyl radical attacks the nitrogen atom of nitrosoarene to form the CN bond14, and reduction of the resulting intermediate by zinc in the presence of an oxophilic Lewis acid such as chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCl) shall give the amine product (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Mechanistic design for Fe-catalysed reductive coupling of nitroarene with alkyl halide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Reduction of iron(II) to iron(I);

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The present method allows the synthesis of alkyl aryl amines from functionalized nitroarenes, which are often cheaper than functionalized anilines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, anilines are generally synthesized by reduction of nitroarenes, so amination using directly nitroarenes is more step-economical than using anilines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, anilines containing easily reducible groups such as alkenes, ketones, and so on would be difficult to obtain by reduction, while the corresponding nitroarenes are readily available and suitable substrates for the current amination (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these points of view only, the current method can be already considered as a valuable alternative to the conventional amination methods such as direct alkylation and reductive amination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the data in Figs 3, 4 and 6, and Supplementary Figs 14 also demonstrate potential advantages of the current method in terms of scope, group tolerance, and yield in certain reactions: (i) Our method is applicable for the synthesis of aryl amines substituted with a tertiary alkyl group, of which direct alkylation and reductive amination are incapable (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) Direct alkylation using a secondary alkyl halide often has a lower yield than the current method (Fig 6a,b; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) Direct alkylation using a primary alkyl halide is intolerant to a functional group prone to SN2 substitution, which is not a problem for the current method as it involves radical alkylation (Fig 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) Reductive amination cannot tolerate a keto group or a leaving group prone to SN2 substitution by aniline, while the current method tolerates well these groups (Fig 6e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All in all, our results prove that, despite its early stage of development, the present method exhibits certain potential advantages over the well-established amination methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The preliminary mechanistic study rules out direct alkylation of in situ formed anilines as a major reaction pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data suggest that alkyl radicals and nitrosoarenes are viable intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed mechanism starts with the reduction of Fe(II) catalyst by Zn to form Fe(I), which activates an alkyl halide to give an alkyl radical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, Zn reduces nitroarenes to give nitrosoarenes, which is attacked by the alkyl radical to form the CN bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting species is then further reduced by Zn and deoxygenated by TMSCl to give the secondary alkyl aryl amine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this mechanism, when nitroalkanes were used as substrates, the conversion was full but no amination product was isolated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that the nitrosoalkane intermediates are less stable than their aryl counterparts and undergo isomerization to give oximes38,39,40, which rapidly dissociate into aldehydes/ketones and hydroxylamine without further reacting with alkyl radical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is analogous with the mechanism proposed for the reductive coupling of nitroarenes14,15,16,17 and nitrite salts41 with alkenes, which also involves nitroso intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, the Fe-catalysed reductive coupling methods presented here represented a general approach to synthesize various (hetero)aryl amines from nitro(hetero)arenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to couple primary, secondary and tertiary alkyl halides and the high functional group tolerance of the method shall attract applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistic study suggests that the addition of an alkyl radical to nitrosoarene is the main reaction pathway.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
