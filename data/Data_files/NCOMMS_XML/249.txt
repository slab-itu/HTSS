Rapid expulsion of microswimmers by a vortical flow  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Interactions of microswimmers with their fluid environment are exceptionally complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macroscopic shear flow alters swimming trajectories in a highly nontrivial way and results in dramatic reduction of viscosity and heterogeneous bacterial distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on experimental and theoretical studies of rapid expulsion of microswimmers, such as motile bacteria, by a vortical flow created by a rotating microparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a formation of a macroscopic depletion area in a high-shear region, in the vicinity of a microparticle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rapid migration of bacteria from the shear-rich area is caused by a vortical structure of the flow rather than intrinsic random fluctuations of bacteria orientations, in stark contrast to planar shear flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our mathematical model reveals that expulsion is a combined effect of motility and alignment by a vortical flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings offer a novel approach for manipulation of motile microorganisms and shed light on bacteriaflow interactions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Interactions of bacteria with fluid and solid surfaces are exceptionally complex and are the topic of active research1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to a variety of chemical and physical factors, swimming trajectories are also affected by macroscopic shear flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Migration of microorganisms in fluid or over surfaces is determined by a multitude of various physical and biological processes, such as chemotaxis10,11, thermotaxis12, quorum sensing13, gyrotaxis14,15 and rheotaxis6,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, undergo a biased random walk consisting of smooth swimming segments and tumbles (abrupt changes of the swimming direction)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That behaviour enables them to move up to a chemoattractant or in the direction of the temperature gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A drift of bacteria can also be a result of a combination of different mechanisms, such as chemotaxis and rheotaxis11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to chemotaxis and thermotaxis, which are fairly well characterized both biochemically and mathematically10,18, gyrotaxis14,15 and rheotaxis5,6,16 of microorganisms are purely physical phenomena: no chemical/temperature stimuli or active receptor response are engaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the course of gyrotaxis, a preferred orientation of a bottom-heavy cell is determined by a balance between the viscous torque exerted by a fluid and the gravitational torque caused by the asymmetric mass distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial rheotaxis occurs due to a combination of two effects: reorientation of elongated bacterial bodies by shear flow and self-propulsion due to flagella rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism does not require any active sensing in contrast with fish rheotaxis19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microfluidic experimental and theoretical studies of sheared suspensions of swimming bacteria5,6,20 demonstrated that a planar shear flow triggers a bacterial drift and alters their spatial distribution function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, the distribution function of bacteria in a microfluidic channel has a minimum along the channel center line corresponding to zero local shear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed microswimmer transport in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 also required significant intrinsic stochasticity of bacterial orientations characterized by the rotational diffusion coefficient Dr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the spatial distribution function remains homogeneous if the rotational diffusion Dr is set to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stochasticity of bacterial orientations is also needed for the explanation of viscosity reduction in suspensions of microswimmers in a planar shear flow21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is somewhat counterintuitive, because a non-tumbling strain of B. subtilis was used in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scattering and trapping of deformable microswimmers in a swirling flow was investigated numerically in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerical studies of bacteria dynamics in non-planar flow represented by a periodic array of vortices demonstrated an accumulation of swimmers near separatrices dividing the vortices25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The local flow environment of motile bacteria is not generally represented by a planar shear flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical turbulent flow is manifested by recurring vortices and non-zero curvature of the flow lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in experiments23,26, the shear flow created by a rotating particle, is characterized by a vortical motion and closed streamlines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that the vortical structure of the flow, and, correspondingly, curvature of the streamlines has a highly nontrivial effect not present in a planar shear flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the spatial distribution of bacteria in a vortical flow created by a rotating particle is strongly heterogeneous with an almost complete concentration depletion in the vicinity of the rotational center r=0, that is, a shear-rich area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of macroscopic depletion region occurs surprisingly fast, with the time scale determined by the bacterial swimming speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our mathematical model reveals that, in stark contrast to a planar shear, no rotational noise is needed for the onset of depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculate the distribution functions for position and orientation of bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our theoretical findings match well with the experimental data.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Formation of a depletion zone', 'In our experiment, a pendent drop of bacterial suspension (10 l) is attached to a microscope glass slide, see Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A nickel particle of radius R30 m is placed in the center of the drop, and the gravity force keeps the particle around the nadir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two pairs of orthogonal Helmholtz coils create a uniform rotating magnetic field forcing the particle to spin with the field frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the magnetic field is turned off, then bacteria are swimming randomly in the vicinity of the particle and their spatial and angular distributions are homogeneous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a rotating magnetic field with frequency 240 Hz is applied, the spinning particle creates a macroscopic vortex with a diameter of a few hundred microns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This vortex advects bacteria along streamlines and aligns their bodies parallel to the local flow direction (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rarely bacteria flip their orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the spatial distribution (during first few seconds) is almost uniform, the orientational distribution acquires two sharp peaks near relative angle  and , see Fig 1a for the definition of relative angle .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within a few seconds the concentration of motile bacteria in the vicinity of the particle starts to decrease resulting in a formation of a macroscopic depletion zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depletion zone expands over a few minutes (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trajectories of bacteria are represented by unwinding spirals with a slowly changing curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the shear flow created by a spherical particle is decaying roughly as 1/r2 with the distance r from the origin, see Supplementary Fig 1, at a certain distance the rotational diffusion of bacteria overcomes the shear-induced alignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That limits the depletion zone diameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For not too high concentrations, most of the bacteria are confined to a thin layer near the surface of the drop due to hydrodynamic attraction/steric collision27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confinement allows an effective two-dimensional approximation for the interaction between bacteria and flow created by the rotating particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Formation of a depletion zone.Distribution of bacteria in the vicinity of the rotating particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacteria imaged approximately 05 m above the surface of the sessile drop.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We characterize the configuration of bacteria by a single-particle distribution function  of the bacterial position (r, ) and the bacterial orientation .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here r,  are polar coordinates with the origin at the center of rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interactions between bacteria do not alter the underlying mechanism of a depletion zone formation: we observed similar effects with a wide range of bacterial concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low concentrations of bacteria, bacterial bodies are not overlapping, and each bacterium in the microscope field of view can be tracked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a custom script (based on MATLAB toolboxes), we measured positions, orientations and velocities of bacteria at every moment in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detection of bacterial orientation  poses a uncertainty ± due to visual degeneracy between a tail and a head of a bacterium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this limitation we developed a dedicated tracking algorithm, see Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The results are summarized in Figs 2e,f and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientational distribution function P(r, ) has two distinct peaks in the vicinity of /2 and 3/2,  is a relative angle (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the bacterial motility, the distribution is not symmetrical and locations of the peaks shift towards bigger values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect has a simple explanation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For non-motile elongated particles and in the absence of noise, the shear-induced reorientation results in two peaks at  and , that is, they tend to align parallel to streamlines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a planar shear flow and in the absence of rotational noise, motile bacteria maintain their average positions with respect to flow transverse direction31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to curvature of the streamlines in a vortex flow, motile bacteria swim into regions with different flow orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, self-propulsion results in misalignment and a systematic migration across circular streamlines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a drift mechanism does not require a non-zero rotational diffusion of bacteria crucial in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, since the migration of bacteria is controlled by the rotation rate of the particle and the bacterial swimming speed, the expulsion effect is observed in the absence of diffusion (or angular noise).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characteristic drift speed and the fraction of bacteria expelled from the center of rotation (practically complete depletion) can significantly exceed the corresponding values observed in a planar flow (about 70% in the middle of the channel5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Comparison of results for orientation distributions and concentration evolution.Orientational distributions of bacteria at various distances r from the center of rotation obtained from simulations (a) and experiments (b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotation frequency of the particle is 20 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Relaxation of bacterial concentration at different distances from the rotating particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines with symbols represent the experimental data and lines without symbols are simulation results for V0=25 m s1, R=30 m, Dr=0.1 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotation frequency is 10 Hz.Full size image', 'To quantify the observed effects, we developed a kinetic model of swimming bacteria in a vortical flow of viscous incompressible fluid created by a solid rotating particle of radius R.

t45 s in Fig 3c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This temporal increase is caused by a migration of motile bacteria from smaller radii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time scales of presented functions also depend on the distance from the rotation origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of the propagating concentration peaks was also seen in the solution of the FokkerPlanck equation (9), see Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concentration decreases faster at small radii.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall good agreement with theoretical result is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute the differences between experimental data and simulation results to several factors, mostly to a three-dimensional structure of the flow created by the rotating spherical particle and a noise created by imperfections in the particle shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results elucidate the subtle role of fluctuations in the experiments with effective viscosity of active suspensions23,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, the observed sevenfold viscosity reduction cannot be easily explained by the intrinsic stochasticity in bacterial orientations for a planar shear flow, provided that non-tumbling strains of bacteria was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect can be illustrated as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effective viscosity eff is defined as a ratio of a shear stress component sh to the corresponding rate of strain component .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of two-dimensional rotational flow with the azimuthal velocity , the rate of strain is , and the effective viscosity is of the form .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cylindrical coordinate system (see Fig 1a), the corresponding component of the shear stress tensor  associated with the motility of bacteria (so-called active stress, normalized by solvent viscosity ) can be written as (see Supplementary Note 3)', '', 'where a0 is proportional to the strength of the hydrodynamic dipole (stresslet) imposed by bacteria on the fluid and increases with the increase in swimming speed V0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For bacteria (that is, pushers) the sign of a0 is negative, a0 less_than 0 (refs 21, 22, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of bacteria orientation fluctuations (for example, tumbling), the steady-state probability distribution function  is reduced to a -function, , where  is the stable fixed point given by equation (6) and n is the local bacterial concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, substituting this expression for  into equation (8), we readily obtain .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the active stress contribution is positive, while the strain rate is negative, we obtain the overall reduction of the effective viscosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For very small strain rates, , the effective viscosity eff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this limit is singular, and an infinitesimally small rotational diffusion Dr will regularize the divergence21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the case of a flow created by a rotating particle, such as was used in refs 23, 26, vortical structure of the flow results in strong asymmetry of the orientation distribution function, even in the absence of tumbling, and, in turn, a noticeable viscosity reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the effective viscosity reduction for the conditions of the experiment23, that is, concentration n1010 cm3 (that is, slightly below the threshold for the onset of collective behaviour when interactions between the bacteria still can be neglected), and the rotation rate 0.5 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An estimate for the dipolar moment strength can be found in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtain that relative reduction of the effective viscosity due to this effect is of the order of 2030%, see Supplementary Note 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are below what was observed experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further reduction of the effective viscosity is likely due to additive effects of fluctuations and hydrodynamic interactions between the bacteria21,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Let us briefly discuss a connection between two seemingly different phenomena: reduction of the effective viscosity and depletion of bacterial concentration in active suspensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While both phenomena occur in the same system, they are manifested at different experimental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction of the viscosity is observed at low shear rates (since for very high shear rates the passive contribution to the stress tensor dominates over active stress active), while the depletion occurs at much higher shear rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the origin of both phenomena is similar and is associated with a non-isotropic orientation distribution of bacteria in a vortical flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formally, no rotation diffusion is needed for the onset of depletion and viscosity reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, angular diffusion plays a significant role at low shear rates, making corresponding angular distribution functions relatively wide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For that reason, directed migration of bacteria and formation of a depletion zone was suppressed in experiments23,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we demonstrated, both experimentally and theoretically, that a rapidly rotating microparticle expels microswimmers in its vicinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to planar shear flow5, the expulsion does not require stochasticity in microswimmer orientation and occurs on a much faster time scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results shed new light on the bacterial dynamics in vortical flows, which are ubiquitous in bacterial habitats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, elucidation of the physical mechanisms governing response of microswimmers on shear and the role of intrinsic fluctuations may lead to better understanding of active materials behaviour9,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings can be used to prevent biofilm formation/biofouling in microfluidic devices.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
