Haploinsufficiency networks identify targetable patterns of allelic deficiency in low mutation ovarian cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Identification of specific oncogenic gene changes has enabled the modern generation of targeted cancer therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In high-grade serous ovarian cancer (OV), the bulk of genetic changes is not somatic point mutations, but rather somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The impact of SCNAs on tumour biology remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we build haploinsufficiency network analyses to identify which SCNA patterns are most disruptive in OV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of all KEGG pathways (N=187), autophagy is the most significantly disrupted by coincident gene deletions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with 20 other cancer types, OV is most severely disrupted in autophagy and in compensatory proteostasis pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Network analysis prioritizes MAP1LC3B (LC3) and BECN1 as most impactful.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of LC3 and BECN1 expression confers sensitivity to cells undergoing autophagic stress independent of platinum resistance status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results support the use of pathway network tools to evaluate how the copy-number landscape of a tumour may guide therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Characterization of specific cancer mutations has yielded a map of which oncogenes and tumour suppressors that may be chemically or biologically targetable1,2 and guided immunotherapy3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, single-nucleotide variants and short insertiondeletion mutations (here referred to simply as mutations) are not the sole drivers of oncogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-grade serous ovarian cancer (OV) is uniquely low in mutation and high in somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SCNAs drive cancer through losses of tumour suppressors or amplifications of oncogenes, often by large SCNAs encompassing hundreds of genes4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Homozygous deletion occurs rarely (12% of SCNAs) due co-deletion of essential genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On a gene-to-gene basis, SCNAs are more common than mutations even in highly mutated cancer types and 95% of SCNAs observed in tumours are monoallelic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with 16,000 genes with SCNAs in the average OV tumour (Fig 1d), statistical modelling of driver SCNAs is complicated by pervasive background SCNAs, which may not drive tumour progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous analyses of SCNAs via chromosome arm alterations identified correlated pairs5,6, but lack a consideration of collaborative monoallelic SCNAs altering entire molecular pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathway analysis can improve an understanding of which molecular processes are altered when multiple genes contribute to cellular function, since different gene deletion combinations can yield identical phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Prevalence of gene-level alterations in cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The average percentage of genes with either somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) or somatic point and small indel mutations for TCGA studied cancers (N=9,740 tumors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The number of significantly mutated cancer genes8 other than TP53 that are mutant in OV is plotted as a percentage of primary tumours from TCGA studied patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly half have no oncogenic mutation other than TP53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Ratio of SCNAs to mutations relative to total percentage of genes changed across cancer types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) The percent of genes altered by either SCNA (allele numbers 0, 1, 3 or 4+) or by mutation is plotted for each TCGA OV tumour (N=579 for SCNAs, N=316 for mutations).Full size image', 'We developed a new tool to analyse highly variable SCNA tumours to determine significantly altered pathways and the gene-level SCNAs, which most likely contribute to pathway disruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tool is designed to incorporate known pathway concepts of genetic bottlenecking7, and is found to correctly prioritize known tumour suppressors and oncogenes as impactful genes in OV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By this analysis, the most suppressed pathway in OV is autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many other proteostasis pathways, such as the proteasome, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the lysosome are suppressed in OV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In validation of these computational findings, treatment of multiple OV in vivo models by autophagy- and proteostasis-disrupting drugs abolishes tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of BECN1 and LC3B sensitizes OV to the autophagy halting drug chloroquine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results implicate autophagy as a major disrupted pathway in OV, which is also amenable to therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Half of ovarian tumours lack clear driver mutations', 'OV tumours have been characterized8 as being uniquely low in mutations and high in SCNAs (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is possible that despite relatively low mutation rates, each OV tumour nonetheless contains multiple tumour suppressor or oncogene mutations that drive cancer formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this possibility, we analysed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) OV data for mutations in well-known tumour-driver genes8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, 48% of studied tumours have no mutations in these oncogenes or tumour suppressors, other than TP53 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since mutant p53 alone is insufficient for tumour formation9,10, these tumours likely contain SCNA drivers5 which aid in tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the high ratio of SCNAs to mutations in OV (Fig 1c,d), we sought a new method to better understand potential SCNA drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Design of the HAPTRIG SCNA analysis tool', 'We developed a computational tool to identify pathways significantly disrupted by SCNAs in the highly noisy genetic background of OV tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The program was designed to analyse diverse genetic backgrounds which all yield at least one similar phenotype (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many biological pathways have multiple bottleneck7 or regulatory points11, any of which can equivalently affect pathway phenotype12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) also looks at multiple genes within a pathway to determine statistical significance at the cohort level13, we designed our tool to incorporate two additional pieces of information to better characterize genetic disturbance of pathway biology: proteinprotein interactions (to prioritize genes that modulate other genes within the same pathway) and haploinsufficiency data (to prioritize genes that are known to affect biology when only a single gene copy is altered).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Design of HAPTRIG and OV pan-pathway analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of the rationale behind designing HAPTRIG network analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotypes with similar phenotypes can be spread across many genes and each tumour may alter the phenotype using different genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haploinsufficient genes are more likely to drive phenotype changes, as are highly interactive genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Different versions of HAPTRIG were coded and executed to test which inputs prioritized genes with known tumour suppressor or oncogenic function, as annotated in COSMIC, and for ability to prioritize STOP and GO genes as expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HAPTRIG was most effective across all KEGG pathways when considering proteinprotein interactions within pathway genes only and when mouse and/or yeast orthologue haploinsufficiency data were included.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including genes that interacted with pathway genes (1° interactors) reduced efficiency as did including genes with an additional interaction distance from pathway genes (2° interactors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) HAPTRIG network analyses were created for all distinct, human KEGG pathways (N=187 pathways) and significantly disrupted pathways are plotted by significance compared with a minimally altered SCNA cancer type, thyroid cancer (THCA; in grey overlay).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top-disrupted pathways are noted in comparison with known canonical OV-disrupted pathways, focal adhesion and p53 signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed information on these pathways is in Supplementary Data 1, and secondary OV data sets can be found in Supplementary Data 2 and 3.Full size image', 'This Haploinsufficient/Triplosensitive Gene (HAPTRIG) tool generates network scores by (1) building proteinprotein interaction networks of pathway proteins from BioGRID14, (2) prioritizing interactions that contain a haploinsufficient or triplosensitive gene, (3) negatively scoring interactions containing gene deletion SCNAs and positively scoring interactions containing gene amplification SCNAs, and (4) summing all interaction scores within a molecular pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For statistical significance, pathway scores from observed tumours were compared with control data of 1000 tumour-paired randomly permutated SCNAs to derive a P value of observed tumour pathway changes compared with what would be expected by chance (for a schematic, see Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This design enables statistically significant pathway changes in a cohort of tumours to be detected in a high noise background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the HAPTRIG pipeline scores the contribution of each gene within a pathway to allow for ranking the biological importance of each gene within a pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, since TP53 is highly interactive and often deleted, it is ranked by the HAPTRIG tool as the most impactful deletion within the p53 pathway for most OV tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test the robustness of the HAPTRIG approach, we queried HAPTRIG for its ability to prioritize known tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes15, as most affecting deleted or amplified gene sets, respectively, and similarly tested for STOP and GO gene4 prioritization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the full HAPTRIG approach as a reference, we measured how its sensitivity is affected by the following parameters: (1) removal of haploinsufficient orthologue data from mice and yeast, (2) inclusion of only intrinsic (within gene set only) interactions or primary/secondary interactions as well, and (3) when gene ontology (GO) pathways were used in place of comparable Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways (Fig 2b, Supplementary Fig 2A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All components altered HAPTRIG efficiency in the range of 1060%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we predict many GO pathways to be useful in HAPTRIG analysis, GO pathways are typically much larger and contain many genes with tangential relation to core pathway function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most accurate view of SCNA-altered pathways within OV was thus found by using all distinct, human KEGG pathways (N=187 pathways) scored for intrinsic and haploinsufficient interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HAPTRIG pathway analysis of OV identifies autophagy loss', 'In TCGA OV cohort, we observed the most statistically unlikely disrupted deletion-enriched pathway to be autophagy (followed by FoxO signalling, adipocytokine signalling, arginine/proline metabolism and NOTCH signalling) and the most statistically unlikely disrupted amplification-enriched pathway to be glycerophospholipid metabolism (Fig 2c, all disrupted pathway data in Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Known altered pathways such as p53 and focal adhesion were also significantly altered, albeit at lower significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern persisted in an independent OV cohort16 but did not reach statistical significance in an endometrioid OV cohort, perhaps due to small sample size (Supplementary Fig 2; Supplementary Data 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we focus on KEGG pathways here, HAPTRIG functions on any pathway set (Hallmark pathway set results shown in Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HAPTRIG improves on GSEA to identify these significantly disrupted pathways: only two KEGG pathways reached statistical significance using GSEA (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We release the code for HAPTRIG as Supplementary Software 1, and provide example input data sets as Supplementary Data 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Autophagy has long been implicated in tumour development and may have dual roles: loss of autophagy genes including BECN1 leads to early oncogenesis in mouse models17,18; however, KRAS mutant cancers are addicted to elevated autophagy19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, most proteostasis pathways in our pan-pathway analysis were enriched for deletions, including ER stress, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and the lysosome, although the peroxisome pathway was enriched for amplifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haploinsufficiency in model organism screens is associated with an inability to form adequately proportioned proteinquality control complexes20, suggesting single allele SCNAs disrupt these pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether proteostasis disruption was specific to OV, we ran HAPTRIG analyses across 20 other cancer types studied by TCGA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alterations ranged from minimal among acute myeloid leukaemia and thyroid cancers, a strongly suppressed network of proteostasis genes in invasive breast (BRCA) and serous ovarian (OV) cancers, to a uniquely amplified autophagy network in renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRC; Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many genes were frequently altered in OV, and HAPTRIG ranked known biologically impactful genes (for example, BRCA1, TP53, BECN1 and CASP3) as most altered for OV (Fig 3b, full OV networks in Supplementary Fig 4), as well as some genes uncommonly associated with cancer (for example, CTSD for lysosomal function and PEX5 for peroxisomal function, full summary in Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OV was clearly the most disrupted for proteostasis amongst these 21 tumour types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next evaluated whether these SCNA network alterations contribute to cancer phenotypes as mutations do, and whether they might be predictably targeted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Summary of HAPTRIG proteostasis network scores across 21 cancer types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) HAPTRIG analyses were performed for proteostasis pathways and the p53 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since these pathways are functionally interdependent, HAPTRIG scored both intrinsic and primary interactions from within these different pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chart displays pathway network scores as blue fill if deletion-enriched, red fill if gain-enriched, and white fill for neither.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significance is represented as overlaid circles of size proportional to the log10 q value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) OV HAPTRIG networks were visually graphed by Cytoscape, with gene node and edge proteinprotein interaction size proportional to the penetrance of the gene changes within the cancer type (left panel) or by HAPTRIG predicted gene-impact scores (right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A red fill is assigned if the majority of copy-number changes are positive, and blue if they are negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Node outlines are highlighted in cyan if haploinsufficiency annotations are

90% of the time, even in a single unstressed experimental condition21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In OV, protein expression correlated with mRNA expression for 8090% of genes22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autophagy depends on mRNA induction for full function23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCGA OV tumours exhibit decreased mRNA expression of core autophagy genes upon heterozygous loss and often contain several core autophagy gene deletions (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such pervasive deletions in protein and organelle quality control genes may sensitize OV to proteotoxic, autophagy-stressing drugs24; redundant losses may underlie the severely compromised capacity of these tumours to compensate for proteotoxic treatment combinations (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate this possibility, we treated OVCAR3 cells with chloroquine, to prevent autophagy resolution25, and nelfinavir, to promote ER stress26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein aggregates increased by 36-fold (Supplementary Fig 7), concurrent with the accumulation of autophagolysosomes (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotype was further amplified when chloroquine/nelfinavir was combined with rapamycin and/or dasatinib24, which we term Combination Of Autophagy Selective Therapeutics (COAST; Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proteasomal inhibitors also stress autophagy, and bortezomib exhibited cytotoxicity in the low nanomolar range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, bortezomib was not OV selective and risks high clinical toxicity (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytotoxic concentrations required for the OV tumour cells were low for other proteostasis-targeting agents (Supplementary Figs 10 and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chloroquine and nelfinavir within the concentration range found in patients blood24 was sufficient to prevent single-cell colony formation, cell growth in suspension, and to promote cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig 12) in OV cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher-order combinations (COAST) were selective across six different OV tumour cell lines (Supplementary Fig 11) with autophagy gene deletions (Supplementary Table 3), and no drug or combination reduced the effects of any other drug.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next evaluated whether this HAPTRIG-informed choice of drugs would ameliorate disease in preclinical models of OV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cisplatin and docetaxel did not alter the growth of a patient-derived xenograft model derived from a recurrent chemotherapy-resistant patient (Fig 4a), while the proteostasis-targeted cocktail resulted in a striking complete ablation of tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the lack of any macroscopic disease, we next used an ID8-IP-mCherry labelled tumour model27 to allow detection of persistent microscopic disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, mice treated with COAST showed eradication of tumours, although microscopic nests of cells were still detected in 2/8 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, chloroquine and nelfinavir alone did not result in statistically significant inhibition (Fig 4b), despite having the best efficacy of two drugs in vitro (Supplementary Fig 10), possibly reflecting the complexity of the tumour microenvironment and other forms of heterogeneity in syngeneic models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This five drug cocktail was remarkably well tolerated in mice24, in which we tested up to 8 weeks of COAST therapy, long after all control mice perished (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COAST also arrested tumour growth in a subcutaneous OVCAR3 model (Fig 4c), with residual tumour showing accumulation of autophagosomal Lc3-II and the ER stress marker Grp78 (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: OV tumours are sensitive to disruption of proteostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Low passage

determine gene SCNAs most likely to have an impact on autophagy in OV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These most impactful genes were identified by summing the score contribution of each gene within HAPTRIG networks across all tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We ranked impactful suppressive and oncogenic genes for all pathways in OV (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For autophagy, the two highest impact genes were MAP1LC3B (LC3) and BECN1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two genes were also commonly lost in OV, along with ATG10, ULK2 and GAPARAPL2 (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LC3 and/or BECN1 are monoallelically deleted in 94% of OV (Supplementary Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, this may explain the sensitivity of OV tumours to drugs pressuring the autophagy network, since orthologues of each gene confer haploinsufficiency in yeast20 or mice18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These losses occur early in the evolution of OV28 and have an associated defect in expression when monoallelically lost (Supplementary Fig 5),

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The HAPTRIG tool represents an initial haploinsufficiency network-based analysis program that can be applied genome wide for any cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing of mutations has identified potentially targetable genes in minorities of OV patients34,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the excessive (two-third of the genome) SCNAs present in OV (Fig 1ad), we undertook a strategy to identify pathways that are uniquely and perhaps unexpectedly disrupted by SCNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our permutation strategy enabled identification of significant pathways despite a potentially passenger-filled SCNA landscape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, aside from merely identifying known altered genetics such as suppression of the p53 pathway, enhancement of the focal adhesion pathway and disruption of homologous recombination repair pathways37, our top hits are not currently considered to be canonical OV driver pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, using in vivo and in vitro models, we validated that autophagy was suppressed in OV and moreover that by targeting this suppression by drugs that disrupt proteostasis we achieved remarkable tumour remission independent of platinum resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the strong autophagy phenotypes we found in OV, it is curious why the autophagy pathway has not been emphasized in prior integrative analysis publications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous publications have supported the finding that OV is deficient in DNA repair pathways, dysregulated in cell cycle control and often overexpress MYC and ERBB2 (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HAPTRIG confirms these disruptions in KEGG pathways and in MSigDB (Molecular Signature Database) Hallmark pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, GSEA13 of copy-number data also highly ranks these pathways and autophagy, albeit at a lower rank than HAPTRIG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely because GSEA does not incorporate interaction or haploinsufficiency data, resulting in an altered spectrum of prioritized genes relative to HAPTRIG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second significant reason that autophagy has not received further exposure in the context of OV is that very few pathway sets include autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the many thousands of pathways annotated in MSigDB38, autophagy is only included in KEGG and GO pathways, as assayed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many genes remain to be annotated within pathways39, and improved pathway curation will certainly advance pathway analysis tools such as HAPTRIG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although loss-of-heterozygosity accompanied by mutations is a recognized phenomenon in breast, ovary, and other cancer, 99.8% of gene deletions in OV show no mutation in the opposing allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For autophagy genes, mutations in the remaining allele for tumours with heterozygous deletion were not observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, cumulative gene expression changes from SCNAs contribute to biological phenotypes40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced gene expression is observed much more commonly than no change in controlled heterozygous deletions21, and mRNA correlates with protein expression in 8090% of OV mRNAs22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Losses of proteostasis genes are likely oncogenic; multiple studies implicate BECN1 as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor in mice17,18, possibly related to roles in chromosomal segregation during cell division43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromosome instability in human cancers such as OV and BRCA may be further exacerbated by loss of BRCA1, a functionally independent tumour suppressor neighbouring BECN1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45) on cytoband 17q21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early losses in autophagy genes may contribute to the extreme SCNA heterogeneity of OV, but as we have shown here, also provide opportunity for network-targeted therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The prevalence of such monoallelic changes has been largely unappreciated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cancer types, more genes are affected by single gene-dose changes than by biallelic deletions, doubling or more amplifications, and mutations combined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour selection for specific chromosomal arm losses or duplications follow enrichments for tumour suppressors or oncogenes, respectively4,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, methods to interpret effects and implement action on SCNAs have been underdeveloped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monoallelic SCNAs may sometimes be viewed as a gene-dose equivalent of a passenger mutation, but scoring collaborative and cumulative pathway interactions and alterations and comparing to a permuted control enabled HAPTRIG to sort through this passenger noise and yield significant results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed the HAPTRIG tool to accurately predict targetable individual gene losses for the autophagy pathway in OV, and have further provided quantitative predictions for all disrupted OV pathways (Supplementary Data 1,2,3,4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we have provided a free web-tool (https://delaney.shinyapps.io/HAPTRIG_Single_Module_Beta/) to allow the community to easily perform a HAPTRIG analysis on 21 cancer types with 187 unique KEGG pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We suggest that a roadmap of targetable genetic changes in tumours need not be limited to mutations, and HAPTRIG may therefore reveal additional targetable pathways across cancer types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COAST therapy should be clinically tested in OV, given its strong effects, minimal toxicity24, and genetic rationale.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'HAPTRIG analysis construction', 'HAPTRIG proteostasis networks were built from the KEGG pathways autophagy (hsa04140), Lysosome (hsa04142), endoplasmic reticulum processing (hsa04141), ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (hsa04120), peroxisome (hsa04146) and the p53 (hsa04115) pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The KEGG autophagy pathway was further curated using current knowledge by adding MAP1LC3B, encoding the protein most commonly used to define autophagosomes25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used proteinprotein interactions (PPIs) from the BioGRID curated database14 to connect input pathway genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the pan-pathway analysis and in quality control networks, all human KEGG pathways were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full list of 187 KEGG pathways tested is included in Supplementary Data 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We obtained copy-number data (N=579 tumours for OV) from the UCSC cancer genome Browser46, using copy-number calls from the GISTIC2.0 algorithm47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the 2009 OV data sets16, log2 segmented copy-number data were used, since the array used was not a SNP6 array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were 102 serous tumours and 11 endometrioid tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To incorporate information regarding dose sensitivity of genes into our network scores, orthologous data sets were used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yeast data were extracted (17 August2015) from YeastMine48, with the query Phenotype=Haploinsufficient or Phenotype=Haploproficient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar annotations for 169 murine genes were extracted (9/17/2015) from the Mouse Genome Informatics database or the MouseMine database49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human homologues for mouse and yeast genes were systematically determined using the Homology tool of MouseMine and YeastMine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 486 proteostasis genes studied, 284 were annotated as gene-dose-sensitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All gene annotations can be found in Supplementary Table 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Each edge connecting two gene nodes was scored for negative (loss or deletion) or positive (gain or amplification) copy-number change as follows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given an edge between gene1 (G1) and gene2 (G2), edge scores were calculated as:', 'For either (G1,G2) GISTIC less_than 0 (at least one gene is deleted):', '', 'For both (G1,G2) GISTIC0 (neither gene is deleted):', '', 'Wherein GISTIC scores represent a range of (2, 1, 0, 1, 2) from 2 as a double deletion, 1 as a monoallelic deletion, 0 as no somatic change, 1 as a monoallelic gain and 2 as a gain of two or more alleles, and gene dose sensitivity (GDS) indicates the gene-dose sensitivity information (1 for no information, 2 for yeast information and 3 for mouse information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For Fig 2, the pan-pathway analysis utilized only gene edges within the given pathway (for example, only genes within the autophagy pathway).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Fig 3, wherein interactions between proteostasis pathways were important to consider, edges were also utilized in the analysis if one gene in the edge contained a gene in another proteostasis pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For each pathway within a cancer type, we first calculated for each patient the sum of edge scores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then normalized to the minimum possible haploinsufficient score of that module (a score in which every gene within the module had a monoallelic loss).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further average these normalized scores across all tumours within a TCGA cohort to produce the colourized depiction of average network score suppression (blue) or enhancement (red) in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Each cancer type has a unique distribution of chromosome losses and gains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since a highly copy-number variable cancer may have a higher chance of a random loss or gain of a pathway than a relatively SCNA stable cancer, we compared the distribution of observed HAPTRIG module scores to that of the distribution of HAPTRIG module scores resulting from globally shuffled gene copy-number data from the same cancer cohort (Supplementary Software 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Edge scores were then recreated using the shuffled gene data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two distributions for each cancer type were thus created using identical calculations: an observed HAPTRIG module score distribution corresponding to observed tumour data, and a statistical comparison HAPTRIG module score distribution corresponding to randomized data To increase the confidence in the output P value, our automated HAPTRIG code creates 1,000 control network scores for each tumour and output P values are generated from the average log10(P value) resulting from these 1,000 control network comparisons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HAPTRIG score distributions were compared by Students t-test and multiple hypothesis testing corrected by the Bonferroni method (for 6 pathways and 21 cancer types=126 comparisons in Fig 3, 187 comparisonsall KEGG pathwaysfor Fig 2) to generate a q value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Visual networks were drawn using Cytoscape 3.3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To produce a representative network for the entire OV cohort, the EdgeScores were recomputed at the cohort level using mean GISTIC scores across all tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a node had an SCNA alteration in  greater than 33% of patients, an edge was drawn to its PPI partner (blue: loss, red: gain, purple: antagonistic).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accommodate lower numbers of mutations relative to SCNA events, if a gene reached a mutation rate of above 10%, PPI edges were represented as disrupted by mutations (green edge visualization).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Node size and colour represent their frequency of SCNAs: blue for more common losses, red if for more common gains, and green if mutated in  greater than 10% of patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Node shade represents the prevalence of the most frequent SCNA event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Node outlines are coloured bright cyan if mouse GDS information was incorporated, and light cyan if yeast GDS information was incorporated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grey edges depict associations of genes with their respective KEGG molecular pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For gene-impact prioritization, EdgeScores were summed among all tumours within a cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scores were then summed for each gene within the proteostasis network (the gene could be on either end of the edge).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sum of scores was used to rank those genes which had the lowest values (genes of highest network score impact for losses) as well as rank those genes that had the highest values (genes of highest network score impact for gains).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A summary of the highest and lowest scoring five genes for each KEGG molecular pathway is provided in Supplementary Data 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For quality control, a table of the top 10 ranked genes (as in the gene-impact prioritization) for each of the 187 KEGG pathways was generated and compared with the appropriate COSMIC tumour suppressor/oncogene gene set or STOP/GO gene set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficiency was calculated as the per cent of possible hits that were found to be present in the quality control table.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Code availability', 'Complete HAPTRIG code is available as Supplementary Software 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Demo data for input are
