Killing by Type VI secretion drives genetic phase separation and correlates with increased cooperation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'By nature of their small size, dense growth and frequent need for extracellular metabolism, microbes face persistent public goods dilemmas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic assortment is the only general solution stabilizing cooperation, but all known mechanisms structuring microbial populations depend on the availability of free space, an often unrealistic constraint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a class of self-organization that operates within densely packed bacterial populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through mathematical modelling and experiments with Vibrio cholerae, we show how killing adjacent competitors via the Type VI secretion system (T6SS) precipitates phase separation via the Model A universality class of order-disorder transition mediated by killing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mathematically demonstrate that T6SS-mediated killing should favour the evolution of public goods cooperation, and empirically support this prediction using a phylogenetic comparative analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work illustrates the twin role played by the T6SS, dealing death to local competitors while simultaneously creating conditions potentially favouring the evolution of cooperation with kin.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Microbes are fundamentally social organisms1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They often live in dense, surface-attached communities, and participate in a range of social behaviours mediated through the production and consumption of extracellular proteins and metabolites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paradigmatic examples include the cooperative production of digestive enzymes6, metal chelators7, signalling molecules6 and the structural components of biofilms8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these extracellular compounds are susceptible to social exploitation, in which non-producing cheats gain an evolutionary advantage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If unchecked, this social exploitation can lead to the extinction of cooperative genotypes9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is widely recognized that the spatial segregation of cooperative microbes away from cheats can solve this cooperative dilemma by ensuring that the investment of cooperators goes to other adjacent cooperative individuals1,5,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanisms creating assortment when organisms expand their ranges via growth into free space have recently received much attention13,14,15,16,17,18, where robust patterns of genetic segregation can occur via stochastic bottlenecking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this mechanism cannot generate genetic segregation within dense, well-mixed communities displaying no net growth, despite the clear ecological relevance of such communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One mechanism that has been proposed to potentially generate spatial structure in dense communities is antagonistic interactions among genotypes1,19,20,21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If different genotypes interact antagonistically then wherever a genotype is in the minority they will be killed by competitors at a high rate, resulting in genetically homogenous patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While mechanisms via which individuals can recognize and kill non-kin have been extensively studied, the consequences of such interactions for the spatial structure of communities have not been explored in detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a potent mechanism of bacterial aggression that can deliver effector proteins directly into eukaryotic cells to mediate virulence by cellular disruption, and into adjacent bacteria to mediate competition by killing non-kin while leaving kin with corresponding protective immunity proteins unscathed24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Vibrio cholerae, T6-proficient strains utilize the T6SS to intoxicate T6-deficient eukaryotic predators and diverse proteobacteria, as well as other more closely related V. cholerae isolates that lack identical effector immunity pairs26,27,28,29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T6-mediated segregation occurs during co-culture of T6-proficient V. cholerae with T6-deficient E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Segregation was also predicted to occur between two mutually antagonistic T6-proficient strains33, and recently demonstrated at the single cell level in co-cultures of V. cholerae and Aeromonas hydrophila20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we examine the causes and consequences of neighbour killing via the T6SS on the physical structure of microbial communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a V. cholerae experimental system and mathematical modelling, we show that T6SS-mediated killing causes an initially well-mixed population of mutually antagonistic bacteria to phase separate, forming clonal patches that grow larger through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phase separation belongs to the Model A class of order-disorder transitions, which is described by the Allen-Cahn equation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mathematically demonstrate that the spatial structure generated as a consequence of T6SS-mediated killing can favour the evolution of public-goods cooperation by limiting the potential for unrelated cheats to access secreted products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we bioinformatically show that bacteria with more T6SS systems and effectors dedicate a larger fraction of their genomes to secreted products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is too early to rule out alternative hypotheses, this correlation is consistent with general predictions from social evolutionary theory that spatially structured environments favour the evolution of cooperation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mutual antagonism drives phase separation', 'Our system illustrates the profound effect of T6SS-mediated killing on emergent spatial patterning of a surface attached population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mathematical modelling suggests that an initially well-mixed population of mutual killers should rapidly undergo phase separation due to selfish herd dynamics34, as the cells within genetically uniform groups no longer risk T6SS-mediated death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we observe rapid phase separation in three distinct classes of models, all starting with a randomly seeded population on a two-dimensional lattice (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first developed an individual-based model (IBM; Fig 1b; Supplementary Movie 1) that simulates bacterial growth, the killing of adjacent competitors and reproduction into empty patches through time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IBMs are appealing, in that they offer an intuitive simulation of discretized, interacting individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, IBMs often lack mathematical transparency, limiting generalization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus modelled our system using two distinct, mathematically defined approaches: an ecologically based partial differential equation model in order to gain analytical insight into the dynamics (PDE; Fig 1c; Supplementary Figs 1 and 2, Supplementary Movie 2), and the ecologically-based Ising spin model in order to relate our results to classical modelling of phase separation in statistical mechanics35 (Fig 1d; Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all three modelling frameworks, initially well mixed populations rapidly underwent phase separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, initially-well mixed populations of two Vibrio cholerae strains (C6706 and 69279; Supplementary Table 1) capable of mutual T6SS-mediated killing (Supplementary Fig 3) underwent phase separation (Fig 1f,i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-killing controls (vasK, that is, T6SS; Supplementary Fig 3) and T6SS+ mutual killers cultured at low temperatures which impede T6SS activity36 remained well-mixed (Fig 1e,g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: T6SS-mediated killing drives phase separation in dense bacterial populations.We modelled the dynamics of phase separation in fully occupied, randomly seeded square lattices (a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase separation between red and blue bacteria capable of mutual killing occurred in an individual-based model (scale bar, 50 cells) (b), in a partial differential equation model (c), and in an Ising spin model (scale bar, 50 magnets) (d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No phase separation occurred between red (C6706) and blue (69279) T6SS- mutants of Vibrio cholerae (vasK; e), in contrast to T6SS+ strains (f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We varied the efficacy of T6SS while still allowing for growth by culturing V. cholerae at a range of temperatures: 17 °C (h), 25 °C (i), and 30 °C (j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T6SS controls cultured at 25 °C did not phase separate (g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars denote 100 m in e,f, and 1 mm in gj.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images shown in gj are representative of four replicate competitions.Full size image', 'Spatial analysis', 'To determine whether our models and experiments undergo the same type of order-disorder transition, we quantitatively examined the dynamics of phase separation in each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first computed the Fourier-transformed structure factor, S(q).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characteristic wavenumber of clonal groups is , and the height of the peak is related to how often it occurs in the lattice (that is, the strength of patterning at that length scale).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At early timesteps (Fig 2a, Supplementary Fig 4), or for non-killing controls (Fig 2b), S(q) is relatively flat, as expected for a well-mixed population lacking a characteristic length scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T6SS-mediated killing causes S(q) to increase at smaller values of q (longer length scales) as the population grows increasingly structured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This progression of S(q) is a hallmark of phase separation37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Model A, qm scales as qm1/, while S(qm) scales as  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is ambiguous how to relate simulation time to experimental time; instead, we plot S(qm) versus qm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All models (IBM, PDE and Ising) and experiments fall on the same line (S(qm)1/) (Fig 2c), a relationship consistent with the Model A order-disorder phase separation process39, developed to explain the interaction of atomic spins in systems that lack conservation, and described by the Allen-Cahn equation =, which relates the change in local concentration, , over time to diffusion and the chemical potential,  and stochastic fluctuations (see Methods)40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate this equivalence across wavenumbers, we plot qm2S(q) versus q/qm (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This collapses all data onto one master curve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, due to the universality of non-conserved domain growth, this collapse could have been expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this universality, shown in Fig 2c,d, demonstrates that while initial conditionssuch as the initial number ratio of the two competing strainsmay influence the timing of phase separation, they do not influence how phase separation occurs, or that the characteristic clonal group size always grows as .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular mobility has a surprising effect on phase separation: rather than impeding phase separation, it accelerates it by enhancing killing at the borders of clonal patches (Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Fig 5 and Supplementary Movie 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Structural analysis of models and experiments.The static structure factor S(q), plotted versus wavenumber q multiplied by cell size L for the individual based model (IBM;

Panels correspond to the time-points marked by circles in d.Full size image', 'Our models and experiments demonstrate that T6SS-mediated killing can generate favourable conditions for the evolution of public-goods cooperation1,12,15,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can occur in two ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, T6SS-mediated killing induces positive frequency-dependent selection, allowing cooperators to resist rare cheats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, T6SS-mediated killing precipitates self-organized structuring of microbial communities, reducing the diversity of cheats that can exploit cooperators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the predictions of our models previous experimental work has suggested that, via pleiotropic linkage to quorum sensing communication systems, the T6SS can also act as a policing mechanism protecting against the evolution of quorum sensing cheats46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, this suggests that there are three complementary paths via which T6SS-mediated killing could favour the evolution of cooperation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Association between T6SS and secreted product evolution', 'Does T6SS-mediated killing have a similar effect in the real world, where ephemeral resources, physical disturbance and intense competition may impede these mechanisms?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We approach this question phylogenetically, examining the relationship between the proportion of each genome coding for potentially exploitable secreted proteins and its T6SS complexity, with the rationale that microbes possessing a greater number of T6SSs may face less social exploitation by living in more structured communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All else equal, genotypes that possess a greater number of T6SSs should form more highly structured patches (higher r), phase separating with a greater proportion of competitor genotypes (that is, those with non-complementary effector/immunity proteins).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, we hypothesize that genotypes with more T6SSs should experience less pressure from social cheating imposed by distantly related competitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is, of course, an important caveat to this scenario: while T6SS-based phase separation should effectively exclude competitors, it does not address the de novo evolution of cheating from within the clone (for example, Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a first-order proxy for cooperativity, we measured the proportion of a clones genome dedicated to secreted proteins (henceforth referred to as secretome size).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While many of these secretions may have antagonistic effects on other microbes, they can still be seen as cooperative from the producing cells perspective, as their kin can benefit from the reduced competition that they create47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We constructed a Bayesian phylogenetic mixed model of T6SS-containing Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Fig 4a, Supplementary Fig 6) using 439 genomes from 26 genera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secretome size is positively correlated with both the number of T6SSs (Fig 4b,d, Supplementary Table 2) and T6SS effector proteins (Fig 4c,e, Supplementary Table 2) present, and the model shows an excellent overall fit to the data, explaining 99% of the variance in secretome size (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are also robust in univariate analyses (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) and to the inclusion of genome size as a predictor (Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As our analyses include many closely related strains (for example, many Helicobacter pylori, Fig 4a), most (91%) of the variance in secretome size is explained by the phylogenetic relationships among strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the number of T6 secretion systems and T6SS effectors are important predictors of secretome size, explaining 8% of the total, and 90% of the non-phylogenetic variance in secretome size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: T6SS is associated with investment in other secreted

with the predictions of our mathematical model showing that phase separation should favour the evolution of cooperation (Fig 3), it is not conclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with any broad-scale phylogenetic analysis, alternative mechanisms explaining this correlation cannot be ruled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, some unknown aspect of bacterial ecology may independently select for both investment in T6SS-mediated killing and exoproduct production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By controlling for phylogenetic variation, our analysis should capture some of this ecological variance, through it does not eliminate it entirely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, increases in the presence of dead competitors owing to T6SS-mediated killing can create additional opportunities for horizontal gene transfer49, which could allow for increased acquisition of genes coding for secretions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such an explanation relies on horizontal gene transfer being biased towards genes encoding extracellular secretions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there is evidence that this bias towards secretions is the case for plasmids and other mobile genetic elements50, whether this bias occurs when sampling the genes of dead competitors remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed analysis of the phylogenetic dynamics of T6SS genes and secretions in individual clades may allow the relative contributions of these hypotheses to our observed correlation to be disentangled.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Phase separation is well-known to drive pattern formation in biology51,52, but has mainly been investigated using either Turing activator-inhibitor feedbacks53,54, or positive density-dependent movement, described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation51,55,56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we describe a third general mechanism of self-organized pattern formation: targeted killing of non-kin competitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This drives a Model A phase separation; the kinetics of this coarsening processdescribed by the Allen-Cahn equationonly depend on a few cellular details.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we restrict our analysis in this paper to the T6SS, the role of antagonistic interactions in structuring biological communities it is probably far more general, applying to diffusible compounds that kill adjacent non-kin in both micro-organisms (for example, antibiotics) and macro-organisms (for example, allelopathy in plants58 and animals59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while Model A coarsening is universal, the realization of such dynamics in a densely packed, immobile, athermal system is likely unique to biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Physically, this system bears similarities to active matter18,51,56,57; phase separation has also been observed in these far from equilibrium active systems, wherein constituents expend energy to move.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phase separation in these systems typically occurs due to differences in mobility as a function of density; constituents move slowly through crowded regions, and quickly through low density regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mobility-induced phase separation has been observed (or predicted) in systems as varied as swimming bacteria60, self-propelled colloids61,62, mussels51, granular rods63, active filaments64,65, rotating particles66, among other systems52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current system, activity is derived from reproduction and killing events at high density rather than constituent mobility67, leading to a Model A transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Model A coarsening captures the behaviour of a broad array of phase transitions that lack conservation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This transition was originally developed to model magnetization in ferromagnetic materials via the Ising model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ferromagnetic spins have minimum energy when they align; they do so via Glauber spin flips, leading to a change in the overall magnetization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The physical universality of this transition may be reflected in the strong correlation between secretome and T6SS effectors and apparatuses seen in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microscopic details of the system do not strongly affect coarsening, so long as densely packed cells are equipped with T6SS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In recent years, there has been a growing appreciation that many microbial behaviours requiring extracellular metabolism are susceptible to social exploitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show how simple cell-cell aggression can, as a consequence, create a structured population favourable to cooperation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, many factors contribute to the structure and function of microbial communities1,4,15,16,19,20,21,22,42,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because T6SSs are common (found in 25% of Gram-negative bacteria68), and microbes often live in dense communities, phase-separation driven by contact-mediated killing may have a fundamental role in defining the genetic composition and ecosystem-level functionality of microbial communities worldwide.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
