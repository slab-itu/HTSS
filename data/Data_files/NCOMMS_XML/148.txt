Testing necessary regional frontal contributions to value assessment and fixation-based updating  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Value-based decisions are biased by the time people spend viewing each option: Options fixated longer are chosen more often, even when previously rated as less appealing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bias is thought to reflect value updating as new evidence is accumulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior work has shown that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) carries a fixation-dependent value comparison signal, while other studies implicate dorsomedial PFC in representing the value of alternative options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we test whether these regions are necessary for fixation-related value updating in 33 people with frontal lobe damage and 27 healthy controls performing a simple choice task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that damage to dorsomedial PFC leads to an exaggerated influence of fixations on choice, while damage to ventromedial or lateral PFC has no effect on this bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest a critical role for dorsomedial, and not ventromedial PFC, in mediating the relative influence of current fixations and a priori value on choice.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Traditional theories of economic decision-making argue that a rational actor makes choices guided by a comparison of the utility (or subjective value) of available options, leading to internally consistent choices1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, humans make decisions more flexibly, expressing a variety of biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have shown that visual fixations influence value-based choices: subjects choose options they have looked at longer more often than would be predicted by their a priori value ratings of those options alone3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bias is present even when the duration of fixations is experimentally manipulated7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings argue that decisions do not rely only on a comparison of the pre-determined values of options, but are also influenced by information gathered in the moment through fixations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We know very little about the neural processes underlying this dynamic value updating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, regions within the frontal lobes have been implicated in value-based choice more generally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activity within ventromedial PFC reflects the subjective value of available options9,10,11,12, and predicts choice13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with damage to this region and adjacent orbitofrontal cortex (together termed ventromedial frontal lobe; VMF) are more internally inconsistent when making preference-based choices14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Macaques with medial orbitofrontal cortex lesions fail to update the value of visual cues in selective satiety paradigms17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings have together been taken as evidence that VMF represents and compares options in a common value currency10,12,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dorsomedial frontal (DMF) regions have also been linked to value processing and decision-making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamic value-related signals have been reported within this region in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology studies, and linked to choice, particularly in foraging contexts11,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lesions to this region in humans and macaques lead to impairment in optimal action-value learning21,22, but whether this region is critical for decision-making under more ecologically valid conditions remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Neural representations of value are dynamically modulated as a decision is prepared.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlates of accumulating value information have been found in PFC before choice, suggesting that values are constructed in this region during the decision process23,24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lim et al.28 showed that hemodynamic signals reflecting relative value in PFC were dependent on which option the subject looked at when choosing between foods, arguing that these value computations were influenced by fixations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether these signals are necessary for value updating during decision-making has not been established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we test the causal role of three PFC subregions in this fixation-driven dynamic value updating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with damage to ventromedial (VMF), dorsomedial (DMF) or lateral frontal (LF) lobes, and age-matched healthy control subjects judged how much they wanted a variety of artworks, and then chose between pairs of these artworks while we tracked their eye movements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in prior studies with this paradigm, subjects choices are biased by fixations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DMF damage leads to an exaggerated influence of fixations on choice, whereas VMF- and LF-damaged subjects perform normally in this and most other aspects of the task.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'People with focal lesions involving the frontal lobes (N=33) and healthy older controls (N=27) were recruited from the Cognitive Neuroscience Research Registry at McGill University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

performance, according to standard boundaries29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1 shows an overlap image of lesion tracings manually registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) brain by the same

executive function tests, and the frequency of use of psychoactive medications, was comparable across patient groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DMF group scored lower than the VMF group on a test of

difference of the left and right options, and whether the option was looked at longer (fixation advantage), on individual trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rating differences ranged from 2 to 2 (lower to higher rating for left option), while fixation advantage was divided into five bins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent work has also shown that visual saliency can bias choices, independent of value6,30,31.

effects of these variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To isolate the information-gathering process that was the focus of this study, we calculated a predicted fixation advantage based on the a priori value rating difference and binary saliency variable for each subject, in each trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value was subtracted from subjects actual fixation advantage, leaving residuals reflecting the fixation advantage not predicted by differences in value ratings and saliency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variable was used in all further analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For consistency with the prior

the value rating difference of this option and the alternative, with the magnitude of fixation advantage and saliency included as nuisance variables (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including the interaction

value of the unfixated option, resulting in a bias toward choosing the fixated option.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an exploratory analysis, we fit the model to individual subject data to examine whether the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Several recent studies have found that visual fixations during deliberation can influence value-based decisions3,4,5,6,7,8, an observation that opens a novel window on the dynamic construction of value during choices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we applied this experimental approach to test whether focal PFC damage affects this aspect of value updating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choices of all the groups were influenced by both their a priori value assessment of the options, and by fixations during the choice process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Damage to DMF, and not other PFC regions, was associated with a significant increase in the influence of fixations on choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Existing efforts to relate fixation-driven updating to neural mechanisms have focused on value-related signals in ventromedial PFC28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That account would predict a reduced influence of fixations on choice after VMF damage, which we did not observe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the VMF group was intact in nearly all aspects of this task, a striking finding given the putative central role of this region in current models of value-based decision-making10,12,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work from our group has found that VMF damage disrupts preference transitivity14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding has been taken as evidence that this region is required for consistent comparisons, but could support other models of the role of this region, such as a role in constructing a superordinate hierarchy of option values40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, for the first time, we directly tested the stability of value ratings for individual options, and found that VMF-damaged patients provided consistent ratings over the course of the experiment and made choices that were more consistent with these ratings (in economic terms, more rational) than controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings align with studies in monkeys demonstrating intact preference-based choice after orbitofrontal lesions41, and present a challenge to simple views of ventromedial PFC as universally necessary for assessing and comparing the economic values of options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The intact, even supranormal, behaviour of VMF-damaged patients might reflect differences in the information used to make value ratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with all ecologically valid stimuli, artwork can be assessed on a range of attributes42, presumably integrated to produce a single subjective value estimate that has been a focus of much neuroeconomics work to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging studies suggest a role for VMF in the integration of value information from multiple sources26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, value ratings of the VMF group agreed less with those of controls, suggesting these assessments might be based on different attributes, or different attribute weightings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent work with social stimuli, we found that VMF damage disrupts the integration of attributes: these patients used simpler information to inform their choices than did controls43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, VMF damage may affect the information used by patients to assign value to items, rather than the ability to report or compare those values once assigned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, subjects with VMF damage may simplify the value construction problem as a compensatory strategy44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addressing this possibility fully will require approaches that impose better experimental control over the value construction process that work in this field to date has largely left unconstrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Damage to DMF, and not other PFC regions, was associated with an increase in the influence of fixations on choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An exploratory model-based analysis of this data set suggested that the increased influence of fixations in the DMF group could be accounted for by discounting the value of the unfixated option during the decision process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the results of this post hoc model-based analysis should be considered preliminary, they complement the main GEE analyses that took full advantage of this data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Those primary analyses showed a robust increase in the influence of fixations in the DMF group and decreased sensitivity to the value rating difference of the fixation advantaged and alternative options, as would be predicted by a decrease in the fixation discount rate in the model3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DMF may thus be necessary for maintaining the value of unattended options.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result aligns with findings from foraging tasks where activity within DMF tracked the value of departing from a default option and exploring alternatives19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fMRI data supporting this view have recently been challenged with the alternative hypothesis that this signal reflects choice difficulty or conflict45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predictions of the latter model in terms of lesion effects in this task are not entirely clear, but we note that our prior work has failed to find consistent effects of DMF lesions on behavioural indices of conflict monitoring in a variety of tasks46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, here we found that the performance of DMF patients was sensitive to choice difficulty, as indexed by RT and fixation data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These findings agree with other work placing DMF at a critical juncture linking value comparison and action selection21,22,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Voxel-based analysis in this large PFC-damaged sample revealed that increased fixation bias was driven by damage within the pre-SMA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Damage to the pre-SMA/SMA has been associated with failure of goal-directed control over externally triggered responses48,49, and can cause utilization behaviour, a clinical phenomenon in which behaviour is excessively influenced by environmental cues (see Iaccarino et al.50 for a recent review).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased fixation bias associated with pre-SMA damage in the current study could be interpreted as exaggerated environmental control over decision-making, arguing for a specific role of pre-SMA in mediating the influence of attention during the choice process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Human lesion studies have intrinsic limitations that should be kept in mind in interpreting these results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sample size is limited by practical considerations, particularly when the behaviour is measured in detail, as here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The power to detect effects also varies with the extent of lesion overlap and the covariance of damage within individual lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the sample studied here is relatively large by the standards of such work, and the expected effect size in lesion studies is moderate-to-large, power remains a perennial concern in interpreting both the null and positive findings51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overlap map (Fig 6a) is a guide to those PFC regions we are best placed to test in this sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that these lesions also affect the underlying white matter to varying degree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although consistent effects of white matter damage should be revealed in the voxel-based analysis, it is difficult to fully distinguish effects of cortical damage from effects on underlying fibers of passage with potential impact on brain function at a distance from the site of injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings thus need to be considered in the context of evidence from multiple techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we note that the design of the experiment required that initial ratings meet certain criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two VMF subjects and one healthy control were excluded from the experiment for failing to meet these criteria, biasing the VMF sample towards those able to make value ratings along the specified range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These findings provide convergent support for some, but not all, elements of current neurobiological models of the influence of attention on value-based choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We clearly show that intact VMF is not required for fixation-based value updating, challenging a simple view of VMF as a general, dynamic value-meter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, DMF makes a necessary contribution to this process, allowing information about the value of the currently unattended option to influence choice.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

influence of these variables on choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimal model was selected on the basis of the minimum QIC, which balances fit of the model (based on the maximum-likelihood function) with number of parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Table 1 provides the QIC statistics for each model and the associated Akaike weights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These weights indicate the relative likelihood of each model based on the QIC statistics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A single odds ratio and 95% CI was computed for each variable, as well as each interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To compare ratings of value and brightness for artworks between the control group and patient groups, we computed the average rating for each artwork in the initial rating task within each group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used nonparametric Spearman correlations to test whether the average brightness and value ratings for artworks given by the patient groups followed a similar pattern to the average ratings given by controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Code availability', 'Computer code used in the analysis of data presented here is available upon request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
