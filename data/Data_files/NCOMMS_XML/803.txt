IFI16 is required for DNA sensing in human macrophages by promoting production and function of cGAMP  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Innate immune activation by macrophages is an essential part of host defence against infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cytosolic recognition of microbial DNA in macrophages leads to induction of interferons and cytokines through activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other host factors, including interferon-gamma inducible factor 16 (IFI16), have been proposed to contribute to immune activation by DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, their relation to the cGAS-STING pathway is not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that IFI16 functions in the cGAS-STING pathway on two distinct levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of IFI16 in macrophages impairs cGAMP production on DNA stimulation, whereas overexpression of IFI16 amplifies the function of cGAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, IFI16 is vital for the downstream signalling stimulated by cGAMP, facilitating recruitment and activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 in STING complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our results suggest that IFI16 is essential for efficient sensing and signalling upon DNA challenge in macrophages to promote interferons and antiviral responses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Innate immune activation by cytosolic DNA from microbial pathogens is a potent trigger of type I interferon (IFN) and pro-inflammatory cytokines1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interferon activation has been extensively studied both in terms of the proteins binding cytosolic DNA and those needed for subsequent downstream signalling and immune activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although many candidate sensors of cytosolic DNA have been suggested2, two proteins have been demonstrated by separate laboratories to play a role in DNA-driven type 1 interferon responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins are cyclic GMP-AMP synthetase (cGAS) and interferon gamma-inducible factor 16 (IFI16) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFI16, a cytosolic and nuclear protein, is associated with induction of IFN- and IFN- on stimulation with single-stranded and double-stranded DNA4,5,6 and by infection with different herpesviruses7,8,9, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)5 and bacterial infections such as Listeria and Francisella10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cytosolic protein cGAS is important for sensing all forms of structured DNA, and is a pivotal sensor of microbial DNA12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cGAS has the enzymatic capacity to produce the second messenger cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)13,16,17,18, which docks onto the endoplasmic reticulum-bound protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction induces conformational changes that allow STING to homodimerize, migrate from the ER (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19), and recruit TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How TBK1 is actively recruited to STING is currently unknown, but the absence of TBK1 binding to STING results in impaired immune activation21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report demonstrated that TBK1 binding to STING initiates a complex cascade of events including phosphorylation of STING as well as recruitment and activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of phosphorylation of STING at Ser366 abolishes downstream signalling and immune activation, demonstrating the importance of precise and direct activation of STING.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Studies of cGAS-deficient mice show a clear phenotype in innate immune responses13,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mice do not have a direct ortholog to human IFI16, data from IFI16-deficient mouse models are not available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many p200 family members have been suggested to have functions partly overlapping with human IFI16 (refs 24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to the lack of a definitive murine IFI16 ortholog, mouse models are not suitable to resolve the potential interconnection between cGAS and IFI16 in the innate immune response to foreign DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast to the well-described mechanism of action of cGAS in DNA sensing, there is limited knowledge regarding the interaction of IFI16 and STING-dependent signalling and also whether IFI16 is redundant to the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous findings have shown that the affinity of cGAS for DNA varies between relatively weak (Kd in the 20 M range)26,27 to strong (80 nM)28 and that specific sizes or structures of the dsDNA are required for cGAS to engage binding29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, cGAS binding to ssDNA is ineffective28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it seems plausible that cGAS responds efficiently to cytosolic DNA with help from one or more co-factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As IFI16 can bind strongly to single and double-stranded DNA through its HIN domains and modulate protein-protein interactions via its PYRIN domain5,31,32, here we explored the mechanism by which IFI16 promotes DNA-driven STING-dependent signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We present two functions of human IFI16 in the cGAS-STING pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using human phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treated THP1 cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) depleted of IFI16, we find that early interferon expression in the response to viral infections or DNA transfection requires IFI16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, in IFI16-deficient cells stimulated with DNA, the level of STING dimerization, phosphorylation and downstream signaling is compromized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, IFI16 is necessary for efficient cGAMP production through cGAS in response to DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, IFI16 actively recruits TBK1 to the cGAMP-stimulated STING complex and thus promotes phosphorylation of STING.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our results suggest that IFI16 regulates STING activation and is an integrated part of the DNA sensing pathway in human macrophages.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'IFI16 controls innate immune responses to viral infections', 'Recent reports have demonstrated that HIV reverse transcription intermediates (RTIs) can be detected by cGAS and initiate the canonical STING-interferon pathway in myeloid dendritic cells treated with the viral SAMHD1 antagonist Vpx (refs 12, 30, 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In macrophages, SAMHD1 may regulate both the pool of dNTPs, as well as direct degradation of HIV RNA35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, degradation of SAMHD1 by Vpx enables higher production of HIV RTIs in the cytosol and thus more PAMPs for potential sensing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore sought to determine whether IFI16 is involved in innate immune activation in primary human MDMs infected with replication competent HIV in combination with lentiviral particles packed with Vpx proteins (hereafter HIV+vpx).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using RNAi depletion of IFI16 in MDMs from four different donors, we achieved variable knockdown efficiencies ranging from 15 to 85% (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most efficient knockdown was achieved in the two donors showing the highest basal levels of IFI16 expression (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the basal level of IFI16 correlated with induction of ISG54 following infection with HIV+vpx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Donors 1 and 2 demonstrated robust ISG54 induction in scrambled siRNA-treated MDMs (Fig 1b; range 150300 fold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, donors 3 and 4 presented a modest increase in ISG54 expression (Fig 1b: range 23 fold increase) when infected with HIV+vpx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vpx alone had no significant effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar observations were made for IFN- expression (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, here we only detected a signal above background for donors 1 and 2, in which case infection with HIV+vpx demonstrated clear IFN- induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the poor response to HIV infection observed for donor 3 was not because of reduced basal expression of cGAS or STING (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, MDMs treated with IFI16-specific siRNAs did not show an induction of ISG54 and IFN- expression after HIV infection (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that these results were not due to unspecific effects of the siRNA treatment, another IFI16 siRNA pool was applied to three additional donors (Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in one of the donors we were unable to achieve sufficient knockdown with the siRNA targeting IFI16 and therefore observed no differences in interferon responses, further arguing against the possibility of unspecific effects of the siRNA treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, IFI16 enhances the capacity of macrophages to sense HIV and to initiate an immunological response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The immune response to HIV and HSV infection in human macrophages is regulated by IFI16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) IFI16 expression was measured by western blotting in four primary human macrophage donors treated with scrambled (Sc.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and IFI16-specific (IFI16) siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,c) ISG54 expression (b) and IFN- expression (c) was measured in the four donors portrayed in (a) challenged with either Vpx particles alone or HIVvpx+ for 18 h.

**P less_than 0.01.Full size image', 'We hypothesized that lack of innate immune activation directed by IFI16 could lead to impaired viral control in macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we knocked-down IFI16 in MDMs and investigated the levels of HIV production 6 days post-infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that an average IFI16 reduction of 70% increased production of the macrophage-tropic HIV Bal strain by about two orders of magnitude (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar findings were observed using another set of IFI16 specific siRNAs where a 3-fold enhancement was achieved (Supplementary Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To better understand how IFI16 regulates the innate immune responses to viral infection, we utilized the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate knockout gene variants in human THP-1 cells, a monocytic cell line that adopts a macrophage-like phenotype on PMA differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single cell clones carrying IFI16 mutations were generated based on three different guide RNAs (Supplementary Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Verification of genetic KO was carried out by Western blot on PMA-treated THP1 cells (Supplementary Fig 2c,d) and by single clone sequencing (Supplementary Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The THP-1 clones harbouring KO mutations in genes encoding STING and cGAS have been described earlier37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Unlike HIV, members of the herpesviridae trigger robust innate immune responses in macrophages6,7,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously reported important roles for IFI16 in stimulating interferon responses to herpes virus infections using shRNA-directed knock-down7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore sought to validate whether the KO cell lines exhibit a similar dependence on IFI16 for herpes virus-induced type I interferon production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control PMA-treated THP1 cells, we observed elevated type I interferon secretion 18 h after infection with both herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1; Fig 1e) and human cytomegalovirus (hCMV; Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This response was completely abolished in THP1 cells lacking cGAS and STING, and only minor residual induction of type I interferons in IFI16 KO cells was observed (Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a higher MOI of HSV1, we were able to explore interferon secretion at earlier time points (28 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results confirmed that IFI16 is required for potent early immune activation following HSV-1 infection (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To exclude potential off-target effects of the IFI16-directed CRISPR knockout, we evaluated innate immune responses to the paramyxovirus Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an RNA virus known to trigger RIG-I activation38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, type I interferon and TNF- responses were not affected by knocking out IFI16 (Supplementary Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, to exclude saturating effects of high NDV titres, we confirmed our results using sequential dilutions of viral inoculums (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, IFI16 specifically enhanced the capacity of macrophages to sense infection by DNA-containing or producing viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Early and robust activation of STING is regulated by IFI16', 'A reliable approach to trigger immune activation by cGAS and STING is liposomal transfection of synthetic DNA of various structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore transfected control and IFI16 KO cells with different types and concentrations of synthetic DNA and evaluated early type I interferon secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both HSV-1 60mer (dsDNA) and herring testis DNA (HT-DNA) induced robust interferon responses in control THP1 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, THP1 cells lacking IFI16 showed a significantly weaker interferon response (Fig 2a; Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structured single-stranded HIV DNA, previously shown to trigger interferon signalling5, resulted in a similar interferon response as observed for HT-DNA and dsDNA (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lipofectamine transfection alone did not induce a substantial amount of type I interferon (Supplementary Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Cytosolic DNA sensing and efficient innate signalling is dependent on IFI16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Control and IFI16 CRISPR KO THP-1 cells were transfected with dsDNA at various concentrations and interferon induction measured after 6 h. (b,c) Control and IFI16 KO cells were transfected with dsDNA (4 g ml1) at indicated time-points (b) or poly (I:C) (1 g ml1 or 5 g ml1) for 20 h (c), hereafter supernatants were evaluated for type I interferon expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Whole cell lysates from control or IFI16 KO cells stimulated with dsDNA (4 g ml1) at indicated time-points were subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies against STING, pIRF3, pTBK1, total TBK, total IRF3 and vinculin (VCL) as loading control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Control or IFI16 KO cells were transfected with dsDNA (4 g ml1) for two and four hours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cells were fixed and stained with anti-IFI16 (Green) and anti-STING (Red) specific antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA was visualized with DAPI (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data represent

and IFI16 KO THP1 cells with dsDNA and assessed type I interferon secretion over a 12 h time course.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control cells, we observed a continuous increase in interferon responses, whereas IFI16 KO cells depicted a significantly attenuated and delayed interferon response (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This impairment in THP1 cells lacking IFI16 was even more pronounced when we evaluated expression of the IRF3-dependent target gene CXCL10, which was completely absent in IFI16 KO cells (Supplementary Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, transfection with polyI:C, that activates the RIG-I pathway, induced normal interferon (Fig 2c) and TNF- responses (Supplementary Fig 4e) in both control and IFI16 KO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minimal interferon response observed in IFI16 KO THP1 cells could be due to effects on other innate signalling pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when we pre-treated control and IFI16 KO cells with the TBK1/IKK kinase inhibitor BX-795 before DNA transfection we observed a complete block of type I interferon responses (Supplementary Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that DNA transfection did not affect kinases other than TBK1 in the interferon induction pathway, we also evaluated interferon responses in TBK1 KO THP1 cells (Supplementary Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TBK1 KO cells did not produce type I interferon on transfection with dsDNA, in constrast to control THP1 cells (Supplementary Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate these findings in primary cells, we knocked-down IFI16 in MDMs using siRNA (Supplementary Fig 5a) and transfected with dsDNA 48 h after the final siRNA treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efficient IFI16 depletion was associated with significantly reduced interferon responses following transfection with dsDNA but not polyI:C (Supplementary Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These observations were confirmed in additional THP1 IFI16 KO clones from a total of three different gRNA sequences (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All clones responded normally to polyI:C transfection or NDV infection but showed strongly impaired type I interferon responses to dsDNA (Supplementary Fig 6ae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Type I interferon responses were also absent upon dsDNA treatment in THP1 cells lacking cGAS or STING (Supplementary Fig 6f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we reconstituted IFI16 expression by lentiviral gene delivery and demonstrated a partly restored IFI16 expression 48 h after transduction (Supplementary Fig 6g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells gained the capacity to respond to dsDNA transfection observed by increased production of type I interferon, whereas the response to poly(I:C) transfection was unaltered (Supplementary Fig 6h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, we observed that lentiviral gene delivery of eGFP did not induce interferon production in IFI16 KO cells, however, it slightly increased interferon response following DNA stimulation in control cells (Supplementary Fig 6h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We speculated that the attenuated interferon responses observed in IFI16 KO THP1 cells could be due to impaired regulation of the STING signalling cascade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate this, we performed immunoblotting for STING, phospho-TBK1 and phospho-IRF3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that transfection of cells with dsDNA resulted in the emergence of a slow migrating form of STING (Supplementary Fig 7a, left side), possibly due to phosphorylation40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this we treated samples with alkaline phosphatase before SDSPAGE electrophoresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in disappearance of the slower migrating signal (Supplementary Fig 7a, right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, control and IFI16 KO THP1 cells were transfected with dsDNA and evaluated for the appearance of the phosphorylated STING band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control cells, this signal appeared after one hour and peaked between 4 and 6 h p.t.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 2d, upper left panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, cells lacking IFI16 produced a very faint and transient signal after 46 h p.t.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 2d, upper right panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evaluation of TBK1 phosphorylation further indicated that control cells responded rapidly to dsDNA, whereas cells lacking IFI16 had a delayed and transient phosphorylation pattern (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This attenuated response was also apparent IRF3 phosphorylation where control THP1 cells induced phospho-IRF3 after 1 h and peaked 8 h p.t., whereas IFI16 KO cells demonstrated at least a 4 h time delay and a weaker signal for phospho-IRF3 (Fig 2d, lane 24 versus lane 1012).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then employed confocal microscopy to visualize the kinetic of STING activation as assessed by STING puncta formation after dsDNA transfection in both control and IFI16 KO cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In control THP1 cells, IFI16 and STING colocalized in distinct spots with saturated DAPI staining, indicating transfected dsDNA, which was completely absent in cells lacking IFI16 (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, STING specks were clearly observed in control cells 2 h p.t., which further increased at 4 h (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, THP1 cells lacking IFI16 formed no detectable specks at 2 h and very few at 4 h p.t.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference was significant when STING puncta were counted in multiple cells (Supplementary Fig 7b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether these data demonstrate that macrophages, which express cGAS and STING but lack IFI16, do not have the capacity to initiate early and robust STING signalsome activation in response to cytosolic dsDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'STING dimerization and phosphorylation is controlled by IFI16', 'Recently, it has been shown that dimerization of STING through cGAMP interaction precedes active TBK1 phosphorylation of STING and IRF3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we hypothesized that IFI16 participates in regulating STING dimerization and subsequently TBK1/IRF3 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this, we utilized an in-house STING dimerization protocol37 that allows investigation of STING dimerization and phosphorylation after dsDNA transfection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To pinpoint STING dimerization, all experiments were conducted under semi-native conditions, as reducing conditions would disrupt the dimerization but not the phosphorylation signal of STING (Supplementary Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When control THP1 cells were stimulated with dsDNA, an immediate dimerization signal was observed that peaked in intensity after 4 h (Fig 3a, lane 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signal was both delayed and less intense in THP1 cells lacking IFI16 (Fig 3a, lane 1014).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DNA potently stimulates innate immune responses through a pathway dependent on the DNA sensor cGAS and signalling via STING, TBK1 and IRF3 to induce type I interferon expression1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, several other DNA sensors have been proposed2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate a central role for IFI16 in innate DNA sensing in macrophages, and unveil a two-step interconnected process where IFI16 enhances both cGAS-mediated cGAMP production, and cGAMP-mediated activation of the STING signalsome (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The function of IFI16 as a DNA sensor was demonstrated more than five years ago6, and work by us and others suggested important roles for IFI16 in pathogen recognition5,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, after the discovery of cGAS as a DNA sensor and demonstration of a clear role of this protein in both men and mice13,16,47 less attention has been given to other proposed DNA sensors, including potential interactions with the cGAS-STING pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a recent report highlights that cGAS may need cofactors to achieve optimal binding to cytosolic DNA33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary, a recent report observes unaltered DNA sensing in mice depleted for the locus containing PYHIN-encoding genes48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results argue against a role for murine PYHIN proteins in the cGAS-STING pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since mice do not have a clear ortholog of IFI16, it is difficult to extrapolate the murine data to human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our present results reiterate the necessity of cGAS and IFI16 to drive interferon responses in the human macrophage-like cell line THP-1 during infection with HIV, HSV-1 and CMV or by stimulation with synthetic DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More interestingly, we demonstrated that IFI16 is also necessary for initiating an early and robust interferon response to cytosolic DNA, HIV and herpes infections, and cGAMP stimulation in primary human macrophages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that IFI16 and cGAS cooperate in macrophages to enable optimal production of cGAMP that allows STING dimerization and downstream signalling events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that IFI16 has a function as co-factor for cGAS, through its capacity to bind double-stranded DNA (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model is similar to what has been suggested for PQBP1 in human dendritic cells33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PQBP1 appears to be more specific as a co-factor for retroviral infections than IFI16, although the precise PAMP has not been identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have previously demonstrated that monocytic undifferentiated THP-1 cells have very low basal expression of IFI16 but show high expression levels of cGAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells do respond immunologically to cytosolic DNA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when differentiated into macrophage-like cells over a two-day period they drastically change morphology, and also display strong elevation of IFI16 expression and decreased cGAS expression, which correlates with elevated interferon and cytokine responsiveness compared to undifferentiated cells10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, DNA-driven IFN- expression is independent of IFI16 in undifferentiated THP-1 cells10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the core cGAS-STING pathway may use a panel of co-factors, including IFI16 and PQBP1, depending on the cellular context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the physiological relevance of the IFI16-dependent phenotype observed in PMA differentiated THP-1 cells is supported by the demonstration of a role for IFI16 in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages for both DNA stimulation and cGAMP infusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also interesting to notice that in the study by Almine et al.49 an analogous function of IFI16 in human keratinocytes was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Primary keratinocytes treated with siRNA and HaCaT cells with IFI16-deficience lacked the capacity to produce interferon in respond to exogenous DNA and cGAMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison to our study, Almine et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  did however not observe that IFI16-deficiency affected production of cGAMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These variances indicate cell-type specific differences for the fine-tuning of IFI16 function in respond to DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The experimental design used here aimed to address a potential role for IFI16 in the cytosolic compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that IFI16 is a multifunctional protein involved in nuclear as well as cytosolic processes, including sensing of foreign DNA in the nucleus3,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others have reported a role for IFI16 in transcriptional regulation of the IFN- promoter51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results based on measurement of cGAMP production, STING dimerization and phosphorylation clearly demonstrate that human macrophages deficient of IFI16 have impaired capacity to initiate these processes and hence to stimulate IRF3 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the PMA-THP-1 macrophage model, IFI16 has a function as co-factor for cGAS, most likely through its ability to bind DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, based on other recent publications9,11 we cannot exclude that IFI16 may also act by stabilizing cGAMP and inhibiting its turnover.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are warranted to address this possibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, when macrophages were stimulated with cGAMP directly, we identified a hitherto unknown function of IFI16, independent of its cooperative function for cGAS activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, IFI16 was not necessary for STING to initiate dimer formation, but was important for recruitment of TBK1 to STING and phosphorylation of STING.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study shows that STING can be phosphorylated at numerous positions, where phosphorylation at Ser366 is important for downstream signalling to IRF3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it has been proposed that activation of STING is associated with its trafficking from the ER to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of these data, it is interesting to note that even though STING dimerization occurred in IFI16-deficient cells with a delayed response, we observed less STING degradation in combination with reduced TBK1-directed phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could indicate that STING dimerization occurred in the ER, but did not traffic to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, where it is assumed to associate with TBK1 and leading to subsequent degradation of STING by the autophagy pathway19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further studies are warranted to determine whether STING translocation from the ER occurs in the absence of IFI16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of our immunoprecipitation results, we propose that IFI16 constitutively binds TBK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon cGAMP-triggered STING dimerization, IFI16 may then form a signalling complex with STING and TBK1 that allows TBK1 to phosphorylate STING.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, based on the results obtained using IFI16 mutants we propose that IFI16 promotes activation of the cGAMP-activated STING-TBK1 pathway by a process relying on PYRIN domain-dependent protein-protein interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, our data reveal that IFI16 is important for the DNA-activated cGAS-cGAMP-STING-TBK1 pathway in human macrophages, and that it acts at two levels in the upstream part of the pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFI16 (i) augments cGAS-mediated production of cGAMP and (ii) enables cGAMP-mediated recruitment of TBK1 to STING.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work thus identifies IFI16 as an important cofactor for cGAS in the initial steps of DNA sensing upstream of cGAMP production, and provides evidence for a novel appliance of a known PRR needed for downstream events in the STING signalling pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the results reveal that the activity of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING-TBK1 pathway can be fine-tuned by the cell-type and context-specific expression of the cellular factor IFI16.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
