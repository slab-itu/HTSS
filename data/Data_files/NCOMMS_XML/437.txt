Lasting mantle scars lead to perennial plate tectonics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mid-ocean ridges, transform faults, subduction and continental collisions form the conventional theory of plate tectonics to explain non-rigid behaviour at plate boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the theory does not explain directly the processes involved in intraplate deformation and seismicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, damage structures in the lithosphere have been linked to the origin of plate tectonics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite seismological imaging suggesting that inherited mantle lithosphere heterogeneities are ubiquitous, their plate tectonic role is rarely considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that deep lithospheric anomalies can dominate shallow geological features in activating tectonics in plate interiors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In numerical experiments, we found that structures frozen into the mantle lithosphere through plate tectonic processes can behave as quasi-plate boundaries reactivated under far-field compressional forcing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intraplate locations where proto-lithospheric plates have been scarred by earlier suturing could be regions where latent plate boundaries remain, and where plate tectonics processes are expressed as a perennial phenomenon.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The expanded regions of future (and past) orogenesis may be determined by a perennial plate tectonics map (Fig 1), which highlights active and latent plate boundaries and deformation zones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seismic reflection data from Canada, the Alps, the Pyrenees, the North Sea, and the Skagerrak and Hebrides shelf have identified tectonic structures as scarred lithosphere extending deep into Earths interior1,2,3 (yellow crosses, Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such seismic reflectors in the mantle lithosphere (ML) have been interpreted to be related to relict subduction zones linked to the closing of oceanic basins (that is, subduction scars generated at an ancient plate boundary) (for example, refs 4, 5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: A perennial plate tectonic map.Present-day plate boundaries with major paleo-suture zones and regions of ML scars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yellow lines are regions of proposed ancient suture zones as compiled from Burke et al.46 and Hoffman et al.47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yellow crosses indicate seismic surveys where mantle reflections have been reported, with locations here given by a previous compilation of mantle heterogeneities1 and two recent studies6,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Present-day plate boundaries are white lines as compiled from Bird49.Full size image', 'ML scars are well established in the geological record (for example, refs 1, 4, 6) but they have not received the same attention as, for example, the reactivation of faults within the Earths crust7 for localizing intraplate deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments on rock properties find that deformation generates weak zones that, over time, can be dormant (or be reactivated) depending on how the material strength is affected by changes in ambient stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reduction in grain size is a characteristic of this lithospheric damage8, which can be abundant at tectonic margins in the form of ML peridotite mylonites9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As deep seismic reflector anomalies are generally inferred to represent deformation relating to ancient tectonic margin processes (for example, refs 4, 11), these ML scars can be classified as weak zones (that is, a region of reduced grain size at mid-lithospheric depth) via the continuum theory of damage mechanics8,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show the results of thermo-mechanical finite-element experiments with continental parameters to understand further the role of ML heterogeneities by comparing weak zones at different depths and of different geometries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We implemented a strong ML to model the conditions required for a normal continent (for example, (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13)), with a lower crustal rheology that permits crustmantle interaction (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We model pre-existing zones of weakness (for example, (refs 15, 16, 17)) by specifying a region with a low angle of internal friction (to mirror the processes of lithospheric damage (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8)), and simulate inherited structures in the upper crust (UC), lower crust (LC) and ML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have chosen a two-dimensional (2D) geometry (over three-dimensional) so that the experiments track the evolution of fault zones in the crustmantle tectonic models to high resolution (1-km vertical resolution in the crust).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

fault has localized over time18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time-dependence of the UC scars is shown in Fig 2b by markers A, B and C, with these faults reactivating in alphabetical sequence as strain is accumulated and transferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UC fault reactivation produces folding in the UC, but acts to thicken the LC and produce subcrustal subduction within the ML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When only LC scars are present (Fig 2c), a time-dependent strain pattern change remains (markers DG) but the thickening of the LC produces widespread folding in the UC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The combination of both LC and UC scars (Fig 3a) produces a shifting pattern of strain that appears to be controlled by the lower crustal heterogeneities rather than the shallower features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Timing of crustal fault ruptures (HK) coordinate with those of LC scars only (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the combination of LC and UC faults produces a strong decoupling of the LC from the UC, as shown by the high strain rate along the boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The introduction of a ML scar to convergent models featuring 22 remnant crustal features produces a marked focusing of deformation (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ML scar supersedes the shallower pre-existing faults to produce pseudo-subduction (that is, underthrusting of the ML).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower crustal thickening impinges on the UC to produce folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over time, the folding propagates as the convergence continues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the deformation produced by the ML scar is localized (despite the numerous crustal features present) with little time-dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, the pattern of deformation produced by UC, LC and ML weak scars (Fig 3b) is almost identical to that of a convergent model featuring a ML scar only (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the evolution of intraplate deformation follows the later stages of a continent collision (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Model validation', 'Additional experiments were performed to test how robust the model set-up is to changes in rheological parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 2 shows the strength profiles for the rheology used in Figs 2 and 3 (Supplementary Fig 2a), as well as for the additional experiments (Supplementary Fig 2bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The models presented in Supplementary Figs 3 and 4 show ML scars to be important in activating tectonics, while the reduction in crust and mantle strength may also determine the dominant factor in tectonic evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The models presented in Figs 2 and 3 are the most relevant as we apply a strong LC and ML to simulate relatively stable, strong continental interiors that feature long-lived ML scars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present additional models here to understand the limits of our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Jelly sandwich or crème brûlée', 'Supplementary Fig 3 shows results from using a crust and ML rheology that is not as strong as those experiments presented in Figs 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We implement a different configuration of weak zones for this suite of models (Supplementary Fig 3a) as compared with Fig 2a, with 12 weak zones in the LC and UC and 2 in the ML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge that previous studies have highlighted the possible jelly sandwich or crème brûlée strength profiles of the mantle (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13), and present experiments taking this into account in Supplementary Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our jelly sandwich experiments have a weaker LC than shown in Figs 2 and 3 (strength profile as given in Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For models just featuring UC scars, we find that the UC dominates tectonic evolution in this jelly sandwich setting (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time markers AC show the evolution of strain within the UC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The introduction of weak zones into the LC and ML (Supplementary Fig 3c) generates more localized deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the UC weak zones are reactivated, their influence on regional tectonics and the deformation of the LC is minimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ML scars again show to be dominant in activating tectonics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "In applying a crème brûlée rheology, we detach the LC and mantle from the UC leading to décollment tectonics (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that regions where a crème brûlée rheology is present, perennial plate tectonics may not persist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in order for stable continents to be preserved over time, Burov and Watts13 found that a jelly sandwich rheology would be required over a crème brûlée rheology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the crème brûlée' rheology is not applicable to our study of intraplate tectonics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'LC strength', 'The strength of the LC and ML is important in activating tectonics (for example, refs 14, 18, 20, 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To show that our results are not dependent on the rheological parameters, we present a suite of models that use material values that are similar to a previously published paper22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these models we use the weak zone configuration as shown in Supplementary Fig 3a, and implement flow laws for wet quartz for the UC23, wet anorthite for the LC24 and dry olivine for the upper mantle25 (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These rheological parameters produce strength profiles that are intermediate in the range of published flow laws for crustal and mantle materials (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Supplementary Fig 4 shows the material deformation after 270 km of shortening for the rheological parameters given in Supplementary Table 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The UC weak zones in Supplementary Fig 4a generate strong folding of the crust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The changing patterns of stress build-up shifts to produce pseudo-subduction of the crust into the ML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implementation of wet anorthite for the LC generates a layer that is not primed for failure (even with regions of designated weakness).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The wet anorthite flow law generates a weak LC that plays no role in the deformation pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is shown with the introduction of UC and LC weak zones (Supplementary Fig 4b) and the dominance of the upper crustal weak zones in the deformation pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ML weak zones again dominate the deformation pattern when introduced in Supplementary Fig 4c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the UC weak zones reactivate, the overall tectonic pattern is controlled by the ML scars (with the LC weak zones playing no role).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time-dependent nature of the UC deformation pattern is replaced by the ML scarrings ability to accommodate shortening through sub-crustal subduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an experiment featuring only ML scars (Supplementary Fig 3d), the deformation is localized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the pattern of crustal deformation with all weak zones present (Supplementary Fig 4c) follows closely with that of the simulation with just ML weak zones (Supplementary Fig 4d), rather than that of UC only (Supplementary Fig 4a), implying that the deeper scars control tectonic evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Plate velocity', 'By increasing the convergence rate of the model from =1 to 2.5 cm per year, we can show the difference in deformation due to plate forcing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we compare simulations that have been shortened by 450 km using the rheological parameters of Supplementary Fig 2a and Supplementary Table 1 (and the weak zone configuration shown in Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only major difference that occurs from increasing the convergence velocity (when comparing with Fig 2) happens for the model featuring UC scars only (Fig 2b and Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a lower convergence velocity the stress pattern changes over time reactivating faults over time (Fig 2b and Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at =2.5 cm per year the stress pattern does not change and the time-dependence of the model disappears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of a higher convergence velocity, the result that lower crustal weak scars control deformation over shallower features is highlighted due to this lack of time-dependence with UC scars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deformation pattern from UC and LC scars (Supplementary Fig 5c) is more similar to LC tectonics (Supplementary Fig 5b) than UC tectonics (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, increasing the convergence velocity allows for the same conclusions: deep lithospheric heterogeneities can control deformation over shallower features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ML weak zone orientation', 'Supplementary Fig 6 give an indication of how the orientation of a ML weak scar would affect the pattern of deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all previous models we applied similar angles to the scars within the ML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 6a gives four different ML scar configurations: ML(i) two scars with angles as previously shown; ML(ii) two steeper ML scars; ML(iii) two vertical ML scars; and ML(iv) two smaller ML scars (of the same size as the lower crustal scars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All models are realized with UC and LC scars as in Supplementary Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models ML(i), ML(ii) and ML(iv) exhibit very similar deformation patterns despite having different configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a result shown here, we found that if a ML scar becomes small enough, the crustal scars can control deformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The vertical nature of the weak scars in model ML(iii) inverses the deformation pattern, which indicates that there appears to be a preferred angle in which the ML can pseudo-subduct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the overall result from changing the orientation of the weak scars in the ML is that deeper heterogeneities often controls the pattern of deformation (despite changing the angles of scars).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results demonstrate that deformation patterns in continent interiors are influenced by the depth of lithospheric heterogeneities, and that ML scars can guide deformation over other pre-existing features in the UC and LC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The range of deformation patterns exhibited from the models presented here indicates the complex nature of lithospheric heterogeneities and plate tectonics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation of dormant lithospheric structures depends on changes in the regional stress regime18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The tectonic history of China provides one reference to understand plate tectonics beyond plate boundaries with regards to our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are many regions where continents have been accreted by closure of paleo-oceans between micro-plates, China is a unique reference as the far-field convergent stress from the IndianEurasian collision is relatively recent and ongoing (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: The suture zones of Chinese tectonics and the ATF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A topographic map of the different tectonic blocks with paleo-suture zones (white lines) of the IndiaEurasia collision zone (suture zones from Watson et al.50).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CAOB, Central Asia Orogenic Belt;

the localization of deformation from strong ML heterogeneities can change strain patterns during periods of shortening and dominate over the crustal response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our result that ML dominates crust in controlling tectonic processes is consistent with findings from geological studies (for example, refs 11, 20, 41) and recent physical scaled analogue modelling of heterogeneous lithosphere (for example, refs 21, 38, 39, 40) (although no previous studies have incorporated both crustal and mantle heterogeneities as done here).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ML scars related to oceanic subduction have been the most documented in the geological record (for example, refs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, processes that do not feature oceanic subduction may also account for seismically inferred heterogeneities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RayleighTaylor instability, lithospheric underplating, lithospheric delamination and lithospheric subduction are all related to continental collisions (that is, suture zone tectonics) and may produce lasting (seismically visible) ML structures11,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in the number of high-resolution imaging studies of the upper ML (at sites of previous continental collisions in particular) would be able to test this extended theory through the discovery of further ML heterogeneities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ability of deep lithospheric heterogeneous structures to exist over long periods in stable continental settings (Fig 1) allows for a new mechanism for intraplate evolution (following external forcing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If, as an example, the ATF has a long-lasting ML scar from a continental collision that is controlling the crustal evolution, then plate tectonics may indeed display perennial processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, an increase in intraplate orogenesis would be observed during future (and past) periods of global compression and extension (that is, supercontinent formation and dispersal).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A tenet of the conventional theory of plate tectonics is that crustal deformation is confined to near the boundaries of plates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work implies that this remains true for general planetary deformation as ML scars (that can control tectonic evolution) in a continent interior may originate from an ancient plate boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this way, ancient and present-day plate boundaries could be represented together as latent and active boundaries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A global map of perennial plate tectonics (Fig 1) presents a redefined illustration of tectonic activity and modifies the conventional theory of plate tectonics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
