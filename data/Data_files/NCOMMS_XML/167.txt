Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Inorganic nanoparticles, stabilized by a passivating layer of organic molecules, form a versatile class of nanostructured materials with potential applications in material chemistry, nanoscale physics, nanomedicine and structural biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the structure of the nanoparticle core is often known to atomic precision, gaining precise structural and dynamical information on the organic layer poses a major challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a full assignment of 1H and 13C NMR shifts to all ligands of a water-soluble, atomically precise, 102-atom gold nanoparticle stabilized by 44 para-mercaptobenzoic acid ligands in solution, by using a combination of multidimensional NMR methods, density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamics simulations augment the data by giving information about the ligand disorder and visualization of possible distinct ligand conformations of the most dynamic ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method demonstrated here opens a way to controllable strategies for functionalization of ligated nanoparticles for applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Inorganic nanoparticles, including metals, semiconductors and metal oxides, comprise a common set of structures exhibiting an inorganic core passivated by an organic shell1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligated inorganic nanoparticles currently provoke widespread fundamental interest in their structural, optical and magnetic properties, which differ fundamentally from bulk counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These nanomaterials already find application in biology3, medicine, solar energy4 and display panels5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their widespread study, the structure of inorganic nanoparticles, especially of their surfaces, is often still a matter of conjecture6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the structure of the inorganic fraction of nanoparticles is straightforwardly determined by methods such as transmission electron microscopy and/or powder diffraction7,8, the nature of the ligand/metal interface is often obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In special cases where synthesis is successfully refined to produce atomically precise nanoparticles that can form well-ordered crystals, single-crystal X-ray methods can result in total structure determination9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-crystal X-ray methods reveal that the surfaces of nanoparticles can be markedly rearranged by ligand interactions, often into surprisingly low-symmetry structures12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These single-crystal X-ray structures highlight the shortcomings of conventional transmission electron microscopy methods for determining nanoparticle structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can reveal a three-dimensional structure with fidelity comparable to single-crystal X-ray crystallography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in determining the complex structures of proteins, the method is ideal for addressing the structures and dynamical interactions of proteins or protein fragments that are recalcitrant to crystallization13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, NMR provides a sensitive method to probe the structure of the ligand shell of ligand-passivated inorganic nanoparticles in solution phase, and it has indeed been recently applied to a few cases of atomically precise gold nanoclusters stabilized by thiolates14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies9 yielded the total structure of Au102(pMBA)44 in 2007, revealing a complex ligand layer with 22 symmetry-unique ligand environments in C2 overall symmetry (pMBA stands for para-mercapto benzoic acid).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since then, its electronic structure18,19,20, spectroscopic21 properties and chiral22 properties as well as the propensity for thiolate ligand exchange12 have been studied, and this nanoparticle has been functionalized for site-specific labelling of enteroviruses by utilizing covalent23 and weak24 interactions with viral capsid proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR spectroscopy has previously revealed the protein-like complexity of the Au102(pMBA)44 ligand shell15, yielding a broad one-dimensional (1D) 1H spectrum comprising several overlapping signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here data from multidimensional NMR spectroscopy (nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY), total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) 1H NMR and heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) 1H13C correlations), combined with theoretical calculations for 1H and 13C NMR shifts based on the known crystal structure of Au102(pMBA)44, augmented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the ligand dynamics in water, allowed for a full assignment of the 1D NMR signals to the 22 symmetry-unique ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The successful strategy disclosed here opens a new avenue for structural and dynamical studies of ligated inorganic nanoparticles in the solution phase, and is generalizable to both organic and aqueous media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resolving the structure and dynamics of the ligand layer with molecular precision can lead to highly controllable and accurate methods for functionalization of the ligated nanoparticles for various applications where the essential chemistry between the nanoparticle and environment takes place in solution phase.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Solid-state structure', 'The atomic structure of Au102(pMBA)44 determined from the single-crystal X-ray experiment9 is shown in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the C2 overall symmetry, the cluster contains 22 symmetry-unique pMBA ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray structure reveals that the pMBA ligands interact with the inorganic core through two types of goldthiolate motifsshort RS-Au-SR and long RS-Au-(SR)-Au-SR units9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although crystal packing has an effect on the ligand orientation due to the intermolecular interactions between neighbouring clusters in the solid state, the same ligand symmetry equivalence was previously suggested in the 1H NMR spectrum of Au102(pMBA)44 cluster in solution15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, an intrinsic ordering of the ligands on the cluster surface in solution may be similar to that observed in the solid state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assignment of ligands to their symmetry-equivalent site on the cluster surface cannot be done solely based on the 1D proton spectrum due to high complexity of broad and overlapping signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, two-dimensional (2D) NMR techniques together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations and MD simulations were undertaken for full assignment of the symmetry-equivalent pMBA ligands in the 1D proton spectrum of Au102(pMBA)44 cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Crystal

environment becomes more pronounced as each of the symmetry-equivalent ligand will experience unique and distinguishable shielding based on their different local chemical environment on the cluster

affected by interactions with the neighbouring ligands, the available space around the ligands and constraints set by the parent goldthiolate unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final assignment of the 22 pMBA ligands was made based on special ligand environments (see below), neighbouring ligand interactions and ligand dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Special ligand environments', 'From the calculated spectra, a set of five special ligand environments could be identified arising from shielding effects imposed by the local chemical environment (marked by horizontal bars in Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These five environments are, in order of deshielding: (1) ligand-to-gold interaction; (2) ligand-to-sulfur interaction; (3) isolated ligand; (4) face-to-face aromatic interaction; and (5) edge-to-face aromatic interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligand-to-gold interactions were the most deshielded and gave the highest downfield shifts (8.88.2 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), whereas isolated ligand and ligand-to-sulfur interactions fell in the same region (7.67.1 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  as free pMBA (7.40 and 7.23 p.p.m.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Face-to-face aromatic interactions were likewise more deshielded and shifted downfield (8.07.3 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in comparison with free pMBA, while edge-to-face aromatic interactions shifted the most upfield (6.65.9 p.p.m.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large difference () between Ha and Hb shifts was observed for ligands that experienced both shielding and deshielding ligand environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, combination of edge-to-face and face-to-face interactions yielded this large difference, marked by large  p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Correlating the experimental TOCSY assignments with the calculated chemical shifts revealed two pMBA ligands (pMBA-1 and -2) having the most downfield shifts, which were assigned as ligands in the model having distinct ligand-to-gold interactions (Fig 1b, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pMBA-1 is located at the five-fold symmetry axis of the gold core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second special ligand environment was traced to face-to-face aromatic interactions of three ligands (pMBA-3, -7 and -11) assembling into a stack of three that gave downfield shifts both in the experimental and calculated data (Fig 1b, middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different chemical environment imposed by the static -stacking interactions was clearly seen as multiple strong HSQC correlations for Ca and Cb carbons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to face-to-face aromatic interactions from both sides, ligand pMBA-7 in the middle of the stack showed two HSQC correlations for both Ca and Cb carbons (129.4/132.5 and 129.1/131.9 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), whereas only the Ca carbons of ligands pMBA-3 (132.8 and 133.6 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and -11 (129.0 and 132.3 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at the top and bottom of the stack were affected (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most upfield shift, on the other hand, was identified as an edge-to-face aromatic interaction (pMBA-15), which also correlated well with the calculated model (Fig 1b, middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last special ligand environment was observed with a pMBA ligand (pMBA-6) that had both symmetry-equivalent ligands attached to the same RS-Au-SR unit having the largest  value (1.39 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  between protons Ha and Hb that resulted from both edge-to-face and face-to-face aromatic interactions with the neighbouring ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Through-space interactions', 'Whereas chemical shift shielding afforded information about the nature of the ligand interactions, through-space correlations gave information to which neighbouring ligands these interactions are formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NOESY and ROESY spectra therefore afforded a connectivity map of neighbouring ligands, which could be used together with the previous assignment based on the local ligand environment (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strongest NOESY and ROESY correlations were associated with ligands pMBA-1 and -15, which also suggested lesser mobility of these ligands and the neighbouring ligands they were interacting with.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, pMBA-1 showed NOESY/ROESY correlations to ligands pMBA-4/-3, -7, -8/-5, -9, -11 and -13 (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these the symmetry-equivalent site was already established for pMBA-3, -7 and -11 corroborating the earlier assignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pMBA-7 also showed ROESY correlations to pMBA-1, -2 and -3 confirming their proximity and agreement with the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pMBA-11 likewise gave correlations to pMBA-1 and -2 that were in close ranges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that pMBA-1 and -11 are attached to the same RS-Au-SR unit and are therefore likely to interact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same holds for ligands pMBA-2 and -3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The assignment of the remaining ligands surrounding pMBA-1 at the five-fold symmetry axis was based on the best possible agreement of the experimental and calculated chemical shifts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pMBA-13 was assigned first as having a distinct upfield shift in the experimental spectrum (6.986.76 p.p.m., =0.20 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), which was most likely due to an edge-to-face aromatic interaction to a ligand that was assigned as pMBA-4 showing up more downfield (7.707.18 p.p.m.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ligands pMBA-4 and -13 had a NOESY correlation to pMBA-2 and -15, which were in close distance and agreed well with the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The order of ligands pMBA-5, -8 and -9 was made based on the subtle changes in their chemical shift shielding, since they all appeared at the middle range (7.626.56 p.p.m., =0.50.8 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and their symmetry-equivalent site was determined based on the best agreement with the experimental and calculated data (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ligand pMBA-3 gave NOESY/ROESY correlations to ligands pMBA-2, -7 and -11, whose proximity was already confirmed and established, but also to pMBA-9/-10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction was assigned to pMBA-10 due to its closer distance and more probable interaction to pMBA-3 based on the model in comparison with pMBA-9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, the last through-space interactions were established for ligand pMBA-15 that showed NOESY correlations to ligands pMBA-4, -12 and -13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, the assignment of pMBA-4 and -13 was already made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the symmetry-equivalent site for pMBA-12 was assigned as the centre position of the long RS-Au-(SR)-Au-SR unit, also agreeing well with the experimental and calculated data (Fig 1b, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MD simulation studies showed this ligand to be one of the most dynamic ones, due to the flexibility of the long goldthiolate unit (Figs 3b and 6 and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Dynamics of the centre of mass (CM) of selected ligands

analysis of the dynamics of three selected ligands are given in Fig 6, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Data 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that the extent of the chemical shift in the NMR spectra had a clear correlation to ligand mobility (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More static ligands gave stronger correlation peaks, whereas ligands that showed higher mobility in the MD simulation gave weaker correlation peaks (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong TOCSY correlations were found for 15 pMBA ligands, of which 14 were assigned above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining strong correlation (pMBA-14) in the upfield region of the proton spectrum (6.796.28 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  was assigned based on its good agreement with the calculated data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symmetry-equivalent site for pMBA-14 is a close neighbour to pMBA-12, which was established as one of the most mobile ligands being attached on the long goldthiolate unit, and therefore does not show through-space correlation to pMBA-14, although correlation to the other closest neighbour pMBA-15 was observed (Fig 1b, right; and Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The remaining weak TOCSY correlations were assigned by comparing the experimental chemical shifts with the calculated ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ligands also showed high mobility in the MD simulation studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligands pMBA-16, -17 and -18 all gave similar TOCSY correlations in the downfield region with high  value (8.256.76 p.p.m., =1.101.39 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  indicating more than one type of interaction (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed downfield shifts can be explained by the interaction with the gold core that is very similar for all the three ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligand pMBA-19 appeared at the middle range (7.577.29 p.p.m., =0.28 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), whereas good agreement with the calculated data was found for ligands pMBA-20 and -21 in the upfield region of the spectrum (7.246.06 p.p.m., =0.951.18 p.p.m.).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reasonable since pMBA-19 is nearly isolated on the cluster surface while pMBA-20 and pMBA-21 both have edge-to-face and face-to-face characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last remaining ligand pMBA-22 was assigned to the symmetry-equivalent site at the other end of the long goldthiolate unit.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We were able to interpret fully the very complicated 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the inorganic nanoparticle Au102(pMBA)44 in solution by using a combination of multidimensional NMR methods, DFT calculations and MD simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With help of DFT calculations and MD simulations we showed that the ligands have their own intrinsic orientation in close connection to the arrangement seen in the crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also showed that different ligands can have considerably different dynamical behaviour, which is confirmed by both MD simulations and the observed signal strengths of the measured NMR shifts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We mapped the ligandligand interactions and ligand environments to the proton spectrum, which can be generalized to also other ligand-protected inorganic clusters and nanoparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong ligandligand interactions were seen to reduce dynamics of the ligands and cause splitting of the signal in HSQC, which meant that four signals could be measured for the carbon atoms of the phenyl ring that are bound to the hydrogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our observations are important for future research of the ligated inorganic clusters in many ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, many of the known ligand-protected clusters have a well-defined molecular composition, including nanoparticles with perhaps 500 metal atoms and a well-developed plasmon, but lack empirical structure information regarding the ligand shell and ligandmetal interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR spectra for many of these clusters are reported, with severe congestion in the aromatic region of the spectra when the clusters are ligated by phenyl-containing ligands14,16,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work gives fingerprints of typical proton NMR shifts expected for a number of different classes of weak ligandligand interactions, which should prove useful in future analyses of NMR data from clusters where the solid-state X-ray structure is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the multidimensional NMR measurements combined with DFT calculation of NMR spectra, augmented by traditional high-resolution electron microscopy, can now allow for empirical structural models of entire nanoparticles (including the ligand shell and ligandmetal interaction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, unsolved questions like reason for the different structural symmetry with different ligands could be answered using the methods used in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the results show that monitoring and controlling the ligand exchange of protected inorganic clusters could be possible with a single ligand accuracy using multidimensional NMR methods, allowing more rapid assessment of regio-isomerism than is presently possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future this can lead to extremely highly controllable and accurate methods for functionalization of the ligated nanoparticles for various applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

structure was relaxed by using DFT as implemented in code-package GPAW26 that uses a real-space grid with projector-augmented waves (PAW).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electronelectron interactions were treated by using the PerdewBurkeErnzerhof (PBE)27 exchange-correlation functional, and the wave functions and electron density were described in a real-space grid of 0.2 Å grid spacing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Wave (GIPAW) formalism as implemented in pseudopotential- and planewave-based DFT code-package Quantum Espresso28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used ultrasoft PBE-PAW pseudopotentials (http://www.quantum-espresso.org/pseudopotentials/), a kinetic energy cutoff of 950 eV for wave functions and 9,520 eV for the charge density and potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy convergence criterion for the self-consistency was set to 1.4·1011 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total chemical shifts were defined as =(ref)(calc), where (ref) was fixed to 31.099 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for 1H shifts and for 166.049 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for 13C shifts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of the selected reference values give a total average of all the calculated 1H and 13C shifts that is comparable to the experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the calculated NMR shifts we mainly concentrate on the symmetrically averaged values of 22 unique pMBA ligands as seen also in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A couple of clear overestimations in the shifts for the specific individual atoms of the ligands were found, most probably caused by the unique ligand arrangement and ligandligand interactions that are static in NMR calculations but not in the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dynamics of the ligands was studied by classical MD simulations in a water environment for 30 ns time at room temperature

recently developed and tested in our group (Pohjolainen et al, submitted manuscript).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principles of the force field were as follows: (1) no constraints included in the gold core, with the atoms interacting via a simple pair potential (LennardJones type); (2) for transferability, the charges of gold atoms were set to zero; (3) for the Au-S interface, equilibrium bond lengths and angles were averaged from our previous DFT calculations for the Au102(pMBA)44 structure, and force constants were adopted from a previous work30; and (4) for pMBA parameters, atom types were chosen from existing AMBER atom types, and partial charges were calculated from RESP fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dynamical behaviour of the 22 symmetrically unique ligands were estimated from the MD trajectory both visually and by calculating an averaged root mean squared deviations for all the ligands separately, in which we concentrated on the atoms that were relevant for the measured NMR shifts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reference structure in root mean squared deviation calculations were taken after initial thermalization but before any conformational changes were seen in the ligand layer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
