Kinase-independent role for CRAF-driving tumour radioresistance via CHK2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although oncology therapy regimens commonly include radiation and genotoxic drugs, tumour cells typically develop resistance to these interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that treatment of tumours with ionizing radiation or genotoxic drugs drives p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1)-mediated phosphorylation of CRAF on Serine 338 (pS338) triggering a kinase-independent mechanism of DNA repair and therapeutic resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRAF pS338 recruits CHK2, a cell cycle checkpoint kinase involved in DNA repair, and promotes CHK2 phosphorylation/activation to enhance the tumour cell DNA damage response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, a phospho-mimetic mutant of CRAF (S338D) is sufficient to induce the CRAF/CHK2 association enhancing tumour radioresistance, while an allosteric CRAF inhibitor sensitizes tumour cells to ionizing radiation or genotoxic drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings establish a role for CRAF in the DNA damage response that is independent from its canonical function as a kinase.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Oncogenic or stimulated RAS family GTPases are capable of triggering the growth and progression of a wide range of cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RAS activation drives critical downstream effectors (including PI3K, BRAF/CRAF and RAL) that not only potentiate tumour cell proliferation, and survival but also induce resistance to a wide range of therapeutics1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is not surprising that targeting RAS or its effectors can sensitize tumours to the effects of genotoxic stress5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the finding that CRAF becomes phosphorylated in response to ionizing radiation7, expression of CRAF anti-sense oligonucleotides leads to increased cellular radio-sensitivity8 and a liposomal formulation of the RAF anti-sense oligonucleotide LErafAON has shown promise when used in combination with radiation therapy for patients with advanced malignancies9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, targeting of RAF or MEK with multi-kinase inhibitors appears to provide sensitization in some cases10,11,12 but not others13,14, which may be due to the non-specific nature of kinase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to its well-known role as a kinase upstream of MEK, recent studies have uncovered a role for RAF as an adapter protein that is independent of its kinase activity15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRAF phosphorylation on Serine 338 (due to P21-activated kinases) promotes CRAF association with and inactivation of the pro-apoptotic kinases ASK1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16) and MST2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CRAF forms similar complexes with ROK- to drive cell motility18 and the cell cycle kinase PLK1 to drive cells through the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To perturb these kinase-independent functions of CRAF, we developed an allosteric inhibitor of CRAF designed to stabilize its inactive conformation and block CRAF phosphorylation on S338 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This agent prevents CRAF coupling to PLK1, leading to cell cycle arrest in mitosis19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the relationship between cell cycle progression and DNA repair21, we considered whether CRAF pS338 might influence the DNA damage response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report that exposing tumours to radiation or genotoxic drugs induces a p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1)-mediated phosphorylation of CRAF on S338, driving a complex between CRAF and CHK2 to promote DNA repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, inhibition of CRAF pS338 (but not its kinase activity) sensitizes tumour cells to radiation and genotoxic drugs by increasing the level of DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results highlight an opportunity to target this resistance mechanism to sensitize tumours to the DNA-damaging effects of cancer therapy, potentially lowering the chemotherapy or radiation dose required to achieve tumour killing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'CRAF protects cells from DNA damage', 'Given the well-established role for RAS activity in tumour cell resistance to therapy, we examined the relative contribution of the RAF family kinases BRAF and CRAF to radioresistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from BRAF/ or CRAF/ mice were exposed to radiation and monitored for DNA damage by examining the level of nuclear H2AX foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only those cells deficient in CRAF showed radiosensitivity (Fig 1a, Supplementary Fig 1a), suggesting that CRAF but not BRAF contributed to radioresistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extended these studies by knocking down either CRAF or BRAF in HCT-116 human colorectal adenocarcinoma and PANC-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and measured cell survival and DNA damage following irradiation (Fig 1b, Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In irradiated HCT-116 cells, knockdown of CRAF decreased cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, knockdown of CRAF in PANC-1 cells increased DNA damage as measured by neutral comet assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, knockdown of BRAF in HCT-116 and PANC-1 cells had no such effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CRAF was required for radioresistance, MEK inhibition did not result in radiosensitization consistently (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that, while CRAF protects cells from DNA damage, this function may not require CRAF kinase activity or MEK activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: CRAF pS338 is induced by genotoxic stress and protects tumour cells from DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Embryonic fibroblasts isolated from wild-type (WT), BRAF/ or CRAF/ mice were irradiated (6 Gy), and DNA damage was assessed using H2AX staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graph shows mean H2AX foci/cell±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for n=6 fields analysed per group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  * indicates P less_than 0.05 from two-sided t-test comparing WT and CRAF/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data shown are representative of two independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) HCT-116 cells were transfected with siRNA to BRAF and CRAF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were irradiated (2 Gy) and cell survival was measured using clonogenic survival assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Graph shows mean surviving fraction±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  * indicates P less_than 0.05 from two-sided t-test comparing si-CRAF to si-BRAF, si-CTRL or non-transfected with n=3 wells per group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data shown are representative of three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) HCT-116 cells treated with KG5 (1m) overnight, irradiated (6 Gy) and whole cell lysates collected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunoblotting to indicate phospho CRAF and BRAF sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data shown are representative of three independent experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Immunoblotting for pS338 CRAF following 6 Gy or 0.5 M etoposide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunostaining for CRAF pS338 (green) with dose range of IR in HCT-116 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 20 m.

damage triggers phosphorylation of CRAF on Serine 338', 'Recent studies indicate that CRAF phosphorylated on S338 potentiates cell cycle progression, cell survival and motility in a manner that is independent of its kinase activity15,16,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the relationship between cell cycle progression and DNA repair, we considered whether the DNA damage response might depend in part on CRAF pS338.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiation of HCT-116 or PANC-1 cells specifically resulted in increased pS338 CRAF relative to untreated cells (Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, other phosphorylation sites on CRAF such as, pS259, pS301 or BRAF pT599 did not increase in response to radiation treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, radiation treatment produced a strong dose-dependent induction of CRAF pS338 (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of HCT-116 and U87 (glioblastoma) cells with the DNA-damaging cancer therapy Etoposide produced a similar CRAF pS338 dose-dependent response, suggesting that CRAF becomes phosphorylated on S338 in response to genotoxic stress (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish the physiological relevance of these findings, HCT-116 tumour xenografts established in mice were locally irradiated with a single dose of 6 Gy ionizing radiation (IR), harvested 2 h later, sectioned and stained for CRAF pS338.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with our in vitro findings, tumours exposed to IR showed a marked increase in CRAF pS338 (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CRAF pS338 is necessary and sufficient for radioresistance', 'We previously described a type II allosteric RAF inhibitor that stabilizes RAF in the inactivate state, known as compound 6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20) or KG5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19) that inhibits CRAF pS338 in various cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, KG5 suppressed the radiation-induced CRAF pS338 cytoplasmic staining in HCT1-116 and PANC-1 cells (Fig 1c,f, Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other phosphorylation sites on CRAF and BRAF were diminished to some degree following treatment with KG5 which is not surprising considering the fact that KG5 is an allosteric inhibitor of RAF and blocks the dimerization of BRAF and CRAF20 thereby preventing co-activation of these molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While KG5 interferes with various phosphorylation sites on RAF, only CRAF pS338 is upregulated in response to IR (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a role for CRAF pS338 in radioresistance, treatment of HCT-116 and PANC-1 cells with KG5 not only decreased clonogenic survival in response to IR, but it also markedly enhanced the DNA damage response as detected by an increased comet tail length and H2AX foci formation (Fig 1g, Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To validate the role of CRAF pS338 in radioresistance, HCT-116 cells expressing a phospho-mimetic mutant of CRAF (S338D) or full-length wild-type (WT) CRAF were exposed to IR and examined for cell survival and DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of CRAF S338D protected cells from IR-induced damage compared with cells expressing WT CRAF (Fig 2a, Supplementary Fig 5), suggesting that CRAF pS338 is sufficient to promote radioresistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate this finding in vivo, mice were implanted with HCT-116 tumours (expressing either WT or S338D CRAF) on bilateral flanks, and only the right flank was subjected to localized 6 Gy radiation on days 5, 7 and 9 after tumour implantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While irradiation inhibited the growth of tumours expressing WT CRAF, tumours expressing CRAF S338D continued to grow (Fig 2b) indicating that the phospho-mimetic CRAF mutant is sufficient to protect tumours from radiation damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Accumulating evidence suggests that CRAF operates in a kinase-independent (and therefore MEK independent) manner to influence cellular behaviour by functioning as a molecular scaffold15,16,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, CRAF phosphorylation on S338 appears to contribute to CRAF scaffolding function15,16,19, leading to enhanced tumour cell proliferation19 and a significant decrease in the survival of breast cancer patients34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this concept of a kinase-independent scaffolding function of CRAF, the DNA damage response mediated by CHK2 appears to depend on CRAF pS338 but not its kinase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CHK2 activity depended in part on its capacity to couple to CRAF pS338, however, CHK2 activation and DNA repair were not inhibited by a kinase-dead form of CRAF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to traditional RAF inhibitors that target its ATP-binding pocket to block MEK/ERK signalling, KG5 is an allosteric CRAF inhibitor that suppresses CRAF thereby disrupting its scaffolding function to produce a significant impact cell cycle progression19, and as shown here, the DNA damage response (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While KG5 does not possess PK properties sufficient for clinical development, our results highlight the potential of such drugs as a new class of agents with the capacity to sensitize tumours to genotoxic therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have identified PAK1 as the upstream kinase that, in response to genotoxic stress, is activated and phosphorylates S338 on CRAF leading to DNA repair in a CHK2-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PAKs respond to growth factor and integrin ligation, and their activity leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton necessary for cell migration and invasion35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PAK family members have been reported to be overexpressed and or deregulated in cancers and have been linked to the DNA damage response pathway37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, PAK1 phosphorylation and activation in response to IR have been linked to ATM, a key regulator of the DNA damage response, and microarray expression profiling has revealed that the primary group of genes regulated by PAK1 in response to DNA damage is involved in cell cycle progression35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is not surprising that DNA repair is intimately linked to cell cycle progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On exposure to genotoxic stress, activation of various checkpoint proteins helps to ensures DNA will be repaired prior to resumption of the cell cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is of paramount importance during mitosis, as unrepaired DNA damage would be propagated to daughter cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, sensitivity to IR varies throughout the cell cycle with the G2/M phase being the most radiosensitive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These concepts are consistent with the roles we have uncovered for CRAF in coordinating cell progression by activation of PLK1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19) and DNA damage repair via CHK2, both of which depend on pS338 and operate in a kinase-independent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localization of CRAF pS338 at the spindle pole and its association with PLK1 may limit its potential for interaction with CHK2, thereby further contributing to the increased radiosensitivity of cells undergoing mitosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A number of studies have revealed the RAF inhibitor paradox in which CRAF is activated and tumour growth enhanced for tumours with activating mutations in KRAS but not BRAF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has become clear that ATP mimetic inhibitors of RAF drive dimerization of WT BRAF and CRAF, lead to phosphorylation of CRAF on serine 338, potentiate the MEK/ERK pathway and thereby contribute to the observed increase in tumour growth38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, while genetic knockdown of CRAF enhances cancer sensitivity to IR, pharmacologically targeting CRAF with ATP mimetic inhibitors often fails to radiosensitize tumours9,12,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike typical RAF inhibitors that target the ATP-binding pocket, the allosteric RAF inhibitor KG5 acts in a kinase-independent manner to block the dimerization of BRAF/CRAF and phosphorylation of CRAF on S338 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By virtue of their ability to induce cell cycle arrest in G2/M by targeting PLK1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19), and to dampen the DNA repair response through the inhibition of CHK2 activity, allosteric RAF inhibitors such as KG5 would be expected to have a broad application for the sensitization of genetically diverse tumours to the effects of cancer therapies such as ionizing radiation or etoposide that function by inducing genotoxic stress.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
