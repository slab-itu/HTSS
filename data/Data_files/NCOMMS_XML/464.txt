Eigenspectra optoacoustic tomography achieves quantitative blood oxygenation imaging deep in tissues  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Light propagating in tissue attains a spectrum that varies with location due to wavelength-dependent fluence attenuation, an effect that causes spectral corruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectral corruption has limited the quantification accuracy of optical and optoacoustic spectroscopic methods, and impeded the goal of imaging blood oxygen saturation (sO2) deep in tissues; a critical goal for the assessment of oxygenation in physiological processes and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe light fluence in the spectral domain and introduce eigenspectra multispectral optoacoustic tomography (eMSOT) to account for wavelength-dependent light attenuation, and estimate blood sO2 within deep tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validate eMSOT in simulations, phantoms and animal measurements and spatially resolve sO2 in muscle and tumours, validating our measurements with histology data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  eMSOT shows substantial sO2 accuracy enhancement over previous optoacoustic methods, potentially serving as a valuable tool for imaging tissue pathophysiology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The assessment of tissue oxygenation is crucial for understanding tissue physiology and characterizing a multitude of conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer hypoxia1 or metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Today, measurements of the partial pressure of oxygen in tissue (pO2) and hypoxia measurements remain challenging and often rely on invasive methods that may change the tissue physiology, such as single-point needle polarography or immunohistochemistry2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-invasive imaging methods have been also considered, underscoring the importance of assessing pO2, but come with limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography assess cell hypoxia through the administration of radioactive tracers2, but are often not well suited for quantifying pO2, suffer from low-spatial resolution and are unable to provide longitudinal or dynamic-imaging capabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron paramagnetic resonance imaging3 can measure tissue pO2, but is not widely used and offers limited spatial and temporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imaging methods using tracers may be further limited by restricted tracer bio-distribution, in particular to hypoxic areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tracer-free modalities have also been researched, in particular blood-oxygen-level dependent MRI4, which however primarily assesses only deoxygenated haemoglobin and, therefore, presents challenges in quantifying oxygenation and blood volume5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Measurement of blood oxygen saturation levels (sO2) is a vital tissue physiology measurement and can provide an alternative way to infer pO2 and hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arterial sO2 is widely assessed by the pulse oximeter, but this technology cannot be applied to measurements other than arterial blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical microscopy methods like phosphorescence quenching microscopy6 or optoacoustic (photoacoustic) microscopy7 can visualize oxygenation in blood vessels and capillaries but are restricted to superficial ( less_than 1â€‰mm depth) measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffuse optical methods received significant attention in the last two decades for sensing and imaging oxy- and deoxygenated haemoglobin deeper in tissue8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite recent progress9, diffuse optical methods are inherently limited in spatial resolution and accuracy, due to photon scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the high heterogeneity of blood sO2 in tissue, the values reported by diffuse optical methods are often hard to interpret.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) detects the spectra of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin in high resolution deep within tissues, since signal detection and image reconstruction are not significantly affected by photon scattering10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the principal MSOT suitability for non-invasive imaging of blood oxygenation, accuracy remains limited by the dependence of light fluence on depth and light colour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless explicitly accounted for, the wavelength-dependent light fluence attenuation with depth alters the spectral features detected and results in inaccurate estimates of blood sO212,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite at least two decades of research in optical imaging, the problem of light fluence correction has not been conclusively solved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To date, this problem has been primarily studied from an optical property quantification point of view13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not possible today to accurately image tissue optical properties in vivo, in high resolution, and compute light fluence13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, quantitative sO2 measurement deep in tissue in vivo remains an unmet challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventional spectral optoacoustic methods15,16 typically ignore the effects of light fluence and employ linear spectral fitting with the spectra of oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin for estimating sO2 (linear unmixing), a common simplification that can introduce substantial errors in deep tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we found that the spectral patterns of light fluence expected within the tissue can be modelled as an affine function of a few reference base spectra, independently of the specific distribution of tissue optical properties or the depth of the observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show how this principle can be employed to solve the spectral corruption problem without knowledge of the tissue optical properties, and significantly increase the accuracy of spectral optoacoustic methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proposed method, termed eigenspectra Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (eMSOT), can provide quantitative estimation of blood sO2 in deep tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the superior performance of the method with  greater than 2,000 simulations, phantom measurements and in vivo controlled experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, using eMSOT, we image oxygen gradients in the skeletal muscle in vivo, previously only accessible through invasive methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we show the application of eMSOT in quantifying blood oxygenation gradients in tumours during tumour growth or O2 challenge, and relate label-free non-invasive eMSOT readings to tumour hypoxia; demonstrating the ability to measure quantitatively the perfusion hypoxia level in tumours, as confirmed with invasive histological gold standards.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'eMSOT concept and application', 'A new concept of treating light fluence in diffusive media/tissues is introduced, based on the observation that the light fluence spectrum at different locations in tissue is the result of a cumulative light absorption operation by tissue chromophores, such as haemoglobin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We, therefore, hypothesized that there exists a small number of base spectra that can be combined to predict any fluence spectrum present in tissue; therefore, avoiding the unattainable task of knowing the distribution of tissue optical properties at high resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To prove this hypothesis, we first applied principal component analysis (PCA) on 1,470 light fluence spectral patterns, which were computed by simulating light propagation in tissues at 21 different (uniform) oxygenation states of haemoglobin and 70 different discrete depths (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCA analysis yielded four significant base spectra, that is, a mean light fluence spectrum (Fig 1a) and three fluence Eigenspectra (Fig 1bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCA was used due to its optimality in modelling the spectral variability of light fluence in a linear manner (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the selection of three Eigenspectra offers a simple model with relatively high-modelling accuracy (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: eMSOT concept and application.

Supplementary Note 3).Full size image', 'We then postulated that light fluence spectra in arbitrary and non-uniform tissues can be modelled as a superposition of the mean fluence spectrum (M) and the three Eigenspectra (i(), i=1..3) multiplied by appropriate scalars m1, m2 and m3, termed Eigenfluence parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate this hypothesis we computed the light fluence in  greater than 500 simulated tissue structures of different and non-uniform optical properties and haemoglobin oxygenation values (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each pixel, we fitted the simulated light fluence spectrum to the Eigenspectra model and derived the Eigenfluence parameters (m1, m2, m3) and a fitting residual value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The residual value represents the error of the Eigenspectra model in matching the simulated data and typically assumed values below 1% (see Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig 1), indicating that three Eigenspectra can accurately model all simulated fluence spectra generated in tissues of arbitrary structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further observed that the values of m2 vary primarily with tissue depth while the values of m1, m3 also depend on the average levels of background blood sO2 (see Fig 1fh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intuitively, this indicates that the second Eigenspectrum 2() is mainly associated with the modifications of the light fluence spectrum due to depth and the average optical properties of the surrounding tissue, while the first Eigenspectrum 1() is also associated with the spectral shape of light fluence that relates to the average oxygenation of the surrounding tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Localized measurements of light fluence spectra obtained in vivo and post mortem corroborated these observations (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Following these observations, we propose eigenspectra MSOT (eMSOT), based on three eigenspectra 1(), 2(), 3(), as a method that formulates the blood sO2 estimation problem as a nonlinear spectral unmixing problem (see Methods), that is:', '', 'where P(r,) is the multispectral optoacoustic image intensity obtained at a position r and wavelength ,  and Hb() are the wavelength-dependent molar extinction coefficients of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin,  and cHb(r) are the relative concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin (proportional to the actual ones with regard to a common scaling factor, see Methods), and (r, )=M()+m1(r)1()+m2(r)2()+m3(r)3().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equation (1) defines a nonlinear inversion problem, requiring measurements at 5 wavelengths or more for recovering the five unknowns, that is, , cHb(r), m1(r), m2(r), m3(r) and is solved as a constrained optimization problem (see Methods, Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the light fluence varies smoothly in tissue, we only compute the Eigenfluence parameters on a coarse grid subsampling the region of interest (Fig 1i), for computational efficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, cubic interpolation is employed to compute the Eigenfluence parameters in each pixel within the convex hull of the grid (Fig 1j) and calculate a fluence spectrum (r, ) for each pixel using these parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equation (1) is then solved for  and cHb(r), and sO2 is computed (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The performance of eMSOT was validated using simulated data obtained from a light propagation model (finite element solution of the diffusion equation) applied on  greater than 2,000 randomly created maps of different optical properties, simulating different tissue physiological states (Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1k depicts a representative example of a simulated blood sO2 map and visually showcases the differences between the eMSOT sO2 image (middle), the sO2 image obtained using linear unmixing (left), and the original sO2 simulated image (right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  eMSOT offered significantly lower sO2 estimation error with depth, compared with the linear fitting method (Fig 1l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A substantially improved sO2 estimation accuracy was observed using eMSOT over linear unmixing when we analysed the complete simulation data set (Fig 1m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, for imaging tissue depths of  greater than 5â€‰mm eMSOT offered a 38-fold sO2 estimation improvement over linear unmixing (Supplementary Fig 4n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A thorough validation of eMSOT performance across different data sets, optical properties and grid densities is presented in Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For experimentally assessing the accuracy of eMSOT, we performed a series of blood phantom experiments that suggest an up to 10-fold more reliable sO2 estimation derived by eMSOT, as compared with conventional linear unmixing (Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, controlled mouse measurements (n=4) were performed in vivo, under gas anaesthesia, by rectally inserting capillary tubes containing blood at 100 and 0% sO2 levels (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice were imaged in the

muscle and tumour', 'Blood oxygenation and oxygen exchange in the microcirculation have been traditionally studied through invasive, single-point polarography or microscopy measurements in vessels and capillaries of the skeletal muscle17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research for macroscopic methods that could non-invasively resolve muscle oxygenation was broadly pursued in the past two decades by considering near-infrared spectroscopy and diffuse optical tomography, which, however can only report bulk tissue sO2 values18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a next set of experiments we, therefore, studied whether eMSOT could non-invasively quantify the oxygenation gradient in the skeletal muscle, and we compared this performance to conventional spectral optoacoustic methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  eMSOT was applied in the area of the hindlimb muscle of mice undergoing an O2 challenge as described in Supplementary Note 5 (n=6 animal experiments); three of the mice were then killed with an overdose of CO2, the latter

unmixing for comparison (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the post-mortem case, linear unmixing overestimated the sO2 as a function of tissue depth (Fig 3e) and yielded large errors in matching the tissue

venous blood saturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, previous studies based on direct microscopy measurements in vessels and capillaries through polarography, haemoglobin spectrophotometry and phosphorescence quenching microscopy have revealed similar oxygenation gradient in the skeletal muscle17 with haemoglobin saturation in the femoral artery found to range between 87 and 99% sO217,20, while rapidly dropping down to 5060% sO2 in smaller arterioles20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average oxygen saturation in venules and veins has been found to range between 45% and 60% sO2 under normal breathing conditions, reaching up to 70% at 100% O2 breathing21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Average capillary blood oxygenation has been estimated at 40% sO2 with a large standard deviation22, often reported lower, at an average, than venular oxygenation17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the eMSOT values measured at ROI-1 possibly relate to a weighted average of arterial/arteriolar and venous/venular sO2 in the skeletal muscle, while the values measured at ROI-2, which anatomically presents no prominent vasculature, relate more to capillary sO2 measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The improved accuracy observed in eMSOT over previous approaches and general agreement with invasive tissue measurements prompted the further study of perfusion hypoxia emerging from the incomplete delivery of oxygenated haemoglobin in tissue areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that measurements of blood saturation could be employed as a measure of tissue hypoxia, assuming natural haemoglobin presence in hypoxic areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine this hypothesis, we applied eMSOT to measure blood oxygenation in 4T1 solid tumours orthotopically implanted in the mammary pad of eight mice (Methods, Supplementary Note 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSOT revealed the tumour anatomy and eMSOT exposed tumour heterogeneity, which was found consistent to anatomical features identified through cryoslice colour photography and haematoxil and eosin staining (Supplementary Note 6, Supplementary Fig 7cg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, imaging tumours at different time-points revealed the progression of hypoxia during tumour growth (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spread of hypoxia, that is, the percentage of the hypoxic area (area presenting sO2 values below a threshold which varied from 50 to 25% sO2) over the total tumour area also increased during tumour progression (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the in vivo measurements we harvested the tumour tissue and related the non-invasive eMSOT findings to the

perfusion) and Pimonidazole24 (indicating cell hypoxia).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results indicated close correspondence between the hypoxic areas detected by eMSOT using haemoglobin as a hypoxia sensor (Fig 4b) and the histology slices (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that eMSOT could not only quantitatively distinguish between high- and low-hypoxia levels in the tumours, but the spatial sO2 maps further presented congruence with the spatial appearance of hypoxia spread and reduced perfusion seen in the histology slices (Fig 4eg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A quantitative congruence analysis is shown in

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Spectral corruption has so far limited the potential of optical and optoacoustic methods to offer accurate, quantitative assessment of sO2 deep inside tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventional computational methods in optical imaging propose to invert a light transport operator to recover tissue optical properties (absorption and scattering)13; then use these properties for calculating tissue physiological parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the very-high numerical complexity and ill-posed nature of the inversion problem has not allowed so far accurate, high-resolution sO2 imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hereby followed an alternative approach that describes the spectral features of light fluence as a combination of spectral base functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this principle, we formulated the sO2 quantification problem as a nonlinear spectral unmixing problem that does not require knowledge of tissue optical properties or the inversion of a light transport operator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effectively, eMSOT converts sO2 imaging from a problem that is spatially dependent on light propagation and optical properties, as common in traditional optical methods, to a problem solved in the spectral domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, sO2 can be directly quantified without estimating tissue optical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'eMSOT requires theoretically at least five excitation wavelengths for resolving spectral domain parameters and the relative oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hereby utilized 21 wavelengths for ensuring high accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent evolution of video-rate MSOT imaging systems, based on fast tuning optical parametric oscillator lasers25, allows the practical implementation of the method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern MSOT systems offer five wavelength scans at 20â€‰Hz or better.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore eMSOT is a technology that optimally interfaces to a new generation of fast and handheld spectral optoacoustic systems26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The method developed demonstrated quantitative, non-invasive blood oxygenation images in phantoms and tissues in vivo (muscle and tumour) in high resolution, showing good correlation with the expected physiological state or the histologically observed spatial distribution of perfusion and hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  eMSOT measures blood oxygenation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that a correlation exists to tissue oxygenation and hypoxia measurements by assuming a wide presence of haemoglobin in tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated congruence (Supplementary Note 6) between traditional invasive histological assays resolving tissue hypoxia and eMSOT analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, not only average values are resolved, but there is a close spatial correspondence between hypoxia patterns resolved by eMSOT non-invasively and histological analysis (Fig 4, Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High-resolution non-invasive imaging of blood oxygenation across entire tissues and tumours offers novel abilities in studying physiological and pathological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This goal has

that it is insensitive to scaling factors such as the GrÃ¼neisen coefficient or the spatial sensitivity field of the imaging system (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, due to its scale invariance
