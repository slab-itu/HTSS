Autophagy initiation by ULK complex assembly on ER tubulovesicular regions marked by ATG9 vesicles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Autophagosome formation requires sequential translocation of autophagy-specific proteins to membranes enriched in PI3P and connected to the ER.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preceding this, the earliest autophagy-specific structure forming de novo is a small punctum of the ULK1 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The provenance of this structure and its mode of formation are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the ULK1 structure emerges from regions, where ATG9 vesicles align with the ER and its formation requires ER exit and coatomer function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Super-resolution microscopy reveals that the ULK1 compartment consists of regularly assembled punctate elements that cluster in progressively larger spherical structures and associates uniquely with the early autophagy machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlative electron microscopy after live imaging shows tubulovesicular membranes present at the locus of this structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the nucleation of autophagosomes occurs in regions, where the ULK1 complex coalesces with ER and the ATG9 compartment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Autophagy is the membrane trafficking pathway that delivers intracellular material for degradation to lysosomes via de novo formation of double-membrane vesicles, the autophagosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells activate autophagy in response to nutrient limitation or accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles, and as a result they recycle building blocks generated in lysosomes into new macromolecules and sub-cellular structures1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unsurprisingly, autophagy has implications for ageing and associated diseases, such as neurodegeneration, inflammation and cancer2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Autophagy also underpins physiological functions, such as development, cell differentiation and immunity6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Autophagosome formation requires a protein machinery to act upon a membrane source, organize it into a flat sheet, expand it and finally fuse its extremities to enclose the cytosolic cargo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yeast genetics have identified  greater than 30 autophagy-related (Atg) genes encoding the core autophagy machinery, most of which are conserved in mammals3,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protein machinery is organized into functional complexes that carry out the steps of autophagosome formation3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In brief, scarcity of amino acids inactivates mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) and releases the repression of a functional complex, including the protein kinase ULK1, which then translocates to membranes (initiation step).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ULK1 activates the functional complex, including the lipid kinase VPS34, stimulating the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and the formation of an omegasome (nucleation step).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The omegasomes are membrane platforms in contact with endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the remaining core machinery is recruited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes vesicles of ATG9, the only transmembrane autophagy protein, and two conjugation systems, ultimately leading to the covalent attachment of the small ubiquitin-like protein LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine (lipidation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LC3, the signature protein of autophagosomes, promotes the expansion of the autophagosomal membrane (also known as isolation membrane, elongation step), and its closure and fusion with the lysosome (maturation step).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The characterization of the membrane source that drives the nucleation and elongation of autophagosomes has proven so far to be more elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is generally accepted that more than one membrane sources are likely to be involved in the different steps of autophagosome formation, including the ER, mitochondria, mitochondria-associated membranes, the Golgi, the plasma membrane and recycling endosomes8,9,10,11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts to identify this membrane source have focused on two fronts: the co-localization of the autophagic machinery with pre-existing organelles and the characterization of the membrane compartment that hosts ATG9, the only transmembrane autophagy protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the pre-existing organelles, autophagosomes induced by amino-acid starvation emerge adjacent to ER; however, the mechanistic contribution of this arrangement has remained unknown8,12,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that the autophagic machinery associates with two ER-associated membrane compartments: the ER exit sites (ERES) and the ERGolgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)19,20,21,22,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ERES are sites where proteins trafficked to Golgi are packaged into coat protein complex I (COPII)-coated carriers, creating an adjacent collection of vesiculartubular structures that constitutes the ERGIC25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, the Rab GTPase Rab1/Ypt1, which is required for the ER-to-Golgi trafficking, also promotes autophagy26,27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A second possibility is that the ER coordinates the redistribution of the ATG9 compartment during autophagy14,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Ypt1 binds to Atg9 (refs 29, 33), one of the first proteins recruited at the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS), promoting the recruitment of downstream proteins14,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the mammalian ATG9 colocalizes at the some point of its life cycle with the ULK1 complex13,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The recruitment of the ULK1 complex confers to the earliest autophagy-specific structure forming de novo its autophagic character.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterizing the provenance and mode of formation of this structure though has proven to be challenging: it is a short-lived intermediate that has not yet acquired the characteristic double-membrane crescent shape identified by electron microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we take a comprehensive imaging-based approach to address where the ULK1 complex nucleates autophagosome formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that both ERES/ERGIC and ATG9 are functionally important for the nucleation of autophagosomes, though ATG9 vesicles are more frequently observed in association with the earliest detectable autophagy structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We develop for the first time a protocol for direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM) of autophagy-related structures and we observe the autophagic machinery in combination with the ERES/ERGIC and ATG9 compartments at sub-diffraction resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that ATG13 decorates a unique compartment that associates with small vesicles of ATG9 or ERGIC, but not with the conventional ERES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), we find that the ATG13 structures correspond to a tubulovesicular compartment surrounded by ER and mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that new autophagosomes nucleate in regions, where the ULK1 complex coalesces with the ER and vesicles of ATG9.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

also complicate the efforts to identify the cellular organelles comprising the membrane source for autophagosome nucleation48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We developed a protocol for dSTORM to observe the autophagosome precursors and how they associate with the ATG9 and ERGIC compartments at super resolution for the first time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In starved cells, the ATG13 puncta corresponded to pleiomorphic structures no more than 300 nm in diameter, with ATG13 distributed on a granular pattern, as if it resided on distinct vesicles or focal points on a flat membrane (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ATG13 dots were further organized in four distinct patterns: crescent shaped (a), semi-spherical (b), quasi-spherical (c) and spherical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They showed a bias towards the outside of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have tried to identify where the ULK1 complex nucleates autophagosomes using as main surrogate the component of the complex ATG13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that both ERES/ERGIC and ATG9 compartments are functionally contributing to autophagosome nucleation, but ATG9 associates more ubiquitously with the early ULK1 structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have used super-resolution microscopy to capture the morphology of the ATG13 compartment and its relationship with the autophagic machinery and the ERES/ERGIC and ATG9 compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show for the first time at super resolution that the ATG13 compartment associates with clusters of ATG9 vesicles or with isolated elements of ERGIC, which cannot be resolved by conventional light microscopy, but rarely with ERES.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, combining light with electron microscopy we correlate the ATG13 early punctum with a tubulovesicular membrane compartment surrounded by ER and mitochondria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This compartment is compatible with the tubulovesicular ATG9 compartment previously described14,32,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, building up on our previous study16, we combine several imaging modes (dual-colour SIM and dSTORM and CLEM) to describe the association of the ATG13 structures with the ER at sub-diffraction resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining everything we suggest that the nucleation of autophagosomes occurs in regions, where the ULK1 complex coalesces with ER and the ATG9 compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have shown that the associating ULK1 and ATG9 structures previously reported13,32,53 comprise multiple ATG9 vesicles  less_than 50 nm in diameter swarming around the ATG13 puncta (Fig 7a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structures may also correspond to the tubulovesicular compartment observed by electron microscopy (Fig 10g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between ATG9 and early ATG13 structures is independent of PI3P synthesis (Fig 7a,c), as previously reported54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, where no isolation membrane is evident, the ATG13 assemblies already begin to assume quasi-spherical morphology (Fig 6a; starved+inh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our opinion, this is strong evidence that some of the membrane organization function necessary for autophagosome formation exists within the ULK1 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the capacity of yeast ULK1 to bind highly curved vesicles similar with ATG9 vesicles55 and the phosphorylation cascades underpinning activation of the complex during autophagy56, this arrangement is possibly self-propelled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that this type of association between ATG9 and the early ATG13 structures may suggest that the ULK1 complex usurps membrane from the ATG9 compartment to nucleate a new autophagosome, while ATG9 only transiently incorporates to the autophagosome membrane as it was previously shown53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, inactivation of the yeast ULK1 complex causes the tubulovesicular ATG9 compartment to resolve into distinct vesicles14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A layered network of interactions that may bring the yeast ULK1 complex in gradually closer proximity to the ATG9 compartment was also recently suggested57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ULK1 structures also adjoin ER and overlap with scattered ERGIC-derived vesicles, but not with the canonical ERES/ERGIC vesicular clusters (Figs 7 and 8), even if their assembly is facilitated by the functional integrity of ERES (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Why is the ER-to-Golgi traffic required for ATG13 puncta formation, but these puncta do not localize on canonical ERES?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that the canonical ERES/ERGIC may affect the ATG13 indirectly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-free assays have recently shown that ERGIC membranes recruit the component of the VPS34 complex ATG14 and, in PI3P- and COPII-dependent manner, generate the membrane template for LC3 lipidation23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, ERGIC may affect the ATG13 indirectly through activation of the VPS34 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of a positive feedback loop from the VPS34 complex that reinforces the translocation of ATG13 to its early structures is compatible with this hypothesis16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The yeast autophagic machinery occupies distinct sites on forming autophagosomes22,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using super-resolution microscopy of endogenous autophagy proteins, we here provide a spatial context of the physical and functional interactions among the autophagic machinery in mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We can distinguish at least two layers of components: a layer at the autophagosome periphery comprising the PI3P effectors (and potentially the VPS34 complex), and an inner layer comprising the ULK1 complex (ATG13 and FIP200) and the lipidation machinery (ATG16; Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This arrangement should allow ATG16 to interact with WIPI2 and FIP200 (refs 58, 59) and LC3 to accumulate within the DFCP1 ring8,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with this spatial arrangement, disruption of ATG16 binding to FIP200 inhibits autophagy60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have suggested that SNARE-mediated fusion of vesicles is involved in autophagosome expansion11,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that if the elongation of the isolation membrane occurs through vesicle fusion at its extremities, this arrangement is compatible with membrane handover from the PI3P-rich area to the area hosting the ULK1 complex and the lipidation machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our aim was to understand the provenance and mode of formation of the early ULK1 structure to identify where autophagosomes are nucleated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of our findings, we suggest that upon mTOR inactivation and the subsequent phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascades driven by alterations in the ULK1 kinase activity, the ULK1 complex clusters on tubulovesicular elements made up of ER tubules and ATG9 vesicles, with some contribution from ERGIC/ERES vesicles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that this structure, which can be thought of as an autophagy-specific ERES and already takes on a quasi-spherical shape, is the origin of autophagosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, the VPS34 complex would generate PI3P enriched membranes that enable the original structure to expand and to attract the lipidation machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, traffic from the nearby ERGIC and ERES would ensure additional supply of membranes and the translocation and activation of the lipidation machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this stage, we imagine that the growing phagophore could functionally interact with additional membrane compartments (mitochondria, endosomes, plasma membrane and so on) for expansion and maturation, as recently shown by advanced immunolabelling and electron microscopy techniques61.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

to capture images of live cells: a CellR imaging system (Olympus) and a Nikon Ti-E-based system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were plated onto 60 mm dishes and transiently transfected with the relevant plasmids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next day the transfected cells were transferred onto 22 mm diameter glass coverslips (BDH) and on the third day the individual coverslips were secured in an imaging

correspond to the formation and collapse of one GFP-ATG13 particle, starting and finishing with the frames in which the fluorescence of the GFP-Atg13 particle is emerging clearly above the fluorescence of the cytosolic GFP-ATG13 (for example, Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frames corresponding to time points before the beginning or after the end of a particular event were carefully scanned,

markers, the same coordinates were used to create montages of the other markers and composite images of the two channels were created to analyse the co-localization of the two proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines were drawn crossing the sites of closest association (judged by eye in large magnification) and line plots of the fluorescence intensity were used to decide on association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

sample was (in mW) 4.1, 27.3 and 65.3 for the 405, 561 and 643 nm lasers, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images 256 × 256 pixels (0.16 m per px) were captured at a frame rate of 55 fps with the camera conversion gain set to 2.4 and the electron microscopy gain typically set at 100.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least 15,000 frames were captured per field of view, with the laser illumination switching alternately for dual-labelling experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Laser power of 405 nm was ramped during the image capture to maintain blinking frequency as determined by the Nikon software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  dSTORM images were reconstructed using Nikon Elements software, starting the analysis from a frame where only isolated blinks were observed across the whole field of view (no residual continuous signal could be seen).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of molecules was typically done using default blink identification parameters within the Nikon software, using Minimum Heigth threshold of 750.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatic alignment of dSTORM images from dual-labelled samples was ensured by calibrating the system using a slide with 100 nmTetraspeck beads (Life Technologies) and following the chromatic calibration procedure in the Nikon software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Channel crosstalk was excluded by running control experiments, in which the samples were labelled with secondary antibody only for the one channel and images were captured in the other channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resolution of our system was determined using dSTORM images of test samples (microtubules) under imaging conditions similar to those described here, in which we have been able to resolve objects separated by a distance of  less_than 30 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the regions of interest, shown localization precision of the identified molecules, as estimated by the N-STORM module of the Nikon software67, were typically 59 nm (CF568) and 310 nm (AF647).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identified molecules are displayed as a Gaussian spot of diameter 5 nm with an intensity profile proportionate to the localization precision (spots with a higher precision of localization appear brighter).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To filter out identified molecules that did not correspond to the puncta observed by conventional light microscopy, the density was adjusted to 5060 counts per 100 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'dSTORM topology analysis',
