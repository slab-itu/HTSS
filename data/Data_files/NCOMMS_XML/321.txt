Interplanar coupling-dependent magnetoresistivity in high-purity layered metals  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The magnetic field-induced changes in the conductivity of metals are the subject of intense interest, both for revealing new phenomena and as a valuable tool for determining their Fermi surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report a hitherto unobserved magnetoresistive effect in ultra-clean layered metals, namely a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance that is capable of overcoming their very pronounced orbital one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is correlated with the interlayer coupling disappearing for fields applied along the so-called Yamaji angles where the interlayer coupling vanishes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is intrinsically associated with the Fermi points in the field-induced quasi-one-dimensional electronic dispersion, implying that it results from the axial anomaly among these Fermi points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In its original formulation, the anomaly is predicted to violate separate number conservation laws for left- and right-handed chiral (for example, Weyl) fermions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its observation in PdCoO2, PtCoO2 and Sr2RuO4 suggests that the anomaly affects the transport of clean conductors, in particular near the quantum limit.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The magnetoconductivity or -resistivity of metals under a uniform magnetic field 0H (0 is the permeability of free space) is highly dependent on the precise shape of their Fermi surface (FS) and on the orientation of the current flow relative to the external applied field H1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly true for high-purity metals at low temperatures, whose carriers may execute many cyclotronic orbits in between scattering events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the description of the magnetoconductivity of real systems in terms of the Boltzmann equation including the Lorentz force, the electronic dispersion and realistic scattering potentials is an incredibly daunting task, whose approximate solutions can only be obtained through over simplifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the inherent difficulty in describing the magnetoresistivity of metallic or semi-metallic systems, it continues to be a subject of intense interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in recent years, a number of new magnetoresistance phenomena have been uncovered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, although semi-classical transport theory predicts a magnetoresistivity (0H)(0H)2, certain compounds such as -Ag2Te display a linear, non-saturating magnetoresistivity3, which is ascribed to the quantum magnetoresistive scenario4, associated with linearly dispersing Dirac-like bands5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in semi-metals characterized by a bulk Dirac dispersion and extremely high electron mobilities such as Cd3As2, the linear magnetoresistivity develops a weak (0H)2 term as the quality of the sample increases6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its enormous magnetoresistivity is claimed to result from the suppression of a certain protection against backscattering channels6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The semi-metal WTe2 was also found to display a very large and non-saturating magnetoresistivity, which is (0H)2 under fields up to 60 T. This behaviour was ascribed to a nearly perfect compensation between the densities of electrons and holes7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent times, a series of compounds were proposed to be candidate Weyl semi-metals characterized by a linear touching between the valence and the conduction bands at several points (Weyl points) of their Brillouin zone8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These Weyl points are predicted to lead to a pronounced negative magnetoresistivity for electric fields aligned along a magnetic field due to the so-called axial anomaly9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we unveil the observation of yet another magnetoresistive effect, namely a pronounced negative magnetoresistivity in extremely clean and non-magnetic layered metals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We study the delafossite-type PtCoO2 and PdCoO2 compounds, which are characterized by a single FS sheet and, as with Cd3As2, can display residual resistivities on the order of a just few tenths of n cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given its extremely low level of disorder, for specific field orientations along which the interlayer coupling vanishes, PdCoO2 can display a very pronounced positive magnetoresistivity that exceeds 550,000% for 0H35 T and for currents along the interlayer axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, as soon as the field is rotated away from these specific orientations and as the field increases, this large orbital effect is overwhelmed by the emergence of a pronounced negative magnetoresistivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For fields along the interlayer direction, a strong longitudinal negative magnetoresistivity is observed from 0H=0 T to fields all the way up to 0H=35 T. Very similar behaviour is observed in the PtCoO2 compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the correlated Sr2RuO4, the longitudinal negative magnetoresistivity effect is also observable but only in the cleanest samples, that is, those displaying the highest superconducting transition temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that this effect might result from the axial anomaly between Fermi points in a field-induced, quasi-one-dimensional electronic dispersion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Observation of an anomalous longitudinal magnetoresistivity', 'As shown in Fig 1a, PdCoO2 crystallizes in the space group , which results from the stacking of monatomic triangular layers11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthesis of PdCoO2 single crystals is described in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to band structure calculations12,13,14, the Fermi level EF is placed between the filled t2g and the empty eg levels with the Pd triangular planes dominating the conductivity and leading to its highly anisotropic transport properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported room temperature in-plane resistivity is just 2.6  cm, making PdCoO2 perhaps the most conductive oxide known to date15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b,c show the configuration of contacts used for measuring the longitudinal magnetoresistivity of all compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  de Haas van Alphen measurements15 reveal a single, corrugated and nearly two-dimensional FS with a rounded hexagonal cross-section, in broad agreement with both band structure calculations12,13,14 and angle-resolved photoemission measurements16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  de Haas van Alphen yields an average Fermi wave vector  m1or an average Fermi velocity  m s1 (where 1.5 is the carrier effective mass15 in units of free electron mass).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent measurements of interplanar magnetoresistivity c(0H) reveal an enormous enhancement for fields along the  direction, that is, increasing by 35,000% at 2 K under 0H=14 T, which does not follow the characteristic (0H)(0H)2 dependence at higher fields17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour can be reproduced qualitatively by semi-classical calculations, assuming a very small scattering rate17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most single crystals display in-plane residual resistivities ab0 ranging from only 10 up to 40 n cm, which correspond to transport lifetimes  ranging from

However, at 0H=35 T, c/0 decreases by one order of magnitude as 0H is rotated by just 0.3° with respect to n=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as seen in Fig 5d, at higher fields c displays a cross-over from a very pronounced and positive to a negative magnetoresistance, resulting from a small increment in  relative to n=1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a very clear indication for two competing mechanisms, with negative magnetoresistivity overcoming the orbital effect when the orbitally averaged interlayer group velocity (or the transfer integral tc) becomes finite at n. We emphasize that for a conventional and very clean metal, composed of a single FS sheet, the magnetoresistivity should either be (0H)2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21) or saturate as seen in quasi-two-dimensional metals close to the Yamaji angle27, or in Fig 2a,b for fields below 15 T. This is illustrated by the Supplementary Fig 1 (see also Supplementary Note 1), which contrasts our experimental observations with predictions based on semi-classical transport models, which correctly describe the magnetoresistance of layered organic metals in the vicinity of the Yamaji angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, as illustrated by the dotted red line in Fig 5d, c(0H) can be well described by the expression .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the c(0H)1 term describes the negative magnetoresistivity as previously seen in Fig 3, whereas the c0H term describes the non-saturating linear magnetoresistance predicted and observed for systems close to the quantum limit3,4,5,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This expression describes c(0H, ) satisfactorily, except at the Yamaji angle where both terms vanish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the neighbourhood of n, the addition of a small c(0H)2 term improves the fit, with its pre-factor increasing as n is approached.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  c also displays Shubnikov de Haas oscillations at small (and strongly  dependent) frequencies, which were not previously detected in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29, these slow oscillations, observed only in the interlayer magnetoresistance of layered metals, originate from the warping of the FS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Supplementary Fig 2 (See also Supplementary Note 2), we show how these frequencies disappear when the group velocity vanishes at n.', 'Significantly, this effect does not appear to be confined to PdCoO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6 presents an overall evaluation of the longitudinal magnetoresistance of isostructural PtCoO2, whereas Supplementary Fig 3 displays the observation of impurity-dependent negative magnetoresistivity in the correlated perovskite Sr2RuO4 (See also Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 6, PtCoO2 presents a pronounced negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity either for  c axis or for 0H close to an Yamaji angle (j is the current density).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also presents a very pronounced and non-saturating magnetoresistivy for fields applied along the Yamaji angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both systems, the magnetoresistivity does not follow a single power law as a function of 0H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, as shown in Supplementary Fig 4, at n the magnetoresistivity of the (Pt,Pd)CoO2 system follows a (0H)2 dependence for 0H15 T. At intermediate fields, (0H) deviates from the quadratic dependence, recovering it again at subsequently higher fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Kohlers rule implies that /0(0H/0)2, we argue that the observed increase in slope would imply a field-dependent reduction in scattering by impurities (see Supplementary Fig 4 and Supplementary Note 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise origin of this suppression in scattering remains to be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the enormous and positive magnetoresistivity observed for fields along n seems consistent with a simple scenario, that is, an extremely clean system(s) whose impurity scattering weakens with increasing magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Sr2RuO4, the negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity is observed only in the cleanest samples and for angles within 10° away from the c axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This compound is characterized by three corrugated cylindrical FS sheets, each leading to a distinct set of Yamaji angles, making it impossible to completely suppress the interplanar coupling at specific Yamaji angle(s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in PtCoO2.Interplanar resistivity c normalized by its zero-field value 0 for a PtCoO2 single crystal at a temperature T=0.35 K and as a function of the magnetic field 0H applied along two angles with respect to the c axis, respectively =0° (pink line) and 17° (blue line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dashed magenta line describes the smoothly varying background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inset: c/0 as a function of 0H applied along the first Yamaji angle n=22.8°.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Negative magnetoresistivity is a common feature of ferromagnetic metals near their Curie temperature, or of samples having dimensions comparable to their electronic mean free path where the winding of the electronic orbits under a magnetic field reduces the scattering from the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can also result from the field-induced suppression of weak localization or from the field-induced suppression of spin-scattering/quantum-fluctuations as seen in f-electron compounds30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the compounds described in this study are near a magnetic instability, nor do they contain significant amounts of magnetic impurities or disorder to make them prone to weak localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnitude of this anomalous magnetoresistivity, coupled to its peculiar angular dependence, are in fact enough evidence against any of these conventional mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below, we discuss an alternative scenario based on the axial anomaly, which in our opinion explains most of our observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The axial anomaly is a fundamental concept of relativistic quantum field theory, which describes the violation of separate number conservation laws of left- and right-handed massless chiral fermions in odd spatial dimensions due to quantum mechanical effects31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When three-dimensional massless Dirac or Weyl fermions are placed under parallel electric and magnetic fields, the number difference between the left and the right-handed fermions is expected to vary with time according to the AdlerBellJackiw formula9,33', '', 'Here, nR/L are the number operators for the right- and the left-handed Weyl fermions, with the electric and the magnetic field strengths respectively given by E and B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Dirac fermion describes the linear touching of twofold Kramers degenerate conduction and valence bands at isolated momentum points in the Brillouin zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the Weyl fermions arise due to the linear touching between nondegenerate conduction and valence bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The axial anomaly was initially proposed to produce a large, negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, for a class of gapless semiconductors, for which the low-energy band structure is described by massless Weyl fermions10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason for the negative magnetoresistance is relatively straightforward.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number imbalance due to axial anomaly can only be equilibrated through backscattering between two Weyl points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This involves a large momentum transfer QW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quite generally the impurity scattering in a material can be modeled by a momentum dependent impurity potential V(Q), where Q is the momentum transfer between the initial and the final electronic states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If V(Q) is a smoothly decreasing function of |Q| (such as Gaussian or Lorentzian), the backscattering amplitude can be considerably smaller than its forward scattering counterparts (occurring with small Q around each Weyl point).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore in the presence of axial anomaly the transport lifetime can be considerably larger than the one in the absence of a magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently the axial anomaly in the presence of parallel E and B fields can give rise to larger conductivity or smaller resistivity i.e., negative magnetoresistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent theoretical proposals for Weyl semi-metals34,35,36,37 followed by experimental confirmation38,39 have revived the interest in the experimental confirmation of the axial anomaly through efforts in detecting negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity40,41,42,43,44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are examples of three-dimensional Dirac semi-metals47,48,49, which may be converted, through Zeeman splitting, into a Weyl semi-metal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examples include Bi1xSbx at the band inversion transition point between topologically trivial and nontrivial insulators42, and Cd3As2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In analogy with the predictions for the axial anomaly between Weyl points, here we suggest that our observations might be consistent with the emergence of the axial anomaly among the Fermi points of a field-induced, one-dimensional electronic dispersion18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In effect, in the presence of a strong magnetic field, the quantization of cyclotron motion leads to discrete Landau levels with one-dimensional dispersion and a degeneracy factor eB/h, see Fig 7ac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consider the low-energy description of a one-dimensional electron gas, in terms of the right- and left-handed fermions obtained in the vicinity of the two Fermi points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence

level intersects the Fermi energy EF at two Fermi points, as indicated by the red dots.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the vicinity of the two Fermi points located at kz=±kF,n for the n-th partially filled Landau

For this reason, Fig 7c, with multiple partially occupied Landau levels, describes PdCoO2 for fields along the c axis or for arbitrary angles away from the Yamaji ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, one can suppress the Fermi points by aligning the field along an Yamaji angle and this should suppress the associated axial anomaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As experimentally seen, the suppression of the Fermi points suppresses the negative magnetoresistivity, indicating that the axial anomaly is responsible for it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, in very clean layered metals we have uncovered a very clear correlation between the existence of Fermi points in a one-dimensional dispersion and the observation of an anomalous negative magnetoresistivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suppression of these points leads to the disappearance of this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that the axial anomaly and related negative magnetoresistivity would not be contingent on the existence of an underlying three-dimensional Dirac/Weyl dispersion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, our study in PdCoO2, PtCoO2 and Sr2RuO4, which are clean metals with no Dirac/Weyl dispersion at zero magnetic field, indicates that the axial anomaly and its effects could be a generic feature of metal(s) near the quantum limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the detection of negative magnetoresistivity would depend on the underlying scattering mechanisms, that is, observable only in those compounds that are clean enough to be dominated by elastic forward scattering18,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a generic metal with a high carrier density, it is currently impossible to reach the quantum limit; for the available field strength, many Landau levels would be populated, thus producing a myriad of Fermi points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, extremely pure layered metals such as (Pd,Pt)CoO2 are unique, as by just tilting the magnetic field in the vicinity of the Yamaji angle one can achieve the condition of a single, partially filled Landau level as it would happen at the quantum limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An explicit analytical calculation of transport lifetime in the presence of axial anomaly due to multiple partially filled Landau levels is a technically challenging task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore at present we do not have a simple analytical formula for describing the observed (0H)1 behavior of the negative magnetoresistance along the c axis (for magnetic field strengths much smaller than the one required to reach the quantum limit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the suppression of this negative magnetoresistivity for fields precisely aligned along the Yamaji angles indicates unambiguously that the electronic structure at the Fermi level is at the basis for its underlying mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation of (0H)1 behavior in the magnetoresistance around the Yamaji angle (when only one partially filled Landau level contributes) gives us the valuable insight that the anomaly induced negative magnetoresistance is quite robust irrespective of the number of partially filled Landau levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However the determination of a precise functional form for the magnetoresistance in the presence of multiple partially filled Landau levels remains as a technical challenge for theorists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The situation is somewhat analogous to that of the Weyl semi-metals, which are characterized by a number of Weyl points in the first Brillouin zone37, and apparently with all Weyl points contributing to its negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our results suggest that the axial anomaly among pairs of chiral Fermi points may play a role in ultra-clean systems even when they are located far from the quantum limit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, it is noteworthy that negative longitudinal magnetoresistivity is also seen in kish graphite at high fields, which is characterized by ellipsoidal electron- and hole-like FSs, on approaching the quantum limit and before the onset of a many-body instability towards a field-induced insulating density-wave ground state51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18, the axial anomaly on approaching the quantum limit may also play a role for the negative magnetoresistivities observed in ZrTe5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52) and in (ET)2I3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53), indicating that this concept, which is the basis of our work, is likely to be relevant to a number of physical systems, in particular semi-metals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
