Morphogenesis of liquid crystal topological defects during the nematic-smectic A phase transition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The liquid crystalline phases of matter each possess distinct types of defects that have drawn great interest in areas such as topology, self-assembly and material micropatterning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, relatively little is known about how defects in one liquid crystalline phase arise from defects or deformations in another phase upon crossing a phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we directly examine defects in the in situ thermal phase transition from nematic to smectic A in hybrid-aligned liquid crystal droplets on water substrates, using experimental, theoretical and numerical analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hybrid-aligned nematic droplet spontaneously generates boojum defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During cooling, toric focal conic domains arise through a sequence of morphological transformations involving nematic stripes and locally aligned focal conic domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This simple experiment reveals a surprisingly complex pathway by which very different types of defects may be related across the nematicsmectic A phase transition, and presents new possibilities for controlled deformation and patterning of liquid crystals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Materials composed of anisotropic organic molecules may display a number of mesophases called liquid crystals (LCs), with order and material properties intermediate between fluid and crystalline solids1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the molecular order relaxes after a phase transition or the application of an externally imposed stimulus, there commonly appear defects where the LC order locally breaks down, either as kinetically trapped metastable objects or as components of free energy-minimizing configurations2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most currently used LC-based optoelectronic applications, such as displays and modulators, the presence of defects would inhibit device performance and is avoided3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, once they are well controlled, defects hold the potential to dramatically broaden the applications of LCs, such as in micropatterned surfaces4,5, microlenses6,7, vortex beam generators8,9 and particle manipulation systems10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Besides these technological applications, LC defects have been a subject of study for over a century as a tool for fundamental scientific studies of topological singularities in physics, ever since the discovery of liquid crystallinity2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Topological defects in liquid crystals have been studied in analogy with defects related to symmetry breaking in the early universe (the KibbleZurek mechanism)12 and topological defects in other condensed matter systems, including superconductors13, superfluids14 and soft ferromagnets15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liquid crystal defects are often strikingly visible under optical microscopy, facilitating their study in comparison with the smaller or cosmologically larger deformations in the analogous systems mentioned above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, LC defects are interesting not just as analogues for other systems but also for a wide variety of unique phenomena arising from their interaction with external fields16,17 and colloidal particles18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, very little is known about the fate of defects during the phase transition between two of the most common LC phases, the nematic (N) and the smectic A (SmA) phases, or how this phase transition determines the final structure of the SmA defect patterns upon cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this phase transition, the broken rotational symmetry of the N phase, characterized by a director field n(r), is augmented by a further broken translational symmetry along the n direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density becomes modulated, forming equally spaced smectic layers to which n(r) is normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Studying topological defects at phase transitions is especially important in light of the crucial role that such defects play in orderdisorder transitions such as the celebrated KosterlitzThouless transition in the two-dimensional XY model22 and a related theory of melting in two-dimensional solids23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paucity of information about defects at the NSmA phase transition is partly due to an apparent complete reorganization of the LC order at the transition in some systems, driven by strong anchoring at the boundaries (for example, see Supplementary Fig 1) in which it is hard to discern a relationship between defects in the two phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, some recent studies have demonstrated continuous and quantifiable changes in LC defects as the N phase is cooled into the SmA phase; these systems include LC shells24,25,26,27,28 and samples with micron-scale colloidal inclusions29,30, as well as thin films with multidirectional rubbing at the substrate31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations raise important questions about the pathways and history dependence of defect transformations across the NSmA phase transition, and about the role of these transformations in SmA phase defect pattern formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we use films of the LC material 8CB, open to the air above and resting on a water substrate below, to study LC defects during the NSmA phase transition upon cooling by polarized optical microscopy (POM)31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surface anchoring is strongly homeotropic at the LC/air interface, and strongly degenerate planar at the water interface, creating a hybrid-aligned cell32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The choice of water as the lower substrate provides a useful and striking new view on the phase transition, as this system provides a uniform thin LC thickness with no azimuthal anchoring potential and a minimal thermal gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the surface tension dominates over liquid crystalline anchoring energies, the LC/water interface is not significantly perturbed from flatness by director distortions or defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a dramatic sequence of morphological changes in the director field geometry during the phase transition that reveals surprising connections between the initial N geometry and the subsequent defect configurations32 (Figs 1 and 2, Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Boojums at the water surface in the N phase (Fig 1a) become the organizing centres for stripe undulations in the N director n. These stripes break up into rows of aligned focal conic domains (FCDs), well-known defects of the SmA phase, with nonzero eccentricity and orientations determined by the initial boojum patterning, recalling their N history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the FCDs relax into toric FCDs (TFCDs) (Fig 1b)31,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, we observe the direct transformation of certain special N boojums into large TFCDs early in the cooling process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We rationalize our findings through geometrical modelling, along with a theoretical and numerical study of the stripe instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results shed significant light on the self-assembly pathway of defects in LC phases, revealing unexpected intermediate states with a strong history dependence, and opening new avenues for potential applications beyond LC-based displays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Typical defect structures of N and SmA phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic diagrams of molecular configuration surrounding boojum at NLC phase in square-outlined area of d.

'Morphological changes during the phase transition', 'When a drop of 8CB is placed on a water surface with a temperature in the isotropic range of 8CB, the LC drop spreads until achieving a uniform thickness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drop is then cooled to the N phase in which the molecules are subjected to the antagonistic boundary conditions of hybrid alignment32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From top to bottom of the LC film, the director field must rotate by 90° from vertical to horizontal to satisfy these boundary conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the directors azimuthal angle in the plane of the water substrate is a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, a unit vector field analogous to the XY model of magnetism and the c-director of the smectic C phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in those cases, vortices may arise in the projected director field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the full three-dimensional director field, these vortices are boojums34,35, point defects at the LC/water interface (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They arise spontaneously upon cooling from the isotropic phase into the N phase, and are clearly visible as the intersection of four dark and four bright brushes under crossed polarizers (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In such schlieren textures, the number of dark brushes meeting at a point is four times the absolute value of the winding number of the defect |s|2,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sign of s can be experimentally determined by rotating the crossed polarizers; when the brushes rotate in the same or opposite direction as the polarizers do, the sign is positive or negative, respectively (black or white arrow in Fig 1d)36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Upon cooling sufficiently below the NSmA transition temperature TNA=32.2 °C, we observe the TFCD arrays (Fig 1b,g) that are typical of SmA films under hybrid anchoring4,5,6,11,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A TFCD consists of a family of smectic layers shaped as nested tori, with a circular defect line at the centre of the tori and a vertical cusp line in the centre (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SmA ground state under hybrid anchoring is typically an array of TFCDs, each bounded by a vertical cylinder as in Fig 1b, with the interstices between TFCDs filled by planar, horizontal layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TFCD is a special, zero-eccentricity case of the FCD, in which the smectic layers take the form of surfaces known as Dupin cyclides, and the defect lines are an ellipse and a hyperbola33 (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FCD is said to have an eccentricity e, 0e less_than 1, equal to the eccentricity of its elliptical defect, , where a and b are the lengths of semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FCDs of nonzero eccentricity are often called elliptichyperbolic FCDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study reveals two intricate intermediate states during the cooling process between nematic boojums and smectic TFCDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the nematic director n develops stripe undulations, with the stripes running parallel to the initial n at the water substrate (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, as the temperature falls below TNA, these stripes break up into rows of FCDs (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such FCDs have an orientation given by the long axis of their elliptical base, or equivalently by the projection of their hyperbolic cusp defects onto the horizontal plane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe that the orientations of the FCDs follow the orientations of the stripes that precede them, which are themselves inherited from the boojum arrangement in the N phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only after further cooling do the FCDs relax into TFCDs, with zero eccentricity and azimuthal symmetry (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To more precisely determine the director field around the defects during the phase transition, we insert a first-order retardation plate (=530 nm) between the sample and the analyser (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sample then appears magenta where n is parallel, perpendicula, or vertical with respect to the polarizers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyan-blue and yellow colours appear where n is parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the slow axis of the first-order retardation plate37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the N phase, the region around a boojum consists of two large yellow areas and two large blue areas, all meeting at the boojum site (Fig 2a,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the stripes regime (Fig 2b,f), the predominant colour in each region is the same as in the boojum regime, but the colour oscillates over the stripe wavelength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies large-angle azimuthal undulations of n in the direction transverse to the stripes, oscillating about the locally average direction parallel to the stripe direction, inherited from the boojum regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of Fig 2b, the stripes are oriented radially outward from the initial boojum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stripes arise as a result of the diverging ratio of the bend and splay elastic constants, K3/K1 (refs 38, 39), as the N phase is cooled into the SmA phase; we will investigate this phenomenon theoretically and numerically below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Upon further cooling below TNA, FCDs appear throughout the system (Fig 2c,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These FCDs at first have a high eccentricity, as evidenced by the asymmetry of the yellow and cyan-blue lobes of each domain about the point where they meet, in contrast with the symmetric arrangement of the four lobes of the TFCDs (Fig 2d,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lobes also reveal the orientation of each FCD that in the case of Fig 2c is generally radially inward toward the site of the initial boojum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A closer comparison of Fig 2b,c reveals that the FCDs are arranged in rows parallel to the domain orientations, and that these rows are the same as the stripes of Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the NSmA phase transition here involves the breaking up of stripes along their lengths into rows of FCDs oriented along the stripe direction, with the minor axis length of the FCDs equal to the stripe wavelength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even the dislocations of the stripes in Fig 2b persist as dislocations in the FCD rows of Fig 2c, creating FCD defects of defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, further cooling causes a relaxation of the FCD array into an array of TFCDs, with the eccentricity diminishing to zero continuously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The boojums of the N phase have a winding number of either +1 or 1 in the plane of the substrate, describing the sense of rotation of the director field on a loop around the boojum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stripes and FCD rows are organized radially around a +1 boojum (Fig 2ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the 1 boojum, which involves a hyperbolic director field in the N phase (in the plane of the substrate), the stripes and FCDs follow a diamond-shaped pattern around the defect site (Fig 2eh)28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the stripes form parallel to the N phases horizontal n component, the radial or diamond arrangement of stripes inherits and reveals the +1 (radial) or 1 (hyperbolic) windings of the original boojum configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also observe the direct transformation of a special class of boojums, which we term +1 converging, into TFCDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hybrid-aligned N, the +1 boojums can be divided into converging and diverging types (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is well known that the nematic symmetry n=n generally forbids such a choice of orientation to be made consistently3, here the lack of half-integer defects in our system makes it possible32, and useful, to describe n as a unit vector field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In traversing from the air interface to the substrate, the director rotates by 90° to point either inward (converging) or outward (diverging), as shown schematically in Fig 3b,df, where we adopt the convention that the director points up at the air interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The +1 converging boojum is frequently referred to in the literature as hyperbolic, and the +1 diverging boojum as radial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The converging/diverging distinction has a clear physical manifestation in the SmA phase: the FCDs are oriented towards the boojum site in the converging case, meaning that the hyperbolic focal curve faces the boojum site, with POM showing lobes positioned on the radially outward side (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the diverging case, the FCDs are oriented away from the boojum site, with the lobes positioned on the radially inward side (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason the FCD orientations reveal the rotation sense of the N director in the vertical cross-section will be discussed below, in the section Geometrical discussion of the stripeFCD transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Enlarged cores region of two distinguishable +1 defects in the SmA phase.FCDs orient inward (a) and outward (c) from different +1 surface defects (POM images

that transform directly into TFCDs (Figs 2a and 3a) during the breaking up of the stripes into eccentric FCDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because the TFCD, like the +1 converging boojum, has azimuthal symmetry and a converging director field from top to bottom (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These early-forming TFCDs are larger than the surrounding FCDs, but the size distinction is gradually lost as the FCDs evolve into TFCDs upon further cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The +1 diverging boojums, on the other hand, do not evolve directly into TFCDs (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1 boojums also cannot evolve directly into TFCDs because they lack the azimuthal symmetry of TFCDs, as revealed by the diamond-like configurations of the stripes parallel to the original n field (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Theory of the nematic stripe instability', 'Stripe instabilities in N have a rich and diverse history in the study of LCs, both deep in the N phase and close to the NSmA transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to previous studies32,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46, we observe a stripe instability in 8CB on a water substrate upon cooling towards TNA in which the LC thickness is micron-scale and the boundary conditions are those of the hybrid-aligned N (HAN).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The planar-anchoring substrate is degenerate planar unlike in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47, while the proximity to TNA makes the bend elastic constant K3 far greater than the splay elastic constant K1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we will see, stripes arise to decrease the bend distortion of the nematic director field48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To develop a theoretical understanding of the stripe instability in our system, we begin with the uniformly distorted HAN director field before the stripes appear, and we perform a linear stability analysis to predict when stripes become energetically favourable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The details of the calculation can be found in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elastic energy of deformations is calculated using the Frank free energy', '', 'The distortion modes in the integrand are respectively the splay, twist, bend and saddle-splay modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The water substrate contributes a degenerate planar anchoring potential .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume infinitely strong anchoring at the homeotropic air interface, so that n is strictly vertical there, which is probably appropriate close to TNA where homeotropic anchoring strengths increase by orders of magnitude38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the transition temperature TNA is approached from above, the ratio K3/K1 of bend to splay elastic constants diverges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the limit of large K3/K1, the HAN director field has a polar angle profile 0(z) similar to that shown in Fig 6a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The directors

discussion of the stripeFCD transition', 'Why do the nematic stripes evolve into elliptichyperbolic FCDs at the NSmA transition?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that such FCDs, in particular incomplete FCDs50,51, provide a field of smectic layer normals in close agreement with the director field of the N stripes, from which the FCDs evolve.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incompleteness of the FCDs refers to the fact that the domains are generally missing a portion of the elliptical focal curve on the side that the hyperbola faces, and a corresponding volume of the FCD is missing as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This missing volume is occupied by the next FCD in the row.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We know the FCDs to be incomplete in part because the bright lobes seen in POM appear only behind the convergence point of the lobes, marking the hyperbola location (Fig 2c,g), whereas a complete FCD would have small lobes on the forward side as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, bright-field optical microscopy directly reveals incomplete elliptical defect lines (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A schematic illustration of the system geometry is presented in Fig 6b, with the incomplete FCDs occupying portions of vertical circular cylinders52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asymptotic direction of the upper portion of the hyperbola is then along the vertical, so that the layers at the air interface are mostly horizontal, smoothly joining onto horizontal layers in the interstices52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This geometry requires the ellipses to be somewhat tilted out of the plane of the substrate, and a small portion of the FCD under the ellipse is contained within a tilted circular cylinder53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Degenerate planar anchoring at the substrate is not strictly satisfied, but this energetic sacrifice is not unusual for hybrid-aligned systems with stronger anchoring at the homeotropic interface53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our optical microscopy measurements show that the hyperbola, viewed from above, appears to be oriented opposite to the FCD orientation, as Fig 6b would suggest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incompleteness of an FCD requires curvature walls or many dislocations between neighbouring FCDs, but the energetic cost of such smectic defects may not be prohibitive near TNA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the defect cost increases upon cooling deeper into the smectic phase, the FCDs relax into complete (or more nearly complete) TFCDs, with their circular focal curves resting on the substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete TFCDs join smoothly to one another and to interstitial regions of horizontal layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Comparing a side view of the HAN director field profile (Fig 6a) with the polar angle of the smectic layer normal in the elliptichyperbolic FCDs behind the hyperbola (Fig 6b), we see that the rotation of the director from the homeotropic air interface to the degenerate planar substrate is qualitatively the same in both cases, provided that the FCD orientation agrees with the N in-plane orientation before the stripe onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the forward side of the FCDs, which is the side faced by the hyperbola, the director would rotate in the sense opposite to the HAN n profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the combination of high eccentricity and incompleteness of the FCDs removes most of this volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Meanwhile, in the plane of the substrate, the FCD layer normal direction splays out behind the hyperbola (Fig 6d) in a way similar to the numerically calculated nematic director field at the substrate (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the structure of the stripes is connected with FCD formation: the monotonic variation of  over most of the stripe period (Fig 5d,g) allows n to evolve easily into the rear portions of the FCDs (hence incomplete), while the quick jump in  in the small remainder of the stripe period seeds a curvature wall between adjacent FCD rows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, the forward side of the FCDs would have an in-plane director field opposite to the N stripe undulation, but high eccentricity and incompleteness of the FCDs remove most of this problematic portion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, rows of incomplete elliptichyperbolic FCDs, with the FCDs oriented along the row direction, provide a natural smectic successor structure to the N stripe state, with a very similar director field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows the N stripe pattern, organized around the original boojums, to persist in the complex arrangement of the FCDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The exact structure of the curvature walls, between FCDs within a row and between adjacent FCD rows, is likely to involve many dislocations and is beyond the scope of this work both experimentally and theoretically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is reasonable to assume that the curvature walls become increasingly energetically costly as the temperature is lowered deeper into the SmA phase and the smectic layer compression modulus increases1,33,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This energetic cost, and the resulting tendency to anneal away the curvature walls as the sample is cooled, drives the continuous evolution of tilted, incomplete, nonzero-eccentricity FCDs into upright, complete, zero-eccentricity TFCDs that need no curvature walls to fill space with smectic layers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Using water as a substrate for a hybrid-aligned LC film, we have demonstrated two new pathways of defect transformation at the N-SmA transition: a direct transformation of +1 converging boojums to TFCDs, and a sequence of morphological changes from HAN to N stripe undulations, then to rows of incomplete elliptichyperbolic FCDs and finally to a packing of TFCDs in the rest of the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The original boojum network strongly influences the geometry of the subsequent states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientations of the FCDs reveal the sense of rotation of the director field along the vertical direction in the N phasedistinguishing, for example, converging and diverging +1 boojumsthat is otherwise difficult to determine using optical microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through linear stability analysis and Landau-de Gennes numerical modelling, we have provided an explanation for the N stripe instability as the elastic constant ratio K3/K1 diverges near TNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we have rationalized the transition from N stripes to smectic FCD rows by illustrating the similarity in their director fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal new connections between the defects of the N and SmA phases, and demonstrate a strong history dependence in the geometries of the defect configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such temperature-controlled transformations and orientational memory provide avenues for switchable behaviour in applications that exploit the interactions of light, colloidal particles or nanoparticles with liquid crystalline materials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
