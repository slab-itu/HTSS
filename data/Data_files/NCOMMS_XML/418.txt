Notch-independent RBPJ controls angiogenesis in the adult heart  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Increasing angiogenesis has long been considered a therapeutic target for improving heart function after injury such as acute myocardial infarction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, gene, protein and cell therapies to increase microvascularization have not been successful, most likely because the studies failed to achieve regulated and concerted expression of pro-angiogenic and angiostatic factors needed to produce functional microvasculature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that the transcription factor RBPJ is a homoeostatic repressor of multiple pro-angiogenic and angiostatic factor genes in cardiomyocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBPJ controls angiogenic factor gene expression independently of Notch by antagonizing the activity of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to previous strategies, the cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Rbpj increased microvascularization of the heart without adversely affecting cardiac structure or function even into old age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the loss of RBPJ in cardiomyocytes increased hypoxia tolerance, improved heart function and decreased pathological remodelling after myocardial infarction, suggesting that inhibiting RBPJ might be therapeutic for ischaemic injury.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Angiogenesis in the adult heart is tightly regulated in order to maintain cardiac function in response to workload1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms that coordinate angiogenesis and workload are poorly understood, but involve the regulated secretion of angiogenic factors from cardiomyocytes2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Increasing angiogenesis is of therapeutic interest to treat chronic myocardial ischaemia,4,5 as well as acutely after myocardial infarction since many patients have inadequate perfusion despite restoration of coronary artery blood flow6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite pre-clinical proof of concept, clinical trials of single factor, gene and cell-based therapies have provided inconsistent results, and identifying a definitive means of inducing clinically useful therapeutic angiogenesis remains elusive4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A challenge in achieving therapeutic angiogenesis is that the formation of functional vessels involves the coordinated activities of numerous factors, some of which promote endothelial cell proliferation and vessel sprouting (for example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)), while others drive vessel remodelling and maturation (for example, angiopoietins)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since pressure overload increases myocardial angiogenesis and activates Notch signalling8,9, we hypothesized that Notch and its transcriptional effector RBPJ (recombination signal binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region) might function in cardiomyocytes as a high level modulator of myocardial angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBPJ is ubiquitously expressed, and can either activate genes by forming a complex with the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) when Notch is active10, or silence an overlapping but non-identical set of genes by recruiting co-repressors in the absence of Notch signalling11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our studies revealed that RBPJ represses the production of pro-angiogenic and angiostatic factors in cardiomyocytes of the unstressed heart, such that the adult cardiomyocyte (ACM)-specific deletion of rbpj increases microvessel density, confers physiological tolerance to hypoxia and protects the heart from ischaemic injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to expectations, activation of Notch itself did not induce an angiogenic programme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We present evidence that RBPJ controls angiogenic factor gene expression by direct binding and inhibition of HIF1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, RBPJ has a novel Notch-independent role as a repressor of hypoxia responsiveness and myocardial angiogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'RBPJ acts as a transcriptional repressor in healthy ACM', 'We first investigated the location and activity of RBPJ in the mouse adult heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear-localized and faint cytoplasmic RBPJ is readily detected in the adult heart, both in cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes, and its level does not change substantially following either chronic pressure overload by thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) or myocardial infarction (Fig 1a,b; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, RBPJ was nearly undetectable basally by immunostaining with the monoclonal antibody T6709 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14) (Fig 1d), but was strikingly evident in response to a doxycyclin-inducible, transgenic NICD (iNICD)15 (Fig 1c,f) and after TAC or myocardial infarction (MI) (Fig 1e; Supplementary Fig 1cf) coinciding with elevated expression of Notch ligands (Supplementary Fig 2ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T6709-detection correlates with Notch activation14, suggesting that RBPJ in the heart might repress gene expression basally and mediate Notch signalling after MI and pressure overload.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Cardiac stress switches RBPJ from transcriptional repression to activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (af) Histological sections of ventricular myocardium from WT mice from sham (a,d) and TAC (b,e) operated mice, and a cardiomyocyte-specific doxycycline-iNICD mouse (c,f) immunostained for total RBPJ (ac) and RBPJ in its transcriptional activating complex(brown) (df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAC and iNICD upregulate nuclear-localized RBPJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 50 m.

Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Culture media conditioned by cKO isolated ACM showed an increased ability to form microvascular endothelial tubes in vitro relative to WT-conditioned media, and this increased activity was blocked by the VEGF receptor inhibitor (carbozantinib) (Fig 2o).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the in vitro and in vivo data support the model that RBPJ inhibits VEGF-A dependent angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed increased content of histone-H3 modifications (K9/K18Ac2 and K4me3) in the endogenous Vegfa promoter in a region 1.5 kb upstream of the start site of transcription that contains both RBPJ and HIF consensus motifs (Fig 2p; Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These epigenetic marks indicate gene activation in the cKO cardiomyocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation was reversed by the overexpression of RBPJ, and co-transfection with a truncated-form of SHARP that physically sequesters RBPJ18 completely eliminated repression (Fig 2q).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, RBPJ represses Vegfa gene expression under unstressed conditions, and deleting RBPJ leads to Vegfa gene activation (Fig 2r).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cardioprotection and hypoxia tolerance in rbpj cKO hearts', 'Given the increased CC ratio in the cKO heart, we evaluated the hemodynamic consequences deleting Rbpj.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the cKO genotype, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible Myh6-Cre19 knockout (icKO;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, RBPJ regulates a paracrine circuit for myocardial angiogenesis (Fig 4i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RBPJ exerts control over microvessel density by acting within cardiomyocytes to antagonize HIF1 and HIF2; therefore, desensitizing the angiogenic response to hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deleting RBPJ, therefore, increases sensitivity to hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Attenuating RBPJ in cardiomyocytes is remarkable, in that it benignly increases myocardial vascularization, increases cardiac perfusion and output under hypoxia and preserves cardiac function following MI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are relatively few instances of RBPJ having a repressive role in mammals23,24,25, and most studies have focused primarily on its function as the effector of Notch signalling, which is itself cardioprotective following ischaemic injury8,9,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of RBPJ deletion resembles chronic adaptation of the heart to hypoxia27 suggesting that attenuating the suppressive function of RBPJ might be therapeutic in the setting of ischaemic injury or chronic overload.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus BX51WI equipped with a high resolution digital CCD ORCA-285 (Hamamatsu Corp., Hamamatsu city, Japan) illuminated with a mercury burner and the appropriate fluorescent cubes (XF100-2 and XF02-2, Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images for pimonidazole antibody-stained areas and Hoechst were prepared using Wasabi Imaging Software (Hamamatsu Corp).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of pixels stained for pimonidazole in each region, to the total cellular area of the image was calculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten images were analyzed by section, and the results were pooled to determine the mean and standard deviation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To indicate the co-localization of pimonidazole and Hoechst in cell, images were superimposed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'All relevant data are included in the figures and/or Supplementary Data, or available from the authors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
