The Gonium pectorale genome demonstrates co-option of cell cycle regulation during the evolution of multicellularity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The transition to multicellularity has occurred numerous times in all domains of life, yet its initial steps are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volvocine green algae are a tractable system for understanding the genetic basis of multicellularity including the initial formation of cooperative cell groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the genome sequence of the undifferentiated colonial alga, Gonium pectorale, where group formation evolved by co-option of the retinoblastoma cell cycle regulatory pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, expression of the Gonium retinoblastoma cell cycle regulator in unicellular Chlamydomonas causes it to become colonial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of these changes in undifferentiated Gonium indicates extensive group-level adaptation during the initial step in the evolution of multicellularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results emphasize an early and formative step in the evolution of multicellularity, the evolution of cell cycle regulation, one that may shed light on the evolutionary history of other multicellular innovations and evolutionary transitions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Multicellular organisms have independently evolved numerous times throughout the tree of life including plants, animals, fungi, cyanobacteria, amoeba, brown algae, red algae and green algae1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In animals, multicellularity emerged 600950 million years ago (Myr ago) correlating with a large expansion of genes encoding transcription factors, signalling pathways, and cell adhesion genes that were co-opted from their unicellular ancestors3,4 Similarly, multicellular, terrestrial plants emerged 750 Myr ago correlating with an expansion of many signalling pathways present in their unicellular relatives5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because most multicellular lineages have long diverged from their unicellular relatives, the genomic signature of the transition to multicellularity has been obscured, and consequently this evolutionary process remains enigmatic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The volvocine green algae are a unique model system for the evolution of multicellularity because the unicellular ancestry is clear, the emergence of multicellularity occurred 230 Myr ago, and species exhibit a stepwise increase in morphological complexity ranging from undifferentiated colonies to differentiated multicellular species7,8 (Fig 1, Supplementary Figs 1,2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unicellular Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is thought to resemble the unicellular ancestor of multicellular volvocines, including undifferentiated Gonium pectorale and differentiated Volvox carteri (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Volvocine phylogenetic tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Evolution of cell cycle control (C), expanded ECM (E) and somatic cells (S) are denoted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Micrographs of Chlamydomonas (green; scale bar, 10 m), Gonium (blue; scale bar, 10 m) and Volvox (black; scale bar, 25 m) show morphological differences.Full size image', 'Chlamydomonas undergoes a variant cell cycle (Supplementary Fig 2), regulated by homologues of the retinoblastoma cell cycle pathway, termed multiple-fission where it divides by a series of rapid cell divisions producing individual daughter cells9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gonium typically forms 8- or 16-celled undifferentiated colonies, where each constituent cell resembles a Chlamydomonas cell (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gonium also undergoes multiple fission forming daughter colonies by keeping cells attached after multiple-fission, suggesting either cell cycle regulation12, or cellcell adhesion has been modified to promote multicellularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Gonium, like Chlamydomonas, growth and cell division are uncoupled13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asexual juvenile Gonium colonies grow (without cell division) into adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After cell division through multiple-fission, juvenile colonies hatch forming 8 or 16 daughter colonies of 8 or 16 cells (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volvox contains approximately 2,000 small, terminally differentiated, somatic cells on the surface of the spheroid and approximately 16 large reproductive cells embedded in extracellular matrix (ECM) inside the spheroid (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volvox also has modified multiple fission where germsoma separation is established after an asymmetric cell division8,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The transition to multicellularity in the Volvocales was thought to involve at least 12 steps (Supplementary Fig 1)15,16 though the genetic basis of these steps remains enigmatic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic comparison of the extremes of morphological complexity, Chlamydomonas and Volvox, suggests few genetic changes are required17, but it is unclear how and when the genes important for multicellularity evolved during these 12 steps14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By sequencing the genome of the undifferentiated, chlorophycean Gonium pectorale, a species without a differentiated ancestor16, we find co-option of cell cycle regulation, which occurred during the initial transition to cell groups, as the genetic basis for the evolution of multicellularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cell cycle regulation found in undifferentiated Gonium, co-opted in a multicellular context and shared with germsoma-differentiated Volvox, indicates group-level adaptations in undifferentiated colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early co-option of cell cycle regulation for group-level life cycle and reproduction is a critical and formative step in the evolution of multicellularity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'We next examined genome-wide evolution in all three species to better understand the genetic basis for the evolution of multicellularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A prediction of lineage-specific genes20 shows few genes correlate with the evolution of multicellularity in the Volvocales (phylostratum 7; PS7) with a maximum of 180357 genes (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the evolution of multicellularity does not rely upon the evolution of de novo genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though gene regulation may be important during multicellular innovation, the diversity and abundance of transcription factors is similar in Chlamydomonas, Gonium and Volvox (Fig 2b, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although enrichment of transcription factors can correlate with the evolution of multicellularity3, this is not always the case21; we found that Gonium and Volvox have fewer transcription factors than in Chlamydomonas (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include

families of size greater than one).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with 2,844 net gene families gained, which correlate with the origin of the Chlorophyceae, a phylogenetic analysis of these gene families suggests little protein innovation (110 net gene families) during the evolution of multicellularity (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These same green algae genomes allowed analysis into Pfam domain innovation, which may correlate with the evolution of multicellularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found innovation of only nine Pfam domains correlating with the evolution of multicellularity (Fig 2d, Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, multicellular algae (Gonium and Volvox) have reduced Pfam domain diversity and abundance (compared with nine unicellular green algae, Supplementary Data 1); 394 Pfam A domains are significantly under-represented versus 129 over-represented Pfam domains (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, there is an excess of species-specific genes (Fig 2a,c) and Pfam domains (Fig 2d) compared with multicellularity-correlated genes and Pfam domains, suggesting that species-specific adaptations are more numerous than changes correlating with the evolution of multicellularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe more evidence of species-specific, rather than multicellular-specific, protein innovations, suggesting species-specific adaptation (Fig 2a,c,d, Supplementary Tables 58) rather than genome-wide differences correlating with the evolution of multicellularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution of multicellularity in the volvocine algae does not require large-scale genomic innovation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Co-option of cell cycle regulation for multicellularity', 'Notably, we observe that the genetic innovation correlating with multicellularity, shared between Gonium and Volvox, evolved through co-option of existing developmental programs of cell cycle control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volvocine algae have a common multiple-fission life cycle, with variation in timing and number of divisions (Supplementary Fig 1)14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like most eukaryotes, including plants and animals, their cell cycles are regulated by homologues of the retinoblastoma cell cycle regulatory pathway (Fig 3, Supplementary Figs 58, Supplementary Table 9)9,10, in which cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) bind cyclin proteins to phosphorylate and regulate retinoblastoma (RB or MAT3 in the Volvocales), which in turn de-represses the cell cycle (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although most of these regulators are nearly identical in Chlamydomonas, Gonium and Volvox (Fig 3b,e), there are two notable differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, Volvox has a four gene expansion of cyclin D1 genes (Fig 3c)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Volvox has tissue differentiation, these cyclin D1 genes may have been important for tissue development as is the case in metazoans and land plants22,23, supported by the fact that RB has moved into the mating locus of Gonium and Volvox and is differentially expressed between mating loci (Fig 3d)24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the tandem array expansion of the cyclin D1 genes is also found in Gonium (Fig 3c), where cyclin D genes display elevated dN/dS ratios compared with other cell cycle regulators (Supplementary Fig 8), suggesting the function of these cyclin Ds may be important for the transition to undifferentiated colonies, rather than tissue differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Cell cycle pathway evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The retinoblastoma cell cycle regulatory pathway.

modification of the RB gene in Gonium and Volvox (Fig 3d, Supplementary Figs 57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protein dimers of cyclins and CDKs primarily regulate RB by phosphorylating serine or threonine residues, which is thought to regulate RB binding of chromatin via E2F/DP transcription factors11,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently it has been shown in human cells that cyclin D and CDK4/6 regulate monophosphorylation of RB proteins for G1 phase-specific RB functions27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If similar in Gonium, this would suggest a role of the expanded cyclin D1 genes for regulating RB to express multicellularity-related genes during G1 phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the expanded cyclin D1 proteins found in Gonium regulate multicellular cell cycle changes, modification of cyclin D-CDK phosphorylation sites in RB is predicted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the linker of the E2F/DP binding pocket of RB is shorter in Gonium and Volvox compared with Chlamydomonas (Fig 3d, Supplementary Figs 5 and 6), potentially altering how RB binds to chromatin via E2F/DP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, phosphorylation sites between the E2F/DP pocket region (RB-A and RB-B domains) and the conserved carboxy (C)-terminal domain are absent in Gonium and Volvox RB proteins (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in animals the C terminus of RB is intertwined with E2F/DP and changes in the phosphorylation by cyclinCDK complexes could also alter E2F/DP binding28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As these phosphorylation sites are absent in Gonium and Volvox RB proteins (Fig 3d), this suggests that RB co-option for multicellularity may result in differences in locus-specific temporal expression of genes important for multicellularity during G1, such as cellcell adhesion genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the role the RB pathway plays in regulating the cell cycle in Chlamydomonas, its early modification found in Gonium, and its co-option for complex morphology in Volvox, RB pathway regulation might be a key step towards multicellularity in the volvocine algae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test whether RB modifications present in Gonium and Volvox (compared with Chlamydomonas) are unrelated to, cause or are a consequence of multicellularity, we expressed the Chlamydomonas11 and Gonium RB genes in a Chlamydomonas strain lacking its RB gene (rb, mat34 strain, Fig 4a)9,11 using the promoter and terminator from the Chlamydomonas RB gene to ensure expression near wild-type levels (Fig 4b,c)11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Chlamydomonas RB gene rescues the small cell size defect in the rb mutant (HA-CrRB::rb, Fig 4a), while the Gonium RB gene rescues the cell size defect and causes the Chlamydomonas rb mutant to become non-palmelloid colonial, ranging from 2 to 16 normal-sized cells (HA-GpRB::rb, Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crossing RB gain-of-function transformed Chlamydomonas strain to a Chlamydomonas strain lacking DP1, a gene that dimerizes with E2F to anchor RB to chromatin11, results in suppression of the colonial phenotype and large-sized cells (HA-GpRB::rb::dp1, Fig 4a) consistent with the phenotype of the Chlamydomonas dp1 mutant itself10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrates that the Gonium RB gene causes colonial multicellularity (Fig 4a) through the RB pathway (Fig 3a) and suggests differences in how RB binds chromatin and regulates the expression of cell cycle related genes in Gonium and Volvox are important for co-option of these RB targeted genes for multicellularity (Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gain-of-function demonstrates a causal link between cell cycle regulation and the group level during the evolution of multicellularity, emphasizing that multicellularity can evolve by co-option and modification of regulatory genes rather than extensive genomic differences or innovation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Gonium RB causes a colonial phenotype when expressed in Chlamydomonas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Transformation schematic showing

ferrisii and Volvox gigas32, suggesting early evolution and co-option of this cluster shortly after the split of Gonium and Volvox lineages (Fig 1)32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, if the absence of

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have investigated the evolution of multicellularity in the volvocine algae by sequencing the genome of the undifferentiated Gonium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite morphological differences, it was known that the Chlamydomonas and Volvox genomes are strikingly similar, suggesting that multicellularity required few genetic innovations17,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these two genomes, positioned at the extremes of volvocine morphology, were unable to resolve the tempo and mode36 of the evolutionary transition to multicellularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The evolution of multicellularity in the volvocine algae is thought to involve 12 morphological innovations (Supplementary Fig 1)15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Five of these steps correlate with the evolution of cell groups7, a period of rapid evolutionary change (tempo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This view emphasizes the importance, and subsequent modification, of innovations correlating with undifferentiated colonies (mode).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finding support for this view, we have generalized these 12 steps into three major phases (Fig 6): the evolution of cell cycle regulation to form cooperative groups via cellcell adhesion, the evolution of increased organismal size, and the evolution of differentiated germ and soma cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having sequenced the genome of Gonium, along with the published genomes of Chlamydomonas and Volvox, we can now identify the genetic pathways associated with each of these steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The evolution of undifferentiated colonies correlates with RB cell cycle regulatory pathway evolution (Figs 3 and 4), which is further modified as complexity increases in the Volvocales24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased organismal size toward Volvox correlates with an expansion of pherophorins and MMPs (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally the evolution of the regA gene cluster underlies somatic differentiation (Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future sequencing of additional Volvocales genomes should clarify the evolutionary steps required for the evolution of germ and soma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our three-phase model for the emergence of multicellularity, supported by the genetic pathways important for their evolution, changes our understanding of the tempo and mode of multicellular evolution previously obscured in other taxa such as plants, fungi and animals due to genomic divergence (Fig 6).

genetic basis for the evolutionary transition emerges much earlier than anticipated3,6,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In plants and animals, RB proteins are important for regulating both cell proliferation and differentiation by highly complex locus interactions with chromatin and chromatin remodelling factors37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that the RB pathway was co-opted early for multicellularity in undifferentiated colonies suggests that the template for subsequent evolutionary innovations in developmental programs was laid out during the transition to undifferentiated multicellularity via RB and cell cycle modifications, rather than with emergence of germ and somatic cellular differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, RB has been further co-opted for a role in sexual differentiation in Volvox, where there are male- and female-specific isoforms of RB24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the evolution of multicellular cell cycle regulation was a critical step for the evolution of multicellularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing the genomes of these three volvocine green algae, we have determined that the mechanism of multicellular evolution is primarily co-option and regulatory

the critical role of transcriptional regulation of the cell cycle by RB for the formation of undifferentiated colonies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RB proteins regulate the cell cycle of most eukaryotes11,26, and
