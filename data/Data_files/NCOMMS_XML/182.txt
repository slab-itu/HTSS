Cytotoxicity of crystals involves RIPK3-MLKL-mediated necroptosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Crystals cause injury in numerous disorders, and induce inflammation via the NLRP3 inflammasome, however, it remains unclear how crystals induce cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that crystals of calcium oxalate, monosodium urate, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate and cystine trigger caspase-independent cell death in five different cell types, which is blocked by necrostatin-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA interference for receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) or mixed lineage kinase domain like (MLKL), two core proteins of the necroptosis pathway, blocks crystal cytotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, deficiency of RIPK3 or MLKL prevents oxalate crystal-induced acute kidney injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The related tissue inflammation drives TNF--related necroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in human oxalate crystal-related acute kidney injury, dying tubular cells stain positive for phosphorylated MLKL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, necrostatin-1 and necrosulfonamide, an inhibitor for human MLKL suppress crystal-induced cell death in human renal progenitor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, TNF-/TNFR1, RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL are molecular targets to limit crystal-induced cytotoxicity, tissue injury and organ failure.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Crystals are deposits of various sizes and shapes composed of atoms, ions or biomolecules, frequently with tissue injury, inflammation and remodelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two mechanisms may explain this association: (I) nucleation or crystal growth from a seed crystal formed on a surface medium, for example tubular epithelial cells, urolithiasis forming at Randalls plaques, calcifications in injured tendons, damaged cartilage or atheromatous vascular lesions, (II) crystal formation itself causes tissue injury and inflammation, for example in gouty arthritis, pulmonary silicosis or asbestosis, cholesterol crystals driving atherogenesis and in oxalate, cystine or urate nephropathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals trigger tissue inflammation via the NLRP3 inflammasome- and caspase-1-mediated secretion of IL-1 and IL-18 (refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, crystals also exert direct cytotoxic effects leading to necrotic rather than apoptotic cell death6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is still unknown, whether crystal deposition causes necrosis in a passive-mechanical or in one of the recently identified modalities of regulated cell death8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that crystal-induced tissue injury involves a regulated form of cell death and that the identification of this pathway may reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention that limit crystal-related tissue injury and organ dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that various crystals uniformly induce necroptosis, that is, a receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3- (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL)-dependent form of primary necrosis in vitro, in vivo and in human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data identify several molecular targets for pharmacological intervention to limit tissue injury in crystallopathies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Various crystals cause primary cellular necrosis', 'What is the mode of crystal-induced cell death?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this question we first studied the cytoxic effects of calcium oxalate (CaOx), monosodium urate (MSU), calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) and cystine crystals on kidney epithelial cells in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmission electron microscopy images and rhodamine-sytox stains to identify living and dead cells, respectively, showed that kidney tubular epithelial cells die by primary necrosis after crystal exposure (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we employed flow cytometry to better characterize the mode of CaOx-induced cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end sideward scatter, forward scatter, Hoechst 33342, annexin V, 1,1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate, and prodidium iodide were measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that CaOx crystals induced primary necrosis without signs of apoptosis (Fig 1b,c), evidenced by pan-caspase inhibition not affecting cytotoxicity of any of the aforementioned crystals (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also the kinetics of crystal cytotoxicity were caspase independent (Supplementary Fig 1A) and absence of NLRP3 did not affect CaOx crystal-induced cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, being a caspase-independent mode of cell death, excluded NLRP3-caspase-1/11-dependent pyroptosis10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that crystal cytotoxicity does not involve apoptosis or pyroptosis but largely represents primary cellular necrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Crystals induce primary cell necrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a): Various crystals were incubated with tubular epithelial cells as indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images show the crystal shapes at a magnification of × 1,000 (left), TEM images shows that these crystals induce necrosis of tubular epithelial cells as indicated by ruptured plasma membranes (middle, × 2,000), scale bar, 2 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Various crystals trigger cell death and inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While inflammation was traditionally thought to be secondary to tissue injury, the discovery of crystals being agonists of the

excluded this option as Nlrp3-deficiency or caspase blockade did not affect crystal cytotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Caspase blockade virtually also excluded apoptosis as another form of regulated cell death, which was consistent with our flow cytometry results and the results of a previously published report6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we found that the cytotoxicity of crystals involves necroptosis, an injury-driven form of regulated cell death driven by the phosphorylation of the pseudokinase MLKL13,14,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knockdown of RIPK3 and MLKL almost entirely abrogated crystal cytotoxicity in vitro, suggesting strongly that necroptosis is the predominant form of crystal-induced cell death13,14,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As further lines of evidence, lack of Ripk3 and Mlkl also almost entirely abrogated oxalate nephropathy in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data further support the concept that cell necrosis is the initial event of crystal-induced necroinflammation and that blocking necroptosis during the early stage of tissue injury is sufficient to prevent subsequent auto-amplification loop of inflammation, immune-mediated pathology and organ failure29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, RIPK3 is also involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation30, which is an important trigger of tissue inflammation in oxalate nephropathy5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note NLRP3 and ASC deficiency both lacked oxalate-induced kidney injury, and was exclusively mediated by intrarenal dendritic cells, which excludes any inflammasome signalling in non-immune kidney cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the in vivo phenotype of the RIPK3 knockout may also involve impaired NLRP3/ASC signalling in intrarenal dendritic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Providing evidence that necroptosis is also involved in human disease is difficult because the different forms of regulated necrosis cannot be distinguished by ultrastructural morphological criteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To resolve this issue we used immunostaining for phosphorylated MLKL, which suggests MLKL-dependent regulated necrosis also in human oxalate nephropathy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Necrostatin-1 keeps RIPK1 in an anti-necroptotic conformation and protected from crystal-induced cytotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As RIPK1 interacts with the intracellular domain of TNFR1 via its death domain31 and TNFR1-mediated necroptosis is considered a prototype of regulated necrosis8, it is tempting to speculate that RIPK1 loses its protective function against crystal-induced organ failure presumably by post-translational events, such as deubiquitination on TNFR1 ligation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, lack of TNFR1 or treatment with etanercept abrogated CN in vivo, but not crystal-induced cytotoxicity in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This should relate to the lack of direct interaction between crystals and TNFR1 and the absence of TNF- in the in vitro system (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, however, TNF- is secreted by infiltrating immune cells, which triggers necroptosis in additional cell populations secondary to the initial direct activation by crystals, thus contributing to the auto-amplification loop of necroinflammation29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The selective expression of TNF- and TNFR1 in tubules of human oxalate nephropathy implies a similar role also in human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'How exactly crystals trigger RIPK1 activation remains uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSU crystals can induce Syk signalling in dendritic cells via biding to lipid rafts32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSU crystals also affect signalling by binding to the surface receptor Clec12A but this interaction does not apply to other crystals33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via lysosomal leakage of cathepsins into the cytosol34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cathepsin B was reported to inhibit necroptosis by cleaving RIPK1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could also be an avenue of crystal-induced necroptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, crystal cytotoxicity involves necroptosis as a form of regulated cell death in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, also secondary TNF-driven necroptosis adds in (Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the therapeutic blockade of this pathway, for example, with soluble TNFR2-IgG fusion protein or the RIPK1 stabilizer necrostatin-1, can prevent crystal-induced tissue necrosis and organ dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings imply TNFR1, RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL being potential therapeutic targets to limit tissue injury in crystallopathies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 10: Schematic illustration of crystal-induced necroptosis and inflammation (necroinflammation).During crystallophathies, crystals are formed and deposited inside the organ, for example, kidney stone disease or joint, for example, gouty arthritis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon crystallization, crystals are phagocytized by parenchymal cells where they activate the RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL pathway of necroptosis, a prototype form of regulated necrosis, by inducing a series of phosphorylation events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular necroptosis lead to release of DAMPs, which activate immune cells surrounding the parenchymal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activated immune cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines, for example, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF- and so on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF- can also activate the RIPK1, RIPK3 and MLKL pathway of necroptosis via TNFR1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The auto-amplification loop between cell death and inflammation, called necroinflammation, leads to aggravation of tissue injury, and if remain uncontrolled then to organ failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current settings, the loop of crystal-induced necroinflammation can be blocked by using a
