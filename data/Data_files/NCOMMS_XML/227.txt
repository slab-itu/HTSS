Functional dissociation in sweet taste receptor neurons between and within taste organs of Drosophila  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Finding food sources is essential for survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insects detect nutrients with external taste receptor neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drosophila possesses multiple taste organs that are distributed throughout its body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the role of different taste organs in feeding remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By blocking subsets of sweet taste receptor neurons, we show that receptor neurons in the legs are required for immediate sugar choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we identify two anatomically distinct classes of sweet taste receptor neurons in the leg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The axonal projections of one class terminate in the thoracic ganglia, whereas the other projects directly to the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two classes are functionally distinct: the brain-projecting neurons are involved in feeding initiation, whereas the thoracic ganglia-projecting neurons play a role in sugar-dependent suppression of locomotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinct receptor neurons for the same taste quality may coordinate early appetitive responses, taking advantage of the legs as the first appendages to contact food.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Animals rely on sensory systems for survival and reproduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gustatory system is important for finding and evaluating food sources, but can also have other roles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Drosophila in particular, gustation is critical for mate and food selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mate selection requires specialized pheromone receptors in the legs of male flies1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Food selection is thought to involve the perception of multiple taste qualities, including bitter, sweet and salty tastants4,5,6,7,8,9, which promote or inhibit feeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Drosophila, tastants are detected by taste hairs and taste pegs, most of which house multiple gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs)10, with each neuron tuned to a specific taste quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike mammals, where the tongue is the primary taste organ, insect taste hairs are distributed throughout the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, Drosophila GRNs can be found in the labellum, pharynx, tarsi, wing margins and female ovipositor10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, the functional significance of different taste organs is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, even though Drosophila GRNs are broadly distributed in the body, their central nervous system (CNS) projections are grouped according to taste organ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Projections from the pharyngeal, labellar and tarsal GRNs are located in the anterior, medial and posterior gnathal ganglia (GNG), respectively7,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that flies are able to differentially process gustatory information depending on stimulus location, and thus produce different behavioural outputs for the same stimulus7,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, different sets of bitter taste receptor neurons in Drosophila are necessary for positional aversion and egg-laying preference15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Feeding is a complex sequence of behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila, feeding is initiated by food detection and followed by locomotion arrest, extension of the proboscis and ingestion16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a recent study reported that sweet taste receptors in the pharynx promote ingestion prolongation17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore reasonable to assume that external taste organs are involved in earlier stages of appetitive behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the decision to feed is made, the inhibition of other behaviours, such as locomotion, should occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent identification of interneurons that influence the decision between feeding and moving in the Drosophila larva18 and adult19 helps to explain why these behaviours are mutually exclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the contribution of taste receptor neurons in deciding between these two behaviours remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To better understand the role of different taste organs in appetitive behaviour, we targeted subsets of GRNs with the GAL4/upstream activating sequence (UAS) system20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected Drosophila lines8 expressing GAL4 under the control of various gustatory receptor promoters (Gr-GAL4) that have overlapping but distinct expression patterns in sweet taste receptor neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These lines differentially label the major Drosophila taste organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To characterize the function of these different sets of GRNs, we developed an assay that allows the quantification of multiple feeding behaviours under conditions that resemble natural foraging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then independently silenced subsets of GRNs and measured sugar preference in our assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that sweet taste receptor neurons in the tarsi are essential for sugar choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the tarsi, we identified two anatomically distinct populations of sweet taste receptor neurons that are involved in different appetitive behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results highlight a functional dissociation between and within taste organs of Drosophila.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hungry flies show rapid and robust sugar preference', 'We developed a simple behavioural paradigm, the sugar preference assay, to quantify early appetitive responses of fruit flies (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the sugar preference assay, we introduced freely walking flies into a circular arena, where they were allowed to choose between two sides: one with sugar and one without (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fly behaviour was video-recorded from above, allowing subsequent quantification of position and locomotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the wild-type Canton S strain to characterize the assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starved flies showed quick and robust responses to sucrose (Fig 1be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated preference indices (PIs) by automatically counting and subtracting the fly numbers on the sugar and non-sugar sides in a given video frame (Fig 1fi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plotting PI over time revealed that wild-type flies chose the sugar side within the first 2030 s, with PIs reaching a plateau thereafter (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore pooled the data between 30 and 60 s for each experiment, and simply refer to them as preference or PIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PIs were strongly dependent on the degree of starvation and sugar concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the average PI increased steadily between 2 and 8 h of starvation, and reached a plateau between 24 and 48 h (Fig 1j and Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the PI rose with increasing sucrose concentration for long-starved flies (20% mortality; Fig 1k and Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the high signal-to-noise ratio, we chose the long starvation/high sugar concentration conditions for the following experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The sugar preference assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of the experimental set-up used to measure sucrose preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (be) Examples of the distribution of starved (36 h) Canton S flies in the circular arena at various time points (560 s) after introduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 2-M sucrose solution was used for the sucrose side (lower semicircle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (fi) Same images as in be after applying a suitable threshold with the Fiji software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identified particles are in black.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (j) Starvation dependency of sucrose PI of Canton S flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 2-M sucrose solution was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n=812 per starvation interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (k) Concentration dependency of sucrose PI of Canton S flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Flies were starved to 20% mortality (average starvation time 40 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  n=1115 per concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are means±s.e.m.Full size image', 'Sweet GRNs in the legs are required for sugar preference', 'To examine the role of different taste organs in appetitive behaviour, we next chose to silence subsets of sweet taste receptor neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected seven Gr-GAL4 lines labelling GRNs that express sets of homologous sweet taste receptors (Fig 2a)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We drove expression of Kir2.1, an inward-rectifying potassium channel22, to electrically silence sweet taste receptor neurons by the specific Gr-driven GAL4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested flies for sugar preference (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that sugar preference was highly variable among the drivers, ranging from normal preference to complete impairment of sugar preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blockades with Gr61a-GAL4 and Gr64f-GAL4 abolished sucrose preference, and blocking with Gr64e-GAL4 caused a statistically significant decrease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand the observed differences, we examined the expression patterns of all GAL4 lines in the GNG and forelegs (Fig 2bo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our detailed anatomical analyses are consistent with a recent study23 and highlight three key findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, expression in the labellar nerve did not always yield strong sugar preference impairment (Gr64c-GAL4 and Gr5a-GAL4 in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, Gr64a-GAL4 specifically labelled pharyngeal GRN terminals (Fig 2d,k) but showed normal preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed anatomical analysis revealed that Gr64a-GAL4 and Gr64f-LexA co-labelled four cells in the labral sense organ (LSO), but did not label the ventral or dorsal cibarial sense organs (Supplementary Fig 2), in line with a recent study17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these LSO GRNs are not critical for sugar choice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, only Gr61a-GAL4 and Gr64f-GAL4, which labelled the maximum number of GRNs in the legs (12 cells, Fig 2n,o) showed abolished sugar preference on blockade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our results suggest that sweet taste receptor neurons in the legs, but not the labellum or LSO, are critical for sugar preference in Drosophila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Blocking specific subsets of sweet taste receptor neurons differentially affects sucrose preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Requirement of different sweet taste receptor neurons for sucrose preference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electrically silencing sweet taste receptor neurons in Gr61a-GAL4, Gr64e-GAL4 and Gr64f-GAL4 with constitutively active UAS-Kir2.1 impaired 2-M sucrose PI compared with genetic controls (KruskalWallis test;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Insects have multiple taste organs distributed throughout the body, but the functional significance of this organization has been unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore utilized sweet taste receptor neurons in Drosophila melanogaster as a model to study this question and showed that GRNs in different taste organs, or even within the same organ, have functional specialization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sweet taste receptor neurons in the legs, but not the labellum or LSO, are necessary for the early appetitive response to sugar (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a genetic subtraction approach (Fig 4) and three different paradigms of appetitive behaviour (Fig 5), we showed that the atGRNs, a small subset of tarsal GRNs, are critical for feeding initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other subset of tarsal sweet receptors that terminate in the VNC, stGRNs, control locomotion arrest on encountering sugar (Figs 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We devised a model of sugar preference, which predicts that both appetitive responses influence sugar preference and that loss of both is required to generate sugar-blind flies (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data demonstrate that the atGRNs and stGRNs are preferentially tuned to distinct facets of the early appetitive response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, more detailed characterization of the receptorligand relationships in the legs with regards to sugar choice should await further experimentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The roles of atGRNs and stGRNs are unlikely to be mutually exclusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the atGRNs may affect locomotion directly with collaterals in the VNC (for example, Figs 3f and 4f) and/or indirectly through PER, as proboscis extension was recently shown to negatively regulate walking19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, blocking stGRNs with Gr5a-GAL4 gave trends of impairment in sugar preference and PER (Figs 2 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The involvement of stGRNs in these behaviours is consistent with previous studies using activation and inhibition with Gr5a-GAL4 (refs 7, 31), suggesting that stGRNs can indirectly relay sweet taste information to the GNG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, sugar-induced suppression of walking is controlled by the stGRNs (Fig 7 and Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projection of the stGRNs terminates exclusively in the VNC (Fig 3), and may have better access to the VNC circuits that directly control locomotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we did not find direct connections between stGRN terminals and leg motor neurons, the stGRNs may suppress locomotion using unidentified local circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because detection of food promotes multiple behaviours, functional specialization in tarsal GRNs is an effective way to coordinate the initial responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that stGRNs are tuned to suppressing competing behaviours such as locomotion, while atGRNs promote the change to the feeding state through PER (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The importance of tarsal GRNs in sugar choice (Fig 2) fits well with the fact that legs are typically the first appendage to contact food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent physiology studies identified hypersensitive sweet taste GRNs in the fifth tarsal segment4,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to their innervation of taste hairs, these are likely the atGRNs (Fig 4c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrangement of GRNs that are sensitive and important for appetitive behaviour in the ventral tip of the tarsus is an appropriate cellular configuration, given the maximal accessibility to food.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct projection of the atGRNs to the GNG may further ensure rapid and efficient feeding initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bees also have taste hairs with very high sugar sensitivity in their tarsi32 and antennae33, which are presumably the first organs to detect nectar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another taste-driven behaviour, tapping of the female abdomen by male flies during courtship, involves GRNs specifically on the dorsal area of the forelegs34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these examples suggest that optimization of taste hair position with respect to function is a general principle in insect gustation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tarsal GRNs are stimulated as soon as a fly steps on tastants and may therefore be important for early gustatory responses across taste qualities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, bitter GRNs in the legs, but not the proboscis, are required for aversion to a bitter chemical15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, GRNs in the labellum and pharynx come into play in later stages of feeding and may have distinct functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this idea, sweet taste receptor neurons in the LSO and ventral cibarial sense organ drive food choice in a longer-lasting (2 h) assay, presumably by prolonging ingestion17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the GRNs in the labellum might be necessary to guide the mouth part to a food source more accurately or to open the labial palps with greater efficiency than that observed after tarsal stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because taste organs are differentially represented in the brain35 and send projections to discrete clusters in the CNS7,14, they most likely contribute to distinct aspects of feeding behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies focusing on fine neuronal manipulations, detailed characterization of appetitive behaviours and a mechanistic view of their interplay will promote understanding of the neuroethology of feeding.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
