Non-invasive imaging using reporter genes altering cellular water permeability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Non-invasive imaging of gene expression in live, optically opaque animals is important for multiple applications, including monitoring of genetic circuits and tracking of cell-based therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could enable such monitoring with high spatiotemporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, existing MRI reporter genes based on metalloproteins or chemical exchange probes are limited by their reliance on metals or relatively low sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce a new class of MRI reporters based on the human water channel aquaporin 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that aquaporin overexpression produces contrast in diffusion-weighted MRI by increasing tissue water diffusivity without affecting viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low aquaporin levels or mixed populations comprising as few as 10% aquaporin-expressing cells are sufficient to produce MRI contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We characterize this new contrast mechanism through experiments and simulations, and demonstrate its utility in vivo by imaging gene expression in tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results establish an alternative class of sensitive, metal-free reporter genes for non-invasive imaging.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The ability to image gene expression within the context of living mammalian organisms is critical for basic biological studies and the development of cellular and genetic therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most genetically encoded reporters, based on fluorescent and luminescent proteins1,2,3 have limited utility in this context due to the poor penetration of light into deep tissues4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to optical techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables the acquisition of in vivo images with excellent depth penetration and high spatial and temporal resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, there is intense interest in the development of genetically encoded reporters for MRI6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous efforts to develop such reporters have focused primarily on two classes of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one class, metalloproteins and metal ion transporters are overexpressed to enrich the paramagnetic content of cells, thereby enhancing nuclear relaxation rates and producing contrast in T1- or T2-weighted MRI9,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second strategy, proteins with large numbers of basic or acidic amino acids are used to generate contrast through chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) between protein-bound and aqueous protons6,8,21,22,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these pioneering approaches has significant limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metal-based reporters can be hindered by metal ion bioavailability and toxicity29,30,31,32,33,34,35, whereas CEST reporters tend to require high expression levels to achieve observable contrast6,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, a major need exists for new MRI reporter genes that do not require metals and can be detected at low levels of expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we introduce an entirely new class of non-metallic MRI reporter genes that work by modulating water diffusivity across cell membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a well-established MRI technique used in applications ranging from basic biophysical studies to the diagnosis of diseases such as stroke36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffusion-weighting is commonly achieved by applying a pair of pulsed magnetic field gradients, which dephase nuclear spins in proportion to how far they diffuse in the time interval between the two pulses41,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, water molecules that diffuse more freely have more severely dephased proton spins and appear darker in DWI (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In biological tissues, the effective diffusion coefficient of water depends on several parameters, including its local diffusivity in intracellular and extracellular compartments, the relative volume fraction occupied by cells and the transport of water across the plasma membrane46,47,48,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noting the strong influence of the last factor46,51,52, we hypothesized that facilitating the transmembrane diffusion of water by overexpressing water-permeable channels would result in enhanced contrast in DWI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: AQP1 functions as a genetically encoded reporter for diffusion-weighted MRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Illustration of the impact of aquaporin expression on water diffusion across the cell membrane and the resulting decrease in diffusion-weighted signal intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Diffusion-weighted images of CHO, U87 and Neuro 2a cell pellets expressing AQP1 or GFP, acquired using a b-value of 1,000 s mm2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 3 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) ADC of water in CHO, U87 and Neuro 2a cells expressing AQP1 relative to GFP controls, measured at eff=398 ms.

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Aquaporins serve as reporters for diffusion-weighted MRI', 'To evaluate AQP1 as a genetically encoded reporter for diffusion-weighted MRI (Fig 1a), we used lentiviral transfection to generate CHO, U87 glioblastoma and Neuro 2a neuroblastoma cell lines stably overexpressing this channel, and corresponding control cells expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of AQP1 and GFP were driven by identical constitutive cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters in U87 and Neuro 2a cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To implement chemogenetic control of gene expression, we used a doxycycline-regulated CMV promoter in CHO cells engineered to stably express the tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pellets of AQP1- and GFP-expressing CHO, U87 glioblastoma and Neuro 2a neuroblastoma cells were then imaged using DWI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key parameter in diffusion-weighted pulse sequences is the effective diffusion time, eff, corresponding to the time interval between dephasing and rephasing gradient pulses36,37,45,46,49,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long eff times are important for probing the effects of water exchange between intracellular and extracellular pools because longer times allow a larger proportion of cytoplasmic water molecules to interact with the cell membrane and experience the effects of restriction and exchange36,37,48,49,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, Monte Carlo simulations of a packed cellular lattice suggested that the effects of an aquaporin-mediated increase in water diffusion would be most pronounced at eff greater than 100 ms (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We accessed these longer diffusion times using stimulated echo DWI46,59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pellets of AQP1-expressing cells appeared much darker in diffusion-weighted images compared with GFP controls for all cell types (Fig 1b), corresponding to dramatic increases in their apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs, Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measured with eff=398 ms, AQP1-expressing CHO, U87 and Neuro 2a cells showed 187±12%, 82±5% and 95±3% increases in ADC, respectively, relative to GFP controls (P less_than 104, n4, t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative increase in ADC was less pronounced using a shorter diffusion time (eff=18 ms, Supplementary Fig 2), consistent with a contrast mechanism based on water exchange across the cell membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The larger change in ADC in CHO cells compared with Neuro 2a and U87 is likely to be a consequence of the lower basal ADC in control CHO cells (377.57±20.86 m2 s1 at eff=398 ms) compared with control Neuro 2a and U87 cells (539.69±11 and 479.25±21.23 m2 s1, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish orthogonality to paramagnetic reporters, we measured the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of cells expressing AQP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of this protein did not affect T1 or T2 relaxation (Fig 1d,e, not significant, P greater than 0.24, n=3, t-test), suggesting that AQP1 could be used in combination with genetically encoded T1 or T2 contrast agents for multiplexed imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, AQP1 overexpression was non-toxic in all cell lines, as determined using four different assays, including ethidium homodimer staining, measurement of cytosolic ATP content, metabolic activity and lactate dehydrogenase release (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, no changes in cell morphology were observed under phase contrast microscopy as a result of AQP1 expression (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that we were also able to obtain a significant increase in ADC by transfecting cells with another human aquaporin, AQP4 (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the percentage increase in ADC for the AQP4-expressing cells (44±6% in CHO cells, P=6.2 × 103, n=3, t-test) was smaller compared with AQP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we focused on AQP1 for the remainder of this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'AQP1 is a sensitive reporter gene with a large dynamic range', 'Next, we sought to establish the sensitivity of AQP1 to image varying degrees of gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Monte Carlo simulations suggested that ADC values are sensitive to a broad range of cell membrane permeabilities (Supplementary Fig 1b), providing AQP1 with significant dynamic range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To realize this experimentally, we expressed AQP1 in a dose-dependent manner by supplementing CHO cells with varying concentrations of doxycycline and imaged them with DWI (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corresponding levels of AQP1 expression were quantified via western blotting and measurements of internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-linked GFP fluorescence (Fig 2c and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant increase in ADC was observed across all levels of induction, with differences of 54±5 to 187±12% (P6.8 × 103, n3, t-test) compared with controls at doxycycline concentrations of 0.011 g ml1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the 54% change in contrast corresponds to an estimated AQP1 expression level of just 457±102 nM, consistent with simulation predictions (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high sensitivity and large dynamic range will facilitate the use of AQP1 as a reporter gene in a variety of biomedical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

'AQP1 expression is observable in cells in a mixed population', 'The ability to specifically detect small numbers of genetically labelled cells in an otherwise unlabelled population would enable the use of genetically encoded reporters in applications such as in vivo tracking of cell-based therapeutics16,61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having shown that AQP1 can appreciably increase water diffusion even at low levels of expression (Fig 2), we tested whether apparent water diffusion could be significantly increased if AQP1 expression was restricted to a small subset of cells in a mixed population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intuitively, the relationship between the aquaporin-expressing fraction and water diffusion is expected to be nonlinear, as in small-fraction scenarios cells expressing aquaporin would be surrounded mostly by cells without enhanced water permeability, and the impact of aquaporin expression on overall tissue diffusivity would thereby be diminished (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our Monte Carlo simulations predicted that AQP1-expressing fractions as small as 10% should be sufficient to measurably increase the apparent diffusivity (Fig 3b and Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify this experimentally, we imaged mixed populations of AQP1- and GFP-expressing CHO cells in varying proportions (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this revealed significant contrast and increase in ADC in cell populations containing just 10% AQP1-expressing cells (21.44±5.21% increase relative to all-GFP controls, P=0.03, n=4, t-test; Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This data suggests that, contrary to initial intuition, diffusional reporter genes such as AQP1 are suitable for imaging gene expression in heterogeneous or infiltrating cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results establish aquaporins, and specifically AQP1, as the first genetically encoded reporter for diffusion-weighted MRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AQP1-dependent contrast is readily observed in cell cultures, including cells known to have higher levels of endogenous aquaporins (for example, U87 glioblastoma cells65) as well as in vivo tumour xenografts, and AQP1 expression has no adverse effect on cell proliferation and viability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aquaporins have several distinct advantages relative to existing MRI reporter genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, as a metal-free reporter, aquaporins are not limited by metal bioavailability and do not require the administration of metal ions or chelates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, AQP1-dependent contrast can be detected at reasonably low concentrations (0.5 M), which makes it a sensitive MRI reporter gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CEST reporters operating on hyperpolarized xenon can achieve even higher molecular sensitivity24,66, their use requires elaborate equipment for xenon hyperpolarization and administration, and in the case of gas vesicles, the expression of complex multi-gene clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, successful CEST experiments require sophisticated pulse sequences, whereas diffusion-weighted imaging is implemented as a standard technique on clinical MRI scanners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, as a human protein that works without sequence modifications, aquaporin can serve as a fully autologous reporter gene, overcoming concerns about potential immunogenicity faced by xenogeneic and engineered reporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'AQP1 expression does not affect transverse and longitudinal relaxation rates in cells, which creates the possibility of multiplexed MRI of gene expression by combining aquaporins with existing T1, T2 or CEST reporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, it is conceivable that increased water diffusion in AQP1-expressing cells could enhance the relaxivity of co-localized T1 or T2 agents by facilitating paramagnetic relaxation of a larger fraction of water molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One potential limitation of aquaporin as a reporter gene is its negative contrast enhancement, as AQP1 expression results in image darkening in diffusion-weighted MRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although negative contrast agents are widely established in MRI, their use warrants a certain degree of caution in light of potential confounding signal dropout from lesions, abscesses and susceptibility artefacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of aquaporin, confounds from T1 and T2 relaxation can be accounted for by mapping ADC rather than acquiring single diffusion-weighted images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To distinguish aquaporin expression from tissue structures with high background diffusivity, such as fluid-filled cysts and necrotic lesions, it may be necessary to combine information from ADC measurements at several eff times and from T1- and/or T2-weighted images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemogenetic toggling of aquaporin expression, trafficking or degradation could also help identify reporter gene-dependent signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, although we have demonstrated the application of AQP1 as a non-toxic MRI reporter in three different cell lines and in vivo tumours, the broader utility of this reporter gene in the context of different cell types and tissue architectures (for example, epithelial cells and neurons) and alternative biological applications, remains to be investigated in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the ubiquity of DWI and stimulated echo pulse sequences, the imaging of aquaporin-based reporters can be implemented immediately by laboratories with standard MRI equipment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond this, imaging performance could potentially be improved further using alternative pulse sequences specifically designed to produce contrast sensitive to transmembrane water exchange60, the further development of which will be stimulated by this work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we anticipate that the performance of aquaporins as MRI reporters can be further enhanced through molecular engineering of variants with improved or stimulus-gated permeability to enable functional imaging of biologically relevant markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the high performance, biocompatibility and engineering capacity of aquaporin reporter genes will enable this remarkably simple new approach to biomolecular MRI to impact many areas of biology and medicine.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#
