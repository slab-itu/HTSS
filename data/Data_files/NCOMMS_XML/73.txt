The matrix protein Fibulin-5 is at the interface of tissue stiffness and inflammation in fibrosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fibrosis is a pervasive disease in which the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) compromises tissue function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the underlying mechanisms are mostly unknown, matrix stiffness is increasingly appreciated as a contributor to fibrosis rather than merely a manifestation of the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the loss of Fibulin-5, an elastic fibre component, not only decreases tissue stiffness, but also diminishes the inflammatory response and abrogates the fibrotic phenotype in a mouse model of cutaneous fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing matrix stiffness raises the inflammatory response above a threshold level, independent of TGF-, to stimulate further ECM secretion from fibroblasts and advance the progression of fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that Fibulin-5 may be a therapeutic target to short-circuit this profibrotic feedback loop.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A hallmark of fibrosis is the secretion of excessive fibrous connective tissue, which is associated with a multitude of diseases leading to organ failure1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical event in the development of fibrosis is the aberrant and sustained activation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Myofibroblasts produce elevated levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) and secreted factors, which provides both mechanical and biochemical cues that influence the function of neighbouring cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formation of a dense fibrous tissue in the affected area increases the local tissue stiffness3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fibroblast activation is part of the normal response to tissue damage and its activity is immediately terminated on completion of repair.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in progressive fibrotic pathology, myofibroblasts remain activated and persistently contribute to excessive ECM deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research in vitro suggests a connection between matrix stiffness and fibrogenesis4,5,6, but the mechanisms by which matrix mechanical properties contribute to fibrosis is an open question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To probe the functional contribution of tissue stiffness to fibrosis, we used a transgenic mouse, which expresses the transcription factor Snail in the epidermis of the skin and exhibits features of fibrotic skin7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Snail transgenic (Snail Tg) skin expresses elevated levels of Fibulin-5, an ECM protein involved in the formation of elastic fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the loss of Fibulin-5 was sufficient to decrease tissue stiffness, attenuate fibroblast activation, and avert the fibrotic changes in the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that the abrogation of the fibrotic phenotype is accomplished through the dampening of the inflammatory response, which is an established prerequisite for fibrosis progression8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reveal how dysregulation of the ECM, independent of TGF- signalling, provides a favourable microenvironment for fibrogenesis wherein reciprocal exchange of signals between fibroblasts and immune cells sustain fibroblast activation that fuels fibrogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Stiff skin in neonatal Snail Tg mice', 'The Snail transgenic mouse exhibits a significant increase in the thickness of the dermal compartment of the skin as early as postnatal day 9 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in dermal thickness was accompanied by excessive accumulation of the major ECM components, collagen and elastin (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of elastic fibres and collagen became progressively more pronounced in the adult transgenic skin (Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also examined whether the early signs of the increase in the dermal contents of ECM proteins can increase tissue stiffness, which would reduce the compliance of organs and ultimately compromise its function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stiffness of the skin tissue was determined using stressstrain measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average tangent modulus quantified for both low (elastin) and high (collagen) strains9,10,11 were found to be significantly higher for Snail Tg compared with wild-type (WT) skin (Fig 1d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 1: The Snail transgenic skin exhibits increased tissue stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Left: haematoxylin and eosin-stained P9 skin sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 200 m.

whether Fibulin-5 can impact epidermal hyperplasia by modulating the inflammatory response in the Snail transgenic skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dermis in the Snail Tg skin showed elevated levels of

the Snail Tg mouse', 'Since the depletion of Fibulin-5 lowers the stiffness of the skin of the Snail Tg mouse, we tested the potential role of tissue stiffness in establishing a robust inflammatory microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammation is an indispensable component in the initiation of fibrosis, but thus far tissue stiffness is primarily viewed as a consequence, and not a major cause of this pathological condition8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To first establish whether the inflammatory response observed in the Snail Tg skin contributes to the cutaneous fibrosis, we treated the skin of the Snail Tg mouse with clobetasol propionate, a commonly used anti-inflammatory regimen18, and this caused a significant reduction in the infiltration of immune cells (Fig 4ac and Supplementary Fig 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our previous results linking inflammation and epidermal hyperplasia7, the thickness of the Snail transgenic epidermis was reduced on the clobetasol treatment (Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, collagen (Fig 4f), elastin (Fig 4g) and Fibulin-5 (Supplementary Fig 3e) contents were also significantly reduced after immunosuppression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickness of the dermal compartment of the skin was likewise reduced when inflammation was decreased (Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results illustrate the positive feedback loop that exists between the inflammatory response and ECM proteins that coordinately elevates both inflammation and tissue stiffness to a critical level that facilitates fibrogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

other biochemical hallmarks of fibrosis were affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemical analysis reveals that the number of cells positive for smooth muscle actin (SMA), and other markers of activated fibroblasts, was significantly elevated in the skin of the Snail Tg mouse and decreased in the absence of Fibulin-5 (Fig 5a,b and Supplementary Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the effect of diminishing fibrosis in the Snail transgenic mouse lacking Fibulin-5 occurred through the loss of inflammation, we hypothesized that an anti-inflammatory regimen would phenocopy the genetic ablation of Fibulin-5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the effect of removing Fibulin-5, the skin of the Snail Tg mouse treated with clobetasol showed decreased expression levels of fibroblast activation-related genes compared with the vehicle control (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that Fibulin-5 depletion attenuated fibrosis formation partly through the diminished activity of dermal

observations of the role of Fibulin-5 in recruiting macrophages, T cells and mast cells into the skin of the Snail Tg mouse (Fig 4ac), we focused our attention on the mechanism by which an ECM protein can influence an inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found several chemokine genes such as CXCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL16 that are upregulated in the skin of the Snail Tg mouse and are significantly diminished on loss of Fibulin-5 (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, although TGF- has been regarded as a primary regulator of fibrogenesis4, expression of all three isoforms was not upregulated in our fibrosis model (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results prompted us to investigate the possibility that the Fibulin-5-dependent increase in tissue stiffness is an important contributor to the generation of a robust inflammatory response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, fibroblasts have been revealed to play a role as a hub of inflammation8,19 and we hypothesized that secreted factors from the Snail Tg epidermis work synergistically with matrix stiffness to elevate inflammatory cytokine expression in dermal fibroblasts to a critical threshold level conducive to fibrogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first tested whether dermal fibroblasts treated with conditioned media from Snail Tg keratinocytes can induce chemokine gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Snail conditioned media was capable of inducing the expression of the same chemokines in fibroblasts that are induced in the Snail Tg mouse in vivo (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this experiment was performed on cells cultured on a plastic tissue culture plate, which has a stiffness that far exceeds what is found in normal or pathological tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether subtle changes in tissue stiffnessas documented in both the development of fibrosis in diseased human tissues, as well as the skin of the neonatal Snail Tg mousecould contribute to the strength of the inflammatory response mounted by dermal fibroblasts, we cultured cells on hydrogels with defined stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish the baseline level of inflammatory gene expression, we plated fibroblasts on soft hydrogel with a stiffness of 2 kPa, which is within the range of stiffness for normal human dermis20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mimic the 2.5-fold increase in tissue stiffness of the skin of the Snail Tg mouse (Fig 2e), we plated cells on a hard hydrogel with a stiffness of 5 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fold induction of chemokine genes in response to Snail conditioned media was significantly higher on the stiffer hydrogel than that on the soft hydrogel (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the small change (2.5-fold) in matrix stiffness was sufficient to enhance the response of dermal fibroblasts to pro-inflammatory signals, leading to upregulation of chemokine gene expression levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However this small change was insufficient to induce TGF- gene expression (Supplementary Fig 5b) or Smad2/3 phosphorylation, which is a downstream effect of TGF- signalling (Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we observed an increase in Smad2/3 phosphorylation level in the Snail Tg skin as seen in fibrotic tissues4, Fibulin-5 depletion only reduced this increase by 25% (Supplementary Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, a TGF- receptor inhibitor (SB-431542) did not affect the chemokine gene induction (Fig 6c), implying that the influence of Fibulin-5 on the production of inflammatory cytokines in dermal fibroblasts is independent of TGF- signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the approximately twofold difference in chemokine expression levels between the soft and hard hydrogels (Fig 6c) is comparable to the two to threefold difference in their in vivo expression levels between the skin of the Snail Tg mouse with or without Fibulin-5 (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of its effect on tissue stiffness, an alternative explanation for the ability of Fibulin-5 to reverse the fibrotic phenotype in the Snail transgenic mouse could be its direct effect on epidermal keratinocytes and/or dermal fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this possibility was ruled out by the following findings: (i) dermal fibroblasts retained their ability to induce chemokine gene expression in response to conditioned media from Snail Tg keratinocytes regardless of the presence or absence of the Fibulin-5 gene (Supplementary Fig 6a); (ii) dermal fibroblasts freshly isolated from either Snail Tg skin or Snail Tg/Fibulin-5 KO skin exhibited similar levels of response to the conditioned media from Snail Tg keratinocytes or WT fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig 6b); and (iii) conditioned media from the Snail Tg and Snail Tg/Fibulin-5 KO epidermis induced similar levels of chemokine gene expression in fibroblasts, indicating that pro-inflammatory signals from epidermis were not affected by Fibulin-5 expression in epidermis (Supplementary Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 6: Chemokine gene expression with varying stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Quantitative PCR (qPCR) of chemokine genes in the whole skin of P9 mice.

'As collagen accounts for 75% of the ECM proteins in the skin, a large body of research has focused on collagen as a major constituent in fibrotic tissue but scant attention has been paid to the role(s) of elastic fibres, which accounts for 8% of cutaneous ECM27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elastic fibres are abundantly deposited in fibrotic skin29, and our data suggests that they play two interrelated roles in the fibrosis: tissue stiffening and inflammation, and together these conspire to promote the progression of fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of Fibulin-5 is known to cause impairment of elastic fibre formation without obvious alterations in the status of collagen14,15, which was consistent with our observation that Fibulin-5 depletion did not alter the elevated collagen content in the neonatal skin of the Snail Tg mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several other constituents of elastic fibres are involved in the progression of fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LTBP-4 was recently identified to promote elastic fibre assembly by interacting with Fibulin-5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LTBP-4 was originally found as a latent TGF--binding protein that sequesters the profibrotic cytokine TGF- regulating its availability for binding to the TGF- receptor and its mutation has been found to cause fibrosis in muscle31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another profibrotic effect was found in the mutation of integrin-binding domain of fibrillin-1, which is the main constituent of extracellular microfibrils in elastic fibres32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings imply the critical role elastic fibres play not only in conferring physical properties of the matrix but also in modulating signalling pathways relevant for fibrogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alterations in Fibulin-5 protein function have thus far not been reported to cause profibrotic effects, and our work provides the first in vivo evidence elastic fibre assembly can regulate important cytokine gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Published research has established that normal lung and skin tissues have elastic moduli of  less_than 2 kPa and these tissues increase their stiffness by approximately twofold in a drug-induced fibrosis model6,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this pathophysiologically relevant range, our data demonstrated that a 2.5-fold increase in matrix stiffness (2 to 5 kPa) was sufficient to enhance the response of dermal fibroblasts to pro-inflammatory signals, leading to an enhanced chemokine gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, this small increase in matrix stiffness documented in pathological tissues was not sufficient to induce the expression of TGF- ligands nor augment TGF- signal transduction through Smad2/3 phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was surprising given the preponderance of evidence implicating TGF- signalling in tissue fibrosis4 although several TGF- signalling independent mechanisms of fibrogenesis have been suggested34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results therefore reveal additional novel players in fibrogenesis and shed light on possible reasons why TGF- inhibition alone has not been providing promising results in clinical trials of diseases marked by tissue fibrosis2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The blockade of immune cell recruitment with clobetasol, a potent corticosteroid, completely abrogated the fibrosis programme, emphasizing the role of inflammation as an indispensable primer for fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, inflammation is not only important in fibrogenesis, but in the maintenance of the fibrotic phenotype as a partial resolution of skin symptoms was achieved in patients with the fibrotic skin disease known as diffuse systemic sclerosis treated with dexamethasone pulse therapy35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that the inflammatory response can be initiated by alterations in epithelial homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the expression of members of the Snail family of transcription factors is a common cellular response to multiple types of cellular stress that perturb tissue homeostasis36,37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate how the inflammatory response, which is activated by epithelial stress signals, is further potentiated by increasing tissue stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interdependence of inflammation and tissue stiffness further comprises a positive feedback loop wherein the inflammatory response subsequently stimulates the elevated production of ECM proteins in dermal fibroblasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings aid in understanding the vicious cycle between inflammation and tissue stiffening, which has been anticipated to drive fibrogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our data imply that interventions to ameliorate tissue stiffness though ECM protein levels may halt this self-sustaining fibrotic process and Fibulin-5 involved in the stiffening of fibrotic tissue may serve as a therapeutic target for progressive fibrosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
