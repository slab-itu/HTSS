Identifying causal gateways and mediators in complex spatio-temporal systems  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Identifying regions important for spreading and mediating perturbations is crucial to assess the susceptibilities of spatio-temporal complex systems such as the Earths climate to volcanic eruptions, extreme events or geoengineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here a data-driven approach is introduced based on a dimension reduction, causal reconstruction, and novel network measures based on causal effect theory that go beyond standard complex network tools by distinguishing direct from indirect pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applied to a data set of atmospheric dynamics, the method identifies several strongly uplifting regions acting as major gateways of perturbations spreading in the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, the method provides a stricter statistical approach to pathways of atmospheric teleconnections, yielding insights into the PacificIndian Ocean interaction relevant for monsoonal dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also for neuroscience or power grids, the novel causal interaction perspective provides a complementary approach to simulations or experiments for understanding the functioning of complex spatio-temporal systems with potential applications in increasing their resilience to shocks or extreme events.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A complex systems susceptibility to perturbations may crucially depend on where such a perturbation enters the system and how it is propagated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the climate system, perturbations such as volcanic eruptions, extreme events1,2 or anthropogenic manipulations such as air pollution and geoengineering3,4 may have very different global effects if the region they occur in is strongly connected globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The huge volcanic eruption of Mt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pinatubo in June 1991 had a large impact on global climate5 also because it is located in a climatologically sensitive region tied to atmospheric teleconnections, the tropical western Pacific6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, epileptic seizures in the brain7, blackouts in power grids8,9, epidemic spreading10,11 or the failure of certain banks in the financial system12,13 are key examples where subprocesses have a high cumulative effect on the whole complex system when perturbed, making them gateways of external influences spreading in the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How can such subprocesses or regions be identified?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through which subprocesses are perturbations mainly mediated?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These questions are key for understanding the dynamics and functioning of these systems, predicting their behaviour under perturbations and could help to make them more resilient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One way to address this problem is via active experiments, for example invasive brain stimulations in neuroscience (bearing ethical concerns) or by computer simulations, for example, in epidemic spreading models11 or tracer experiments in climate14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such simulations are, however, only possible if the underlying physical equations are known and even then the corresponding calculations, for example in climate research, are computationally expensive and may not adequately represent important processes15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we follow the complementary approach of using the data alone to retrieve information about the interaction dynamics of the complex system (exploiting passive or natural experiments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data-driven analysis within the framework of complex networks16 is a very active field of current research and has, among others, been applied to study the structure and function of complex systems in neuroscience17,18,19,20 and more recently also in climate research21,22,23,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To identify how important individual subprocesses are in spreading and mediating perturbations in such spatio-temporal complex systems with time series typically given on a spatial grid, the subprocesses or nodes first need to be reconstructed since the gridded time series are often not the variables of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, the analysis should be based on a network that more faithfully than pairwise statistical associations represents possible pathways of perturbation propagation, requiring a causal definition of network links able to distinguish direct from indirect interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Last, even if all links in a network were established to be statistically causal, the toolbox of classical network measures is not rich enough for quantifying gateways and mediators of perturbations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Essentially, these measureswith many originating from the social sciences27are based on a different definition of links, for example, two persons knowing each other, as opposed to dynamical interactions in a complex system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, what is needed are quantitative measures that take into account the relative importance of causal pathways on which perturbations propagate in a complex systems interaction network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we present such an approach based on three steps: First, a dimension reduction of a gridded data set using the Varimax approach28,29 to a set of components representing relevant subprocesses defining the networks nodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, a (multivariate) causal reconstruction of the networks links based on a causal discovery algorithm30,31,32 and, thirdly, a causal interaction quantification utilizing Pearls causal effect theory33,34,35 to construct a causally weighted directed network on which we define network measures that are better suited for quantifying key regions of causal perturbation spread and mediation compared to classical network measures such as the node degree and betweenness centrality36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent to which such a data-driven analysis allows for a causal interpretation depends on the included variables, time resolution of the data and assumptions such as stationarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate the potentials of our method on a global data set of surface pressure as a representative characteristic of atmospheric variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applied to test specific hypotheses, we find that within this pressure system the climatic interaction mechanism between the East Pacific limb of the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)37,38, and the Arabian Sea region, relevant for the Indian Monsoon system, is mainly mediated via the Indonesian archipelago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This application of our method also incorporates more rigorously the concept of atmospheric teleconnections, which were previously defined based on pairwise correlations39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As an exploratory tool, the method identifies several strongly uplifting regions of major convergence of low-level air masses and high-level air uplifts above the tropical oceans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These subprocesses integrate incoming perturbations at the surface and transport them vertically into the higher troposphere from which they again influence other surface processes via atmospheric downdrafts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism explains the key importance of these regions as gateways of perturbation spread along causal pathways in the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach is of substantial value for several applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In climate research it may allow to more efficiently allocate resources to understand, monitor and forecast these important subprocesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For other applications, like epileptic seizure prevention, it may help to more reliably identify which brain regions are seizure foci to concentrate counter measures on.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, the novel causal interaction perspective provides a complementary first-step approach towards model simulations and experiments to better understand the dynamics and functioning of complex spatio-temporal systems and may help to inform design and engineering processes aiming at increasing their resilience.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dimension reduction and causal reconstruction', 'In the following, we explain and illustrate each of the three steps (see Fig 1) with a climate example.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More technical details are given in Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic representation of our proposed approach illustrated for the complex system Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Climatological variables such as sea-level pressure or surface temperature are typically provided as time series at locations on a regular grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) In the first step of our approach, a Varimax-dimension reduction yields a small set of regional components (here denoted by X, Y, ) representing climatological subprocesses with corresponding time series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) In the second step of our approach, this smaller set of variables allows for a reconstruction of the causal network (black links, labels denote time lags).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important pitfall in non-causal networks (as constructed from pairwise association measures such as cross-correlation) is that links can be spurious due to a common driving by another process or due to transitivity effects leading to indirect paths (grey dashed arrows in c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perturbations cannot propagate along common-driver links (for example, between X and Z1) affecting network measures like the degree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, indirect paths such as from X to Y affect shortest path lengths in non-causal networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) In the third step of our approach, the aim is to directly quantify the causal effect between pairs of components based on the causal network (Tigramite approach) and detect through which components and how much the causal effect is mediated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the linear framework studied here this can be achieved by causal effect measures based on suitable link weights, where the weight of a link, for example XW1, indicates the causal effect of a 1 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  perturbation in X on W1 (see Fig 3b for a formula relating link weights to causal effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binary causal networks do not properly account for different link strengths which affects classical network measures (grey highlights in d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis can be used to test specific hypotheses, but also to construct aggregate node measures (e) to identify components with high cumulative causal effect either as sources (causal gateways) or as intermediate nodes on causal pathways (causal mediators).Full size image', 'In climate research, spatio-temporal data sets are typically given on a regular grid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we consider a reanalysis data set of surface pressures41 for the period 19482012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a resolution of 2.5¬∞ in latitude and longitude, the data set consists of 10,512 grid points with 3,339 samples for each time series on a weekly timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But towards an interpretation of perturbation propagation or information transfer42, such individual grid points are not the entity of interest, because they do not represent distinct climatological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, processes like ENSO require a special decomposition of the data fields for an efficient description of their spatio-temporal structure43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also from a statistical perspective, a large number of variables with comparatively few observations presents an estimation problem44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first step of our approach, therefore, is aimed at obtaining a small set of components that represent relevant subprocesses of the complex system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We choose Varimax-rotated principal components28,45 here, combined with a subsequent significance test29,46 to exclude components merely representing noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the atmospheric pressure data set, this dimension reduction algorithm yields a set of 60 components (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methods and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown for selected components in Fig 2 (all components shown in Supplementary Figs 1, 2), the corresponding regions well represent several important climatological subprocesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As further discussed in Methods, all components are anomalized (seasonal cycle removed from the mean and variance) and standardized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we study intraseasonal interactions at a weekly time resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Dimension reduction of an atmospheric data set.Map of the 60 Varimax components, enumerated from 0 to 59 (grey nodes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The colour of the surrounding line identifies the parts belonging to one component, sometimes several regions belong to one component (examples include dipole patterns).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some components can be associated with well-known climatic processes like the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation37 (ENSO, No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  0 representing the western uplift and No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 the eastern downdraft limbs), or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO, No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5 with a pronounced dipole structure over the Icelandic Low and the Azores High).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others are related to global monsoon systems: No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33 in the Arabian Sea high-surface-pressure sector of the Indian Monsoon region53 and No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26 in the tropical Atlantic West African Monsoon system43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not all components are regionally confined, for example, No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53 with loadings in the South Atlantic as well as in the Himalayas.Full size image', 'Given that an external perturbation occurs in one of these components representing a certain subprocess: On which paths can it propagate and which other subprocesses can it possibly reach?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suppose a perturbation enters in subprocess X in the example in Fig 1c, then it can only reach nodes further downstream on causal paths like W1, W2 and Y, but not Z1, even though they are statistically associated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such spurious links can be unveiled by causal discovery algorithms30,47 which iteratively test whether an association can be explained by another process in the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that this notion of causality is only to be interpreted with respect to the included variables and unobserved drivers can still cause spurious links.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The causal reconstruction steps are detailed in Methods (see also Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In essence, for the second step of our approach we employ a causal discovery algorithm adapted to time series31,32 and a subsequent thresholding step to study the robustness of all further analyses at different link densities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach yields the causal time series graph31,32,48 which is a special type of a graphical model49 and encodes the conditional dependencies of the components at different time lags.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the example of the ENSOIndian Ocean teleconnection studied next, Fig 3 depicts two different representations: Fig 3b shows the time series graph on which causal paths and the measures of causal effect (the third step of our approach) are based, while the aggregated causal network shown in Fig 3a can be better visualized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Results for the teleconnection between ENSO and the Indian Ocean

we consider time lags up to max=4 weeks, since we are interested in atmospheric interactions where dependencies typically decay within a month50, but our results are robust also for longer time lags.

not taken into account here since they are not regarded as causal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, we discuss results for a link density of 20% in the causal network consisting of N=60 components,

component time series X with non-zero coefficients for every link in the time series graph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The standardized regression coefficient for a direct causal link  between two components  at lag  (in weeks) is then called the path coefficient33,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes the time series graph a causally weighted directed network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The matrices of path coefficients between all components are shown in Supplementary Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Rather than studying only causal effects between adjacent nodes in the causal time series graph, here we are interested in

picture of seasonal climatic interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, these strongly uplifting regions integrate incoming perturbations at the surface and transport them vertically into the higher troposphere from which they again influence other surface processes via atmospheric downdrafts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism explains the key importance of these regions as causal gateways and mediators of perturbations spreading in global climate via atmospheric teleconnections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis considered delta peak perturbations of 1 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since often perturbations reach extreme deviations of several s.d.1,2,54, and, even more importantly, multiple perturbations can accumulate, these findings reflect the large global influence of these regions.'

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have introduced a three-step approach for the analysis of multivariate spatio-temporal data sets, consisting of a dimension reduction, causal reconstruction, and CE quantification to identify subprocesses in complex systems that are important gateways for spreading and mediating perturbations entering the system in one subprocess.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this approach lends itself also to other spatio-temporal complex systems such as the brain18, for applications to financial data or food webs, the causal reconstruction can already be applied to, for example, economic indices or species abundances, and in complex systems like power grids or transportation networks, the first two steps of our approach could be skipped since the network structure is naturally given.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The causal quantification approach takes classical analyses of functional brain networks18 or climate networks21,23, which were previously mostly based on pairwise association measures, to a new level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, our proposed node measures can be seen as dynamical and causal alternatives to classical measures for functional networks such as the degree or betweenness centrality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Supplementary Fig 9 and Supplementary Note 1 we compare our results with these measures where we find that the latter have only weak predictive power (R20.4) for perturbation propagation and mediation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathway analysis goes substantially beyond pure causal network reconstructions24,32 and also provides, for the first time, a stricter statistical approach for characterizing atmospheric teleconnections, which are of paramount importance for studies of climate change and in particular climate extremes55, and which were previously formulated more phenomenologically based on (lagged) correlations39,40,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Like any data-driven approach our method is limited by several assumptions: causal sufficiency30,33 assumes that the common drivers of all variables are taken into account and the causal Markov condition assumes all error terms of the nodes in the time series graph to be independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our climate analysis, for example, we only excluded common drivers from within the pressure system, but on larger monthly time scales the underlying sea surface temperature field certainly interacts with the faster atmospheric pressure field over the oceans57 and can confound the assessment of CEs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is, therefore, important to interpret CEs only relative to the variables that were taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A further complication are CEs that are faster than the weekly resolution considered here, which appear as contemporaneous in our analysis, but are not taken into account since they are not regarded as causal links.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our weekly time resolution reflects a balance between resolving causal directionality and a multiple testing problem if too many lags are considered (in our example 30 days).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also the interplay of different time scales58,59 could be further addressed, for example by singular spectrum analysis45, and one could possibly also account for time-varying time delays of interactions60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the time series graph and CEs from the observed time series, we assume stationarity such that these properties do not change over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More detailed research questions can take into account non-stationarity, for example, due to seasonality in climate (here we used the whole time series).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the linear approach can also be adapted from delta-peak perturbations to more general scenarios with multiple or different types of perturbations35, the perturbations must be small enough to conserve the dynamics and causal structure of the system such that the conditional distributions remain the same35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of large unprecedented perturbations cannot be predicted from observed data alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We introduced the method using simple linear measures here, but the framework can to some extent also be implemented with nonlinear quantifiers, for example using information-theoretic measures42,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We see the proposed method as a complementary first-step approach towards model simulations and experiments to help guide decision making in several ways: in climate, the knowledge of subprocesses or regions with large perturbative effect, either as gateways or mediators, can help to optimally design computationally expensive simulations such as tracer experiments14, geoengineering impact assessments3,4, or extreme event attribution studies62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such experiments allow to conduct counterfactual analyses, for example, with and without anthropogenic influences, to conclude on necessary and sufficient CEs63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In neuroscience, it could help to optimize therapeutic interventions for preventing seizures by targeting selected brain regions with large CE or mediating CE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In power grids, nodes with strong mediating effect are the ones that one would best block to prevent a blackout perturbation from spreading throughout the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Summarizing, the novel causal interaction perspective provides a general approach to better understand the possible influence of perturbations on complex spatio-temporal systems and may guide further research to inform design and engineering processes aiming at increasing their resilience against shocks or extreme events.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Data and software availability', 'The climatological reanalysis data set41 studied here can be downloaded from http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Code for the dimension reduction step is available from co-author M. Vejmelka at https://github.com/vejmelkam/ndw-climate/blob/master/scripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Python software script by J. Runge to estimate the causal network can be obtained from http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/tigramite.php.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dimension reduction', 'Our dimension reduction approach is based on Varimax-rotated principal components28,45 and a subsequent significance test to eliminate components merely representing noise29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As further discussed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29, the rotation of principal components maximizes the sum of the variances of the squared principal component weights (loadings) and better represents regionally confined processes than principal components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data preprocessing steps to obtain the component weights are discussed in more detail in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29, here we give a brief summary: Monthly gridded time series are first anomalized to remove the annual cycle not only from the seasonal means but also from the seasonal variance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a linear detrending, the covariance matrix is estimated on cosine-transformed data to account for the area a grid point represents (poles are excluded), and the eigenvectors are computed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are then rotated using the Varimax criterion28 and a limited number of components is selected based on a comparison of eigenvalues of original data (not components) to those from surrogate data which preserve the autocorrelation structure, but destroy dependencies between the grid point time series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here this algorithm yields N=60 significant components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the component weight matrix is multiplied with the daily original gridded time series (that have been preprocessed by anomalization in mean and variance, standardization, linear detrending and cosine transform as above), and the daily component time series are aggregated to a weekly resolution which reflects a balance between causal time resolution and the multiple testing problem in the causal reconstruction step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to principal components, where the diagonal entries corresponding to the eigenvalues can be interpreted as the explained variability, for rotated principal components, the off-diagonal entries are not zero anymore and one cannot simply attribute an explained variance to each component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We enumerate the components by the entry on the diagonal starting with the largest value (component No.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here monthly time series were used for the extraction of the components for computational reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carrying out the decomposition directly on the daily or weekly time series might have provided a slightly different set of components, as the decomposition would also take into account higher frequency variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Supplementary Figs 1, 2 we show the loadings and time series of all components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Causal reconstruction', 'To reconstruct the causal network from the component time series, we utilize a causal discovery algorithm31,32 which is based on the PC algorithm (named after its inventors Peter Spirtes and Clark Glymour30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This algorithm can be used in an information-theoretic framework31 as well as employing linear partial correlation24,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we choose the linear approach as a first-order approximation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance level used in the causal algorithm is not a very reliable indicator for the final significance level of causal links because links are tested sequentially and, therefore, Bonferroni corrections cannot be easily applied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this problem, we use the causal algorithm only as a variable selection for a subsequent causal regression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time series graph reconstruction, thus, consists of three steps as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, variable selection of the causal parents: The parents  of each component j are selected with the causal algorithm described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32 and Supplementary Note 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The algorithms parameters here are: maximum time lag max=4 weeks, (two-tailed) significance level =0.001 (Students t-test), initial number of conditions n0=3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the causal algorithm to consistently converge to the true parents, one needs to assume causal sufficiency and the causal Markov condition, that is, the independence of error terms driving each subprocess, and faithfulness30 which guarantees that the graph entails all conditional independence relations true for the underlying process and can be violated in certain pathological cases30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we estimate partial correlations from time series data here, we also assume stationarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6464 discusses the computational complexity of the algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Supplementary Fig 3b we show the distribution of the number of parents for every

associated with the past lag of a component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a sharp decay, most of the coefficients have absolute values below 0.1', 'Thirdly, constructing the time series graph: The causal

stationarity, the subscript t in equation (2) can be dropped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the network analysed in the main article at 20% link density, the median of parents in the time series graph is 14

abbreviation of the accompanying software package.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we consider a measure I to quantify the linear CE of perturbations for its reliable estimation and interpretability,
