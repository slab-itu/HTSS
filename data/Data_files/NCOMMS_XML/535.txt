Two-terminal floating-gate memory with van der Waals heterostructures for ultrahigh on/off ratio  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Concepts of non-volatile memory to replace conventional flash memory have suffered from low material reliability and high off-state current, and the use of a thick, rigid blocking oxide layer in flash memory further restricts vertical scale-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report a two-terminal floating gate memory, tunnelling random access memory fabricated by a monolayer MoS2/h-BN/monolayer graphene vertical stack.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our device uses a two-terminal electrode for current flow in the MoS2 channel and simultaneously for charging and discharging the graphene floating gate through the h-BN tunnelling barrier.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By effective charge tunnelling through crystalline h-BN layer and storing charges in graphene layer, our memory device demonstrates an ultimately low off-state current of 1014 A, leading to ultrahigh on/off ratio over 109, about 103 times higher than other two-terminal memories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the absence of thick, rigid blocking oxides enables high stretchability ( greater than 19%) which is useful for soft electronics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Three-terminal device (source, drain and gate) of flash memory1 increases circuit complexity and requires long gate channel length which limits integration density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the presence of a thick and rigid blocking oxide layer leads to high power consumption2,3 and restricts scaling up in the vertical direction, and limits the flexibility and stretchability of the devices for applications4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two-terminal memory devices have been proposed to overcome such limitations: Phase-change random-access memory (PRAM)6,7,8 and resistive random-access memory (RRAM)2,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the absence of gate electrode, two-terminal memories can have extremely short channel length to achieve high memory integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, two-terminal memories can behave as memristor9 that have potential for applications of semi-non-volatile memories and learning networks that require a synapse-like function9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the biggest challenge for two-terminal memories are low reliability and high leakage off-current because of thermally activated hopping transport through trap states (PooleFrenkel conduction)11,12,13,14,15, resulting in low on/off ratio and off-state power consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Meanwhile, van der Waals heterostructures based on two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides and insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibit peculiar electronic16,17,18,19,20 and optoelectronic properties21,22,23,24,25, and furthermore can provide transparency, flexibility and stretchability19,21,23,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The h-BN layer, with a large bandgap of 5.97 eV, is used as a high-quality insulator20,28 and tunnelling barrier17,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we propose a two-terminal tunnelling random access memory (TRAM) using a vertically stacked MoS2/h-BN/Gr heterostructure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With appropriate thickness of h-BN, charges can tunnel through h-BN layer and be stored in the floating gate by large potential difference between drain and floating gate, while the stored charges in graphene cannot tunnel out to source electrode due to the absence of potential difference, thus allowing for charge storage in the floating gate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our TRAM demonstrates an ultralow off-state current (1014 A), leading to ultimately high on/off ratio (over 109).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we do not use gate electrode and thick, rigid blocking insulator and instead use an ultrathin h-BN ( less_than 10 nm) with high Youngs modulus and breaking strength, which is certainly advantageous for high flexibility, stretchability and scalability in the vertical direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our device performs excellent stretchability with no significant electrical performance degradation up to 19% strain, which will be used for wearable and body-attachable electronics in the near future.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

In fact, we performed two simulations for two channel lengths: 30 nm and 2 m. The potential distributions in both channel lengths were almost similar to each other (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used the simulation model with the channel length of 30 nm for better eye capturing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the electrostatic potential simulation of the programme (bottom panel of Fig 2a), the large potential difference and the corresponding large electric field were constructed between drain and graphene, whereas the negligible potential difference and the corresponding low electric field (Supplementary Fig 8a) were exhibited between source and graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large potential drop between the graphene and drain by 6 V drain bias enables electron tunnelling from drain to graphene, and electrons are spread out through the entire graphene (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, electrons in graphene cannot tunnel out to MoS2 or source because of the small potential drop at the contact (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The asymmetric potential drop originates from the highly resistive MoS2 that competes with tunnelling probability through the thin h-BN film, which is a key concept to store charges in graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Numerical simulation of potential distribution in TRAM and the schematic band diagram.Schematic illustration of band diagram, memory operation and simulated electrostatic potential at the states of Programme (ac), Read in Programme state (df), Erase (gi) and Read in Erase state (jl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed line arrows indicate the tunnelling direction of electrons and holes from drain into graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid line arrows indicate the spreading of electrons and holes at graphene after tunnelling.Full size image', 'The reading process of the programme state is shown in Fig 2df.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the trapped electrons in the programme state charge the graphene, the graphene potential could be dropped to maintain 2.27 V (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small potential difference (Fig 2f) and the corresponding low electric field (Supplementary Fig 8b) are shown at both the draingraphene and sourcegraphene junctions, which are low enough to prevent leakage of the trapped electrons in the floating gate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the trapped electrons generate a negative electric field and deplete the majority electron carriers in the MoS2, resulting in a highly resistive state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the MoS2 performs the programme state (off-state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At +6 V, drain bias (Fig 2gi and Supplementary Fig 8c) holes are tunnelled from drain and trapped in graphene, generating a highly conductive inversion channel in the MoS2 (Fig 2jl and Supplementary Fig 8d), performing an erase state (on-state).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, a large electrical hysteresis is formed by tunnelling and trapping electrons and holes in graphene by a simple drain-bias sweep, fundamental difference from the three-terminals flash memory CFGM (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By calculating carrier concentrations in graphene and MoS2 (Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig 10), the carrier concentration of graphene floating gate at Read in Erase state are 1.2 × 1013 cm2, higher than that of undoped graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MoS2 channel shows a carrier concentration of 1.0 × 1013 cm2, higher than typical carrier density of MoS2 channel, congruent with higher sourcedrain current in our device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The h-BN layer thickness dependence', 'To investigate the thickness dependence of h-BN film on tunnelling current, we fabricated TRAM devices with various h-BN thicknesses from 3.5 to 12 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tunnelling threshold voltage increased in proportion to the h-BN thickness (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thin h-BN (3.5 nm) device exhibits a measurable low-bias conductance, which is attributed to direct tunnelling through the thin h-BN film.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the devices with 5.5, 7.5 and 10 nm thick h-BN film show the threshold voltage at ±2, ±5 and ±7 V, respectively, at a current limit of 1013 A (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the threshold voltage regime, the tunnelling current becomes nonlinear, which is attributed to FowlerNordheim tunnelling31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tunnelling behaviour depending on the h-BN thickness largely influences charge trapping in graphene, as illustrated in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Tunnelling current through h-BN layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Tunnelling current characteristics between drain electrode and graphene floating gate for various h-BN thicknesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (bd) Schematics of electron tunnelling between electrode and floating gate at different h-BN thicknesses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A too-thin h-BN layer allows for charge tunnelling on both contacts, and no charges are stored in the graphene (b);
