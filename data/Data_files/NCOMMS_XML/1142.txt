Highly variable recurrence of tsunamis in the 7,400 years before the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caught millions of coastal residents and the scientific community off-guard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent research in the Indian Ocean basin has identified prehistoric tsunamis, but the timing and recurrence intervals of such events are uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present an extraordinary 7,400 year stratigraphic sequence of prehistoric tsunami deposits from a coastal cave in Aceh, Indonesia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This record demonstrates that at least 11 prehistoric tsunamis struck the Aceh coast between 7,400 and 2,900 years ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average time period between tsunamis is about 450 years with intervals ranging from a long, dormant period of over 2,000 years, to multiple tsunamis within the span of a century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is evidence that the likelihood of another tsunamigenic earthquake in Aceh province is high, these variable recurrence intervals suggest that long dormant periods may follow Sunda megathrust ruptures as large as that of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Projections of fatalities due to catastrophic earthquakes and tsunamis will likely exceed 2 million lives in the twenty-first century1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advances in geodesy and seismology have contributed to our understanding of rupture patterns of large earthquakes, but the devastation caused by the 2011 Tohoku-oki and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis make it clear that estimates of earthquake size and tsunami potential are woefully inadequate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The repeat times of such giant tsunamis can occur centuries to millennia apart2,3,4,5 and are not fully captured in historical and instrumental records2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more refined understanding of the long-term variations in timing and recurrence of giant tsunamis is essential for producing realistic vulnerability assessments for coastal communities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The great SumatraAndaman earthquake triggered a tsunami that devastated south and southeast Asia5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the time, there was no known historic precedent for the 1,500 km rupture of the Sunda megathrust5, with slip exceeding over 20 m (refs 6, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the decade since the Indian Ocean tsunami, the search for prehistoric estimates of earthquake recurrence and tsunami potential remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most reconstructions of past tsunami inundation are based on identifying anomalous beds of sand in low-energy environments, such as salt and freshwater marshes, coastal lakes or swales8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prehistoric tsunamis have been identified using such geological records from northern Sumatra10,11,12, Thailand13,14,15,16,17, Andaman Islands18, Sri Lanka19, Eastern India20 and the Maldives21, but the timeline of their reconstructions is limited or fragmentary, hindered by preservation problems, reworking and a lack of accommodation space22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We identify coastal caves as a new depositional environment for reconstructing tsunami records and present a 5,000 year record of continuous tsunami deposits from a coastal cave in Sumatra, Indonesia (Fig 1), which shows the irregular recurrence of 11 tsunamis between 7,400 and 2,900 years BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sedimentary record in the cave shows that ruptures of the Sunda megathrust vary between large (which generated the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami) and smaller slip failures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chronology of events suggests the recurrence of multiple smaller tsunamis within relatively short time periods, interrupted by long periods of strain accumulation followed by giant tsunamis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data demonstrates that the 2004 tsunami was just the latest in a sequence of devastating tsunamis stretching back to at least the early Holocene and suggests a high likelihood for future tsunamis in the Indian Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sediments preserved in the costal cave provide a unique opportunity to refine our understanding of the behaviour of the Sunda megathrust, as well as study in detail the sedimentology and hydrological characteristics of tsunami deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Tectonic setting and ruptures of major earthquakes along the Sunda megathrust.The pink patch is the estimated rupture area of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red patch is the estimated rupture area of the 2005 NiasSimeulue earthquake60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Orange and green patches show the area of the 1881 and 1907 earthquakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yellow circles show the location of the 2002, 2008 and 2010 eathquakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid lines depict primary faults generalized from Singh et al.61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pivot line shows location of uplift and subsidence of the seafloor during the 2004 earthquake5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative plate motion is from Prawirodirdjo and Bock62.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Coastal caves have not previously yielded prehistoric records of tsunamis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the caves sheltered location and absence of human activity suggest that these sand beds represent the best-preserved and most complete tsunami history for the Indian Ocean between 7,400 and 2,900 years BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The caves interior protects the tsunami deposits from erosion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rock sill near the cave entrance (Fig 2) mitigated the erosional impact of tsunamis that are found at elevations beneath the sill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, deposits above the rock sill are vulnerable to scouring from subsequent events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The caves location also disfavours sand bed deposition or re-working by intense storms12,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exposure to tropical cyclones is limited due to the lack of Coriolis force near the equator24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the track of any tropical cyclones that originate in Indian Ocean will move towards India, Bangladesh or Myanmar without producing a storm surge in Sumatra14,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although tropical cyclones do strike eastern Thailand, they dissipate after crossing the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra before moving offshore along Sumatras west coast (for example, tropical storm Vamei in 2001 (refs 27, 28)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The stratigraphic and microfossil data of the 11 prehistoric sand beds (AK) resemble the 2004 tsunami as well as tsunami deposits described elsewhere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rip-up clasts at the base of sand beds and sharp basal contacts suggest erosion occurred at the beginning of the tsunami inundation as the surge entered the cave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normally graded sand beds indicate settling from suspension following tsunami inundation in the cave9,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normal grading suggests that each bed resulted from a single (rather than multiple) instance of the cave filling with water and draining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The foraminifera assemblage of the sand beds were dominated by intertidal to subtidal to offshore species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Marine foraminifera often dominate tsunami deposits because of the landward transport and deposition of scoured marine sediment23,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The taphonomic (or surface) condition of individual foraminifera distinguishes the tsunami sand beds and the intercalated beds (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The foraminifera of the tsunami sand beds is predominantly pristine suggesting the foraminifera were entrained from a protected subtidal substrate31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have also identified cave chalk weathering as a new indicator of tsunami inundation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large fragments of weathered cave chalk are preserved in the sand beds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These fragments most likely fell from the cave ceiling and were weathered due to abrasion by tsunami transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, we found pristine and fragile chalk florets in the organic and mud beds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Holocene relative sea-level reconstructions from the Indo-Pacific region are characterized by a mid-Holocene sea-level high stand of a few decimetres to several metres33,34, but the presence or absence of such a highstand may be controlled by local tectonic processes35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A record of buried soils from the northwestern coast of Aceh Province suggest that relative sea-level rose during the early and mid-Holocene from 5 m at 7,900 years BP to 1.6 m at 5,700 years BP12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative sea-level was below present until at least 3,800 years BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the late Holocene, relative sea-level stabilized within 0.4 m of modern sea-level12,22,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gradual long-term relative sea-level rise without a mid-Holocene highstand created a time-window for tsunami deposits and intercalated beds to aggrade without a significant interruption in sedimentation36 (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Model of tsunamis deposits in cave interior.Our model shows the development of accommodation space and the accumulation of stacked tsunami beds AK and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in the coast cave.Full size image', 'The cave probably contained stratigraphic evidence of recent historic tsunamis from 2,900 years BP to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that have been identified elsewhere in the region10,14, but these were most likely removed by subsequent tsunamis inundating the cave as indicated by the erosional unconformity beneath the 2004 deposit (Figs 4 and 7; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The missing stratigraphic record coincides with the continued aggradation of the nearby coastal plain12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stratigraphical records of late Holocene tsunamis are generally restricted to environments with sufficient accommodation space, such as intervening coastal swales between ridges10,14, estuaries and ponds where overwash deposits are protected from erosion by rapid growth of vegetation or deposition of sediment36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Independent evidence for tsunami inundation in the cave comes from stratigraphy of nearby coastal lowlands12,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three coseismic subsidence events and seven tsunamis between 7,500 and 3,800 years BP are documented in the stratigraphy of the west coast of northern Sumatra12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During this time interval, the cave sequence preserves an identical number of tsunamis (that is, sand beds AG; Fig 6 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Offshore of Sumatra, Patton et al.38 identified 11 deep-sea turbidites along the AndamanAceh slip patch between 6,500 and 2,700 years BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the number of events is the same, the timing of the events is different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deep-sea turbidite record does not capture the tightly clustered tsunamis (sand beds GJ) and the large gap in time between tsunamis F and G. The discrepancies suggest that ruptures along the Sunda megathrust do not always trigger both tsunami deposits and turbidites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since the 2004 tsunami, considerable evidence for prehistoric tsunamis has been obtained from sites around the Indian Ocean13,14,15,16,18,20,21,39,40,41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, studies with time spans comparable to the cave are restricted to Sri Lanka19 and the Maldives21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In southern Sri Lanka, Jackson et al.19, identified seven tsunami sand beds between 6,700 and 2,400 year BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Klostermann et al.21 identified three tsunami sand beds between 5,600 and 2,900 years BP in the Maldives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these far-field records do not capture the tightly clustered tsunamis (sand beds GJ) and have events that span the large gap in time between tsunami sand beds F and G. The far-field seismic sources for these tsunamis are uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, slip along the megathrust near the AndamanNicobar Islands are potential seismic sources for tsunamis in Sri Lanka and the Maldives44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the faults along the southern coast of Pakistan are potential seismic sources for tsunamis in the Maldives44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immediate proximity of the cave to the Sunda megathrust provides a more reliable indicator of tsunamis generated by ruptures of the megathrust than far-field records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The chronology from accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon ages from the sand beds of the coastal cave and the stratigraphy of the nearby coastal lowlands12,37, combined within a Bayesian framework (Fig 6; Methods section), provides the chronology of tsunamis between 7,400 and 2,900 years BP (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chronology suggests an average recurrence interval of 456 years between 7,400 and 2,900 years BP with a large uncertainty (95% C.I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12,210) (Fig 6; Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar average recurrence interval (600900 years) was estimated from the nearby coastal lowlands of northwestern Aceh Province between 7,400 and 3,800 years BP12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tsunami record from Sri Lanka19 suggested an average recurrence interval of 360 years between 6,600 and 4,200 year BP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The tsunami record from the cave, however, indicates a dramatic variation in recurrence interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 7,400 and 5,500 years BP, the recurrence interval for tsunamis A to F was 681 years (95% C.I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  112,222) (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But after 5,500 years BP, the coastal cave has an age gap of 2,164 years (95% C.I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1,9972,247) between tsunamis F and G. Four tightly clustered tsunamis (GJ) occurred between 3,400 and 3,300 years BP with an average recurrence interval of 16 years (95% C.I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  055).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most recent tsunami (K) recorded in the coastal cave occurred at 2,900 years BP, with a recurrence interval of 426 years (95% C.I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  357505).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the time span of the northern Simeulue coral microatoll record is limited to the last millennium, it shows a similar large variation of recurrence intervals from 56 years to 550 years39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There is a correlation between the thickness of tsunami sand beds and recurrence intervals in the cave (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thinner sand beds (GJ) have the smallest recurrence intervals and were preceded by the largest age gap between tsunamis (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thickest sand bed (F) preceded the large age gap, with a thickness similar to the 2004 tsunami sand bed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although variations of offshore sediment availability or lateral shoreline changes might play a role in the thickness of tsunami beds45, we suggest that the thickness of the sand beds may reflect the size of slip along the megathrust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that sand bed F was deposited by a giant tsunami produced by a large slip that was followed by a very long dormant, interseimic period with substantial strain accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, partial, smaller slip failures occurred in rapid succession between 3,400 and 3,300 years BP, producing sand beds GJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very long dormant period suggests that the Sunda megathrust is capable of accumulating large slip deficits between earthquakes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a high slip rupture would produce a substantially larger earthquake than the 2004 event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The dramatic variation in tsunami recurrence intervals suggests a continuum of recurrence behaviour from large slip ruptures (2004 tsunami and sand bed F), earthquake super cycles or doublet earthquake2,4,11,39 to smaller slip failures (for example, sand beds GJ) similar to the October 2010 Mentawai tsunamigenic earthquake (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variations in recurrence may result from temporal changes in coupling or locking depth, or very long-term slow non-tsunamigenic slip events46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If thickness of the tsunami deposit (Fig 6) reflects slip and the size of the slip patch, the thickness of the 2004 tsunami deposit implies a long dormant period until the next large slip event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slow non-tsunamigenic slip events might predominate during such long periods of quiescence and precede clustering smaller slip failures along the megathrust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remarkable variability of recurrence suggests that regional hazard mitigation plans should be based upon the high likelihood of future destructive tsunami demonstrated by the cave record and other paleotsunami sites, rather than estimates of recurrence intervals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Field methods and data collection', 'The evidence for prehistoric tsunamis is derived principally from stratigraphic relations found in six trench-wall exposures and other smaller pits in the cave.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stratigraphy is visually striking, because of a strong contrast in colour between alternating beds of sand, mud and laminated organic sand (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We identified and described stratigraphic units in Trench 1 and the trench walls were mapped from high-resolution photos of the vertical surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alternating beds of sand, clay and laminated organic sand allow stratigraphic correlation of individual beds within the trench-wall exposure (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We divided the stratigraphy into 12 units, from Unit 1, which is the oldest and deepest, resting on the limestone bedrock of the cave, through Unit 12, which is the youngest unit that underlies the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami sand bed (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Column samples were taken across each stratigraphic interface, providing samples for grain size, microfossil and chronology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Topographic data were based on a total station survey in 2011 and 2012 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excavation of six trenches within the cave interior was conducted in 2011 and 2012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We made measurements of sedimentology and stratigraphy in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tsunami sand beds', 'We use several lines of stratigraphic evidence that point to a tsunami origin for sand beds AK that includes stratigraphic relations, lithology, degree of sorting, internal structures, such as fining upwards beds, rip-up clasts of mud, sharpness of stratigraphic contacts, uniformity in bed thickness and lateral continuity of beds8,48,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we use secondary features such as liquefaction, bedding-plane faults (décollements) and normal faults that are perhaps triggered by seismic shaking8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We analysed foraminiferal assemblages (Fig 5; Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) from most units to confirm marine inundation and indicate the provenance of the overwash sands32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we used foraminiferal test taphonomy51 to reveal depositional and post-depositional environmental conditions (Supplementary Fig 3; Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The foraminiferal analyses help constrain sediment provenance and help identify tsunami sands in a variety of environmental settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used the taphonomy of cave chalk as a new indicator of the environment of deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cave chalk found in the sedimentary units most likely fell from the cave ceiling due to weathering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chalk occurs in two forms: (1) small, fragile, pristine florets; and (2) large detrital rounded fragments that do not have a delicate floret structure (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the florets do not show evidence of water transport (for example, rounding), we suggest that the delicate florets are limited to sand beds not deposited by tsunamis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the rounded chalk fragments are only found in sand beds that were produced by a tsunami.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe the rounding of the fragments is due to abrasion by the tsunami waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Grain size and thickness data allows comparison of the 2004 tsunami sediments with the prehistoric sand beds (Figs 5 and 6;
