Frequency and bandwidth conversion of single photons in a room-temperature diamond quantum memory  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The spectral manipulation of photons is essential for linking components in a quantum network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large frequency shifts are needed for conversion between optical and telecommunication frequencies, while smaller shifts are useful for frequency-multiplexing quantum systems, in the same way that wavelength division multiplexing is used in classical communications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate frequency and bandwidth conversion of single photons in a room-temperature diamond quantum memory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heralded 723.5 nm photons, with 4.1 nm bandwidth, are stored as optical phonons in the diamond via a Raman transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon retrieval from the diamond memory, the spectral shape of the photons is determined by a tunable read pulse through the reverse Raman transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report central frequency tunability over 4.2 times the input bandwidth, and bandwidth modulation between 0.5 and 1.9 times the input bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate the potential for diamond, and Raman memories in general, as an integrated platform for photon storage and spectral conversion.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The fragility of the quantum state is a challenge facing all quantum technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Great efforts have been undertaken to mitigate the deleterious effects of decoherence by isolating quantum systems, for example, by cryogenically cooling and isolating in vacuum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  State-of-the-art decoherence times are now measured in hours1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative approach is to build quantum technologies that execute on ultrafast timescalesas short as femtosecondssuch that operations can be completed before decoherence overwhelms unitarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A shining example is the Raman quantum memory2,3,4,5, which can absorb single photons of femtosecond duration and release them on demand several picoseconds later6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While picosecond storage times are not appropriate for conventional quantum memory applications such as long-distance communication, it has been suggested2 that Raman quantum memories can find additional uses such as frequency and bandwidth conversion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Controlling the spectral properties of single photons is essential for a wide array of emerging optical quantum technologies spanning quantum sensing7, quantum computing8 and quantum communications9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Essential components for these technologies include single-photon sources10, quantum memories11, waveguides12 and detectors13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ideal spectral operating parameters (wavelength and bandwidth) of these components are rarely similar; thus, frequency conversion and spectral control are key enabling steps for component hybridization14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Beyond hybridization, frequency conversion is an area of emerging interest in quantum optical processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency degree of freedom can be used along side conventional encoding in, for example, polarization, or time-bin, to build quantum states of higher dimensionality15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Spectral control is a mature field in ultrafast optics where phase- and amplitude-shaping of a THz-bandwidth pulse can be achieved using passive pulse-shaping elements in the Fourier plane16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, a range of nonlinear optical techniques17 such as second harmonic generation (SHG), sum- and difference-frequency generation, four-wave mixing and Raman scattering are routinely employed to shift the frequency of laser pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extending these frequency conversion techniques into the quantum regime is a critical task for many quantum technologies but is made difficult by the low intensity of single photons, and the sensitivity of quantum states to loss and noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these challenges, quantum frequency conversion18 has been demonstrated in a number of systems including waveguides in nonlinear crystals19,20,21,22,23,24, photonic crystal fibres25 and atomic vapour26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, photon bandwidth compression has been shown using chirped-pulse upconversion27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full control over the spectral properties of single photons28 has been proposed using second-14,29 and third-order30 optical nonlinearities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Large frequency shifts, such as those achieved using sum- and difference-frequency generation, are desirable to convert photons to, and from, the telecommunication band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, smaller shifts can be useful for frequency-multiplexing in several closely spaced bins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This concept is widely used in classical fibre optics, where wavelength division multiplexing is employed to achieve data rates far beyond that which could be achieved with monochromatic light31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in quantum optics the utility of frequency multiplexing has only recently been explored15,32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a frequency-multiplexed quantum architecture, it will be critical to build components that can add, drop, and manipulate different frequency bins: it has been proposed that frequency-selective quantum memories can perform this task15,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with classical wavelength division multiplexing, the frequency bins will likely be closely spaced so that small shifts around a central frequency will be required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this article, we demonstrate the use of a Raman quantum memory to perform quantum frequency conversion; we manipulate the spectral properties of THz-bandwidth photons using a memory in the optical phonon modes of diamond6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crucially, the quantum properties of the photon must be maintained even while the carrier frequency and bandwidth are modified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our demonstration, a signal photon is mapped into an optical phonon by the write pulse, and then retrieved with its spectral properties modified according to the properties of the read pulse.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have demonstrated ultrafast quantum frequency manipulation by adjusting the central wavelength and spectrum, of THz-bandwidth heralded single photons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We achieve this spectral control using a modified Raman quantum memory in diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The single photons are written to the memory from one spectral mode, and recalled to another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Criticallyand unlike frequency conversion based on, for example, amplificationthe non-classical photon statistics in our demonstration were retained after spectral manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diamond therefore offers low-noise THz-bandwidth storage and frequency control of single photons on a single, robust, room-temperature platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have demonstrated frequency conversion of a single polarization; two memories could be used in parallel to convert a polarization qubit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantum memories for long-distance quantum communication typically demand long storage times at the expense of high bandwidth; this application leverages a high-bandwidth memory where long storage time is not relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that this system could find use in a number of applications, including entangling two photon-pair sources of different colour; reducing the bandwidth of the ubiquitous ultrafast SPDC photon source, without losing photons (as occurs in passive filtering); broadening the bandwidth of an SPDC photon source to match a chosen material system (not possible with a passive filtering system); and increasing the dimensionality of quantum encoded information15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, we believe that arbitrary optical function generation40with both classical and quantum lightand associated signal processing capabilities will be a platform for future technology development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that the large-bandwidth nonlinear optical conversion of Raman-based quantum memories will find use in implementations of these generators.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
