Self-assembled three dimensional network designs for soft electronics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Low modulus, compliant systems of sensors, circuits and radios designed to intimately interface with the soft tissues of the human body are of growing interest, due to their emerging applications in continuous, clinical-quality health monitors and advanced, bioelectronic therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although recent research establishes various materials and mechanics concepts for such technologies, all existing approaches involve simple, two-dimensional (2D) layouts in the constituent micro-components and interconnects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce concepts in three-dimensional (3D) architectures that bypass important engineering constraints and performance limitations set by traditional, 2D designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, open-mesh, 3D interconnect networks of helical microcoils formed by deterministic compressive buckling establish the basis for systems that can offer exceptional low modulus, elastic mechanics, in compact geometries, with active components and sophisticated levels of functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coupled mechanical and electrical design approaches enable layout optimization, assembly processes and encapsulation schemes to yield 3D configurations that satisfy requirements in demanding, complex systems, such as wireless, skin-compatible electronic sensors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Rapid advances in the development of precision chem/biosensors, low-power radio communication systems, efficient energy harvesting/storage devices, high-capacity memory technologies and miniaturized electronic/optoelectronic components create opportunities for qualitatively expanding the ways that microsystem technologies can be integrated with the human body for treating disease states and monitoring health status1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Realizing this potential requires not only advances in the components but also in the strategies for their collective integration into systems that offer stable, long-term operation at intimate biotic/abiotic interfaces1,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Promising research in this direction focuses on development of materials and mechanics concepts to enable system-level properties that are mechanically and geometrically matched to those of the soft tissues of the human body6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although previously reported approaches provide significant utility in this context12,14,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42, they all rely on planar, two-dimensional (2D) layouts of the functional elements and electrical interconnects, where the 2D geometries and/or materials define the essential physical characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The work reported here pursues a different strategy, in which system architectures adopt engineered, three-dimensional (3D) designs to provide properties that circumvent intrinsic limitations associated with traditional, 2D counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, combined experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that open networks of 3D microscale helical interconnects offer nearly ideal mechanics for soft electronic systems that embed chip-scale components, by virtue of model, spring-like behaviours similar to those in man-made43,44,45 (for example, coil spring) and biological46,47,48,49,50 (for example, tendrils) analogues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, scalable methods for forming the required 3D mesostructures together with systematic approaches for defining mechanically and electrically optimized layouts allow immediate application to complex systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wireless sensor platforms capable of physiological status monitoring in soft, skin-mounted formats provide demonstration examples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings could find broad utility in many classes of soft microsystems technologies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Mechanics of 3D helical coils', 'The assembly approach builds on recently introduced concepts in deterministically controlled buckling processes51,52, in which initial 2D structures spontaneously transform into desired 3D shapes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1a presents finite element analyses (FEA, see Methods section for details) for the formation of an extended, spiral network of 3D helical microstructures from a corresponding 2D precursor that takes the form of a collection of filamentary serpentine ribbons (widths: 50 m; multilayer construction: 2.5 m PI/1.0 m Au/5 nm Cr/2.5 m PI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each unit cell consists of two identical arcs with central angle 0 and radius r0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two ends include small discs that form strong covalent siloxane bonds to an underlying elastomeric silicone substrate in a state of biaxial prestrain; other regions adhere only through weak van der Waals interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compressive forces induced by releasing the prestrain cause the 2D precursor to geometrically transform, through a coordinated collection of in-plane and out-of-plane translational and rotational motions, into an engineered 3D configuration via controlled buckling deformations51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, each unit cell transforms into a single turn of a corresponding 3D helical microcoil whose pitch (p) depends on the serpentine geometry and the magnitude of the prestrain, pre, according to p=4r0 sin(0/2)/(1+pre).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall shape of coil follows mainly from pre and 0 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical images of a representative structure appear in Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key dimensions match those from FEA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the experimental and FEA results for the pitch, height of the microcoils are 1,150±40 m, 530±50 m and 1,170, 520 m, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Assembly of conductive 3D helical coils and their mechanical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

case of the 2D serpentine in d.Full size image', 'Although previous studies establish the utility of planar serpentine interconnects in soft electronics, the existence of sharp, localized stress concentrations that follow from their 2D formats and their physical coupling to the substrate limit performance for systems that require low modulus, elastic mechanics in compact designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, 3D helical microstructures avoid this unfavourable mechanics due to smoothly varying, uniform distributions of deformation-induced stresses that follow directly from their 3D layouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result enables exceptionally high levels of stretchability and mechanical robustness, without the propensity for localized crack formation or fracture, as supported by results in Fig 1c,d and Supplementary Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For purposes of quantitative comparison, consider a 2D serpentine interconnect with the same material composition (PI/Au/PI) and key geometric parameters (Supplementary Fig 2a), including the width (w), the thickness (tmetal and tPI), the span (S) and the amplitude (A), as a corresponding 3D helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the number of unit cells in the 2D serpentine is selected such that its total trace length (ltotal) is approximately the same as that of the 3D counterpart (10.68 mm, 0=180o and r0=425 m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The limit of elastic stretchability, defined as the maximum overall dimensional change below which structural deformations can recover completely, corresponds to the point at which the constituent materials undergo plastic deformation at the locations of highest Mises stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results for analogous 2D and 3D systems appear in Supplementary Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the absence of stress concentrations, the elastic stretchability of the 3D helices significantly exceeds that of the 2D serpentines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhancement corresponds to a factor of 3 for pre=50%, and this factor increases continuously with pre until it reaches 9.5 for pre=300% (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These improvements follow from qualitatively distinct deformation mechanisms in 3D compared to 2D layouts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1c illustrates the nearly ideal, spring-like mechanics that characterize responses in 3D helices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, deformations are almost completely decoupled from those of elastomeric substrate and the cross-sectional maximum Mises stress () are spatially uniform, except for small regions near the bonding sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative results from FEA appear in Fig 1e, which shows the maximum Mises stress for each cross section along the natural coordinate normalized by the arc length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deformations of the 2D serpentine lead to sharp, unavoidable stress concentrations at the arc regions, as illustrated by the results in Fig 1f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ratio of the peak stress  to its mean value  serves as a metric for the magnitude of this concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ratio is only 1.2 for the 3D helices under both applied strains of 25 and 50%, which is nearly an order of magnitude smaller than the ratio (9.8) for the 2D serpentines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-uniformity in the stress distribution can be characterized by the average absolute deviation relative to the mean value, as given by , where  denotes the natural arc coordinate normalized by the total trace length of entire interconnect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dimensionless factor also highlights the qualitative differences (for example, 0.15 versus 1.06 for 50% stretch) between behaviours of the 3D helical and 2D serpentine microstructures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even when compared to fractal 2D designs, in which microfluidic enclosures afford mechanical decoupling from the substrate14 or to bar-type 2D serpentines, in which planar, scissor-like mechanics dominates53, the 3D helical geometry is superior due to the spring-like responses and associated uniformity in the stress distribution (see Supplementary Figs 37 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, 3D helical interconnects outperform 2D serpentine designs that undergo buckling deformations in the form of local wrinkling, typically by a factor 2.3 for representative prestrains (100%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As compared to thick serpentine interconnects that are dominated by planar, scissor-like mechanics, 3D helical interconnects with a sufficient prestrain (for example, 100%) exhibit a considerable enhancement (for example, 1.8 times) in the elastic stretchability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar improvements, at an even greater factor, apply relative to 2D interconnects with fractal-inspired layouts (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Design of 3D interconnect network of helical coils', 'The versatility in layouts that can be realized by the assembly approach outlined in Fig 1, the scalability of this process to large areas, and the excellent mechanical behaviours of the 3D helical designs facilitate straightforward implementation even in complex systems (see Supplementary Figs 815).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical image of Fig 2a presents an example that consists of 50 separate chip-scale electrical components, 250 distinct 3D helical interconnects (PI 2.5 m/Au 1 m/Cr 5 nm/PI 2.5 m multilayers with 50 m in width for each line; PI 2.5 m/Au 1 m/Cr 5 nm/PI 2.5 m/Au 1 m/Cr 5 nm/PI 2.5 m multilayers with 50 m in width for each crossing point) adhered at 500 bonding sites to an elastomeric substrate (E=20 kPa; Ecoflex 0050, Smooth-on, USA; 4 cm diameter at rest), all encapsulated with an ultra-low-modulus elastomer (E=3 kPa; Silbione 4717A/B, Bluestar Silicones, France).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As described subsequently and demonstrated in Supplementary Movie 1, this platform provides wireless, battery-free capabilities in continuous monitoring of physiological health from mounting locations on the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset shows the device in a complex state of deformation to illustrate the soft, skin-like physical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall layout employs a spider-web-like geometry (Supplementary Figs 1618), selected to avoid failure at any point in the system, to ensure uniform and extreme levels of stretchability and bendability in any direction and to minimize the overall system size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unusual layout follows from a rigorous, systematic design approach that leverages FEA modelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, for any given design, FEA allows rapid identification of locations of high Mises stresses and physical collisions between the different regions of the interconnect network and/or individual components, under various states of deformation within a desired range of strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under constraints of interconnect length and connectivity set by considerations in electrical performance (details described below), an iterative process guided by FEA allows optimization of all relevant parameters, including the magnitude of the prestrain in the assembly process, the spatial layouts of the components, the configurations of the bonding sites and the geometries of the 2D serpentine precursors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of serpentine unit cells with fixed dimensions across the entire circuit simplifies the design process and yields uniform distributions of Mises stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overlaid on these mechanical considerations is a set of electrical requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the length of the line that supplies power must be minimized to reduce resistive dissipation and electromagnetic noise associated with radio frequency power delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large decoupling capacitor (22 F) at the power source and smaller bypass capacitors at each branch of the supply route, all of which have low equivalent series resistance, help to suppress this noise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antenna and the electrodes for sensing electrophysiological signals must be spatially separated from the power line to minimize electromagnetic interference, but they must also enable impedance matching (50 ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These and other coupled considerations in mechanics and electronics underpin the optimized design shown in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Three-dimensional network of helical coils as

the EP sensor output through an internal analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) and data acquisition of the accelerometer output via a serial peripheral interface (SPI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When operated using a custom graphical user interface on a smart phone, this system can capture and transmit a range of information related to physiological health, as shown in Supplementary Movie 1.Full size image', 'The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images in Fig 2bd highlight some key representative regions of this system, including heterogeneously integrated structures of 3D microcoils, chip-scale components and the supporting elastomeric substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of the mechanics, these frames highlight the level of agreement between experiment and FEA predictions across the entire structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2b illustrates electrical crossovers enabled by the multilayer construction of the traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2bd, the bonding sites retain an undeformed shape due to the low modulus of the underlying elastomer and the relatively large thickness (6 m) of the interconnect structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result leads to low levels of Mises stresses at these locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chip-scale components prevent corresponding near-surface regions of the elastomer from relaxing after release of the prestrain, thereby inducing a certain level of strain concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the portions of the helical interconnects that join directly to the chips undergo a slightly enhanced compression, consistent with the increased Mises stresses in Fig 2d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FEA results in the lower images show the stress field associated with the 3D microcoil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum computed stress in the metal layer across the entire 3D interconnect structure is 130 MPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value corresponds to 0.19% strain, which is below the yielding point (0.3%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Delamination has the potential to occur at the chip/substrate interface during the process of mechanical-guided assembly, as shown in experimental results (Supplementary Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretically, delamination occurs more readily as the prestrain increases or the effective rigidity of the chip increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such trends are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations (Supplementary Fig 19), in which the delamination area increases as the effective rigidity of the chip increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, delamination occurs mainly at the periphery regions of the chips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of partial delamination does not affect the bonding conditions between electrical interconnects and substrate, and thereby has a minor effect on the integrity of the entire device.

encapsulation strategy for enhanced mechanics', 'Practical applications demand encapsulating layers to protect the active and passive components and the interconnects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As compared with liquid encapsulation14, the solid encapsulation approach adopted in this paper avoids the potential for leakage or evaporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in previously reported systems that use 2D serpentines, ultra-low-modulus elastomers are attractive due to the minimal mechanical constraints that they impose on the motions of the components and interconnect networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, introduction of this encapsulation material occurs as a final step in the fabrication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative, improved strategy that naturally follows from the 3D assembly process outlined in Fig 1 involves applying this material as a liquid precursor at a state of partial release of the substrate prestrain, encap, crosslinking it into a solid form and then completing the release, as shown in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This last step deforms the cured material in a manner that softly embeds the 3D helical interconnects via mechanical interactions during final release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As illustrated by experimental results (Supplementary Fig 24), the 3D buckled structures in the system maintain their original forms during the encapsulation process because their equivalent moduli are sufficiently high that they are not deformed by shear forces associated with the viscosity of the uncured elastomer or liquid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Strategy for soft

network in a 2D serpentine design bond at selective sites to a bi-axially prestrained soft elastomeric substrate (Ecoflex 00-50A/B, Smooth-on, USA; E=20 kPa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Partial release of the prestrain mechanically transforms the 2D serpentines into 3D helices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coating the entire structure with a thin, low-modulus silicone elastomer (Silbione 4717A/B, Bluestar Silicones, France; E=3 kPa) defines the encapsulation layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, releasing the remaining prestrain enhances the 3D geometry of the helices and completes the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The

of (a) is 1 mm.Full size image', 'Quantitative mechanics modelling reveals significant associated improvements in the elastic stretchability (Fig 3b,c), compared to the usual case of encapsulation at the final stage of fabrication and assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the enhancement corresponds to a factor of 2.2 and 2.8 times for uniaxial and radial stretching, respectively, when encap=30% and pre=150% for the device in Fig 2a (Esubstrate=20 kPa and Eencapsulation=3 kPa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modelling is critical for the practical implementation of this concept, simply because the use of encap above a certain threshold (39% for the case examined here) can lead to plastic yielding of the interconnects before full release (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Near this limit, the elastic stretchability of the encapsulated 3D circuit system approaches that of the unencapsulated counterpart, particularly for uniaxial stretching (for example, 120 versus 144% for X axis and 123% versus 146% for Y axis) (see Supplementary Discussion for more discussions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparison, encapsulation at encap=0 (that is, encapsulation after complete assembly) retains only limited levels of stretchability (for example, 50% for X axis, 51% for Y axis, and 25% for radial stretching, respectively), as shown in Fig 3d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deformation mode in Fig 3e is, in fact, close to that of an ideal, unencapsulated system (Supplementary Fig 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this construction, a radial strain of 70% induces maximum Mises stress of only 199 MPa (corresponding to its yield strain, 0.3%) in the active materials (Au of the interconnects), consistent with reversible, elastic behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the stress distribution is uniform across most of the circuit (Fig 3e), as additional evidence of the efficient mechanics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The modulus of the top encapsulation has a significant effect on the elastic stretchability of the 3D helical interconnects (Supplementary Fig 26).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A low-modulus elastomer (Silbione) reduces mechanical constraints on the deformations of helical interconnects, thereby achieving a much higher stretchability than possible with elastomers with higher modulus values (for example, Ecoflex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circuit can be designed with improved density via the use of increased prestrain during the 3D assembly process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By increasing the prestrain from 150 to 200%, the area of entire circuit can be reduced to 70% of the original area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elastic stretchability undergoes a relatively small corresponding reduction, as in Supplementary Fig 27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The devices might encounter compression along the thickness direction during practical use, associated with physical contact or normal impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantitative modelling of the encapsulated helical interconnects provides insights into the mechanics associated with such situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a variety of prestrains (50300%) used in the assembly process, compressive forces (for example, 10 kPa) sufficiently large to reduce the out-of-plane dimensions of the interconnects to 30% of the original values (that is, a compression ratio of 0.3) lead to maximum principal strains in the metal layer that are below 1.3%, which is much smaller than the fracture strain (5%) of gold or copper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates that the 3D helical interconnects can survive such compression ratios (0.3) and pressures 10 kPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental demonstrations of robust performance of 3D coil interconnect networks, involve simple test structures a LED to allow visual observation of operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each LED interconnect takes the form of a 3D helical coil (width 50 m, thickness 1 m), selectively bonded to an elastomeric substrate (Ecoflex 0030, Smooth-on, USA; E=30 kPa) using interface chemistries described previously and encapsulation with an ultra-soft elastomer (Silbione 4717A/B, Bluestar Silicones, USA; E= 3 kPa) as outlined above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The computational results and experimental results are in Supplementary Figs 28 and 29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experiments show that an LED system constructed with networks of helical interconnects can survive different types of compressive loadings that might occur in practical use, consistent with modeling results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Experimental measurements of the mechanical responses also show good agreement with modelling, even at

of radial, X axis and Y axis stretching shown here (see Supplementary Fig 31 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reference, comparisons of images of local areas to themselves after translation or

of 0.81 corresponds to a 1.8% X axis offset, a 1.5% Y axis offset or a 2.5° rotation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Demonstration of soft electronics built with 3D helical coil', 'Figure 4a and Supplementary

'The results presented here establish concepts, as well as routes for practical implementation, for 3D microstructure designs in soft electronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific findings include quantitative advantages of ideal, spring-like mechanics in 3D helical coils compared to traditional 2D layouts; scalable approaches for forming 3D helical frameworks as interconnect networks between advanced microsystem components; combined electrical/mechanical techniques for optimizing system design; encapsulation materials and methods for ideal, 3D mechanics; and multimodal, wireless, skin-mounted demonstration devices for health monitoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ideas in 3D design have relevance not only to interconnect networks but also to other sub-systems, such as the antennas, the sensor structures and certain of the active and passive device components as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compatibility of the 3D assembly approaches with the most advanced methods in 2D micro/nanofabrication provides alignment both with state-of-the-art microsystems technologies and unusual classes of materials and devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A combination of established and developing elements in overall architectures that leverage both 2D and 3D layout features affords powerful opportunities not only in bio-integrated electronics but also in many other areas of emerging interest, from soft robotics to systems for virtual reality to hardware for autonomous navigation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Finite element analysis', 'Three-dimensional FEA techniques allowed prediction of the mechanical deformations and stress distributions of helical interconnects and entire circuit systems, during processes of compressive buckling and re-stretching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four-node shell elements with a three-layer (PI/metal/PI) composite modelled the interconnects, and eight-node solid elements modelled the substrate and encapsulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refined meshes ensured computational accuracy using commercial software (Abaqus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical buckling strains and corresponding buckling modes determined from linear buckling analyses served as initial imperfections in the postbuckling analyses to determine the deformed configurations and strain distributions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate stretchability in the encapsulated condition, 3D helical interconnects determined by postbuckling analyses were embedded in an encapsulation solid that covered the entire area of substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elastic stretchability corresponds to point at which the Mises stresses in the metal layer exceed the yield strength (199 MPa for Au and 357 MPa for Cu, both corresponding to 0.3% yield strain) across at least one quarter of the width of any section of the interconnect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous experimental studies32,55 support the use of this type of criterion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical hyper-elastic constitutive relation, that is, the MooneyRivlin law, captured the properties of the elastomeric substrate (elastic modulus Esubstrate=20 kPa and Poissons ratio substrate=0.49) and encapsulation material (Eencapsulation=3 kPa and encapsulation=0.49).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevant material parameters are (C10=2.68 kPa, C01=0.67 kPa, D1=0.006 kPa1) for the substrate and (C10=0.40 kPa, C01=0.10 kPa, D1=0.04 kPa1) for the encapsulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other material parameters are EAu=70 GPa and Au=0.44 for gold;
