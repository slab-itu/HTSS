The foot of Homo naledi  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Modern humans are characterized by a highly specialized foot that reflects our obligate bipedalism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our understanding of hominin foot evolution is, although, hindered by a paucity of well-associated remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the foot of Homo naledi from Dinaledi Chamber, South Africa, using 107 pedal elements, including one nearly-complete adult foot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H. naledi foot is predominantly modern human-like in morphology and inferred function, with an adducted hallux, an elongated tarsus, and derived ankle and calcaneocuboid joints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination, these features indicate a foot well adapted for striding bipedalism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the H. naledi foot differs from modern humans in having more curved proximal pedal phalanges, and features suggestive of a reduced medial longitudinal arch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the context of primitive features found elsewhere in the skeleton, these findings suggest a unique locomotor repertoire for H. naledi, thus providing further evidence of locomotor diversity within both the hominin clade and the genus Homo.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Homo sapiens foot is highly adapted to striding bipedalism, and possesses a suite of anatomical features that functionally relate to this form of locomotion1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include a non-opposable hallux, a medial longitudinal arch, a locking calcaneocuboid joint and an elongated tarsal region in conjunction with short, straight toes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the last 20 years, our understanding of the evolution of human pedal function has become complicated by fossil discoveries that point to diversity in the types of terrestrial bipedalism found throughout the hominin clade, including several instances where contemporary hominin taxa possessed different combinations of pedal morphologies, indicating distinct differences in foot function3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In light of recent discoveries, there is also ambiguity concerning the locomotor affinities of basal members of the genus Homo7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It follows, then, that associated pedal remains of new fossil hominin taxa have the capacity to better our understanding of the complex evolutionary history of bipedalism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Excavations at Dinaledi Chamber, located in the Rising Star Cave System, Gauteng, South Africa, have recovered 107 pedal remains that are assigned to the new hominin taxon Homo naledi10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include a well-preserved right adult foot (Fig 1), and isolated remains representing nearly all pedal elements (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of these elements can be provisionally assigned to two adult and two juvenile feet based on anatomical congruence and taphonomic association (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Digital reconstruction of the foot of H. naledi.All elements belong to Foot 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Dorsal view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Distal view of the cuneiforms and cuboid showing transverse arch reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Medial view showing the moderate longitudinal arch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale is in cm.Full size image', 'We show here that the foot of H. naledi is predominantly modern human-like in bony morphology and inferred function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When considered against the primitive features found elsewhere in the H. naledi postcranial skeleton10, these results indicate a locomotor repertoire that would have been distinct from that of other basal members of the genus Homo, such as H. erectus and H. habilis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The foot of H. naledi thus expands the range of locomotor diversity in both the hominin lineage and the genus Homo.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Talus and calcaneus', 'Full descriptions of talus and calcaneus, as well as all other pedal elements currently assigned to H. naledi, are provided in Supplementary Note 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Dinaledi assemblage includes eight tali (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 3) and four calcanei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H. naledi talar trochlea is proximodistally flatter than that of Australopithecus sediba5, has only a moderate trochlear groove, and medial and lateral trochlear margins at a similar elevation to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H. naledi trochlea is thus derived, as in Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis and later species of Homo, including H. sapiens11, and distinct from the markedly grooved, mediolaterally sloping trochlea of African apes, OH 8 (Supplementary Fig 2) and several specimens from Koobi Fora3,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination with the modern human-like wedging of the trochlea (Supplementary Fig 3), these features suggest H. naledi had comparatively limited ankle mobility, and a modern human-like trajectory of the leg over the foot during the stance phase of gait11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither the talar head nor the proximal navicular facet is extended dorsally, indicating a modern human-like range of dorsiflexion and rotation at the talonavicular joint, which is limited compared with that of chimpanzees12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the average head and neck torsion angle of 38° is within the range of modern humans14, and implies a rigid midfoot with non-parallel calcaneocuboid and talonavicular joint axes during foot supination15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to the trochlea, the neck and head of the tali are medially angled 2026° (Supplementary Table 4), which is intermediate between average values for modern humans and extant apes14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are, however, several features of the H. naledi talus that are distinct from the modern human configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lateral and medial malleolar facets are relatively flared (Supplementary Fig 4), and, for the three intact adult Dinaledi tali, the angle of plantar declination of the talar head ranges between 10° and 18°, which is outside the human range of variation and within that of extant great apes (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low head declination has been suggested to imply a low or absent medial longitudinal arch14, and has been linked to pes planus in a computed tomography-based study of modern human feet16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Multivariate analysis of articular facet-based talar landmark configurations shows that the two most complete H. naledi tali (University of the Witwatersrand (UW) 101148/149 & 1417) fall just at the edge of the human range of variation, and outside those of Pan, Gorilla and Pongo (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Humans and H. naledi (along with Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis and the most intact talus from Koobi Fora, KNM-ER 1464) separate from the great apes (and OH 8) due to a flatter trochlea, less flared malleolar facets and a flatter posterior calcaneal facet3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The most complete calcaneus of H. naledi (U.W.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1011322) is well-preserved along much of its length, but exhibits some damage proximally such that only a small portion of the Achilles insertion on the tuberosity remains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The posterior subtalar joint is flat as in humans and Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis, and unlike that of Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sediba and African apes, implying a limited range of motion5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The orientation of the sustentaculum tali is low compared with that of modern humans and the Omo calcaneus (33-74-896) (Fig 2), and falls within the great ape range, along with the values for Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis and Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sediba.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature has been argued to relate to a low or absent medial longitudinal arch in non-human primates1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peroneal trochlea is weakly developed, unlike in P. troglodytes, Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sediba, Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis, Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  africanus and the Omo calcaneus, but is similar to that of modern humans and Neanderthals, perhaps indicative of reduced peroneal musculature17 in H. naledi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the lateral plantar process is not preserved, the retrotrochlear eminence suggests a modern human-like plantar position rather than the more dorsal one as in Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sediba and chimpanzees5,18 (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the calcaneal tuber is quite gracile, with a relative robusticity outside the range of modern humans (Supplementary Fig 7 and Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distally, the cuboid facet is dorsoplantarly concave, and has a proximally deep, medially placed depression for the cuboid beak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This modern human-like morphology is argued to help create a locking mechanism at the calcaneocuboid joint, yielding a rigid lateral column as the stance phase of gait approaches toe-off19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Salient features of the H. naledi foot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The calcaneal anatomy of H. naledi resembles that of modern humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peroneal trochlea (PT) is markedly reduced and is connected to the lateral plantar process (LPP) by a diagonally oriented retrotrochlear eminence (RE), which helps position the LPP plantarly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the calcaneus of chimpanzees and Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sediba possesses a large and laterally projecting PT, with a more horizontally oriented RE and a dorsally positioned LPP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcanei have been scaled to roughly the same proximodistal length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) As found in modern humans, the H. naledi first metatarsal head is expanded dorsally, a product of parallel oriented lateral and medial rims of the articular surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the chimpanzee head tapers dorsally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  StW 562 (Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  africanus?)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is intermediate, with a mediolaterally wide metatarsal head, but still some dorsal tapering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metatarsals have been scaled to roughly the same size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The talus of H. naledi has human-like head and neck torsion relative to the talar trochlea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the StW 88 (Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  africanus?)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  talus has low torsion, more similar to that found in modern apes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Similar to that found in apes and in some australopiths (StW 88 shown here), the H. naledi head and neck are positioned dorsally relative to the trochlear body (line drawn passes through the proximal and distal extent of the articular surface of the talar trochlea).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modern humans tend to have a more plantarly oriented head and neckan anatomy that has been linked to an arched foot16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tali scaled to roughly the same size.Full size

modern humans, H. floresiensis and the OH 8 foot6,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UW 1011418 presents a distinct Os peroneum facet on the proximolateral border of the peroneal groove, which may signify an oblique passage of the M. fibularis longus tendon and a stiffening of the midfoot20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The only complete medial cuneiform (UW 1011535) preserves a hallucial facet that, although slightly medially orientated, is relatively flat and in line with the tarsometatarsal row as in modern humans, OH 8 and StW 573 (Fig 3), thus indicating an adducted hallux incapable of opposability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in H. sapiens, the intermediate cuneiform facet is L-shaped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Dinaledi intermediate and lateral cuneiforms are proximodistally elongated (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the lateral cuneiform, just distal to the cuboid facet is a small and slightly angled fourth metatarsal facet, indicating a modern human-like fourth metatarsal recession into the tarsal row21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Orientation of the sustentaculum tali relative to the mediolateral axis of the calcaneal tuberosity.There is clear separation between African apes and H.

assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Metatarsals and phalanges', 'There are eight complete metatarsals, five of which were found in association as part of Foot 1 (UW 1011443, 1456-8, 1439; Fig 4 and Supplementary Tables 1115), and a large number of metatarsal fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Foot 1, the metatarsal robusticity ratio is 1 greater than 5 greater than 4 greater than 3 greater than 2, a condition shared with 60% of modern humans, but subtly distinct from the 1 greater than 5 greater than 3 greater than 4 greater than 2 configuration of OH 8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the lateral metatarsals, the hallux is modern human-like in relative length (Supplementary Fig 9), which is in contrast to the markedly short hallux of H. floresiensis6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intermetatarsal facets are dorsally positioned and orientated dorsolaterally as in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The base of the 1st metatarsal is oriented perpendicularly to the long axis of the shaft and is more narrow mediolaterally than OH 8, StW 562 and 595 (but similar to H. sapiens).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diaphysial axes of the lateral metatarsals are oriented more proximolaterally to distomedially than OH 8, StW 89 and StW 114/115 (again, similar to H. sapiens).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bases of the 3rd metatarsals are gracile, whereas those of the 4th metatarsals are tall and robust (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dorsoplantarly flat articular surface of the cuboid facet of the 4th metatarsals (Supplementary Fig 11) indicates that the lateral midfoot was modern human-like and rigid during heel lift, unlike the foot of apes and Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sediba23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metatarsal head torsion values generally fall within modern human ranges of variation (Fig 5)24 and signify the presence of a transverse arch and at least an incipient medial longitudinal arch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heads exhibit dorsal doming, and in many specimens there is a dorsal sulcus just proximal to the head, as in modern humans and australopiths, and indicative of increased loading in dorsiflexion25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first metatarsal head is mediolaterally wide dorsally (Fig 1), as found in modern humans17,26, but has a relative dorsoplantar (DP) height at the low end of the human range (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The robust head of the first metatarsal is consistent with H. naledi having a modern human-like windlass mechanism during toe-off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: First two principal component scores of a generalized Procrustes

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The size of the Dinaledi pedal sample and the clear association among many of the pedal elements provides a rare opportunity to make inferences about foot function in a fossil hominin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively complete Foot 1 has a power arm/load arm ratio of 40.8, which is close to the human mean and distinct from that of chimpanzees30 (Supplementary Table 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a value indicates a foot capable of efficient weight transfer through to a terrestrial substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given an ankle joint that is orthogonal to the long axis of the tibia10, a flat subtalar joint, diminutive peroneal trochlea, locking calcaneocuboid joint, limited dorsiflexion at the talonavicular joint, modern human-like metatarsal lengths, torsion and head proportions, and dorsiflexing phalanges, we infer the Dinaledi hominins pedal function was broadly similar to that of modern humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although the H. naledi foot was undoubtedly stiff during the stance phase of the walking cycle, the ape-like orientation of the sustentaculum tali and low talar head declination are features that may signal a relatively low medial longitudinal arch1,14,16, at least in Foot 1, although this hypothesis will require further testing of the relationship between arch height and bony anatomy of the foot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative flaring of the medial and lateral malleolar facets on the talus also point to increased stability when the foot was maximally inverted or everted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These characters, in combination with relatively low calcaneal robusticity and the more curved proximal pedal phalanges, result in a foot morphology that differed subtly from that found in modern humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This combination of primitive and derived features in the H. naledi foot (Table 1) is thus distinct when compared with the well-known foot assemblages OH 8 (refs 3, 12, 14, 22), StW 573 (refs 3, 31) and pedal remains assigned to H. floresiensis6, Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  afarensis11,17,18,21,25, Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  africanus3, Au.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  sediba5 and Ar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ramidus20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that there are no dates currently assigned to the Dinaledi sample, there are several possible scenarios when considering the H. naledi foot: (i) If the remains are from the early to mid Pliocene, they represent a foot more derived than in any other hominin taxon from that time period, indicating selection for human-like pedal function early in the hominin fossil record; (ii) a date from the late Pliocene/early Pleistocene would indicate a foot more derived than those of a similar age from Koobi Fora3, Olduvai3,12,14, Omo32 or South Africa3,5,23,31, and, although not fully modern human-like, perhaps most similar to that from Dmanisi9; (iii) a more recent date would indicate a foot that, although largely human-like, was distinct from that of H. sapiens, H. floresiensis and H. neanderthalensis, extending the range of variation in Homo foot morphology, and indicating possible stasis for primitive characters such as pedal phalangeal curvature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 The mosaic foot of Homo naledi.Full size table', 'Aside from that of H. sapiens and the Neanderthals, the Dinaledi foot possesses some of the most derived pedal morphologies in the hominin fossil record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are members of the genus Homo known with primitive feet and relatively small brains (H. floresiensis6) and with derived feet and larger brains than H. naledi (for example, early H. erectus9), H. naledi is the first known hominin with this combination of such derived feet and legs with a small brain size10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postcranially, the juxtaposition of such a derived foot in combination with the numerous primitive features found throughout the H. naledi skeleton is a unique mosaic previously unknown in the human fossil record.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the primitive shoulder joint10 and curved manual phalanges29 indicate a decoupling of upper and lower limb function in H. naledi that offers an important insight into postcranial form and function that may have characterized basal Homo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the Dinaledi pedal remains provide further evidence of locomotor diversity within the hominin clade3,4,5,6, and expands that diversity within the genus Homo.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
