Direct visualization of a Fe(IV)OH intermediate in a heme enzyme  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Catalytic heme enzymes carry out a wide range of oxidations in biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have in common a mechanism that requires formation of highly oxidized ferryl intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is these ferryl intermediates that provide the catalytic engine to drive the biological activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unravelling the nature of the ferryl species is of fundamental and widespread importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The essential question is whether the ferryl is best described as a Fe(IV)=O or a Fe(IV)OH species, but previous spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic studies have not been able to unambiguously differentiate between the two species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a different approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report a neutron crystal structure of the ferryl intermediate in Compound II of a heme peroxidase; the structure allows the protonation states of the ferryl heme to be directly observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, together with pre-steady state kinetic analyses, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and single crystal X-ray fluorescence, identifies a Fe(IV)OH species as the reactive intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure establishes a precedent for the formation of Fe(IV)OH in a peroxidase.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The family of heme-containing peroxidase enzymes is widespread in biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They catalyse the H2O2-dependent oxidation of a range of different substrates, and in doing so underpin a number of essential biological processes in bacterial, yeast, plant, fungal and mammalian systems1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key to their catalytic power is the formation of two transient, oxidized heme intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These intermediateswhich are both FeIV (ferryl) species but differ in the oxidation state of the porphyrin ringform sequentially during catalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both intermediates were originally observed in horseradish peroxidase but were mistakenly interpreted as enzymesubstrate complexes: the first (green) intermediate was discovered by Theorell, and the second (red) intermediate by Keilin and Mann3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They were eventually given the names Compound I and Compound II to differentiate them from the enzymesubstrate complex5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These same two intermediates are used widely in numerous other O2-dependent catalytic heme enzymes, most notably the cytochrome P450s, the nitric oxide synthases, the terminal oxidases plus the heme dioxygenases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Many years have passed since the first observations, but establishing the nature of these transient ferryl species remains a fundamental question7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A particular focus has been the nature of the ferryl group in Compounds I and II, and whether it is best described as an Fe(IV)=O or a Fe(IV)OH species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is important because the bonding interactions and the protonation state of the ligand bound to the iron controls the reactivityand hence the biological usefulnessof each intermediate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But this conceptually simple question has proved fiendishly difficult to answer, and thus has become highly controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Part of the problem is that spectroscopic approacheswhich have mainly used EXAFS, resonance Raman, and Mossbauerare only indirect reporters of the protonation state of the ligand; none can directly visualize individual protons and so the picture emerging from spectroscopic analyses has been ambiguous, with some data supporting a Fe(IV)=O formulation and other data supporting Fe(IV)OH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  X-ray crystallographic work later followed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long FeO bond lengths were reported and, as an indirect measure of protonation state, were interpreted as consistent with Fe(IV)OH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But photoreduction is now known to affect X-ray structures, and in the case of ferryl intermediates leads to reduction of the heme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early structures were thus undermined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photoreduction problems likely affect some of the spectroscopic experiments as well11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have approached the question in a completely different way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using neutron diffraction, hydrogen and deuterium atoms are directly visible, and photoreduction does not occur at all13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, if the considerable difficulties of a neutron crystallographic experiment on a reactive enzyme intermediate trapped at low temperature can be overcome, then the approach is potentially transformative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we have used the approach to examine the Compound II intermediate of a heme peroxidase.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Taken together, the data from the crystallographic and spectroscopic experiments are all consistent with the presence of an Fe(IV)OH species in Compound II of APX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A broader comparison with the Compound I and Compound II intermediates of the related P450 enzymes is relevant (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two classes of heme enzymes differ in their heme axial ligationthe P450s contain a Cys thiolate ligand on the proximal side of the heme, while the peroxidases have a histidine ligand instead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compound I of cytochrome P450 has a radical on the porphyrin or the thiolate ligand (or delocalized between the two), and the ferryl heme is unprotonated22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compound I in two closely related thiolate-ligated enzymesaromatic peroxygenase (APO) and chloroperoxidaseare also assigned as Fe(IV)=O/porphyrin -cation radical intermediates7,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no information yet on a histidine-ligated peroxidase with a Compound I carrying a porphyrin -cation radical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best information comes from the atypical CcP (containing a Trp radical instead16), which also contains Fe(IV)=O (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Comparison of Compound I and Compound II intermediates in peroxidases and P450s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Compounds I (shown in red) in CcP (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18) and in both P450 and APO (refs 22, 23) are Fe(V)=O species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) In P450 and APO, there is a large increase in pKa of the ferryl group going from Compound I to Compound II (the latter shown in blue), and the ferryl group is a protonated Fe(IV)OH (refs 21, 24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Compound II of APX is an Fe(IV)OH species, as presented in this paper.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bond lengths for CcP-I are from ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17 and for P450-I and P450-II are from refs 21, 26.Full size image', 'Compound II in the bacterial CYP-158 P450 enzyme is a protonated Fe(IV)OH species21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern of unprotonated/protonated ferryl in Compound I/II in P450 is mirrored in both APO and chloroperoxidase24,25 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This means that there is a large uplift in the ferryl pKa from Compound I (Fe(IV)=O) to Compound II (Fe(IV)OH), which leads to the protonation event.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What causes this shift in pKa of the ferryl heme in these thiolate-ligated systems is not clear, although bond length changes to the axial ligand26, other hydrogen bond changes in the heme active site, and even distortions of the heme may all play a role as part of a complex mixture of variables that, together, dictate the nature and reactivity of the ferryl heme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has been widely assumed that formation of a Fe(IV)OH species is not possible in the peroxidases, but our data demonstrate that it is.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This offers a different perspective on the utilization of these ferryl intermediates across the family of heme enzymes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be seen whether other members of the peroxidase family behave similarly, but there is recent evidence that the ferryl heme could be protonated under certain conditions in other histidine-ligated heme enzymes27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms of proton delivery are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are likely to involve networks of hydrogen-bonded residues and water molecules that connect the distal iron ligands all the way to the solvent surface28,29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As further new information emerges, the data presented here will help to lay a foundation for understanding the subtle and varied mechanisms that control proton delivery and biological reactivity in cytochrome P450 and other catalytic heme enzymes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
