Efficient protein production inspired by how spiders make silk  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Membrane proteins are targets of most available pharmaceuticals, but they are difficult to produce recombinantly, like many other aggregation-prone proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spiders can produce silk proteins at huge concentrations by sequestering their aggregation-prone regions in micellar structures, where the very soluble N-terminal domain (NT) forms the shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that fusion to NT could similarly solubilize non-spidroin proteins, and design a charge-reversed mutant (NT*) that is pH insensitive, stabilized and hypersoluble compared to wild-type NT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NT*-transmembrane protein fusions yield up to eight times more of soluble protein in Escherichia coli than fusions with several conventional tags.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NT* enables transmembrane peptide purification to homogeneity without chromatography and manufacture of low-cost synthetic lung surfactant that works in an animal model of respiratory disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NT* also allows efficient expression and purification of non-transmembrane proteins, which are otherwise refractory to recombinant production, and offers a new tool for reluctant proteins in general.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Membrane-associated proteins account for 2030% of the proteome1 and are the targets of 60% of currently available pharmaceutical drugs2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To get sequestered into the membrane, a protein needs at least one stretch of 1520 amino acid residues that promotes membrane insertion3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chains is an important determinant of aggregation potential4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrophobic amino acid residues also promote -sheet formation and are overrepresented in amyloid forming core regions of many disease associated proteins5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, transmembrane (TM) proteins are prone to aggregate, which may severely impede or even prevent the production of functional recombinant proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To circumvent this problem, several amphiphilic membrane-mimicking or micelle-forming compounds have been developed to stabilize TM proteins in aqueous solutions, for example, small-molecule detergents, protein based nanodiscs6, or amphiphilic polymers7 and peptides8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative is to express the desired protein or peptide in fusion with a solubility enhancing protein domain that supports correct folding and promotes solubility to its fusion partner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solubility tags are typically removed by proteolysis but can also be maintained integrated with the protein to ensure functionality during downstream characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous fusion partners have been reported, and although some have been more successful, they must be evaluated empirically in each case12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thioredoxin (Trx), maltose-binding protein (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and ubiquitin (Ub) are among the most widely used solubility tags that accumulate to high levels in the E. coli cytoplasm and have proven to markedly increase the solubility of many heterologous proteins13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immunoglobulin-binding domain B1 from Streptococcal protein G (PGB1) is another well investigated fusion tag that allows soluble expression of various small proteins and peptides and can remain integrated during downstream structural characterizations due to its small size16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Staphylococcal nuclease A (SN), intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (IFABP) and a 19 repeat tetrapeptide sequence (NANP)19 are examples of less examined tags that have allowed expression of integral TM and -amyloid peptides18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The performance of a solubility tag is dependent on a number of qualities, including expression level and the ability to mediate correct folding and solubility to the target protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that an N-terminal hydrophilic domain derived from spider silk protein could be exploited for expression of recombinant proteins based on its natural function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spider silk consists mainly of large and aggregation-prone proteins (spidroins) that are produced in abdominal glands of spiders22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spidroins from ampullate glands are built up from extensive stretches of repeated alanine- and glycine-rich segments flanked by globular and hydrophilic N- and C-terminal domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During spinning, spidroins are passaged through a narrowing duct and convert into solid fibres in a process that involves precise control of the environmental conditions23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite their aggregation-prone nature, spidroins are stored at remarkably high concentrations (3050% w/w) in the spider silk gland24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies propose that the unusually high solubility is attributed to the amphiphilic nature of spider (and silkworm) silk proteins, allowing them to arrange into micellar structures with the hydrophilic terminal domains sequestering the more hydrophobic repeat regions from the aqueous surrounding, thus preventing premature -sheet formation26,27 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highly conserved N-terminal domain (NT) folds into a soluble 130 residue 5-helix bundle with a dipolar charge distribution28,29 and forms antiparallel dimers at a pH below 6.5 (refs 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35), thus interconnecting spidroins in the spinning duct (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigations on recombinant spidroins derived from the Euprosthenops australis major ampullate spidroin protein (MaSp) 1 revealed that NT mediates solubility in its monomeric conformation at neutral and slightly basic pH29, that is, the condition at which native spidroins are stored in the gland23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, recombinant NT is expressed at remarkably high levels in E. coli and could be concentrated to 216 mg ml1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Spider silk proteins are stored as micellar structuresrationale of the current approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Spidroins are synthesized in the tail region of the gland and stored at physiological pH in the sac.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Premature aggregation may be prevented by formation of micelles, where the hydrophilic NT and CT domains sequester the hydrophobic and repetitive regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dipolar charge distribution of NT is illustrated by +and  signs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During passage through the spinning duct, the pH is gradually lowered, resulting in interconnection of spidroins through antiparallel dimerization of the NT domains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assembly of spidroins gradually takes place due to changes in environmental factors and shear forces along the narrowing duct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the exit point, the repetitive regions have arranged into strong fibres consisting of mainly -sheets, making the spidroins inherently aggregation prone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Recombinant production of hydrophobic and/or aggregation-prone peptides or proteins can be achieved using NT as a fusion tag that mediates solubility and shields hydrophobic/aggregation-prone regions from the aqueous surrounding within micelle-like particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mutant NT* is unable to dimerize at low pH due to a reduced dipolar charge distribution and is therefore able to mediate solubility in a wider pH range than NTwt (c) Size-exclusion chromatography of NT*-rSP-C33Leu shows that that the purified amphipathic fusion protein arrange into 510 kDa assemblies and (d)

and aggregation-prone proteins, we sought for pharmaceutically relevant peptides and proteins that previously have been difficult to produce recombinantly due to hydrophobicity and/or propensity to aggregate or fibrillate during expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The panel we identified includes the surfactant protein analogues SP-C33Leu37, KL4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38) and SP-Css (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39); fragment human surfactant protein D (fhSP-D)40; cholecystokinin-58 (CCK-58)41; amyloid -peptides A1-40 and A1-42 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42); human antimicrobial cathelicidin LL-37 precursor protein (hCAP18)43 and a designed -sheet protein (17)44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TM peptides are mainly represented by the surfactant protein C (SP-C) analogues, which are strictly hydrophobic and highly aggregation-prone, although the amyloid -peptides and the LL-37 peptide from hCAP18 also contain hydrophobic segments that associate to membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'SP-C33Leu, KL4, fhSP-D and CCK-58 were here studied in more detail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SP-C is produced by alveolar type II cells and is a constituent of surfactant, which is necessary to prevent alveolar collapse at end expiration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mature SP-C is a TM -helical lipopeptide of 4.2 kDa45,46, perhaps the most hydrophobic peptide isolated from mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Premature infants often suffer from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) due to insufficient amounts of surfactant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Today, this condition is treated with surfactant preparations extracted from animal lungs, for example, Curosurf, Infasurf, Alveofact and Survanta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with exogenous surfactant is also potentially beneficial for adult patients with respiratory distress, but clinical trials have so far been disappointing47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surfactant preparations based on peptides produced in a heterologous system would be a possible alternative to the natural extracts used today (and formulations containing chemically synthesized peptides) and would also allow efficient screening of structure activity relationships for new analogues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recombinant production of SP-C has been notoriously difficult because of its extremely hydrophobic nature48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Successful attempts include recombinant bacterial production of SP-C analogues with the two Cys residues exchanged for Ser (herein referred to as SP-Css) or Phe, and in fusion with bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)39 or SN21, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CAT fusion requires refolding from inclusion bodies, resulting in less active peptide, while SN fusion gives low yields that would be inadequate for scaled-up manufacturing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SP-C33Leu is an SP-C analogue, developed after more than two decades of structure activity studies of various synthetic SP-C analogues37,49,50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KL4 is another surfactant protein analogue designed to imitate the properties of the lung surfactant protein B (SP-B) and consists of iterated repeats of Lys-Leu-Leu-Leu-Leu38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SP-C33Leu and KL4 recapitulate the function of native surfactant peptides, including transmembraneous insertion52,53, but are less prone to aggregate49 and are therefore feasible to produce for development of synthetic surfactant preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KL4 surfactant is approved by the FDA for prophylactic treatment of premature infants54,55, and CHF5633 based on chemically synthesized SP-C33Leu is in clinical trials for neonatal RDS56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The hydrophilic surfactant proteins A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) belong to the collectin family of proteins and are innate immune proteins participating in the pulmonary host defence system against pathogens and allergens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SP-D is proposed to have a protective role against various lung diseases57 and much effort has been made to produce recombinant variants of SP-D with the purpose of investigating their therapeutic potential58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Native human SP-D comprises four domains: a cysteine-linked N-terminal domain, a triple-helical collagen domain composed of Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats, an -helical coiled-coil domain (neck) and a globular C-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three protein chains associate through their neck domains to form active trimeric subunits that further assemble to larger multimers60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterologous expression of full-length SP-D has so far only been successful in mammalian expression systems, while truncated forms have been evaluated for expression in yeast and bacteria59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recombinant fragment human (rfh)SP-D corresponds to the CRD, the neck and a short stalk of the collagen domain40,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RfhSP-D has been expressed in E. coli but required time-consuming and inefficient solubilization in denaturing agents and subsequent refolding40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide hormone involved in the digestion process and appetite regulation and is released as a precursor peptide (pro-CCK) from cerebral neurons and endocrine I-cells in the small intestine62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple forms exist as a result of cell-specific posttranslational processing of pro-CCK into peptide fragments ranging from 8 to 58 residues and CCK-58 has been reported as one of the main forms present in human intestine and circulation41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human pro-CCK has previously been expressed at low yields in yeast63 but recombinant production of human CCK-58 (rCCK-58), has not been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain significant quantities of peptide for structural determination and receptor-binding studies, it would be beneficial to use bacterial expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we investigate the biophysical properties of a designed NT mutant and show that it enables recombinant production of a panel of hydrophobic and/or aggregation-prone peptides and proteins with higher yields compared to several commonly used solubility tags.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that the surfactant protein analogue SP-33Leu can be produced without the use of chromatography and that the peptide is functional in an in vivo model of RDS.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Design and characterization of a charge-reversed mutant NT*', 'Considering that wild-type NT (NTwt) confers solubility primarily in its monomer conformation above pH 6.5, we designed a charge-reversed double mutant with the intention to increase the useful pH range by preventing dimerization, while still maintaining the ability to arrange into micelle-like particles in fusion with a TM peptide (Fig 1b), in agreement with how the non-polar parts of spidroins are protected within micellar structures (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NT dimerization process is highly dependent on intermolecular electrostatic interactions between the residues Asp40 and Lys65 that play key roles in the initial association of monomers32,33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We designed the double mutant NTD40K/K65D (herein referred to as NT*) by replacing Asp40 with Lys and Lys65 with Asp to prevent association and subsequent dimerization, while preserving the net charge of the domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pH-dependent monomerdimer equilibrium of NTwt can be monitored through the fluorescence shift of a single tryptophan (Trp) residue that becomes more exposed in the dimer32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence ratio at 339/351 nm as a function of pH shows a sigmoidal relationship between monomer and dimer populations, with a pKa of dimerization at pH 6.5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to NTwt, the measured ratio for the novel mutant NT* corresponds to a monomer over the whole pH range (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) in the presence of 150 mM NaCl shows a clear correlation to the Trp fluorescence data measured under the same conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NTwt migrates as a monomer at pH 8 and a dimer at pH 5.5, with a 1.4-fold difference in hydrodynamic radius (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The  less_than 2 difference in apparent size between the two states is predictable from the more compact structure of NTwt subunits in the dimer than in the monomer32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further verify the correlation between Trp fluorescence and SEC data, we investigated several previously reported mutants and could confirm that a constitutive monomer mutant NTA72R (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32) and a constitutive dimer mutant NTE79QE84QE119Q (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33) are pH insensitive and migrate as the NTwt monomer and dimer, respectively (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One particular mutant, NTD40NE79QE119Q, adopts a conformation in between monomer and dimer based on Trp fluorescence data at high pH33 and equivalently, it migrates with an intermediate hydrodynamic radius at pH 8, reflecting the presence of both species (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected from the Trp fluorescence spectra (Fig 2a), the novel mutant NT* migrates on SEC similar to the NTwt monomer in a pH-insensitive manner (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to these findings, 2D 15N1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectra for NT* at both pH 7.2 and 5.5 are comparable to the spectrum measured for monomeric NTwt at pH 7.2 (Fig 3ac), demonstrating that the constitutively monomeric state of NT* is recognized also at a structural level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NMR spectra were recorded at pH 7.2 in the presence of 150 mM NaCl to reduce amide hydrogen exchange with water but at the same time give an NTwt monomerdimer ratio comparable with that at pH 8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When subjected to centrifugal filter concentration in this study, NT* and NTwt could be concentrated to 570 and 310 mg ml1, respectively, before the proteins entered a gel state, indicating a higher intrinsic solubility for NT*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Characterization of the charge-reversed

stability at different pH was determined from urea-induced denaturation monitored with Trp fluorescence spectroscopy to evaluate the level of unfolding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously shown, NTwt is significantly more stable in the dimer conformation at low pH33, while NT* exhibits a pH-insensitive stability corresponding to the NTwt dimer (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparable results were obtained using heat-induced denaturation measured with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, NT* shows identical -helical CD spectra before temperature induced unfolding and after refolding at pH 8 and 5.5 in contrast to NTwt that apparently has a lower refolding capacity, as judged from its about 15% lower CD amplitude at 205225 nm after refolding, in particular at low pH (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Charge re-arrangement, as in NT* compared to NTwt, does not affect the total charge and we suggest that a less dipolar charge distribution together with a lower presence of destabilizing charge clusters in NT* provides an explanation to the observed improved stability and refolding capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Comparison of different solubility tags', 'Recombinant SP-C33Leu (rSP-C33Leu), KL4 (rKL4), rCCK-58 and rfhSP-D fused to NTwt and/or NT* were in comparative experiments benchmarked against at least one additional fusion tag (PGB1, Trx or MBP) in terms of expression, solubility and fusion protein yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NT* tag was thereafter removed to produce pure protein or peptide for further characterization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other proteins and peptides included in this study (A1-40, A1-42, hCAP18, SP-Css and 17) were expressed and purified as NTwt and/or NT* fusion proteins and compared to published yields using other solubility tags (GST, SN, Ub, (NANP)19 or IFABP) (see Supplementary Fig 2 for sequences of all fusion constructs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the solubility after expression in E. coli cells, samples were sonicated without the use of detergents and centrifuged to separate soluble and insoluble fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NTwt and NT* fusion proteins were all abundantly expressed at comparable levels, and exceeding those observed for other fusion tags used for comparative experiments (Supplementary Fig 3ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the higher expression levels for NT are more pronounced than visually observed, since NT is less positively charged compared to the other tags and therefore becomes less stained by the Coomassie dye.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NT*, PGB1 and MBP were all potent mediators of solubility and the bulk of the fusion proteins were found in the soluble fractions (Fig 4ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NTwt demonstrated a more divergent performance with the highest solubility in fusion with rfhSP-D (Fig 4d) and 50% solubility in fusion with rKL4 (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most pronounced difference between NT* and NTwt was seen in fusion with rSP-C33Leu, resulting in mainly insoluble fusion protein together with NTwt, but mainly soluble fusion protein together with NT* (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purification of NT*

1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The yields using NTwt were intermediate, around 1.3- to 4-fold higher than in fusion with PGB1, while Trx was the least efficient solubility tag in fusion with rSP-C33Leu

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Inspired by how spiders store their aggregation-prone silk proteins at extremely high concentration, we have developed a novel method to produce aggregation-prone peptides and proteins in heterologous hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A designed mutant of a spider silk protein domain, NT*, is unable to dimerize and displays markedly increased solubility, stability and refolding capacity compared to NTwt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a comparative study, we showed that NT* allows for soluble expression of the TM peptides rSP-C33Leu and rKL4 as well as of the surfactant protein fragment rfhSP-D and the cholecystokinin peptide rCCK-58, all which previously have been reluctant to recombinant production in E. coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Purification of NT* fusion proteins yielded up to eightfold higher amounts compared to PGB1, Trx and MBP fusion proteins, and all peptides/protein were produced in a soluble form after removal of the tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also showed that the NT* solubility tag can be used to produce several other recombinant proteins and peptides of biomedical relevance, including rA1-40, rA1-42, rhCAP-18, r17 and rSP-Css, with fusion protein yields well exceeding those previously published using other solubility tags (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hypothesized that the amphipathic nature of NT*-TM peptide fusion proteins would allow them to arrange into micelle-like particles, thus protecting the water-insoluble peptide during expression and purification in aqueous solvents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hypothesis was verified from SEC and TEM analysis of purified NT*-rSP-C33Leu and NT*-rKL4, showing a homogeneous population of 10 nm particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, NT* also functioned as a general solubility tag for water-soluble proteins that are prone to misfold or aggregate during heterologous expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying mechanism for solubilizing hydrophilic peptides or proteins remain to be established, but it is likely mediated by the remarkably high inherent solubility and folding capacity of NT*, rather than formation of micelle-like particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To optimize the downstream processes, we developed a method to obtain pure TM peptides without the use of chromatography.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NT* allows for efficient purification of hydrophobic target peptides using just simple NaCl precipitation and ethanol extraction step since none of the CNBr-cleaved fragments of NT* dissolve in the ethanol fraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The procedure described herein is amenable to scale-up and represents a cheap, efficient and, from a regulatory point of view, beneficial way of producing non-animal derived rSP-C33Leu and rKL4 for future clinical use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rSP-C33Leu produced with this method has correct covalent structure, is structurally very similar to the native SP-C peptide as judged by NMR spectroscopy, and a mixture of rSP-C33Leu and synthetic phospholipids has therapeutic effects in an animal model of RDS, similar to the porcine-derived surfactant Curosurf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current therapeutic surfactants contain the hydrophobic-surfactant components, required to restore basal lung function but lack the hydrophilic constituents SP-A and SP-D. Much effort has been made to develop recombinant versions of SP-A and SP-D, but rfhSP-D, previously accumulated into inclusion bodies during expression in E. coli and, consequently, the production was hampered by the requirement of denaturing agents and subsequent refolding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we now show that rfhSP-D can be expressed in a soluble form in E. coli when fused to the NT* solubility tag, and the protein fragment is able to adopt a trimeric conformation that is indicative of native folding, which allows further investigation of its functions and the therapeutic potential in models of human respiratory disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we herein present a novel solubility enhancing fusion tag that allows bacterial expression of a panel of pharmaceutically relevant peptides and proteins with different biochemical properties that previously have been refractory to recombinant production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We benchmark the performance of NT* to several commonly used tags and conclude that fusion to NT* gives up to eight times higher protein yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NT* also allows TM peptide purification to homogeneity without the use of chromatography, and the production of functional synthetic lung surfactant preparations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
