Imaging of pH in vivo using hyperpolarized 13C-labelled zymonic acid  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Natural pH regulatory mechanisms can be overruled during several pathologies such as cancer, inflammation and ischaemia, leading to local pH changes in the human body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that 13C-labelled zymonic acid (ZA) can be used as hyperpolarized magnetic resonance pH imaging sensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZA is synthesized from 1-13Cpyruvic acid and its 13C resonance frequencies shift up to 3.0 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  per pH unit in the physiological pH range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long lifetime of the hyperpolarized signal enhancement enables monitoring of pH, independent of concentration, temperature, ionic strength and protein concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show in vivo pH maps within rat kidneys and subcutaneously inoculated tumours derived from a mammary adenocarcinoma cell line and characterize ZA as non-toxic compound predominantly present in the extracellular space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that ZA represents a reliable and non-invasive extracellular imaging sensor to localize and quantify pH, with the potential to improve understanding, diagnosis and therapy of diseases characterized by aberrant acid-base balance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Maintaining acid-base balance is critical for the survival of living species since cellular processes are highly sensitive to changes in proton concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans, pH is mainly regulated by the CO2/HCO3 buffer within a narrow pH range, in the blood between pH 7.35 and 7.45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Locally, deviations from the systemic pH are often caused by pathologies, such as cancer, inflammation, infection, ischaemia, renal failure or pulmonary disease1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumours can acidify their extracellular environment during aerobic glycolysis and increased export of lactic acid, an effect that can even be further enhanced by the reduced buffer capacity of tumour interstitial fluid and poor tumour perfusion2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of its potentially broad impact, non-invasive imaging of local pH changes has been a major goal in biomedical research, even though so far no technique to measure extracellular pH has been applicable in the clinic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The majority of approaches for non-invasive pH imaging focused on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because of its high spatial resolution and excellent soft-tissue contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, optical methods3 and radioactive tracers4 for positron-emission-tomography (PET) have been developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)-based pH sensor molecules exploit pH-induced changes in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters, such as chemical shifts of individual atomic nuclei, which are sensitive to the protonation state of the molecule and therefore the surrounding pH1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase sensitivity, gadolinium and lanthanide complexes as well as iodinated contrast agents with pH-dependent chemical exchange or relaxation properties were developed5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endogenous amide proton transfer chemical exchange saturation transfer experiments8 utilizing the pH-dependent proton exchange from predominantly intracellular proteins are currently used to study pH in the brain in human.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) revolutionized MRS by lifting nuclear spin polarization to a so-called hyperpolarized state leading to a sensitivity gain by more than four orders of magnitude9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most prominently, hyperpolarized 1-13Cpyruvic acid is currently being used in clinical studies to examine its use for metabolic imaging of prostate carcinoma10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hyperpolarized 13C-labelled bicarbonate has been proposed as a probe for clinical pH imaging based on the determination of the ratio of CO2/HCO3 and recently, spectroscopic pH imaging methods have been revived and demonstrated in vitro including hyperpolarized 15N-pyridine derivatives11 and hyperpolarized 13C-labelled Goods buffers12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, a non-invasive clinical method for pH imaging is lacking so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we introduce hyperpolarized 1,5-13C2zymonic acid (ZA) as a novel probe for MRI of pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that using ZA we can non-invasively image extracellular pH both in vitro and in vivo in the bladder, the kidneys and a tumour model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZAs non-toxicity, its long lifetime of the hyperpolarization enhancement and its strong sensitivity to pH changes render this new technique valuable for further preclinical and clinical studies using extracellular pH as an imaging biomarker to characterize pathologies with aberrant acid-base balance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Synthesis and hyperpolarization of ZA', 'While studying metabolism in tumour cell spheroids using hyperpolarized pyruvate for 13C NMR spectroscopy13, we noticed two additional unassigned peaks, whose changes in chemical shift correlated with the extracellular pH in the cell medium (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found unassigned peaks with similar chemical shifts in the literature14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NMR spectra with unlabelled and fully 13C-labelled, highly concentrated pyruvic acid revealed the presence of three chemical impurities of pyruvic acid, and we identified the pH-sensitive molecule as ZA, based on its 1H and 13C chemical shifts and coupling constants (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When synthesized18 (see Methods for details) from selectively 13C-labelled 1-13Cpyruvic acid, ZA bears two 13C NMR-active spin ½ nuclei and is suitable for long-term storage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In aqueous solution, ZA slowly hydrolyses to parapyruvate (PP) with a half-life of 2.5 h (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZA thus stays chemically intact long enough for experimentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To increase sensitivity in 13C experiments, we developed a hyperpolarization protocol for ZA, and used simultaneously polarized, metabolically inactive 13C urea19 as a chemical shift reference, although a pH determination based solely on the difference in chemical shift of the two 13C nuclei of ZA is possible as well, but with a lower dynamical range (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resulted in a solution polarization level for ZA of 22±2% (n=3, see Methods section) with relatively long longitudinal relaxation times (T1) at 3 T for both ZA1 (T1=43±3 s, n=3) and ZA5 (T1=51±4 s, n=3) in 80 mM Tris buffer in H2O (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For back-calculation of pH from changes in chemical shift of ZA, we determined a calibration curve by measuring the hyperpolarized chemical shifts of both ZA1, ZA5 and urea for pH values covering the physiologically and pathologically relevant pH range (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The determined pKa2=6.90 from the hyperpolarized 13C NMR data agrees well with data from literature20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Mechanism and calibration of the pH dependency of ZA at 7 T.(a) ZA bears two exchangeable protons, one in a carboxy group with an acid

and blood phantoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to its robustness towards gradient errors, motion and flow artefacts, as well as off-resonance effects, we used a free induction decay chemical shift imaging (FIDCSI) sequence leading to a full spectrum for each voxel21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Back-calculation of pH on a voxel-by-voxel basis from the acquired spectra results in a spatially localized pH map for a buffer (Fig 2a) and a blood phantom (Fig 2b) of compartments pre-adjusted to different pH values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments with varying buffer compositions and conditions demonstrated the sensors robustness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linear fit shows excellent correlation (R2=0.99) between the 13C biosensor pH values determined from hyperpolarized buffer and blood phantom experiments and subsequent

electrode pH values are shown in white.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZA and urea were simultaneously hyperpolarized and injected into (a) six buffer phantoms and (b) two blood phantoms prepared at different pH

reduction in cell viability when exposed to ZA concentrations relevant during an in vivo experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-toxicity was further substantiated by dose escalation experiments in three rats (Supplementary Figs 7 and 8) and a toxicopathological study (Methods section, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figs 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since concentration of ZA and local temperature could vary substantially in vivo upon injection, the influence of these two parameters on a pH determination needs to be known for a robust measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus recorded 13C chemical shifts of ZA and urea as a function of pH at three different concentrations of ZA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No differences between the three series of measurements could be detected, making ZA a concentration-independent pH sensor within the experimentally relevant concentration range (Supplementary Fig 11a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then tested for a temperature dependence of the relevant pKa2 by regular acid-base titration of ZA solutions at different temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diprotic acid titration curves revealed a very weak temperature dependence of pKa2/T=0.015±0.005 pH per °C (Supplementary Fig 11b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, ZAs pH sensitivity is a concentration and temperature-independent effect within biologically relevant conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we showed that variations in ionic strength (Supplementary Fig 12) and protein concentration (Supplementary Fig 13) are not substantially influencing ZAs pH determination accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The acquisition of spatially localized pH maps in vivo requires a sufficiently long signal lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longitudinal relaxation times were determined in vivo by performing slice selective time-resolved spectroscopy, resulting in an apparent T1 of 17±2 s (mean±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; n=6, three independent slices per two animals) for ZA1 and 16±1 s (mean±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; n=6) for ZA5 at 7 T (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the apparent T1 of ZA is slightly longer than the apparent T1 of urea (13±2 s, mean±s.d., n=6, B0=7 T), placing ZA on the same level with a well-established hyperpolarized compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In vivo pH measurement in rat bladder', 'First, we tested whether a pH measurement using ZA gives reliable results in vivo where an independent validation of the pH is possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we injected simultaneously hyperpolarized ZA and urea via a catheter directly into the filled rat bladder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source of the hyperpolarized signal of both ZA and urea (Fig 3a,b) clearly stemmed from the bladder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the localized spectroscopic imaging data (Fig 3d), a pH map (Fig 3c) was calculated, resulting in a 13C biosensor pH of 6.48±0.02 (n=9 pixels, mean±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), in good agreement with the pH of 6.55±0.01 determined via pH electrode in the urine, sampled from the

hyperpolarized ZA and urea originated from the kidneys with a noticeable amount detected in the blood pool (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered up to three pairs of ZA peaks within the same voxel (Fig 4e) forming three pH clusters with a pH of 7.40±0.01, 6.94±0.05 and 6.55±0.03 (Fig 4d,f, n=4 rats, mean±s.d., representative fitting residuals shown in Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on their consistent pH values with data from literature22, these pH clusters were tentatively attributed to the cortex, medulla and calyx/ureter, respectively, reflecting the transition effects of the blood pH before, during and after processing, filtering and renal metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weighing the pH from the three compartments by their respective amplitudes, a mean pH map was calculated (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extravasation of ZA and its accumulation in renal tissue in both cortex and medulla was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Despite the relevance of extracellular pH for the characterization of human pathologies, there is currently no method to non-invasively map the spatial distribution of pH by clinical imaging methods, creating a pressing need for the development of pH imaging probes with potential for clinical translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a novel pH imaging approach using hyperpolarized ZA as an MRI pH sensor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results showed that this pH imaging method is independent of concentration, temperature, ionic strength and protein concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, ZAs pH sensitivity arises from protonation and deprotonation in proximity to its 13C-labelled sites, which is fast on the NMR timescale (103104 Hz under physiological conditions25) and allows an assessment of pH whenever the agent reaches its target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated that in vivo pH maps within rat kidneys and adenocarcinomas can reliably be determined, and in both cases two to three pH compartments within one imaging voxel can be separated, which is a unique feature of ZA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Important criteria for the evaluation of a novel pH probe are the achievable spatial and temporal resolution, its sensitivity, accuracy to determine pH, toxicity, its potential to disturb the acid-base balance during the measurement, and knowledge about its presence in the vascular, extravascular or intracellular compartments or a combination of the aforementioned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In comparison to hyperpolarized 13C-labelled bicarbonate26, which has been proposed as a probe for clinical pH imaging and which currently is the most prominent among the hyperpolarized pH probes, ZA-based pH imaging offers several advantages: First, ZA has a relatively long signal lifetime with an apparent T1 of 17 s at 7 T in vivo, whereas bicarbonate has a shorter apparent T1, which is 10 s in vivo at both 3 T and 9.4 T (refs 26, 27); second, ZA is highly soluble and does not need enzymatic conversion to become an active pH probe, whereas bicarbonate exhibits a relatively small equilibrium CO2 signal (6% of HCO3 at pH 7.4) and limited solubility at physiological pH; third, ZA is localized in the extracellular space and slowly excreted through the kidneys and decomposes into endogenous substrates, whereas CO2 through respiration and diffusion across cell membranes is not clearly restricted to the extracellular space; fourth, ZA relies on the determination of pH through the measurement of chemical shift displacements, whereas for bicarbonate pH mapping, there is a need for ratiometric analysis of signal amplitudes which is difficult at a low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR); fifth, pH measurements using ZA does not involve any enzymes in contrast to bicarbonate pH imaging, where the enzyme concentration (that is, carbonic anhydrase) influences the speed at which pH can be measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The pH determination accuracy of ZA was found to be high enough to detect relevant pathological pH changes in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pH dispersion of the 13C chemical shift of ZA1 in the physiological pH range is 3.0 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  per pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to a frequency shift of 96 Hz per pH at a clinical field strength of 3 T. Assuming that peaks can be distinguished at 20% of their linewidth apart, which we measured to be on the order of 3050 Hz in vivo, this results in a pH resolution of 0.1 pH units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar accuracies have been reported for other chemical shift-based hyperpolarized probes like 13C,15NACES, although this probe has so far only been proven to work in vitro12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A larger pH dispersion of the 13C chemical shifts of a probe would theoretically allow for a higher accuracy of the pH measurement but comes with the drawback that RF excitation pulses then need to cover a larger bandwidth, which is challenging for the RF pulse design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, chemical shift displacement artifacts impede accurate slice selective excitation of all pH-sensitive resonances if resonances are spread out further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the chemical shift imaging (CSI) readout would need to cover a larger frequency bandwidth resulting in increased noise from the receiver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These limitations could pose a challenge for the recently introduced hyperpolarized 15N-labelled probes based on pyridine and histidine derivatives that have been reported to show pH-dependent chemical shifts of more than 80 p.p.m.11,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the applicability of these probes still has to be proven under in vivo conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our fitting residuals shown in Supplementary Fig 15 indicate that fitting ZA in multiple tissue compartments in kidney and tumour is reasonable, complete separation and fitting of extravascular and intravascular pH compartments remains challenging for the case of small pH differences between individual compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A limitation for most hyperpolarized 13C imaging methods is the low spatial resolution compared to other imaging methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spectral bleeding artefacts, where high-intensity spectral peaks are reproduced in neighbouring voxels, can lead to a further reduction in the resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging methods have a better spatial resolution in the mmm range with good specificity but poor sensitivity7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FIDCSI sequence used in this work (see Methods section) has a slice thickness of 5 mm and a nominal in-plane resolution of 3.75 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Zero filling by a factor of four results in an apparent in-plane resolution of 0.94 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking into account the shape of the point spread function of the circular sampling scheme, the in-plane resolution is affected by a factor of 1.40 resulting in a real in-plane resolution of 5.25 mm and an apparent in-plane resolution of 1.31 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial resolution of hyperpolarized 13C pH imaging could be further improved by implementing alternative acquisition schemes such as echo planar spectroscopic imaging or using cryogenically cooled receive coils such that sub-millimetre resolution for pH imaging seems possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Echo planar spectroscopic imaging increases the gradient hardware and magnetic field homogeneity requirements but reduces the time needed to acquire an image, thereby improving SNR and real resolution21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have established non-toxicity of our agent in a toxicopathological study and with dose escalation experiments at doses up to five times of the injected dose for the in vivo pH measurement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might facilitate clinical translation compared to other pH imaging agents, where toxic effects can arise from Gd3+-chelates in patients with renal insufficiency29 or from preparations of hyperpolarized caesium bicarbonate, where toxic caesium30 is used to increase the bicarbonate concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The injected substances ZA and urea could potentially act as buffering agents and influence the pH value they are measuring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a pKa0.18 of its conjugated acid in water, urea cannot act as a buffer in the physiological pH range and thus does not influence the measured pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For all pH probes for which the pH determination is based on a protonation/deprotonation mechanism within the pH range of interest, the pH measurement is effectively based on the buffering functionality of the pH probe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ZA with a pKa of 6.90 is injected at a concentration of 50 mM and is diluted to a concentration of about 5 mM if evenly distributed in the blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The actual bicarbonate concentration in the blood at full oxygen saturation and 37 °C is 2126 mM, with the CO2/HCO3 equilibrium acting as the main natural buffer component in human.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When, as in the current study, the injection of ZA results in low mM concentrations of ZA in the blood, one should not expect a significant alteration in pH even if much larger relative doses31 are injected in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Evidence suggests that ZA extravasates and predominantly stays in the extracellular/interstitial space, thus measuring extracellular pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extravasation of ZA to renal tissue is confirmed by MALDI-MSI in kidney slices (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the pH measured using ZA in MAT B III tumour bearing rats with the pH values determined by three other interstitial/extracellular pH measurements (31P MRS, needle-type optical sensor, electrode) showed good agreement between these methods, suggesting that ZA can measure and distinguish both extravascular (interstitial/extracellular) and intravascular pH (Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the fact that ZA, instead of using a ratiometric method, uses differences in chemical shifts to determine the pH, allows for the detection of several pH compartments within the same voxel (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If an intracellular pH compartment with a pH predominantly around 7.4 would provide a significant contribution to the overall signal, an additional pair of ZA peaks should be observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 1 shows a cell experiment with just one pair of ZA peaks belonging to a compartment with a 13C biosensor pH that correlates well with the pH measured using a conventional pH electrode measuring the extracellular pH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since no second pair of ZA peaks is visible in this experiment, no significant amount of ZA has entered the cell suggesting that ZA stays mainly extracellular.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ZA can be used for pH imaging either with simultaneously hyperpolarized urea as a pH-independent chemical shift reference as demonstrated in this work or without urea to decrease the number of substances required to be injected in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When ZA is used as a pH imaging sensor without urea, the difference in chemical shift as a function of pH between the two 13C positions within ZA can be used to back calculate the pH (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the range of pH 68, both methods give nearly identical results, but the dynamic range of potential pH values to be measured is larger when the urea peak is included in the pH evaluation, since the pH determination precision is higher at the limit of the sensors sensitivity when using urea as a reference (RMSE0.09 pH units compared to RMSE0.019 pH units between the 13C biosensor pH measurement and the electrode pH measurement).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As for other currently known 13C-labelled probes, a major limitation of using hyperpolarized ZA for in vivo applications is its polarization lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be prolonged by performing the pH measurements at a reduced clinical field strength and by deuteration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For hyperpolarized 13C experiments, higher magnetic fields result in a larger chemical shift separation between the peaks of interest, allowing for easier discrimination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, higher magnetic fields lead to shorter T1 relaxation times, reducing the time available for hyperpolarized measurements, and in contrast to conventional experiments, higher magnetic fields do not result in larger signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it would be best to perform the measurements at an intermediate and well-shimmed magnetic field, for example, at clinically widely available 3 T
