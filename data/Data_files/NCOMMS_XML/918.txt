Endogenous opioids regulate moment-to-moment neuronal communication and excitability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fear and emotional learning are modulated by endogenous opioids but the cellular basis for this is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intercalated cells (ITCs) gate amygdala output and thus regulate the fear response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we find endogenous opioids are released by synaptic stimulation to act via two distinct mechanisms within the main ITC cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endogenously released opioids inhibit glutamate release through the -opioid receptor (DOR), an effect potentiated by a DOR-positive allosteric modulator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postsynaptically, the opioids activate a potassium conductance through the -opioid receptor (MOR), suggesting for the first time that endogenously released opioids directly regulate neuronal excitability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultrastructural localization of endogenous ligands support these functional findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study demonstrates a new role for endogenously released opioids as neuromodulators engaged by synaptic activity to regulate moment-to-moment neuronal communication and excitability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These distinct actions through MOR and DOR may underlie the opposing effect of these receptor systems on anxiety and fear.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The amygdala is central to our emotional responses1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, anxiety and fear learning rely on neural circuits and synaptic plasticity within the amygdala1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These anxiety and fear responses are modulated by our endogenous opioid system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deleting one family of endogenous opioids, the enkephalins, increases behavioural measures of fear and anxiety3,4, whereas inhibiting enkephalin breakdown reduces these behaviours5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that endogenous enkephalin is anxiolytic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, enkephalin is an agonist at both the -opioid receptor (MOR) and -opioid receptor (DOR)6,7 and the consequence of activating each receptor results in opposing behavioural outcomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed activation of DOR is anxiolytic5,8,9, while activation of MOR is anxiogenic9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given this complexity, understanding the cellular actions of endogenous opioids at the DOR and MOR in the amygdala is critical if we hope to utilize opioid related therapy for emotional disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while endogenous opioids regulate fear and many other behaviours, including: pain, decision making, drug dependence and memory11, their cellular actions in the brain are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies in various brain regions suggest endogenous opioid regulation of synaptic activity requires intense stimulation12,13 and often this is shown to regulate long-term plasticity of synapses12,14,15,16,17,18, rather than normal synaptic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been taken to suggest that endogenously released opioids regulate learning rather than continuous information flow through a dynamic neural circuit19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is an open question whether endogenously released opioids produce this myriad of behavioural responses solely through the regulation of synapses under intense neuronal activity (such as during learning), or whether regulation under basal conditions also contributes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Opioid receptors and peptides are expressed to varying degrees throughout the amygdala20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the intercalated cells (ITCs) are one possible site where enkephalin could regulate fear and anxiety behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ITCs are small clusters of densely packed GABAergic neurons that en-sheath the basolateral amygdala (BLA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coronal sections give rise to three separate clusters: the smaller lateral (lpc) and medial (mpc) paracapsular ITC clusters are located within the external and intermediate capsules respectively and the larger main island (Im), is located ventromedial to the BLA22 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the lpc provides feedforward inhibition to the BLA23, the mpc acts as an inhibitory interface between the BLA and CeA and thus regulates fear learning24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular the mpcs are required for fear extinction25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Less is known about the functional role of the main island although it is possible the Im plays a similar role to the mpc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Im neurons also receive sensory information from both the BLA24,26 and the thalamus27 along with more complex information from the medial pre-frontal cortex (mPFC), a region highly implicated in fear extinction28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like the mpcs, the Im sends inhibitory GABAergic projections to the medial central nucleus (CeM)21,26,30 and thus could gate expression of the conditioned fear response31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Im may be particularly important during fear extinction as extinction activates Im neurons22,32, their ablation (along with the mpc) reduces extinction25 and treatments that reverse the extinction deficit in anxious mice elevate Im neuron activity32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Met-enkephalin expressed within the main ITC island is positioned to modulate excitatory synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of amygdala subdivisions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ITC islands are shaded in grey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BLA, basolateral amygdala; CeL, lateral central amygdala and CeM, medial central amygdala make up the central amygdala (CeA); Im, Main ITC island; lpc, lateral ITC; mpc, medial ITC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Single confocal images in the amygdala (Bregma 2.00 mm) of ME (green), MOR (magenta) and the two merged channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Im is outlined by the dashed line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 100 m.

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'ME in dense core vesicles overlaps with MOR expression in Im', 'Consistent with previous reports, we found high immunoreactivity for both MOR and ME in the main ITC cluster (Im; Fig 1b)20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong ME immunoreactivity also occurred in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and in a scattering of cells within the BLA (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diffuse MOR immunoreactivity was found in both the BLA and CEA (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the overlapping distribution of ME and MOR within Im (Fig 1b, merge) we focused specifically on this cluster of ITCs for this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore possible ME targets, we used immuno-electron microscopy to determine the ultrastructural location of ME within the Im region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that ME immunoreactivity was concentrated in dense core vesicles (DCVs) located in axons and axon terminals (Fig 1ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These terminals were directly apposed to (Fig 1c,d) or convergent with (Fig 1e) axon terminals that form asymmetrical (assumed glutamatergic) synapses onto dendrites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, ME is well placed to be released following synaptic activation and in turn, modulate glutamate release within Im.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DOR and MOR agonists reduce glutamate release from the BLA', 'One of the main glutamatergic inputs to Im neurons is from pyramidal neurons of the BLA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BLA-Im synapses (Im referred to as medial ventral ITC in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16) in mice have recently been shown to be insensitive to regulation by MOR16, however, it is not known whether this holds across different species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore tested the sensitivity of this synapse to all three opioid receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this we made whole-cell patch recordings from Im neurons and routinely performed post hoc biocytin staining of the patched cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, staining revealed small bipolar neurons, with an abundance of dendritic spines, located in a cell dense region ventromedial to the BLA (Fig 2a)26,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We electrically stimulated the BLA (Fig 2b) and recorded the resulting evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (eEPSC) in Im neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found BLA-Im eEPSCs were inhibited by selective agonists for DOR (Deltorphin II, 300 nM) or MOR (DAMGO, 1 M; Fig 2c,d), which was accompanied with an increase in the paired pulse ratio (PPR, Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both effects were fully reversed by the selective DOR (ICI174864, 1 M) and MOR (CTAP, 1 M) antagonists respectively (Fig 2ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, neither the -opioid receptor (KOR) agonist (U69593, 3 M) nor antagonist (norBNI, 10 nM) affected the eEPSC amplitude or PPR (Fig 2ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate the BLA-Im synapse is strongly inhibited through DOR and MOR and the associated increases in PPR indicates the likely site of action is through pre-synaptic reductions in glutamate release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opioid sensitivity is consistent with the high expression of DOR mRNA in BLA neurons21 and the expression of MOR in BLA pyramidal neurons34 but does differ from the recently reported MOR insensitivity of this synapse described in mice16, suggesting there may be inter-species variability in opioid action within the Im.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: DOR and MOR activation inhibits glutamate release at the BLA-ITC synapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Post hoc confocal images of DAPI (blue) and biocytin-labelled ITCs (red/white).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low power image shows intense DAPI labelling with high cell density within Im.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single image; scale bar, 100 m.

captopril, 1 M and bestatin, 10 M; Fig 3d), could increase endogenous opioid inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This peptidase inhibitor cocktail significantly enhanced the effects of exogenously applied, submaximal ME (300500 nM) on eEPSC amplitude (Fig 3e,f), confirming these peptidases act to break down exogenous ME and thus limit its actions at the BLA-Im synapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is important to note these targeted peptidases are non-selective metalloproteases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, blocking their activity has the potential to enhance the activity of other off-target endogenous signalling peptides (for example, substance P39,40, neurokinin41,42; neurotensin42,43) that may act either in concert or opposition to endogenous opioid signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, while inhibiting peptidase activity with the peptidase inhibitor cocktail on average, reduced eEPSC amplitude in response to both low (12.9±5.4% inhibition, n=7) and moderate (32.1±6.2% inhibition, n=8) stimuli (for example, Fig 3g,h), there was a high degree of variability, with either inhibition (12/18 neurons); no effect (3/18 neurons) or an increase observed (3/18 neurons).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we defined endogenous opioid action as the naloxone-induced increase in eEPSC following peptidase inhibitor treatment (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, there was variability in the timing of the peptidase inhibitor response, which could reflect the time required to accumulate sufficient peptide or differences in restricting microarchitecture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this variability in peptidase inhibitor response, naloxone significantly increased eEPSC amplitudes in all cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to possible dominance of confounding off-target signalling peptides in cells where the peptidase inhibitors increased the eEPSC amplitude, these cells were excluded from further analysis of the endogenous opioid effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the remaining cells, naloxone induced a significant increase in eEPSC amplitude using both low (Fig 3g,i) and moderate stimuli (Fig 3h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate endogenous opioids are released during low-stimulus experiments but eEPSC amplitude remains unchanged due to rapid degradation of the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, it shows that the actions of endogenously released opioids, released in response to the moderate stimulus, are limited by peptidase activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when peptidases are inhibited, the first pulse of the moderate stimulus train was also increased by naloxone (40.2±4.8% increase, n=8, P less_than 0.01 peptidase inhibitor versus naloxone, paired t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As this did not occur without peptidase inhibitors (10.7±6.4% increase, n=7, P greater than 0.05 baseline versus naloxone, paired t-test), this suggests endogenously released opioids are broken down by peptidases during the 15 s inter-stimulus interval.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Endogenously released opioids signal through DOR', 'We tested whether endogenously released opioids acted through DOR or MOR using our strongest paradigm (moderate stimulus and peptidase inhibitor cocktail), and applying selective DOR and MOR antagonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that while CTAP had no effect, ICI174864 increased eEPSC amplitude (Fig 4a,b) to the same extent as naloxone (P greater than 0.05, unpaired t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While ICI174864 does have modest inverse agonist activity at DOR, since the effect of ICI174864 was not different from the neutral antagonist naloxone, inverse agonism is unlikely to explain the current findings44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data indicate that endogenously released opioids only inhibit the BLA-Im synapse through DOR activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Endogenously released opioids act exclusively through DOR and their signalling is enhanced by a DOR PAM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Endogenous opioids signal exclusively through DOR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Moderate stimulus test eEPSCs and corresponding time plot from single representative experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Bar chart of percentage increase of eEPSC amplitude by selective antagonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MOR antagonist CTAP (1 M) produced no change while DOR antagonist, ICI174864 (ICI, 1 M) significantly increased test eEPSC amplitude (**P less_than 0.01, paired t-test, versus PI).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ce) The DOR PAM BMS-986187 (BMS, 1 M) (c) significantly enhanced exogenous ME inhibition (submaximal, 100 nM) after at least 15 min continuous perfusion and (d) decreased single stimulus evoked eEPSC amplitude in absence of exogenous ligand, both were fully reversed by naloxone indicating PAM and not agonist activity of BMS-986187 (see also Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Data displaying eEPSCs and time plots of single representative experiment and (e) summary bar chart (**P less_than 0.01, repeated ANOVA;

P greater than 0.05 naloxone versus baseline, Tukeys post hoc comparisons, Fig 4c,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BMS-986187 is known to have agonist properties at higher concentrations45 and BMS-986187 alone induced a small but significant decrease in eEPSC amplitude (Fig 4d,e; P less_than 0.05, paired t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these experiments, we used single synaptic stimuli (0.06 Hz) to minimize release of endogenous opioids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this BMS-986187 inhibition was reversed by naloxone (Fig 4d,e) and we found that direct agonism by BMS-986187, resulting in -arrestin recruitment and inhibition of cAMP production in CHO-OPRD1 cells, was insensitive to naloxone (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the naloxone sensitive inhibition of the BLA-Im synapse by BMS-986187 alone is not due to intrinsic agonist activity of BMS-986187, rather it is likely due to positive allosteric modulation of endogenously released opioids signalling at DORs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we know that PAMs can increase responses to exogenous opioids in cell lines45, this is the first instance in which increases in endogenous opioid signalling have been observed (Fig 4d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate PAM activity on endogenous opioid signalling, we tested the effects of BMS-986187 on our previous treatment paradigms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When slices were preincubated with BMS-986187 ( greater than 45 min) and peptidases were inhibited, the naloxone-induced increase was significantly greater than peptidase inhibitors alone in response to the low stimulus (Fig 4f,g), but had no further effect when using the moderate stimulus (CTL: 36.0±6.5% increase, n=8; BMS-986187: 36.8±5.9% increase n=5, P greater than 0.05, unpaired t-test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since naloxone produced comparable increases in eEPSC irrespective of stimulation intensity when in the presence of BMS-986187, this may indicate saturation of endogenously released opioid regulation at this synapse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Endogenous opioids activate a postsynaptic conductance', 'Exogenous opioids activate a potassium conductance in Im neurons16 and in many other brain regions46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is not known whether endogenously released opioids can activate this potassium conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the strong endogenous opioid regulation in Im neurons (current findings), their very high MOR expression21 and that 60% of MOR receptors are in postsynaptic dendritic compartments34,35, we wondered whether endogenously released opioids could directly regulate Im neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have already shown ME is well placed to regulate synaptic transmission (Fig 1ce), but we also found ME immunoreactivity in multiple terminals converging onto large dendrites (Fig 5a) within Im, suggesting ME directly acts at postsynaptic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, exogenous ME (30 M) produced an outward current in all neurons (37.5±4.1 pA, n=20) that could be readily reversed either after washout (n=16) or by CTAP (n=4; Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currentvoltage analysis before and during ME indicates activation of a potassium conductance as the reversal potential of the ME-induced current was close to the potassium reversal potential (MErev: 103.2±1.4 mV, n=9;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We found that endogenous opioids released by electrical stimulation, activated a post-synaptic potassium conductance in Im neurons and also inhibited their glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibiting peptidase activity potentiated these post-synaptic and pre-synaptic actions of the endogenously released opioid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the BLA-Im synapse, endogenously released opioids inhibited neurotransmitter release through DOR but not MOR, even though both receptors are functional at the synapse, suggesting other factors control endogenous opioid action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A DOR PAM potentiated this inhibition and to our knowledge, this is the first example of an opioid PAM potentiating the actions of an endogenously released opioid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up until now, endogenous opioids have been considered neuromodulators that regulate synapses and their plasticity during intense neuronal activity, which suggests an important role in learning12,14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These current findings indicate a different role of endogenously released opioids, namely as neuromodulators that are engaged by synaptic activity to influence moment-to-moment information flow through dynamic Im-associated circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is likely the endogenous opioids regulating Im neuronal activity are met- and leu-enkephalin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endogenous opioid actions we have described are through MOR and DOR, both of which are potently and efficaciously activated by the enkephalins6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We describe this phenomenon in Im neurons of the amygdala, which express high levels of enkephalins20,21 and the effects are terminated by peptidases, known to breakdown enkephalins38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Endorphin is the other major opioid peptide that acts at MOR and DOR but is expressed in Im neurons at much lower levels48 and is much less sensitive to peptidase degradation compared to enkephalin49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Im neurons have a low firing frequency in vivo ( less_than 0.1 Hz)29, subsequent orthodromic spike bursts29 or recurrent firing50 following synaptic stimulation or current injection could effectively release endogenous opioids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our present findings support the premise that endogenous opioid release is activity dependent, however the intensity of this activity is much less than originally anticipated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, within our working model (Fig 7a), enkephalin is released in response to neuronal activity and this is likely from Im neurons, although it is possible that enkephalins are also released from BLA or CeA synaptic projections rather than from Im neurons alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Working model of endogenous opioid actions in Im.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Working model of endogenously released opioid signalling within Im.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (1) Lowmoderate stimuli at BLA-Im synapses promote release of endogenous enkephalins from dense core vesicles (DCV) contained within Im neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sufficient peptide release through moderate stimulation is required to overcome peptidases and allow enkephalin signalling through DOR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enkephalin reduces BLA-Im synaptic activity by decreasing pre-synaptic glutamate release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) Moderate stimuli, together with peptidase inhibition, are required to overcome potential microarchitectural constraints to allow enkephalin-induced MOR activation that reduces presynaptic GABA release at local ImIm synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (3) Activation of postsynaptic MORs by endogenously released opioids activates a potassium conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting efflux of K+ ions hyperpolarizes ITCs reducing their excitability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent synaptic activity is also shunted (for example, blue arrows) due to decreased input resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both outcomes are expected to reduce total Im activity and limit feed forward inhibition from Im to CeM neurons, thus affecting amygdala output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Schematic representation of information flow through the amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Putative thalamic/cortical glutamatergic (blue) afferents carry sensory information to the lateral amygdala (LA), activating BLA pyramidal neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These subsequently activate medial central amygdala (CeM) output neurons to promote fear behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BLA excitatory afferents also project to Im, which then sends inhibitory GABAergic (red) efferents to the CeM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other inputs (for example, from mPFC), traverse the intermediate capsule to activate Im neurons and contribute to feed-forward inhibition of CeM, preventing a fear response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thinner lines depict putative inputs from the cortex, lateral/medial ITCs and the lateral central amygdala (CeL), all of which directly or indirectly affect amygdala output.Full size image', 'Exogenously applied opioids activate a postsynaptic potassium conductance, in many neurons, including the Im16,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while exogenously applied agonists inform us of what to expect when individuals are administered an opioid drug such as morphine, this method provides limited insight into how the endogenous opioid system functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study is the first example of endogenously released opioids, or in fact any endogenously released neuropeptide, activating a potassium conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting membrane hyperpolarization would be expected to increase the excitatory synaptic input required to produce postsynaptic action potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the lower membrane resistance would likely shunt synaptic inputs from more distal synapses and thus could reduce the ability of all excitatory synaptic inputs to produce postsynaptic action potentials (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario would be particularly important if enkephalins are acting at the large dendrites we observed to be associated with ME immunereactive terminals (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These additional roles for endogenous opioids as regulators of postsynaptic excitability and membrane resistance would be expected to have a widespread effect on information flow through the Im.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it is feasible that endogenously released opioids could limit the impact of all synaptic inputs on the membrane potential of Im neurons and thus alter feed-forward signalling in this neural circuit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to previous studies that describe endogenous opioid actions that are limited to inhibiting pre-synaptic inputs that express opioid receptors13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first instance in which endogenous opioids have been shown to influence postsynaptic neuronal excitability, which in turn would be expected to alter the neuronal response to synaptic inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In Im, we found that endogenous opioids are released in response to electrical stimulation, although reducing their breakdown or enhancing DOR sensitivity was required to observe a cellular effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found this surprising, as enkephalin is stored in dense core vesicles51 (Fig 1ce) and optimal neuropeptide release from dense core vesicles traditionally occurs with more intense, higher frequency stimulation37,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, endogenous opioid actions at other synapses require intense stimulation paradigms12,14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that dense core vesicle release is differently regulated in Im neurons, perhaps through differences in release machinery or intracellular calcium handling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, we may be able to measure a response to the small amount of peptide released because Im neurons are highly sensitive to opioids and the local microarchitecture between release site and receptor is favourable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that exogenous ME acts at both MOR and DOR at BLA-Im synapses, while endogenously released opioids only acts through DOR, further suggests local microarchitecture may govern the actions of endogenously released opioids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both met-enkephalin and leu-enkephalin have similar affinity for MOR and DOR6,7, so a difference in affinity for the receptors cannot explain our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, MOR receptors on BLA-Im synapses may be located farther from the endogenous opioid release site or be more closely associated with membrane bound peptidases53, both of which would reduce the ME concentration at MOR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar difference in receptor activation between exogenous and endogenously released agonist, occurs in the striatum13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This, together with our findings, suggests we should be wary of assuming the effects of exogenous agonists are indicative of how endogenous agonists signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of the reason for the high sensitivity, this combination of ready releasable endogenous opioids and their action at multiple sites, including direct effects via a potassium conductance and the inhibition of synaptic inputs, would predict that endogenously released opioids are strong regulators of Im activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Activation of MOR and DOR results in opposite behavioural fear responses with activation of DOR being anxiolytic8 and activation of MOR being anxiogenic10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cellular basis for these opposing actions of opioid receptors is likely complex and occurs at multiple sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a cellular level, we have shown there is anatomical specificity of the endogenous opioid action at MOR and DOR in the Im.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest this could provide a basis for understanding the opposite actions of MOR and DOR activity on anxiety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Im, endogenously released opioids act via DOR to reduce the strength of BLA synaptic inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this reduced excitatory drive from the BLA could decrease Im outputs to target neurons, it is also possible that it could allow Im neurons to be more strongly influenced by other inputs, such as those from the cortex that carry more complex/contextual information31,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a DOR-mediated shift in strength of synaptic inputs could contribute to DOR-mediated anxiolytic processes such as fear extinction (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinct from this, the endogenous opioid actions at MOR directly inhibit Im neuronal excitability and through this, likely reduce their activation by all synaptic inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This in turn, would reduce Im-dependent GABA release onto target neurons such as the CeM16 and disinhibit CeM output to promote fear learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus endogenous opioids acting via postsynaptic MOR to reduce Im excitability, maybe a feature of MOR-mediated anxiogenic processes such as fear learning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This differential pharmacology of endogenously released opioids in the Im could have important consequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the net effect of endogenous opioid actions could change if one receptor sub-type was altered by a physiological55, pathophysiological state or pharmacological treatment56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, it raises some interesting therapeutic possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the desired therapeutic strategy is to enhance endogenous opioid action at both DOR and MOR, this could be achieved by inhibition of peptidases57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, if enhancing the activity of only one receptor is desired, a PAM, such as shown in this study, could be utilized45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The reasons why anxiety disorders manifest are not fully understood, although it is thought a disruption in the balance between opposing circuits responsible for interpretation of fearful stimuli, a process in which the amygdala is heavily involved, maybe key58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible endogenous opioid signalling is one of the essential components that maintain balance within these interpretation circuits, particularly during times of stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, individual variability in fear and anxiety may result from differential expression of enkephalin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, in a subpopulation of rats where stress strongly reduces ME expression in the amygdala, this was correlated with increased vulnerability to negative stress responses59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While opioid receptors and peptides are expressed and likely act in other subdivisions of the amygdala21,56,60, the strong regulation of Im neurons by endogenous opioids is an appealing mechanism for opioid regulation of fear and anxiety behaviours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, since endogenously released opioid regulation is engaged by moderate synaptic activity, this suggests some of their effects on anxiety maybe via regulation of continuous information flow through dynamic Im-associated neural circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to the currently perceived role in which endogenous opioids both regulate and are released by a high-intensity trigger such as a synaptic plasticity event or learning processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, endogenously released opioids may also regulate the expression of previously established plasticity/learning traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This additional role is important, as treatments for anxiety disorders are rarely able to preempt the initial learning but regulators of prior plasticity/learning could be valuable therapeutic options to reduce expression of fear and anxiety disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
