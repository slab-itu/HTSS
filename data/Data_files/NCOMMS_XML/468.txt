Directed percolation identified as equilibrium pre-transition towards non-equilibrium arrested gel states  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The macroscopic properties of gels arise from their slow dynamics and load-bearing network structure, which are exploited by nature and in numerous industrial products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a link between these structural and dynamical properties has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present confocal microscopy experiments and simulations of gel-forming colloidpolymer mixtures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They reveal that gel formation is preceded by continuous and directed percolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both transitions lead to system-spanning networks, but only directed percolation results in extremely slow dynamics, ageing and a shrinking of the gel that resembles synaeresis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, dynamical arrest in gels is found to be linked to a structural transition, namely directed percolation, which is quantitatively associated with the mean number of bonded neighbours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Directed percolation denotes a universality class of transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study hence connects gel formation to a well-developed theoretical framework, which now can be exploited to achieve a detailed understanding of arrested gels.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Amorphous solids are ubiquitous in natural and engineered materials: sand piles, window glass, ceramics, plastics, nanocomposites, gelatin and living cells are just a few examples of solid materials with an amorphous structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glassy systems are amorphous solids in which the solid-like mechanical properties are linked to a dramatic slowdown of the microscopic dynamics when decreasing the temperature or increasing the particle density1,2,3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gels also show arrested dynamics8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17, but their structure is different.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They exhibit a heterogeneous load-bearing network structure that is formed by cross-linking (chemical gels) or attraction-induced aggregation (physical gels)18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamical arrest was associated with different mechanisms, for example, arrested phase separation21, cluster aggregation21, the occurrence and spatial organization of locally favoured structures18 and the onset of rigidity percolation32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a progressive slowdown of the dynamics after sample preparation, that is, ageing, is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the relation between the slowdown and arrest of the dynamics, and the structural properties of these systems are still under debate8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Model systems of physical gels have been established, for example, dispersions of spherical colloidal particles, in which attractive forces are induced by a temperature variation or depletion effects due to the addition of linear non-adsorbing polymer chains30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, there are only few studies on the relation between the slowdown of the dynamics and the microscopic structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that the slowdown of the particle dynamics and the onset of ageing can be related to the microscopic structure of colloidal gels, namely a directed percolation (DP) transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is demonstrated in experiments on charged colloidpolymer mixtures30,33 and in Brownian dynamics simulations of particles interacting through a combination of coulombic repulsion and depletion-induced attraction modelled by the AsakuraOosawa potential34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The onset of DP is investigated along different paths in which either the attractive or the repulsive parts of the interactions are varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that in any case continuous percolation precedes DP and that both can be associated with characteristic values of the mean number of bonds per particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, DP is found to be linked to the onset of ageing effects.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'States of the system', 'In charged colloidpolymer mixtures, two particleparticle interactions compete on different length scales: First, screened electrostatic interactions, which are long ranged for low salt concentrations and become shorter ranged on addition of salt; second, depletion interactions, which are short ranged, typically at most one tenth of the colloidal particle diameter, and controlled through the radius of gyration of the polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We experimentally investigated charged colloidal polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) spheres with volume fraction 0.2 and diameter =1.72 m in the presence of non-adsorbing linear polystyrene with radius of gyration rg=65 nm, where the effective polymer-colloid size ratio eff0.03 (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In experiments and simulations, we consistently observe four states that differ in the structural arrangements of the colloidal particles (Fig 1, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Which state occurs depends on the salt concentration csalt, and therefore the screening length 1 characterizing the range of the repulsion and the polymer concentration cp, that is, attraction strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We consider fixed cp and vary csalt, which will be referred to as path B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of salt, mainly individual particles but also very few clusters are distributed homogeneously throughout the sample (sample C1; note that cp of this sample is higher than the one of the other samples, Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding salt, particles aggregate into isolated small clusters (sample B1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At large salt concentrations, larger clusters are observed which form a network in three dimensions (sample B2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a heterogeneous network structure with thick strands consisting of even larger, dense clusters are formed at the largest salt concentration studied (sample B3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: On the path towards a gel four different states are found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Two-dimensional slices of the three-dimensional systems in the following states: (C1) Fluid state with mainly individual particles and only very few small aggregates, (B1) isolated small chain-like clusters of particles, (B2) larger clusters forming a continuously percolated network in three dimensions and (B3) directed percolated network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper row shows confocal microscopy data, where the polymer concentrations are 3c* (C1) and 2c* (B1B3) with the overlap concentration c*.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The salt concentration increases from left to right (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower row represents the corresponding states as observed in the simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Corresponding pair correlation functions g(r) determined from the three-dimensional data as a function of the particle-particle distance r in units of the particle diameter , which, for the simulation data, is taken to be the effective particle diameter, that is, =eff.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Symbols represent experimental data, solid lines simulation data and (only for B1) the light blue solid line simulation data with parameters obtained by an unconstrained fit (for details see Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data have been shifted for clarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inset shows the (unshifted) first peaks.Full size image', 'These states show different pair correlation functions g(r) (Fig 1, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without salt (C1), g(r) is dominated by a peak located at the mean particle distance 1/3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a small peak at particle contact reflects the presence of a small number of aggregated particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For small amounts of added salt (B1), the increase in the contact peak and a corresponding decrease of the second peak of g(r) is consistent with the presence of doublets, triplets or small string-like clusters (visible in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The size of the clusters is limited by the repulsive contribution to the potential22,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For sample B2, the large peak at contact reflects the large fraction of particles forming clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its g(r) is reminiscent of a percolated gel-like network structure32,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the radial distribution function of sample B3 with its very high first peak at contact reflects the presence of a large number of bonded particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, its deep first minimum and pronounced split second peak can arise from triplet structures and local close packed arrangements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These features of the g(r) are observed in the experiments as well as in the simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there is qualitative agreement between experimental and simulation results, small quantitative differences indicate that the potential and its parameter values used in the simulations are not perfectly describing the interactions present in the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (The mapping of the simulation and experimental parameters is described in Supplementary Note 1.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, both, experiments and simulations, reveal different states on the path towards a gel;

Individual particleparticle bonds cannot be determined unambiguously because the first peak in g(r) is broadened due to polydispersity (about 7%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, two particles are defined to be bonded if they are closer than the position of the first minimum in g(r), which is located between 1.10 and 1.22 (Fig 1, right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mean number of bonds per particle, N, is determined as a function of the interactions, which depend on the salt concentration csalt, determining the screening length 1, and the polymer concentration cp, controlling the depletion part of the potential VD,min=VD(eff) evaluated at the overall potential minimum Vmin=V(eff) (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low polymer, cp, and/or salt, csalt, concentrations, only very few bonds are found (white to purple), whereas high cp and/or csalt result in a bonded state (red).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to previous results23, N monotonically grows without a re-entrant transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even for large screening and strong attraction, N hardly exceeds seven and hence the highly bonded state appears not to be in equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a purely repulsive interaction39,40 or in spring

screening length 1 is kept constant while the polymer concentration cp is increased and hence the value VD,min of the potential at its minimum is decreased, that is, the attraction strength is increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Note that path A implies a high salt concentration, which cannot be achieved in the organic solvent mixture used in the experiments.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, along path B, the screening length 1 is reduced at constant attraction strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On increasing attraction on path A, N increases and the distribution of the number of bonds per particle, p(N), first broadens, indicating a more heterogeneous structure, but then narrows again indicating that the probability to find monomers is reduced to zero, consistent with the observed network structure (Figs 1a,3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along path B, that is, increasing csalt (inset), the distributions also shift to larger N and broaden, again indicating the coarsening of the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with path A, the p(N) are sharper, indicating that monomers are suppressed at low salt concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, repulsions are long ranged and still substantial at the mean monomer separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system avoids this unfavourable situation by forming clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the repulsion between the clustered monomers is even larger,

as between them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, this links the formation of gels to a universality class of transitions, namely DP, and hence a well-developed theoretical framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We investigate gel formation in a system with competing attractive and repulsive interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal microscopy experiments on charged colloidpolymer mixtures are combined with Brownian dynamics simulations of particles interacting via the AsakuraOosawa and Coulomb potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the overall potential minimum Vmin, which can be varied through the attractive and/or repulsive component of the interactions, different states are identified; fluids of individual particles or clusters as well as continuous and directed percolated networks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transitions between these states are associated with changes in structural and dynamical parameters, in particular, the number of bonds per particle with significant increases in the mean, variance and most probable value of the distribution of the number of bonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The effect of continuous percolation on the dynamics is small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, DP leads to a significant slowdown of the dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is attributed to the large number of bonds and concomitant strong confinement of the particles in the attractive potentials of their neighbours, which is also reflected in significant ageing observed in directed percolated systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It suggests that equilibration is very slow in directed percolated systems, but occurs quickly in continuous percolated systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our findings suggest that the slowdown associated with gelation already sets in at the DP transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deeper in the gel region, the dynamics then becomes arrested without any additional structural transition occurring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our finding that DP precedes the formation of arrested gels, establishes a relation between structural and dynamic features of gels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While previous studies linked gelation in adhesive hard spheres to continuous percolation28,29,31, we argue that in colloidpolymer mixtures with competing attractive and repulsive interactions directed rather than continuous percolation indicates the transition to gel states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, DP is a universality class of transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus gel formation can be linked to critical behaviour and the corresponding theoretical formalism53, which can be exploited to obtain a deeper understanding of gel formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, maybe gel collapse under gravity30 is also initiated by percolation transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results hence contribute to an improved understanding of the relation between structural and dynamic features of gel-forming systems and hint at their importance for gel collapse and rheological properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Furthermore, in directed percolated systems the dense and directed networks appear to lead to a contraction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in a detachment from the walls and hence a layer that is depleted of particles appears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon resembles synaeresis and might have important implications for applications and industrial products but also, for example, gel collapse and rheological measurements, in particular concerning wall slip45,54,55,56.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
