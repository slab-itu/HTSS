Constraining climate sensitivity and continental versus seafloor weathering using an inverse geological carbon cycle model  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The relative influences of tectonics, continental weathering and seafloor weathering in controlling the geological carbon cycle are unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we develop a new carbon cycle model that explicitly captures the kinetics of seafloor weathering to investigate carbon fluxes and the evolution of atmospheric CO2 and ocean pH since 100 Myr ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compare model outputs to proxy data, and rigorously constrain model parameters using Bayesian inverse methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming our forward model is an accurate representation of the carbon cycle, to fit proxies the temperature dependence of continental weathering must be weaker than commonly assumed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that 1531 °C (1) surface warming is required to double the continental weathering flux, versus 310 °C in previous work.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, continental weatherability has increased 1.73.3 times since 100 Myr ago, demanding explanation by uplift and sea-level changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average Earth system climate sensitivity is  K (1) per CO2 doubling, which is notably higher than fast-feedback estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conclusions are robust to assumptions about outgassing, modern fluxes and seafloor weathering kinetics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Determining what controls the geological carbon cycle is crucial for understanding climate stability, planetary habitability and the long-term consequences of anthropogenic carbon emissions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On long timescales, carbon inputs into the atmosphereocean system must balance outputs otherwise atmospheric CO2 would be depleted leading to a runaway icehouse, or CO2 would accumulate and become excessively abundant within 10100 Myr ago (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a negative feedback must stabilize the carbon cycle and global climate on geological timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The carbonatesilicate weathering cycle described by Walker et al.2 is widely believed to provide a negative feedback3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this picture, climatic warming from abundant atmospheric CO2 enhances silicate weathering and delivers more carbon to the ocean where it precipitates to form carbonate rocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, climatic cooling due to low CO2 reduces silicate weathering and dampens CO2 drawdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature dependence of silicate weathering effectively provides a natural thermostat to stabilize climate2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the carbonatesilicate thermostat is now part of textbook Earth science4, the link between global climate, CO2 and silicate weathering rates is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gaillardet et al.5 found no overall correlation between weathering rates and temperature on a global scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some regional field studies also fail to find a relationship6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, strongly temperature-dependent continental weathering is argued to contradict the conventional interpretation of the Phanerozoic strontium isotope record7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weatherability changes due to uplift, lithology and biology have all been proposed as alternative drivers of the carbon cycle8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Walker12 himself changed his opinion to suspecting greater sensitivity of weathering rate to the aforementioned factors than to CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some models of the Cenozoic carbon cycle also suggest sizeable weatherability changes for reproducing observed pCO2 and carbon isotope histories13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, weatherability changes alone do not provide a clear negative feedback to balance the carbon cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative or complimentary negative feedback to continental silicate weathering is seafloor weathering7,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seafloor weathering occurs because seawater circulates through upper oceanic crust in low-temperature, off-axis hydrothermal systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reactions with basalt release calcium ions, which precipitates calcium carbonate within veins and pores of the oceanic crust18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the rate of basalt dissolution and precipitation is linkeddirectly or indirectlyto the carbon content of the atmosphereocean system, then seafloor weathering could provide an important negative feedback.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here it is useful to think in terms of carbonate alkalinity, , whichneglecting the small contribution from weak acid anions and water dissociation productsmust balance the sum of conservative cations minus conservative anions, ( ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, dissolution of basalt, which releases alkaline earth and alkali metal cations, generates carbonate alkalinity to neutralize the positive ions in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, carbon speciation adjusts in response to the addition of conservative cations to ensure charge balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Caldeira20 used simple geochemical models to show that the pH dependence of seafloor weathering is too weak to be an important carbon cycle feedback, concluding that continental weathering dominates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent studies challenge this conclusion: Mesozoic-aged oceanic crust has substantially higher carbonate content compared to Cenozoic-aged cores18, and this elevated carbonate content is due to enhanced Mesozoic carbonate precipitation and not carbonate accumulation later21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, these seafloor carbonates can only be explained by alkalinity released from basalt dissolution; alkalinity released from continental weathering is insufficient16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature-dependent seafloor weathering could explain both the observed change in seafloor carbonate abundance since the Mesozoic and the strontium isotope record17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies justify re-examining the importance of seafloor weathering in the global carbon cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous attempts to incorporate seafloor weathering into carbon cycle models have produced conflicting results, and temperature dependencies are often omitted7,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brady and Gíslason14 conducted experiments to find the pCO2 dependence and temperature dependence of seafloor weathering rates, which they summarized as:', '', 'Here  is the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 (pCO2) relative to preindustrial modern ( p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ), =0.23 is the best-fit CO2 dependence and =0.32 is the best-fit temperature dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approximation, with varying values for , has been adopted in several subsequent models, which suggest that seafloor weathering was an important negative feedback during at least some of Earths history10,15,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Subsuming the pH dependence, temperature dependence and ocean chemistry dependence of seafloor weathering into a CO2 dependence (such as equation (1)) is potentially problematic because it does not explicitly capture dissolution kinetics, and so the value for  that combines the temperature, pH and ocean chemistry weathering dependencies must be either guessed or fitted (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models such as GEOCARB and its various incarnations3,23 similarly do not incorporate seafloor weathering accurately because they lack ocean chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some models attempt to capture dissolution kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these models have highly simplified ocean chemistry24, assume a constant temperature of dissolution25 or do not reproduce the observed increase17 in seafloor basalt dissolution26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we develop a new open source model for testing competing hypotheses about the global carbon cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model explicitly calculates ocean chemistry and includes pH-dependent and temperature-dependent kinetics based on laboratory and empirical studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an improvement over previous models that subsumed pH dependence and temperature dependence into an overall indirect CO2 dependence with an arbitrary functional relationship (equation (1)), or only considered pH dependence in isolation20,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we use a new parameterization linking deep-ocean temperatures to surface temperatures, and thus seafloor weathering to climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Cenozoic (660 Myr ago) and Mesozoic (25266 Myr ago) are particularly useful eras to model because of their relatively abundant proxy records of ocean composition and geochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to validate our model, we apply it the last 100 Myr ago and compare model outputs with these proxies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also use a Bayesian inversion to constrain model parameters quantitatively, including the temperature sensitivity of continental weathering, climate sensitivity, and continental weatherability changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach makes minimal assumptions about carbon cycle processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, it is agnostic about whether Cretaceous outgassing was very high or comparable to present levels, and it allows for large changes in weatherability of both silicates and carbonates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the novel probability distributions we obtain for parameters of interest are robust to model assumptions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

was considerably lower than the modern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kump and Arthur13 inferred Cenozoic weatherability through time by forcing a carbon cycle model with crustal production, exposed land area and organic burial from proxies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They found that to fit pCO2 proxies, weatherability as defined here must increase by 0.3 over the Cenozoic, or equivalently, 1+W=0.53 by linear

weaker than linearly related to area23 and the posterior distribution for the weatherability change (Fig 6), it is unlikely that sea-level variation alone can account for the required change in weatherability over the last 100 Myr ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Weatherability can also increase with continental relief.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greater uplift may result in more physical erosion and enhanced

interpretation of the Sr isotope record has recently been challenged17,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the Cenozoic  record can be reproduced by a simple model of temperature-dependent seafloor weathering so that no changes in continental weatherability are required17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, if these nominal changes in relief are accepted, then the combined change in weatherability from sea-level variation and reduced uplift is 0.440.72, which could easily explain the weatherability change inferred from our Bayesian analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Changes in lithology, palaeogeography and biology also have an impact on weatherability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basaltic weathering contributes one-third of the global silicate weathering flux despite only constituting 10% of the global silicate area45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reconstructions of basaltic area through time vary by methodology46,47, but recent analyses suggest a basaltic area at 100 Myr ago approximately double the modern area10, seemingly implying that silicate weatherability was 30% greater than today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change has opposite sign to the change implied by our retrieval, suggesting that either the increase in relief since 100 Myr ago compensated for lithology changes, or basaltic weatherability has been overestimated48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palaeogeography changes are one of the primary controls on weathering for much of the Phanerozoic49, but for the last 100 Myr ago the effect of palaeogeography on weathering fluxes has been relatively muted (Fig 8 in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49 and Fig 4 in

contributed to the weatherability increase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, both biological innovations occurred around 100 Myr ago, suggesting that they may not be important for the relevant time span.

key finding is that average Earth system climate sensitivity since 100 Myr ago is 3.77.5 K for a doubling of pCO2 (90% credible), which is much larger than the IPCC28 range, 1.54.5 K. Our result is broadly consistent with previous estimates of Earth system climate sensitivity based on palaeoclimate data52,53, and supports the view that the long-term climate sensitivity of the Earth system is greater than the fast-feedback Charnay sensitivity captured by Global Circulation Models (GCMs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, high climate sensitivity could help explain why extremely high pCO2 (for example, 4,000 p.p.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  levels are required to reproduce observed Cretaceous equator-to-pole temperature gradients in GCMs54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A caveat is that we have neglected other greenhouse gases (GHGs), which could lead to overestimating climate sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, Earth system models suggest that other GHGs may have contributed significantly (23 K) to Cretaceous and Eocene warmth55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this increase in GHG abundances is largely a vegetation response to warmer temperatures, and GHG feedbacks such as this are already implicitly captured in our overall pCO2-dependent climate sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, the omission of methane forcings could affect our results, but the changes in methane flux would have to be substantial to reduce our inferred climate sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The warming from other GHGs is only 0.5 K from changes in boundary conditions between the Early Eocene and Late Cretaceous55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fourth, although the continental weathering flux was probably larger than the seafloor weathering flux since 100 Myr ago (Fig 5e,f), it is difficult to directly compare the importance of the two feedbacks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature dependence of continental weathering is likely weak, but both the temperature dependence of seafloor weathering and the direct pCO2 dependence of continental weathering are poorly constrained (Fig 6; Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, we cannot say whether the absolute change in continental weathering since 100 Myr ago is greater or less than the change in seafloor weathering (Fig 5i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, conclusions regarding low-temperature sensitivity of continental weathering, weatherability changes and climate sensitivity hold irrespective of assumptions about seafloor weathering; these conclusions arise primarily from the fit to temperature, pCO2, saturation state and pH proxies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With that said, the temperature dependence of continental weathering ( kJ mol1) is weak compared to seafloor weathering ( kJ mol1), and a secular decline in spreading rates over Earth history would imply more dominant seafloor weathering fluxes at earlier times since continental weathering has no direct spreading rate dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these observations suggest that seafloor weathering feedback may have been an important feedback at earlier times in Earths history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All of our conclusionsto varying degreesdepend on the fidelity of proxies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have attempted to minimize this source of error by adopting the broadest possible range of proxy estimates for pCO2, temperature, saturation state, pH and the seafloor weathering sink (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sensitivity analysis in the results section shows that the low-temperature sensitivity of continental weathering and the large weatherability increase since 100 Myr ago are robust.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if current estimates of two proxies are highly uncertain or flawed, the remaining proxies tell a mutually consistent story on continental weathering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the same is not true for climate sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If proxies overestimate global mean temperatures in the Cretaceous, then Earth system climate sensitivity may be lower than our inverse analysis suggests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same is true if real Cretaceous pCO2 was much higher than proxy estimates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To some extent, conclusions are sensitive to the mechanistic assumptions in our forward model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the simple functional forms adopted for many biogeochemical fluxes and the reduction of spatially heterogeneous processes to zeroth order, globally averaged equations could influence our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, wherever possible, we used parameterizations that have a fundamental physical basis, such as the logarithmic dependence of climate on pCO2 and the Arrhenius-style temperature dependence of weathering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In instances where the physical basis is uncertain, we adopted generalized power laws with widely varying exponents to describe relationships between variables, and introduced free parameters to account for unknown processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Column 2 of Fig 6, and Supplementary Note 6 explore the sensitivity of our results to different continental weathering parameterizations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that none of the key conclusions are changed by using different functional forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, our quantitative estimates of key variables could be refined by better mechanistic understanding carbon cycle relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the magnitude of the weatherability increase since 100 Myr ago is moderately sensitive to the choice of continental weathering function (Fig 6;

impose observed changes in Ca2+ abundances from seawater inclusions75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our model, changes in alkalinity are driven purely by weathering and carbonate precipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, by imposing Ca2+ variations, we are effectively assuming that observed Ca2+ changes are offset by changes in other cations and anions, such that they have no direct effect on alkalinity, for example, magnesium exchange with the seafloor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fit a third-order polynomial to the Ca2+ reconstruction in Tyrrell and Zeebe75 to achieve the fast computation times necessary for Bayesian inversion (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Initial conditions and numerical solution', 'Table 2 shows all the initial values assumed in our model or ranges for variables that are

best estimate was taken to be the midpoint of the full range of proxy estimates, while the 1 uncertainty in the best estimate spanned the full range (Supplementary Figs 1013).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This
