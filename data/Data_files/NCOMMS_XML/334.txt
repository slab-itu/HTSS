Hot super-Earths stripped by their host stars  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Simulations predict that hot super-Earth sized exoplanets can have their envelopes stripped by photoevaporation, which would present itself as a lack of these exoplanets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this absence in the exoplanet population has escaped a firm detection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate, using asteroseismology on a sample of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates observed during the Kepler mission that, while there is an abundance of super-Earth sized exoplanets with low incident fluxes, none are found with high incident fluxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We do not find any exoplanets with radii between 2.2 and 3.8 Earth radii with incident flux above 650 times the incident flux on Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gap in the population of exoplanets is explained by evaporation of volatile elements and thus supports the predictions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The confirmation of a hot-super-Earth desert caused by evaporation will add an important constraint on simulations of planetary systems, since they must be able to reproduce the dearth of close-in super-Earths.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Models predict that the envelopes of exoplanets orbiting close to their host stars are stripped by photoevaporation, which should be evident as an absence of very hot super-Earth sized exoplanets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1 show a deficit in the number of exoplanets with radii between 1.8 and 4 R, and that these exoplanets should become comparatively rare for fluxes exceeding 100 F due to photoevaporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the simulations reveal a corresponding increase in the number of rocky planets with R less_than 1.8 R caused by the presence of the stripped cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of a paucity in the radius distribution of close-in exoplanets caused by evaporation is also supported by other theoretical works2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies have detected a deficit of exoplanets in the radius-period (or semi major axis) diagram4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This so-called sub-Jovian pampas or sub-Jovian desert extends from 3 to 10 R for periods shorter than 2.5 days5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the absence in the distribution of exoplanets caused by evaporation has escaped a secure confirmation2,3,4,5,6,7,8 primarily due to uncertain host star parameters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can now be changed with asteroseismology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asteroseismology studies the stellar pulsations, and it allows us to determine the properties of many exoplanet host stars to high accuracy9,10,11,12, which in turn markedly improves the planetary properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NASAs Kepler mission has provided high-quality data for thousands of potential exoplanets and their host stars7,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we exploit these data, using asteroseismology, to make a robust detection of the hot-super-Earth desert, a region in the radius-flux diagram completely void of exoplanets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the hot-super-Earth desert is statistically significant and not caused by selection effects or false positives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detection of the existence of a hot-super-Earth desert confirms that photoevaporation does play a role in shaping the exoplanet population that we see today.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This imposes an important constraint on simulations of the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems since this effect needs to be taken into account.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Therefore, we investigated the radius-range of the hot-super-Earth desert further to determine whether it could be an extension of the sub-Jovian pampas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Of the exoplanets in the seismic subsample above our flux boundary of 650 F, four exoplanets are present above 10 R. These are all confirmed exoplanets (Kepler-1b, 2b, 7b and 14b), and thus agree with the upper limit set by the previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the radius-range between 4 and 10 R, another four exoplanets are present in our seismic sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, two are confirmed exoplanets (Kepler-4b and 56b) and a third (KOI-5.01) is a candidate in a multi-planet system (where the FP-rate is lower23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most important to the location of the upper boundary of the hot-super-Earth desert is Kepler-4b, which is located at R=4.2 R and F=1243 F (see Fig 2), and thus effectively sets the upper boundary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kepler-4b has a density of around 1.9 g cm3 (similar to the density of Neptune), and is consequently volatile rich25, which agrees with its location above the desert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, Kepler-56b also has a density estimate consistent with a volatile-rich composition26, thus also agreeing with its location above the desert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have examined the transits of Kepler-4b for evidence that it could be evaporating, but we failed to find any asymmetry in the transits or any transit-to-transit depth variations, which could both indicate atmospheric loss27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, it cannot be ruled out that evaporation of Kepler-4b could be ongoing at a level, which we cannot detect and possibly at a level that does not influence the radius evolution of the planet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To assess the significance of an extended gap scenario, we tested two additional sets of boundaries, allowing for the presence of exoplanets from the seismic sample within the gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first scenario had the same flux boundary as the hot-super-Earth desert (650 F), but spanned the radius-range from 2.2 to 10 R in agreement with the upper limit stated for the sub-Jovian pampas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This meant that four seismic exoplanets were present in the tested region (Kepler-4b, Kepler-56b, KOI-5.01 and KOI-1314.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since the sub-Jovian pampas was defined in orbital period rather than incident flux, we cannot replicate the exact limit in the radius-flux diagram found by for instance ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we also considered the possibility that we should move the boundary to higher incident flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we tested a region with the aforementioned limits in radius, but bounded by an incident flux of 1,000 F instead of 650 F, which only leaves Kepler-4b in the region of the gap (even though a flux limit this high does not seem to agree with the sharp cutoff in the seismic sample in the 2.23.8 R region).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that both of the tested scenarios are less significant than the hot-super-Earth desert, with the 650 F radius-extended scenario being by far the least significant one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It can be noted in connection to the sub-Jovian pampas that some exoplanets seem to occupy that gap6,29, and that they do not all appear to be FPs29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reference 2929 investigates three planet candidates located in the sub-Jovian pampas, and they find that two of the three are likely true planets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these two planets fall comfortably within the sub-Jovian pampas, one of them is too large to fall in the hot-super-Earth desert, and the other one has uncertainties large enough that it could as well be outside the hot-super-Earth desert (it sits  less_than 1 from the upper radius-limit29).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'For exoplanets in the radius range in question, radius is thought to be a good proxy for composition21,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows for the transition from a predominantly rocky to a volatile-rich make-up to be expressed in terms of radius, and this transition has been found to occur around 1.61.8 R by different studies21,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the majority of exoplanets in the 2.23.8 R range are expected to be volatile rich, though some of them could be water worlds21 (for comparison, the radius of Neptune is 3.8 R).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This agrees with the theory that these exoplanets could be stripped of their envelopes when they are too close to their host star.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we can infer from our hot-super-Earth desert that hot exoplanets below 2.2 R most likely have a predominantly rocky composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dynamical interactions may in principle also be responsible for shaping the gap in the radius-flux diagram, for example, due to orbital decay or inward migration of planets at late evolutionary stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it seems unlikely that orbital decay played a major part in clearing out the particular part of parameter space associated with the hot-super-Earth desert since the planets would either need to be more massive or on shorter orbits32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other migration channels such as a combination of planet-planet scattering, tidal circularisation and the Kozai mechanism could have played a role in shaping the location of the hot-super-Earth desert through migration of exoplanets that were initially part of a triple (or larger) system33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These effects have not been considered in our work, but they could be responsible for later migration of some of the planets that sit above the hot-super-Earth desert (and inside the sub-Jovian pampas, such as Kepler-4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the flux boundary is likely a function of the planet mass with heavier planets being able to better withstand the evaporation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, while we find that the hot-super-Earth desert is more significant than the other regions we tested, we are not in a position to unambiguously decide whether the hot-super-Earth desert is an extension of the sub-Jovian pampas or a separate feature in the radius-flux diagram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have established the existence of a hot-super-Earth desert in the radius-flux diagram.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its presence confirms that photoevaporation plays an important role in planetary evolution, with the mass-loss history depending on the incident stellar flux.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents a mechanism not seen in our own solar system, by which some volatile-rich exoplanets are stripped of their atmospheres by their host stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, our detection of a hot-super-Earth desert will add an important constraint for simulations of the evolution of planetary systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

quarters of 3 months duration due to the roll of the spacecraft) was cleaned for bad data points using sigma-clipping (with 4) of a high-pass filtered time series (high-pass filter was 7 min) to take

sample).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that none of these exoplanets were situated in the hot-super-Earth desert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of limiting our sample by using the uncertainty in radius, we also tried using the impact parameter (with the criterion b less_than 1), which would remove some of the grazing transits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This removed the two exoplanets mentioned above from the asteroseismic subsample, but we opted for the stricter 20% limit on the radius uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also tried to vet the subsample by using asterodensity profiling16,48,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the ratio of stellar mean densities derived from the orbit and, in our case, grid-modelling () is considered, and a value very different from unity points to either very eccentric orbits or a blend scenario (these are the two largest effects).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it was difficult to put meaningful constraints on the density ratio since a conservative value did not eliminate any candidates and a more aggressive value would risk throwing away high-eccentricity exoplanets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we did not pursue this further.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If the cut in radius uncertainty is made at a higher value than 20%, then exoplanets from the non-seismic sample will appear in the desert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have examined the points that appear if the cut is instead made at 30 or 40%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the information from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (from 1 July 2015), when we make the cut at 20% one exoplanet from the non-seismic sample is present in the top of the desert (with its 1 errorbars easily placing it outside the desert).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If we increase this value to 30%, then two additional planets enter the hot-super-Earth desert, one very close to the lower flux boundary, and one which, since we downloaded the data, has been flagged as a FP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If the cut is instead made at 40%, then a total of 13 exoplanets occupy the region of the hot-super-Earth desert including those discussed above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these 13 planets, two are FPs and one is the confirmed exoplanet Kepler-319b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, on checking the radius and flux for Kepler-319b listed in the discovery paper51, it is clear that this planet is in fact situated far from the desert (with R=1.63 R and F=261.6 F (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51)), which brings us down to 10 exoplanets in the desert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have manually inspected these 10 remaining exoplanets situated in the hot-super-Earth desert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They all orbit stars of spectral type F or G, and we find that the reason for the very uncertain exoplanet parameters is very uncertain parameters for the host stars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that all of them have uncertainties consistent with a location outside the desert, and that two of them are likely FPs judged on inconsistency between the stellar density derived from the transit and that derived from the stellar mass and radius (these planets are on short orbits and are thus unlikely to have large eccentricities).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that excluding data points with high uncertainties does not exclude a specific stellar spectral type, for instance, it simply limits the number of bad data points in the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have plotted histograms of the relative uncertainties on the radius and incident flux, which can be seen in Fig 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that there is a clear bimodal distribution in both histograms, and that the uncertainties for the seismic subsample are lower than the typical uncertainties in the non-seismic sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This emphasizes our point that the properties of the seismic sample are determined to a high accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bimodal distributions in relative uncertainty in flux and radius show that the non-seismic sample is divided into a low uncertainty and a high uncertainty population, and the division between the two populations lie at 30% in radius.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, making a cut at 20% should ensure that we are only plotting the best data points from the non-seismic sample, and we have verified that we are not cutting away a population of planets around M-dwarfs (which would have high uncertainties in radius) by doing so.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Determining the boundaries of the hot-super-Earth desert', 'We constrained the size of the hot-super-Earth desert by doing a bootstrap with 1 million iterations of the exoplanets present in the seismic subsample and using the boundaries that make 95.45% (2) of the iterations return an empty desert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To be specific, we first randomly drew 157 exoplanets with replacement from the seismic subsample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we assigned each of these a radius and a flux randomly selected from Gaussians centred on the parameters for the drawn exoplanet with a standard deviation equal to the uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we determined how many of these exoplanets that were situated in the hot-super-Earth desert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was repeated 1 million times, after which we calculated the percentage of iterations without planets in the hot-super-Earth desert (which is the observed number).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used this information to change the boundaries of the desert, and we repeated the above procedure until we had obtained the 2 limits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure does not yield unique boundaries, although they are well constrained due to the small uncertainties on the exoplanets in the sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to determine the exact extent of the hot-super-Earth desert is beyond the scope of this work, and it will in addition depend on whether or not one will allow any exoplanets in the desert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Gaussian mixture model', 'We have used a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which is a probabilistic model that is the sum of a finite number of Gaussian distributions (we used the Python Scikit-Learn Gaussian Mixture Model52).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the GMM to describe the planet population in loglog radius-flux space and then applied tests to the model to assess the probability that we had detected the hot-super-Earth desert.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of planets in flux and radius is expected to form a correlated log-normal distribution as an outcome of a stochastic planet formation process that produced many correlated, fractional changes in planet sizes and orbits18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is justified to use the GMM, which fits a sum of bivariate Gaussians to the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The two different hypotheses that we tested using the GMM and the data are the null hypothesis and the irradiated hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The null hypothesis states that the radius-flux distribution is smooth, thus that there is no hot-super-Earth desert present in the data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The irradiated hypothesis states that there is a gap in the population density and that there is an overdensity at radii lower than the gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We leave the number of summed normal distributions as a parameter to be determined by the data in order to allow for different formation processes, selection effects and other biases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of Gaussian components is determined by selecting the model with the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We apply the fit to three different samples; the seismic subsample of exoplanets, the non-seismic subsample and the combined sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each sample we use the minimum BIC to determine the number of components used in the GMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the seismic subsample, the typical number of components selected by the BIC is one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The fit applied by the GMM does not treat statistical uncertainties on the data points.

uncertainties and for each draw we fit the GMM, and each time we determine the number of components by selecting the lowest BIC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From each of these 1,000 models, we draw 5,000 populations and record the number of planets that occupy the gap for each.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This then provides the probability distribution of planets in the gap under the null hypothesis, since we fit our model to the data under this assumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6 shows examples of the real data together with simulated samples drawn from the fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We artificially injected a
