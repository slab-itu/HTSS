A tipping point in refreezing accelerates mass loss of Greenlands glaciers and ice caps  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Melting of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and its peripheral glaciers and ice caps (GICs) contributes about 43% to contemporary sea level rise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While patterns of GrIS mass loss are well studied, the spatial and temporal evolution of GICs mass loss and the acting processes have remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a novel, 1 km surface mass balance product, evaluated against in situ and remote sensing data, to identify 1997 (±5 years) as a tipping point for GICs mass balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That year marks the onset of a rapid deterioration in the capacity of the GICs firn to refreeze meltwater.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, GICs runoff increases 65% faster than meltwater production, tripling the post-1997 mass loss to 36±16 Gt1, or 14% of the Greenland total.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In sharp contrast, the extensive inland firn of the GrIS retains most of its refreezing capacity for now, buffering 22% of the increased meltwater production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This underlines the very different response of the GICs and GrIS to atmospheric warming.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Covering a total area of 90,000 km2, Greenlands peripheral glaciers and ice caps (GICs) represent 12% of the worlds glacierized area outside of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Greenlands GICs account for 14 to 20% of total current Greenland glacial mass loss2, although they only represent 5% of the area and 0.5% (39 mm SLE) of the volume of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a scenario of continued global warming, Greenlands GICs may lose 1928% (7.511 mm) of their volume by 2100 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite multiple in situ observational campaigns since the early 1950s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4), glacier modelling5 and satellite-based2,6 estimates, large uncertainties remain in the spatial and temporal distribution of Greenlands GICs mass loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fill these gaps, regional climate models (RCMs) are often used7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15, but their horizontal resolution (typically 520 km) fails to resolve the steep surface mass balance (SMB) gradients in the topographically complex regions in which GICs are often situated16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this issue, we created a 1 km data set, statistically downscaled from output of the regional atmospheric climate model RACMO2.3 using regressions of SMB components against elevation estimated at the model resolution of 11 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These regressions are then applied to a downsampled 1 km version of the topography and ice mask of the Greenland Ice Mapping Project (GIMP) Digital Elevation Model (DEM)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The downscaling procedure also includes a bare ice albedo correction based on a 1 km MODIS albedo product to avoid underestimation of melt and runoff, especially on dark, low-lying glacier tongues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Earlier, the downscaling method was successfully applied to the GrIS16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use the novel SMB product at 1 km resolution to quantify Greenlands GICs mass loss, assuming changes in solid ice discharge to be negligible18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data set includes individual SMB components (precipitation, sublimation, melt, refreezing and runoff) for all GICs on a daily time scale (19582015), which is crucial for evaluation using irregular (in time and space) observations and to understand the drivers of mass loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this product, we identify 1997 (±5 years) as a tipping point for the mass balance of Greenlands GICs, which marks the onset of a rapid deterioration of inland firn capacity to refreeze meltwater, causing long-term mass loss.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Prior to 1997, Greenlands GICs average SMB was marginally negative (11.3±15.7 Gt yr1; see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 for numbers in mm w.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  yr1), with an insignificant trend of 0.01±0.22 Gt yr2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note how, even in this earlier period, melt (95 Gt yr1) persistently and significantly exceeded precipitation (58 Gt yr1), stressing the importance of the refreezing process for maintaining the mass balance of these Arctic GICs close to zero (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The situation is very different for the GrIS, where pre-1997 precipitation (746 Gt yr1) exceeded melt (556 Gt yr1) by a wide margin (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coincidentally, before 1997 the GICs and the GrIS had a similar refreezing fraction (RF/ME) of 38% and 43%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Between 1997 and 2015, the integrated GICs SMB decreased at a rate of 1.1±0.6 Gt yr2, signifying mass loss acceleration, resulting in an average SMB over this period of 36.2±15.7 Gt yr1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous estimates for different periods2,5,6 (Supplementary Table 3) confirm this recent increase of GICs mass loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with the new SMB product we are now able to identify the physical processes responsible for the post-1997 mass loss acceleration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a unambiguously shows that the trend in SMB is almost exclusively driven by increased runoff (1.1±0.6 Gt yr2), while precipitation remains constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar pattern emerges for the GrIS; here, a negative trend in precipitation (3.5±2.6 Gt yr2) somewhat reinforces the decrease in SMB (10.4±4.0 Gt yr2), but again the latter is dominated by the increase in runoff (6.9±3.7 Gt yr2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But Fig 3 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 also reveal a striking difference in the responses of the GrIS and Greenlands GICs to atmospheric warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the GrIS (Fig 3b and Supplementary Table 2), an important fraction (22%) of the excess meltwater produced since 1997 has been retained in the extensive interior firn layer, driven by an increase in refreezing (RF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, refreezing decreased on Greenlands GICs (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, runoff outpaces excess meltwater production by 65% since 1997.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It thus appears that the mass balance of Greenlands GICs crossed a tipping point in 1997 (Fig 3c), implying eventual long-term loss of the firn layers refreezing capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4 confirms these findings by comparing vertical profiles of surface mass fluxes integrated over GICs and GrIS elevation bins, scaled by the maximum height per region (hmax), prior to and after 1997.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4a,b shows that the equilibrium line (SMB=0) of the GICs moved significantly upward, that is, from 0.61 to 0.71 of hmax, and is now situated well above the peak in the hypsometry (0.62, Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In combination with decades of increased melt, which depleted firn pore space, the GICs firn layer is no longer capable of buffering the excess meltwater production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, runoff increases at the same rate as melt and fully governs the GICs mass loss (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4a,b also shows that rainfall (RA) is a small (6%) fraction of the liquid water flux available at the firn layer top, which is dominated by melt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the GrIS the equilibrium line has moved upwards from 0.33 to 0.40 of hmax (Fig 4e,f), but remains well below the maximum in the GrIS hypsometry (0.73, Fig 4h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a significant part of the excess melt is buffered by refreezing (Fig 4g) and runoff remains constant above 0.61 of hmax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although formation of ice lenses may reduce the retention efficiency in the lower accumulation zone23,24, we conclude that the extensive and elevated inland firn area of the GrIS (Fig 4h) maintains its refreezing capacity for now.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the acceleration of GrIS surface mass loss is less than half that of the GICs (6.1±2.4 mm w.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  yr2 versus 13.5±7.4 mm w.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  yr2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Shrinking of the accumulation zones.Vertical profiles of surface mass fluxes integrated over GICs (upper row) and GrIS (lower row) elevation bins, scaled by the maximum height per region (hmax), for the period 19581996 (a,e), 19972015 (b,f) and the difference between the two periods (19972015 minus 19581996, c,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMB components are spatially integrated within normalized elevation bins (h/hmax) of magnitude 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the GICs, SMB components are first integrated in elevation bins over twelve individual regions, each with different hmax (boxes in Supplementary Fig 5);

Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the mechanisms involved, Fig 5a zooms in on the region of Hans Tausen ice cap in north Greenland (region 5 in Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hans Tausen region shows a small steady mass loss (2.6±1.4 Gt yr1) before 1997 and a tripling in mass loss (7.6±1.4 Gt yr1) afterwards (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5b shows that the change in runoff (19972015 minus 19581996) is largest in the narrow ablation zone along the margins (300500 mm w.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  yr1), but with a significant contribution from the interior (100 mm w.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  yr1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that all but the very highest parts of the GICs accumulation zones now regularly experience runoff, that is, the firn layer is no longer capable of refreezing all meltwater that is produced in summer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5c confirms that the upper firn area of northern Greenland GICs has experienced the largest negative changes, up to 50%, in the refrozen meltwater fraction (RF/ME).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 5d relates these changes, as well as changes in rainfall, to annual mean (downscaled) 2-m air temperature anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strong correlation proves that the recent warming has reduced the refreezing capacity of the firn layer in these high northern GICs: in warm years, enhanced dry snow densification and surface melt quickly saturate the pore space of the firn layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the fraction of rainfall doubles from 5 to 10% in warm compared to cold years, further limiting the formation of firn.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting reduced refreezing capacity means that continuous warming in the future is likely to further accelerate Greenlands GICs mass loss and rapidly erode these highly sensitive northern ice masses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Mass loss amplification in the Hans Tausen region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Annual mean SMB patterns over the Hans Tausen region for 19582015 (black box 5 in Fig 1), (b) difference in annual runoff between 19972015 and 19581996, (c) difference in the annual mean refreezing-to-melt ratio between 19972015 and 19581996 and (d) annual runoff (red), snowfall-to-precipitation ratio (dark blue) and refreezing-to-melt ratio (light blue) as a function of the anomaly in annual mean 2-m temperature.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Regional climate model', 'Output of the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO2.3) is used as input for the downscaling procedure14,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RACMO2.3 combines the atmospheric dynamics from the High-Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM) and the physics from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecast System (ECMWF-IFS)27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polar version of RACMO2.3 is developed by the Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research Utrecht University (IMAU), to simulate the evolution of SMB over ice sheets and surrounding smaller glacierized regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polar RACMO2.3 incorporates a multi-layer snow module to simulate firn compaction, meltwater retention and percolation, refreezing and runoff9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In RACMO2.3, the excess energy available at the surface, resulting from closure of the surface energy budget, is used to melt snow and ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liquid water from melt and rain percolates through the firn column, and is either held as irreducible water or refreezes, progressively reducing pore space from bottom to top layers until the entire firn column turns into ice (900 kg m3) and no additional water can be stored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this point, any additional water is assumed to run off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model also includes a snow albedo scheme using prognostic snow grain size28;
