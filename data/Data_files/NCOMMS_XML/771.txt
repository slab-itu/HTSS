Pushing the limits of CMOS optical parametric amplifiers with USRN:Si7N3 above the two-photon absorption edge  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'CMOS platforms operating at the telecommunications wavelength either reside within the highly dissipative two-photon regime in silicon-based optical devices, or possess small nonlinearities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bandgap engineering of non-stoichiometric silicon nitride using state-of-the-art fabrication techniques has led to our development of USRN (ultra-silicon-rich nitride) in the form of Si7N3, that possesses a high Kerr nonlinearity (2.8 × 1013 cm2 W1), an order of magnitude larger than that in stoichiometric silicon nitride.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we experimentally demonstrate high-gain optical parametric amplification using USRN, which is compositionally tailored such that the 1,550 nm wavelength resides above the two-photon absorption edge, while still possessing large nonlinearities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical parametric gain of 42.5 dB, as well as cascaded four-wave mixing with gain down to the third idler is observed and attributed to the high photon efficiency achieved through operating above the two-photon absorption edge, representing one of the largest optical parametric gains to date on a CMOS platform.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the fields of attosecond nonlinear optics1, ultrafast laser spectroscopy2 and precision manufacturing3, intense optical fields are required to approach the regimes of light necessary for the observation of both linear and nonlinear phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When high powers are not directly available from electrically pumped lasers, amplification of light through rare-earth media4,5, semiconductor-based optical amplifiers6 and Raman amplifiers7,8,9 are adopted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the three aforementioned methods of amplification, rare-earth doped amplifiers are the most prolific at the telecommunications wavelength, where high gain may be achieved via down-conversion of light at the 980 to the 1,550 nm region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of complementary metaloxidesemiconductor (CMOS)-based photonics systems, rare-earth doped amplifiers have not proliferated to the extent that they have in fibre-based technologies, possibly due to the difficulty in doping CMOS materials with erbium while maintaining sufficiently low losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raman amplifiers, which leverage phononphoton interactions to amplify light at a wavelength, which is up- or down-shifted from a wavelength corresponding to the Raman shift in the medium, have seen considerable success in waveguide platforms, particularly in silicon-based Raman amplifiers8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the narrowband Raman gain spectrum within crystalline materials such as silicon precludes the amplification of optical fields possessing wide spectral bandwidths such as ultrafast pulses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, since the gain in Raman-based amplifiers obeys a power law with respect to the pump power, significant pump powers are required for high gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similar to Raman amplifiers, optical parametric amplifiers also rely on the inherent nonlinearity of the host medium to achieve optical amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While Raman amplifiers rely on a large Raman coefficient for gain, optical parametric amplifiers utilize the Kerr nonlinearity inherent in the host medium10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to rare-earth doped and Raman amplifiers, where the gain wavelength is fixed with respect to the pump wavelength, optical parametric amplification allows for an additional design degree of freedom, where light at carefully designed wavelengths may be engineered to undergo amplification via the transfer of photons from the pump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this process, conservation of momentum is satisfied via phase matching techniques, which have advanced significantly to now cover approaches such as tailoring of waveguide geometries11,12,13,14,15,16, quasi-phase-matched structures17,18, metamaterials19 and first-principles materials synthesis20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the ability for optical parametric amplifiers to amplify light at a large range of wavelengths with respect to the pump, the amplified signals scale quadratically with the pump power, enabling extremely large amplification factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical parametric amplification with high gain is therefore highly sought after, as it is one of the most efficient methods for amplifying light and achieving high-powered optical fields; apart from the aforementioned applications in attosecond nonlinear optics, ultrafast laser spectroscopy and precision manufacturing, within the burgeoning field of CMOS photonics, devices capable of high conversion efficiencies or parametric amplification are likely to find their place as compact, multi-wavelength sources necessary to significantly reduce the high per unit costs of lasers used to power wavelength division multiplexing-based transceivers, or provide compensatory amplification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fundamental to optical parametric amplification within centrosymmetric materials is its inherent Kerr nonlinearity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large optical nonlinearities and negligible nonlinear losses are ideal for such processes, as they enable the parametric process to occur efficiently using low power21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the Kerr nonlinearity of the material, absorptive mechanisms that compete with the amplification process need to be kept to a minimum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The body of work surrounding CMOS nonlinear optics suggests strongly that operating outside of the two-photon absorption regime is necessary to maintain high photon efficiencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While two-photon processes are desirable for a variety of applications such as microscopy22,23, pulse characterization24 and nanofabrication25, this absorptive mechanism needs to be mitigated in Kerr-based nonlinear processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three-photon absorption cross-section is typically much smaller than the two-photon absorption cross-section26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, nonlinear losses can be well reduced by operating in the three-photon rather than two-photon regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To date, demonstrations of CMOS-based optical parametric amplifiers at the telecommunications wavelength have been limited to platforms possessing non-negligible two-photon and free-carrier losses27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, maintaining a high photon efficiency while simultaneously possessing the large parametric gain required for most practical applications such as integrated light sources for transceivers or active optical cables continues to be an important element in CMOS-based optoelectronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Having identified the limitations in existing CMOS platforms, and the requirements for achieving high parametric gain with high photon efficiencies, we recently developed a proprietary nonlinear material especially for this purpose, where guided by design rules from KramersKronig relations30 and Millers rule31, we have succeeded in creating ultra-silicon-rich nitride (USRN), which has a material composition of Si7N3 (more details in Supplementary Note 1), possessing one of the largest optical nonlinearities of any CMOS material to date, in which two-photon absorption is still absentideal qualities for realizing high gain optical parametric amplifiers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this paper, we demonstrate 42.5 dB optical parametric gain using a CMOS waveguide designed to achieve phase matching across a broad bandwidth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This gain represents one of the highest gains at the telecommunications wavelength to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High photon efficiencies are demonstrated as a result of the platform composition, tailored to have a wide enough bandgap to eliminate two-photon absorption, including that from Urbach tails, while maintaining a large linear and nonlinear refractive index to achieve optimum gain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High gain is achieved owing to the large Kerr nonlinearity, high field localization within the designed device and negligible nonlinear losses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Design rules for the highly nonlinear Si7N3 platform', 'KramersKronig relations describe the causal relationship between the real and imaginary parts of a materials dielectric constant30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two important insights offered by the KramersKronig relations is the peaking of a materials refractive index close to its bandgap wavelength, and the reduction in nonlinear absorption as the bandgap is increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photonelectron dynamics are strongly dependent on a materials bandgap, and offer further insight into the derivative refractive index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photons incident on a medium at a frequency larger than its bandgap are optically absorbed, and cause electrons to cross into the conduction band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Materials with larger bandgaps, namely insulators, have electrons that are tightly bound to the atom, and any incident photon below the bandgap energy does not interact strongly with the electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the impact of photonelectron interactions on the mediums refractive index is minimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the bandgap decreases to that, say, of a semiconductor, electrons are now less tightly bound to the atom and experience moderate interaction with an incident photon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction effectively retards the movement of the photon through the medium thus leading to a larger refractive index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, interactions between incident photons and electrons within the material govern the inverse relationship between material bandgap and linear refractive index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the impact of photonelectron interactions on the linear refractive index, the nonlinear polarizability of a material also increases with a decreasing bandgap, a phenomenon that is also empirically described by Millers rule31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it appears that there is an optimum material property with a tailored composition between silicon nitride and amorphous silicon, where the bandgap is sufficiently large to position the 1,550 nm wavelength in the significantly less dissipative multi-photon regime without two-photon absorption effects from Urbach tails, while maintaining a large nonlinearity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CMOS-based platforms in particular are especially important for their large-scale manufacturability and ease of integration with CMOS electronics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A continuum of silicon-based CMOS materials from silicon dioxide (n1.46) to amorphous silicon (n as high as 4.0) are actively being studied as nonlinear optical platforms, each possessing different pros and cons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In amorphous silicon devices where bandgaps as large as 1.7 eV have been demonstrated for nonlinear optics devices, two-photon absorption has been reported to exist from residual Urbach tails32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing the bandgap further could similarly yield nonlinear devices with better nonlinear figures of merit35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 1, we summarize a few CMOS-based amorphous oxide- and nitride-based silicon materials plotted with refractive index and bandgap against the nonlinear refractive index, which follows a log-linear scaling rule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with KramersKronig and Millers rule, as we move up the refractive index scale, bandgap energy decreases and the nonlinear refractive index increases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Guided by these design rules, our current endeavour establishes a new paradigm in nonlinear CMOS optics research, where we have succeeded in synthesizing USRN:Si7N3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The term USRN is adopted to distinguish this material from other silicon-rich nitride films, which are characterized by a lower linear (typically 2.2 versus 3.1 in USRN) and nonlinear refractive index, and considerably less silicon-rich than our films36,37,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our USRN films possesses one of the largest optical nonlinearities of any CMOS material to date, and in which two-photon absorption is still absent, ideal qualities for realizing high-gain optical parametric amplifiers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: List of CMOS amorphous solids on a refractive index

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Over the last few years, CMOS platforms with ultra-low linear losses and negligible nonlinear losses at 1.55 m such as Hydex glass and silicon nitride have made great progress in nonlinear optics applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the scope of nonlinear waveguide devices, the figure of merit,  × Leff, max, where Leff, max=1/ is the maximum effective length achievable in a waveguide with a loss coefficient of , and  is the nonlinear parameter, provides a metric for comparison between nonlinear waveguides, where the acquired nonlinear phase scales linearly with the incident peak power (negligible nonlinear losses).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The figures of merit  × Leff, max for Hydex glass52 (loss=0.06 dB cm1 and 0.22 W1 m1), and ultra-low-loss silicon nitride in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  53 (loss=0.06 dB cm1 and 0.29 W1 m1) and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54 (loss=0.5 dB cm1 and 1 W1 m1) are calculated to be 0.16, 0.21 and 0.087 W1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the USRN waveguides used in this work to achieve 42.5 dB of optical parametric gain (loss=4.5 dB cm1 and 500 W1 m1),  × Leff, max=4.8 W1, which suggests that nonlinear waveguide devices implemented on this platform, are able to achieve close to 30 times more nonlinear phase than ultra-low-loss platforms at the same peak power level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The performance comparison becomes more complicated when considering the use of resonator enhancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because resonators typically possess a very narrow resonance bandwidth, they are best suited to applications that do not require the manipulation of broadband signals, such as low-power nonlinear switching of continuous-wave signals or optical frequency combs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resonators with high-quality factors increase the effective optical path length while maintaining a small device footprint, generate a power enhancement within the resonator, and offer the greatest advantages when utilized on platforms with negligible nonlinear losses such as Hydex glass and silicon nitride.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Silicon-based resonators, for example, have been limited to conversion efficiencies of 39 dB (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51) as a result of nonlinear losses, and this has precluded the realization of on-chip silicon-based optical parametric oscillators at 1.55 m. Hydex glass and silicon nitride have shown excellent performance: experimental reports of continuous-wave four-wave mixing in Hydex waveguides, using high-Q resonators, utilized 5 mW of pump power to realize 46 dB of conversion efficiency55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Resonators with large quality factors of 1.2 × 106 and 5 × 105, with pump powers of 101 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52) and 50 mW (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  54), respectively, have further been used to achieve optical parametric oscillation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the twofold effect of resonator power enhancement and augmented effective optical path length, nonlinear phase from a resonator scales with the square of the finesse, F ( versus ) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An estimation of F2 for the devices used in refs 52, 54 show that Hydex glass and silicon nitride possess a large F2106, enabling resonator enhancements to the nonlinear phase acquisition by this factor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of their ultra-low losses, both Hydex glass and silicon nitride resonators offer significant enhancements in nonlinear phase acquisition, two orders of magnitude greater than that in our USRN platform (F2104)41, and have been successfully configured as nonlinear resonator-enhanced devices for high-performance frequency combs57,58,59,60,61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further reductions in propagation losses could enable resonators on the USRN platform to approach these levels of resonator enhancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was previously postulated that material losses in nitride-based CMOS materials deposited at low temperatures possessed high material losses at 1.55 m because of absorption from NH and SiH bonds at that wavelength13,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further evaluate the material losses of our USRN films, ellipsometric measurements with an accuracy of 106 in the measured k value were performed (Supplementary Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The k value measured at the 1.55 m region is below the minimum measurable k value, which implies that the USRN material loss is lower than 0.35 dB cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to other high confinement waveguides such as silicon on insulator waveguides, fabrication-induced sidewall scattering plays a role in waveguide losses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments to quantify the losses of the waveguides reveal an inverse relationship between the linear waveguide loss and the waveguide width.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In waveguides where the width was increased to 700 nm, losses as low as 1.9 dB cm1 were measured (Supplementary Fig 1e), which suggest that further optimizations in fabrication processes could yield even lower losses, to approach the levels of resonator enhancement available in ultra-low loss platforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have experimentally demonstrated 42.5 dB optical parametric gain at the telecommunications wavelength using USRN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This represents the largest optical parametric gain at this wavelength to date on a CMOS platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cascaded four-wave mixing with gain is observed up to the third idler, and low power, continuous-wave four-wave mixing on the USRN waveguides are also demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broadband conversion from 1,620 to 1,460 nm is facilitated by the ability to achieve substantial conversion efficiencies using short waveguides while keeping within the coherence length, with peak conversion efficiencies of 24.9 dB using 13.7 dBm of pump power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By engineering the films to reside outside the two-photon regime and well within the multi-photon regime, the USRN waveguides possess the ideal combination of a large nonlinearity and nonlinear losses below the detection limit at the 1,550 nm wavelength, while being compatible with back-end CMOS processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future developments on this platform could yield applications in high-performance nonlinear optical pulse compressors and low power, ultra-broadband light sources.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
