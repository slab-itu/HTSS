Sea level fall during glaciation stabilized atmospheric CO2 by enhanced volcanic degassing  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Paleo-climate records and geodynamic modelling indicate the existence of complex interactions between glacial sea level changes, volcanic degassing and atmospheric CO2, which may have modulated the climate systems descent into the last ice age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 85 and 70 kyr ago, during an interval of decreasing axial tilt, the orbital component in global temperature records gradually declined, while atmospheric CO2, instead of continuing its long-term correlation with Antarctic temperature, remained relatively stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, based on novel global geodynamic models and the joint interpretation of paleo-proxy data as well as biogeochemical simulations, we show that a sea level fall in this interval caused enhanced pressure-release melting in the uppermost mantle, which may have induced a surge in magma and CO2 fluxes from mid-ocean ridges and oceanic hotspot volcanoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results reveal a hitherto unrecognized negative feedback between glaciation and atmospheric CO2 predominantly controlled by marine volcanism on multi-millennial timescales of 5,00015,000 years.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Earths geosphere and climate have recently been shown to closely interact on orbital time scales rather than being independent sub-systems1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the end of the last ice age, a positive feedback may have existed between deglaciation, terrestrial volcanism and atmospheric CO2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, crustal production at mid-ocean ridges (MOR) is now thought to be sensitive to glacial sea level changes1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by changes in hydrothermal iron flux variability that indicate a relatively swift increase in hydrothermal activity to the most pronounced sea level fall during the last 50 kyr on a suborbital timescale6, possibly within a few thousand years7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such interactions may also have played a role for the different trends in temperature and atmospheric CO2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9) during a phase of pronounced ice sheet growth and associated sea level fall across the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5/4 boundary (Fig 1) as corroborated by records of enhanced hydrothermal activity across MIS4 in sediment cores at 38°N on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge10, the Galapagos Microplate11 and the East Pacific Rise6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 8570 kyr ago Antarctic and Greenland temperatures display a gradual decline (Fig 1c), superposed by millennial-scale variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, atmospheric CO2 remains relatively stable before dropping abruptly towards the end of this interval (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the close correlation between atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic temperature throughout most of the last 800 kyr12 transiently breaks down across the MIS 5/4 transition9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With respect to the relatively stable CO2 levels between 85 and 70 kyr ago one could ask in an idealized sense what held-up CO2 concentrations during the gradual global temperature decline or, alternatively, why CO2 dropped so abruptly at the onset of MIS 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have so far focused on finding answers to the latter question in the framework of physical and biogeochemical processes in the coupled oceanatmosphere system13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the carbon cycle sub-system in current climate models does not fully account for variations in volcanic degassing over a glacial cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, it is particularly interesting that this period was accompanied by a sea level fall15,16,17 likely in the order of a several tens of metres (up to 100 m in extreme scenarios) within a period of 515 kyr (Fig 1f and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This points to the possibility that a transient phase of enhanced volcanic CO2 degassing in response to the sinking sea level held up atmospheric CO2 concentrations at a time of global temperature decline and ice sheet growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Relevant paleo data during the last glacial cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Earths axial tilt

boundary at 43 mantle plume-related oceanic hotspot volcanoes and along the global MOR system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All geodynamic simulations have been done with the M2TRI- and M3TET-codes (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18 and Methods section), which solve for two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) thermo-mechanical convection, respectively, including fractional wet melting of the Earths mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon dioxide is implemented as a passive highly incompatible component that preferentially enters the melt phase during partial melting (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These models predict that a falling sea level causes enhanced pressure-release melting in the oceanic uppermost mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conjunction with the interpretation of proxy data as well as biogeochemical simulations, we show that the enhanced melting induced a surge in magma and CO2 fluxes from oceanic hotspot and MOR volcanoes, which provides a negative feedback between glaciation and atmospheric CO2 on multi-millennial timescales.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Response of oceanic hotspot volcanoes to sea level fall', 'Oceanic hotspot volcanoes, unlike MOR1,2,3,5, have not yet been investigated for their sensitivity to glacial sea level changes, in spite of a comparatively higher CO2 concentration in the plume source19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the special geometry of hotspot volcanoes, which often features a subaerial volcano on top of a much wider submerged volcanic edifice and mantle melting region, makes them susceptible to sea level-linked variations in melt production (Figs 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fall in sea level may further decompress the upwelling mantle, which results in enhanced pressure-release melting and the efficient partitioning of highly incompatible CO2 into the melt phase within the lower part of the melting zone (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mantle plume melting is inherently 3D and controlled by parameters such as strength and chemical composition of the plume, but it is also shaped by the speed and age of the overriding plate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have designed a global hotspot-melting model by integrating the results of 126 3D numerical experiments that resolve the key aspects of mantle plume melting with data on plume buoyancy fluxes, plume excess temperatures, plate speeds and plate ages for 43 oceanic hotspots (see Supplementary Table 2 and Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This model predicts a global annual oceanic hotspot magma flux of 2.02 km3 (Fig 2), which is in accord with independently derived estimates of plume-related melt production being about 10% of the global MOR melt production of about 21 km3 per year19,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Effect sea level variations on hotspot melting and CO2 release.In (a) an example simulation for the Hawaiian plume (isosurface at T=1,420 °C) is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magmatic system at depth extends beyond the plume stem and is susceptible to sea level changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Size and shape of the melting region not only depend on the plumes strength and composition but also on speed and age of the overlying lithosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of a 60 m sea level drop over 15 kyr on magma flux (b) and CO2 release (c) is shown for the 43 oceanic hotspots investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Steady background values are shown in red, the increases during the MIS 5/4 sea level change in blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the melt and CO2 fluxes from the Iceland hotspot are only considered in the baseline but not in the calculation of the increase in response to a falling sea level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has to been done to honour the observation that Iceland was glaciated during the last interglacial-glacial transition.Full size image', 'Figure 3: Results of 3D viscoelastic simulations that investigate the pressure signal beneath ocean islands of different size at a time of sea level fall.The upper panel show the different geometries of volcanic edifices supported by a viscoelastic lithosphere; the lower panel plots show the percentage of the pressure signal, induced by sea level change, that is present at 60 km depth in the asthenospheric mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A maximum damping of 25% is found for the largest island sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All considered hotspots were catagorized into small, medium and large island depending on their subaerial area (see Supplementary Table 2).

elevation.Full size image', 'To gain a process-based understanding of the impact that a falling sea level has on plume melting and volcanic CO2 degassing, we apply a range of different sea level variations (Supplementary Table 1) as derived from the sea level curves shown in Fig 1f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following we focus on the results obtained for a scenario (S2), in which sea level dropped by 60 m over a period of 15,000 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Linking a sea level forcing to extra decompression melting requires an assessment of the flexural response of the lithosphere as the pressure signal may be damped beneath the subaerial parts of the volcanic edifice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we have performed 3D viscoelastic simulations (see Fig 3 and Methods scetion) that constrain the damping effect for conical-shaped islands of different sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The damping effect scales with island size and we find a maximum local damping of 25% for the largest considered ocean islands (for example, Big Island of the Hawaiian archipelago).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the calculations of increased pressure release melting during a falling sea level, the pressure signal below the respective island size is used for each considered mantle plume (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this methodology, we find an average transient increase in global plume-related magma flux of 12% corresponding to 0.24 km3 per year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that Iceland was excluded from this analysis as its magmatic response may have been controlled by ice sheet loading rather than by a falling sea level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Response of mid-ocean ridges to sea level fall', 'MOR melting has recently been shown to be sensitive to glacial sea level changes showing spreading rate dependent variations of 15100% with respect to the average long-term magma flux2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To obtain a quantitative assessment of the relative importance of these two oceanic subsystems we here additionally present a global MOR melting model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we have integrated a large number of 2D geodynamic simulations (Fig 4a), assuming full spreading rates between 0.2 and 20 cm per year, with the global distribution of MOR opening rates22 (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting global model predicts an average crustal thickness of 7 km for full spreading rates higher than 5 cm per year and a total annual magma flux of 22.8 km3 per year (Fig 4c), which matches observations21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Effect of

not need to be considered for the fully submerged global MOR system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that a 60 m sea level drop over 15 kyr transiently increases the average global magma production at MOR by 12% corresponding to 2.78 km3 per year (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Impact on volcanic CO2 emissions and atmospheric imprint', 'To transfer the above estimates on extra decompression melting to increased volcanic CO2 emissions, assumptions regarding CO2 concentrations in the different mantle sources and possible time lags between enhanced melting and increased emissions have to be made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These assumptions are then used to evaluate the impact on atmospheric CO2, using a box model of the global carbon cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Carbon dioxide quantitatively degasses at MOR and hence its concentration in the mantle source is poorly known, with published values23 ranging from 50 to 2,000 p.p.m.w.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average concentration is probably more on the lower side of this range20,24 and an average value of 140 p.p.m.w was estimated from ocean modelling of 3He and measured CO2/3He ratios19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use this estimate and obtain a steady baseline CO2 flux of 0.096 Gt per year in our global MOR melting model (Fig 4d), which, in spite of our more complex MOR melting model, is consistent with an earlier estimate19 and on the lower side of previously published estimates25 of 0.0440.792 Gt CO2 per year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average mantle CO2 concentration in the plume source is also poorly constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If CO2 is again assumed to behave similarly to He during partial melting, it can be inferred20 that the sources of ocean island basalts contain 1201,830 p.p.m.w CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a value of 950 p.p.m.w, which was determined from 3He as well as CO2/3He measurements and estimates of carbon-rich lower mantle contribution to plume melting19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this we establish a baseline volcanic CO2 flux from oceanic hotpot volcanoes of 0.127 Gt CO2 per year (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In correspondence, we predict that a 60 m sea level fall over 15 kyr results in an increase in the mobilization of CO2 into the melt phase of 14% (0.0172 Gt CO2 per year) beneath hotspot volcanoes and of 13% (0.0125 Gt CO2 per year) beneath the global MOR system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the uncertainty in these values is highmainly because of the high uncertainty in the CO2 concentrations of the mantle source regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the scaling between the predicted increases in CO2 mobilization is linear with the CO2 concentration in the mantle source, the impact of different parameter choices can easily be assessed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further sensitivity tests assuming different magnitudes (60100 m) and durations (515 kyr) of sea level fall show that the integrated amount of extra CO2 mobilization is on average 42 Gt CO2 per 10 m sea level drop at plume-related volcanoes and 31 Gt CO2 per 10 m sea level drop at MOR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This points to oceanic hotspots as the dominant geodynamic system with regard to sea level-linked variations in volcanic CO2 degassing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total we predict 446 Gt of extra CO2 that was mobilized into the melt phase for the 60 m sea level drop throughout the MIS 5/4 boundary (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The climate relevance of these CO2 flux estimates will critically depend on how quickly CO2 is transported from the melting region to the atmosphere/ocean system and on how efficiently it is buffered on the release timescales by marine, terrestrial and atmospheric processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is now growing evidence that the magma flux at MORs can respond to sea level fall on suborbital timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observational evidence for such a multi-millennial response time is the close relationship between sea level changes and hydrothermal activity that has been reported from both the South East Pacific Rise6 and the TAG hydrothermal on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported time lags between change in sea level and a hydrothermal response, most likely driven by temporarily increased magmatic fluxes at these sites, are 515 kyr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Relatively swift response timescales of such magmatic/hydrothermal systems to sea level changes within a few thousand years7 or less are in agreement with melt extraction timescales inferred from geochemical data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of uranium-series isotopic disequilibria point to minimum melt ascent rates of 120 m per year at MORs and oceanic hotspot volcanoes, and of 70 m per year at arc volcanoes, for which more stringent constraints are available26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further support for rapid magma ascent comes from the large volumes of magma that were erupted within less than 2 kyr following the last deglaciation of Iceland, which implies melt ascent rates 50 m per year 27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It thus seems that a magmatic response time to a sea level change in the order of a few kyr is fairly well supported by data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it may seem intuitive that CO2 emission are likely to increase along with the magma flux, such a relation critically depends on details of the melt extraction process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CO2 is highly incompatible and partitions into the melt phase at the base of the melting column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent numerical modelling has shown that under steady-state conditions extra CO2 mobilized in response to a falling sea level may take several tens of kyr to reach the ridge axes28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This time lag is, however, likely to be smaller when transient effects and processes related to intermediate magma storage in, for example, the axial melt lens at MOR or magma chambers at hotspot volcanoes are considered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should further be mentioned here that the timescales of melt extraction also affect the relative sensitivity of crustal production at MOR with differing spreading rates to different frequencies in the sea level forcing2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relation introduces a band-pass filter that controls how much of the sea level induced extra melt production reaches the ridge axis throughout a forcing period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This additional complexity is not considered here and we further take the simplifying view that an increase in magma flux is also related to an increase in the CO2 flux and will investigate the possible climate imprint of the predicted CO2 flux under the assumption that melt extraction occurs within a few thousand years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Based on these assumptions we can evaluate the atmospheric impact of the additional volcanic CO2 release using the box model of the global carbon cycle BICYCLE29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluate four scenarios (S1S4) summarized in Supplementary Table 3 with different magnitudes (60100 m) and durations (515 kyr) of the sea level drop with corresponding total additional volcanic CO2 releases of 400697 Gt CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For simplicity, we assume in these carbon cycle simulations that all the CO2 is either injected into the atmosphere (subaerial) or into the deep ocean (submarine), corresponding to the release from hotspot volcanoes or MOR, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the subaerial carbon injection, the timing of the peak amplitude coincides with the end of the respective carbon injection in the different scenarios (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A complete submarine source for the carbon release reduces the peak atmospheric CO2 value by 1020% and the respective maximum is detected about 200 years later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After reaching the corresponding maximum values of 49 p.p.m.v atmospheric CO2 slowly decreases due to the carbonate compensation feedback of the sediments and the injected additional CO2 that stays in the atmosphere (the so-called airborne fraction) converges to about 6% on a 20 kyr timescale (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Impact of additional volcanic CO2 release in the atmosphere.Simulated changes in (a) atmospheric CO2 and (b) airborne fraction in response to the additional volcanic CO2 release related to sea level fall, using the global carbon cycle model BICYCLE29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shown are the simulated anomalies for four different scenarios (S1-S4) in a setup in which the atmosphere-ocean sub-system of the carbon cycle is perturbed, including the sediment response (carbonate compensation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all scenarios, the additional volcanic CO2 corresponds to the sum of MOR and hotspot melting related to sea level fall, released at constant annual rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All emissions are either injected into the atmosphere (subaerial) or in the deep ocean (submarine).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations are initialized with boundary conditions representative of 83 kyr ago that are held constant throughout the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In (c) the airborne fraction for a pulse response experiment of 367 Gt CO2 (=100 GtC) released in year 1 obtained with the BICYCLE model for background conditions of 83 kyr ago and of pre-industrial times (PI) are compared with PI results from a MIP30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MIP results are restricted to times up to 1 kyr, but are extrapolated (broken line) by results of a regression analysis (function) applied to the output of a Earth system model for a variety of emission scenarios31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 2-uncertainty obtained from the MIP for 1 kyr is also used to show the likely uncertainty (model spread) for longer time periods (cyan-coloured area).Full size image', 'To set our results into context with other carbon cycle model sensitivities it is instructive to compare the airborne fraction in our model with those obtained by other studies, for example, by a model-intercomparison30 (MIP) in which a standardized pulse response scenario has been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario 100 Gt C (=367 Gt CO2) are injected into the atmosphere within 1 year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The carbon cycle response to this injection is a function of background climate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injection has been performed in the MIP30 under modern (not shown) and pre-industrial conditions (experiment pre-industrial times (PI) in Fig 5c), and the evolution of airborne CO2 has been investigated for a period of 1 kyr or less.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We here extrapolate these results towards 20 kyr by an impulse response function derived from the analysis of an Earth system model31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These extrapolated MIP results can be compared with the airborne fraction as simulated for PI and for 83 kyr ago (experiment 83ka) conditions (Fig 5c) using BICYCLE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the airborne fractions of our BICYCLE simulations are at the lower end of the 2-uncertainty spread of the MIP results (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a direct transfer of the airborne fraction spread to our results is not trivial, this model-intercomparison shows that our carbon cycle box model gives a relatively strong damping of volcanic CO2 release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, our simulated impact on atmospheric CO2 is likely to represent a lower bound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other models, for example, those used in the pulse response analysis30,31 would most likely find CO2 anomalies connected with this sea level induced volcanic outgassing that are up to a factor of 2.5 higher than our simulated peak responses (Fig 5a).'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Assuming a hypothetical baseline given by the simplifying assumption that orbital-scale CO2 concentration should have continued its close long-term correlation with temperature across the MIS 5/4 transition, the maximum CO2 offset in ice cores is as much as 18 p.p.m.v (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, our carbon cycle modelling results (Fig 5a,b) suggest that enhanced volcanic degassing can explain the bulk of this disconnect or even the full offset if the uncertainties in airborne fractions are taken into account (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact net effect, however, from the here presented negative feedback mechanism via hotspot and MOR volcanism will need to be further evaluated in the context of possibly counteracting processes such as carbonate formation during seafloor alteration reactions32,33 and decreased terrestrial volcanic emissions1,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Statistical analyses of the Quaternary eruption record do reveal a peak in activity at glaciated high-latitude volcanoes during the last deglacial, which is absent at volcanoes not affected by ice-sheet growth1,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that growing ice-sheets during the MIS 5/4 transition may have resulted in reduced emissions at high-latitude volcanoes; especially since the regional loading effect can be much larger than the global decrease in sea level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constraining the net effect and the respective roles that are played by arc, MOR and hotspot volcanoes in the Earth System is further complicated by the uncertainties in time lags between sea level as well as ice sheet forcing, and the different volcanic responses as discussed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These issues necessitate future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This should include constraints refined by observations, improved multi-phase melt migration simulations, and coupled Earth system models that can account for volcanism-related solid Earthclimate interactions as possible causes for atmospheric CO2 changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The decoupling in the evolution of CO2 and temperature across the MIS 5/4 transition ended between 74 and 70 kyr ago when CO2 also started to drop (Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Available reconstructions indicate that sea level (Fig 1f) is likely to have declined further beyond this point in time, which according to our suggested mechanism implies a sustained source of volcanic CO2 to the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, superposed changes in the atmosphereoceanbiosphere system such as enhanced nutrient utilization in the Southern Ocean29,36 in response to increased dustiness37 leading to iron fertilization (Fig 1e) and/or large scale changes in ocean circulation14,38,39 may have contributed to the overall CO2 decline and thus overprinted any further sea level/volcanism-related CO2 release after 7470 kyr ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The here proposed sea level-CO2 relation may have also, in addition or alternatively to previous explanations40, contributed to the persistence of stable high atmospheric CO2 concentrations at the end of the previous interglacial (MIS 5e) until 115 kyr ago, at a time when global long-term temperatures had already dropped for 10 kyr, approximately in tandem with falling sea level from high-stand conditions at 125 kyr ago (Fig 1, Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing uncertainty levels in the relative timing of atmospheric CO2, temperature and sea level changes provide a challenging framework to test the link between these changes and CO2 outgassing from volcanoes further back in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, stacked records reveal that disconnects between CO2 and temperature during times of sea level fall are not unique to the MIS 5/4 transition (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the deglacial phases that show relatively synchronous changes in CO2 and temperature, most of the intervals of decreasing obliquity with falling sea level show a disconnect between CO2 and temperature for the last 800 kyr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notable exceptions are phases of pronounced atmospheric dust variations, in line with our interpretation that superposed carbon cycle effects (via pronounced dust alterations or ocean circulation changes) can dominate over the impact of our presented sea leveldegassing relation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also applies to deglacial phases as suggested by the timing of pronounced atmospheric dust alterations (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore the superposition of multiple carbon cycle effects within a relatively short deglacial period (10 kyr) also implies that this deglacial window might not be optimally suited to isolate geosphereclimate interactions such as the negative feedback mechanism described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On longer time-scales (100 kyr), associated with the development of full interglacial-glacial changes, a sea-level drop of 120 m facilitates an atmospheric CO2 rise similar to the impact of a smaller glacial terrestrial carbon pool or a higher glacial ocean salinity29, which is expected to counteract the overall interglacial-glacial CO2 drawdown in the atmosphere via the negative feedback mechanism described here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We conclude that throughout the last 800 kyr, the repeated occurrence of diverging trends in atmospheric CO2 levels and temperature during a synchronous sea level fall associated with ice sheet growth indicates that the proposed novel negative feedback mechanism (Supplementary Fig 3) might be an important component of solid Earthclimate interactions and of the global carbon cycle on suborbital timescales.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

mantle plume beneath a moving lithospheric plate requires a 3D geodynamic model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume symmetry across a vertical plane parallel to the direction of plate motion and through the

wetter composition for mantle plume material  compared to the upper mantle composition .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conducted a 3D parameter study in which we systematically varied four key parameters related to the mantle plume and the plate tectonic setting of the associated hotspot: (i) plume buoyancy flux QB (500, 1,000, 4,000, 6,000 and 10,000 kg s1), (ii) plume excess temperature Texc (100, 200 and

submarine MOR, oceanic hotspot melting zones are located below large volcanic edifices that are partially subaerial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A falling sea level, however, will only change the hydrostatic pressure on the seafloor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the amplitude of the sea level-induced pressure signal below the island we have calculated the viscoelastic response of an oceanic lithosphere carrying an island using the free surface and viscoelastic capabilities of M3TET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We initialized cone-shaped islands of different sizes, applied a water depth-dependent normal force boundary condition at the top and calculated the islands subsidence until an isostatic equilibrium established (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we simulated the falling sea level around the island by reducing the normal forces and monitored the pressure change in the viscous asthenospheric mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elastic parameter choices are summarized in Supplementary Table

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, not every plume with estimated buoyancy flux also has an estimate for excess temperature and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To fill these data gaps we calculate the missing value using a linear interpolation between Hawaiian-like values (8,700 kg s1 and 290 °C) representing the strong plume case and values that are typical for a weak plume (500 kg s1 and 150 °C).

plate hosting the hotspot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plate motion relative to the hotspot is then calculated using the global plate motion model described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lithosphere thickness is calculated from the age of the lithosphere at the hotspot location (using the data set in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58) and then converted to plate thickness using the GDH1 model52 for the thermal evolution of oceanic lithosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We define the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at the depth where 90% of the basal temperature in the GDH1 model is reached.

ridges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we assume a minimum plate thickness of 50 km even if the GDH1 model predicts a thinner thermal lithosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these four parameters, each oceanic hotspot/plume (Supplementary Table 2) is located within the 4D parameter space spanned by the 3D calculations (Supplementary Fig 5), and melt production and CO2 mobilization are linearly interpolated.
