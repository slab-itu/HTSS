Wars2 is a determinant of angiogenesis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Coronary flow (CF) measured ex vivo is largely determined by capillary density that reflects angiogenic vessel formation in the heart in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we exploit this relationship and show that CF in the rat is influenced by a locus on rat chromosome 2 that is also associated with cardiac capillary density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (Wars2), encoding an L53F protein variant within the ATP-binding motif, is prioritized as the candidate at the locus by integrating genomic data sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WARS2(L53F) has low enzyme activity and inhibition of WARS2 in endothelial cells reduces angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the zebrafish, inhibition of wars2 results in trunk vessel deficiencies, disordered endocardial-myocardial contact and impaired heart function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of Wars2 in the rat causes cardiac angiogenesis defects and diminished cardiac capillary density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data demonstrate a pro-angiogenic function for Wars2 both within and outside the heart that may have translational relevance given the association of WARS2 with common human diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Angiogenesis describes the formation of new vessels from the existing vasculature1 and is a critical physiological process for matching oxygen and nutrient supply to tissue metabolic demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In disease, pathological angiogenesis often occurs and this is an important process for cancers, retinal diseases and inflammatory conditions2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the diseased heart, cardiac myocyte metabolic needs can exceed capillary vessel growth leading to diminished oxygen delivery and cardiac ischaemia4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While coronary flow (CF) is highly heritable7, large-scale genetic studies of CF in humans have not been possible due to the complexities and limitations of CF phenotyping8, although increasing CF remains an attractive target for therapeutic intervention9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'During angiogenesis, the angiogenic sprouting process requires the recruitment of tip and stalk cells from existing endothelium, followed by migration and proliferation of these cells in response to a chemoattractive tissue gradient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the most important pro-angiogenic signals is provided by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which activates quiescent endothelial cells (ECs) and promotes new vessel formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phenotypic fate determination of ECs into leading tip cells or supporting stalk cells depends on a highly regulated balance between VEGF-receptor and Notch-dependent signalling10, which remains incompletely understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cardiac vessels develop via angiogenic processes, although there is controversy regarding their EC origin11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The limitations of effective ways to regulate angiogenesis relate, in part, to our incomplete understanding of the underlying biology that we postulated, may be improved through genetic studies of CF in the ex vivo rat heart, which provides a model for an indirect, quantitative measurement of capillary density and, by inference, angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work, we identify mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (Wars2) as a novel gene for cardiac capillary density and CF in the rat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pro-angiogenic effect of Wars2 is confirmed by loss- and gain-of-function approaches in vitro and in two in vivo models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings describe a novel gene for angiogenesis both within and outside the heart.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we identify Wars2 as a new gene for angiogenesis both within and outside the heart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human genome-wide association studies, heritable WARS2 gene expression was identified in breast cancers34 and the WARS2 locus was associated with cardio-metabolic phenotypes35 that were also linked to the VEGFA locus35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, genetic studies in the mouse implicated Wars2 in capillary formation in the skin36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WARS2(L53F) variant we identified is associated with reduced enzymatic activity, which can unveil non-canonical effects of ARSs that are often, perhaps surprisingly, tissue specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that, in particular in the zebrafish, there are several mutations in other ARS genes that cause vascular defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, deficiency in several ARS genes (iars, sars and tars) lead to increased branching of ISVs, showing that ARS genes can have both pro- and anti-angiogenic effects37,38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, other zebrafish models with profoundly impaired mitochondrial function do not show the cardiovascular phenotypes41,42,43 that we observed (Fig 3a-h) indicating that the effects of wars2 disruption may be not due to a generic effect of mitochondrial dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The effects of wars2 knockdown in zebrafish embryos are similar to what has been observed previously in mutants with disrupted VEGF function29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, the defects in angiogenic sprouting of ISVs, likely due to a lack of migration and/or proliferation of tip and stalk cells, respectively, suggest that WARS2 might play a role in the signalling mechanisms downstream of the VEGFR responsible for tip and stalk cell behaviour44, potentially involving the balance between VEGF- and Notch-dependent signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGF is known to be a major regulator of cardiac angiogenesis45, and deletion of either myocardial Vegf-a or endocardial Vegfr-2 has been shown to prevent normal coronary vasculature development in mice11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, disruption of VE-cadherin, an endothelial-specific adhesion molecule mediating downstream effects of Vegf-a (vegf-a), prevented sprouting angiogenesis in mice46 and led to a separation between the myocardium and endocardium in zebrafish embryos28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study also showed that Notch1 activation promotes the tight interaction between endocardium and myocardium, leading to cardiac trabeculation via ephrin B2 and neuregulin activation47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our comparable observations of decreased cardiac capillary density in Wars2(/L53F) rats as well as the myocardialendocardial separation after wars2 knockdown in zebrafish support a hypothesis that WARS2 interacts with pathways downstream of VEGF and Notch.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our data show that WARS2 is a novel determinant of angiogenesis in the heart and other tissues perhaps acting as an integrator of pro-angiogenic signalling, directing cell motility and division to enable EC migration and proliferation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
