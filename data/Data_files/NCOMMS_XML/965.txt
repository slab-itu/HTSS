Phylogenetic analysis of metastatic progression in breast cancer using somatic mutations and copy number aberrations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Several studies using genome-wide molecular techniques have reported various degrees of genetic heterogeneity between primary tumours and their distant metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has been difficult to discern patterns of dissemination owing to the limited number of patients and available metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use phylogenetic techniques on data generated using whole-exome sequencing and copy number profiling of primary and multiple-matched metastatic tumours from ten autopsied patients to infer the evolutionary history of breast cancer progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed two modes of disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In some patients, all distant metastases cluster on a branch separate from their primary lesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clonal frequency analyses of somatic mutations show that the metastases have a monoclonal origin and descend from a common metastatic precursor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, multiple metastatic lesions are seeded from different clones present within the primary tumour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that a metastasis can be horizontally cross-seeded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide insights into breast cancer dissemination.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer-related mortality is almost always due to metastatic dissemination of the primary disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While research continues to unravel the molecular underpinnings of the metastatic cascade, it is increasingly recognized that profiling of advanced disease could help elucidate such biological phenomena as distant recurrence and the emergence of de novo resistance to therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A handful of studies using genome-wide molecular techniques have begun to explore the clonal relationships between primary and matched metastatic tumours in diverse types of neoplasia including pancreatic1,2, clear-cell renal cell3, high-grade serous ovarian4,5,6 and prostate cancer7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the small cohort sizes and, too often, a limited number of matched metastases for each patient, these pioneering efforts brought forth thought-provoking findings such as the first quantitative model of cancer progression from onset of the founder mutation to metastatic dissemination2, the occurrence of organ specific lineages1, monoclonal3,4,5,6,7,8, as well as its counterpart, polyclonal seeding7,8, horizontal cross-seeding between distant metastases6,8, and finally homing of metastatic cells to the primary tumour bed7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While yet other studies continue to highlight the potential of genomic analyses from small cohort sizes to decipher the origins of intra-tumour heterogeneity and its contribution to metastatic dissemination9,10, in-depth knowledge is currently lacking for breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several studies have tackled this issue11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while early attempts were constrained by the development of high throughput genomic techniques, more recent endeavours were, on the other hand, limited in scope by the availability of multiple-matched metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noteworthy exceptions are the work of Juric et al.15 and Murtaza et al.16, both n-of-1 fast autopsy studies, where the authors uncovered the mechanisms of resistance to a PI3K-inhibitor and lapatinib, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this, it remains difficult to discern any pattern of metastatic progression due to the small number of patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further investigate breast cancer progression, we applied phylogenetic techniques on data generated using whole-exome sequencing, custom ultra-deep resequencing and copy number profiling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary tumours and their associated metastases were obtained from ten autopsied patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed two modes of metastatic progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the majority of cases, all distant metastases cluster on a branch separate from their primary lesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clonal frequency analyses of somatic mutations show that the metastases have a monoclonal origin and descend from a common metastatic precursor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the primary tumour is clustered alongside metastases with early branches leading to distant organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that a distant metastasis can be horizontally cross-seeded confirming previous results observed in other types of neoplastic disorders6,8 and lending further support to the self-seeding hypothesis20.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Characteristics of patients and samples', 'We reviewed the database of the institutional autopsy programme of the second Department of Pathology at Semmelweis University.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From 50 deceased metastatic breast cancer patients, whose corpses underwent autopsy between 2001 and 2012, ten patients for whom  greater than 1 g double-stranded DNA from the primary breast tumour, a non-cancerous tissue as germline reference, and at least one metastatic sample was available, were selected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eight patients were diagnosed with early stage disease among whom, one was diagnosed with a single liver metastasis (5/87).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three patients (3/92, 5/87 and 6/91) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery while the remaining five patients (4/71, 7/67, 8/82, 9/68 and 10/80) were treated with breast surgery followed by adjuvant systemic therapy according to standard of care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining two patients (1/69 and 2/57) were diagnosed with de novo metastatic disease and deceased before receiving any systemic or surgical treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The patient clinico-pathological characteristics are provided in Supplementary Data 1 while the clinical history and autopsy findings are detailed in Supplementary Notes 110 corresponding to patient 1/69 to 10/80.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lesions profiled are described in Supplementary Data 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples from the de novo metastatic patients were collected post-mortem while, for the remaining patients, the primary tumours were collected at surgery and the distant metastases, in addition to one case of local recurrence, were collected at autopsy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average, three distant metastatic lesions were profiled per patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Indexing of somatic mutations and copy number aberrations', 'We used whole-exome sequencing to index somatic mutations from 51 samples (median coverage 40±18 × ) followed by orthogonal validation using Sequenom MassARRAY to exclude false positive calls and targeted amplicon ultra-deep sequencing (median coverage 11,390±5,646 × ) to obtain accurate variant allele frequencies (VAFs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The list of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from each patient is provided in Supplementary Data 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We supplemented this with high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to characterize the underlying copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 64 matched samples (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further devised a multiple tier system to ascribe a confidence level to each indexed mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Between 27 and 305 non-synonymous SNVs per patient were successfully validated up to tier-3 level and after applying defined quality criteria, a total of 56 samples with either CNA or sequencing data remained for downstream analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phylogenetic reconstruction of metastatic progression', 'Metastases are clonally related and originate from cells disseminated at various stages of the disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, they inherit varying fractions of genomic alterations from their parental lineage, followed by acquisition of private alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Provided the genomic alterations under investigation are fully clonal, phylogenetic inference can be used to investigate lineage tracing of metastases within a patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we used a maximum parsimony criterion to infer the sequence of genomic alterations occurring during metastatic progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1af illustrates the results obtained in patient 2/57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whenever the two phylogenies obtained from SNVs and CNAs were consistent, these were graphically represented as a combined tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of SNV-based phylogenies containing unresolved nodes, so called soft polytomies, we used the corresponding tree generated from CNAs as the correct phylogeny on account of the greater number of aberrations from SNP arrays, allowing for a unique solution to tree reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Phylogenetic inference from SNVs and CNAs.Fully clonal somatic CNAs of chromosome 3 for (a) the primary tumour, (b) the liver and (c) the ovarian metastases of patient 2/57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tracks are in descending order, the B Allele Frequency (BAF), integer copy number (CN) state and log2 ratios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phylogenetic reconstruction is displayed in d, where arrows indicate aberrations with annotations besides detailing coordinates and event type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Convergent evolution is exemplified by the focal amplification of region d in a,b but a broad gain of ce in c, in all three cases leading to copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity of region d.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Herein, we applied phylogenetic techniques to infer the evolutionary history of breast cancer progression from an autopsy cohort of ten patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to previous reports, which compared single metastasis and primary tumour pairs only or multiple-matched metastases and primary tumours for no more than two patients, the availability of a larger number of patients with matched primary and multiple metastatic samples was critical to our study for deciphering the routes of dissemination underlying metastatic progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We observed two possible scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most frequent implied a single successful seeding event from the primary tumour followed by metastasis-to-metastasis cascading disseminations, whereas the second involved multiple seeding events from the primary tumour alongside daughter metastasis-to-metastasis disseminations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dichotomy coincides with the clinical history where, except for patient 5/87, descent from a common metastatic origin was observed in patients diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, whereas multiple seeding events from the primary tumour occurred in patients diagnosed with advanced stage disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The role of primary tumour resection in de novo metastatic breast cancer patients is unclear, and there is currently no consensus whether this procedure confers a survival benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent open label trial did not support primary surgery in de novo metastatic patients progressing to front-line chemotherapy25 and in a subgroup analysis of a Turkish study26, patients with multiple liver and lung metastases did worse in the primary surgery group consistent with earlier reports that surgical excision of the primary tumour might enhance the growth of micrometastases27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the same trial by Soran et al.26, the authors observed an increased progression free survival for primary tumour resection in ER+/HER2-de novo metastatic patients with solitary bone metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our observations suggest that surgical excision of the primary tumour might reduce metastatic dissemination in selected cases hence providing a potential biological rationale for this practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, there is no strong recommendation showing overall survival benefit from surgical resection of oligo-metastases in breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our analyses, metastatic lesions constitute an additional source of seeding and heterogeneity in advanced breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our cohort is too small to derive practice-changing evidence, but supports the concept that resecting isolated metastases may be of clinical benefit in oligo-metastatic breast cancer patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, results from larger, prospective studies are warranted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We reckoned that the number of late SNVs and CNAs, should increase as distant metastases evolve and should give an indication, albeit approximate, of the time elapsed since they last diverged from their common ancestor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we observed a positive correlation between overall survival and the average normalized phylogenetic branch lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be explained by the fact that patients 1/69 and 2/57 were de novo metastatic and consistent with those two patients, 4/71 also had a very short distant metastasis free and overall survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the other extreme, in patients 8/82, 9/68 and 10/80 who relapsed more than 4 years after initial diagnosis, the extent of late genomic alterations were commensurate with the survival of the patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest, not unexpectedly, that metastases from patients with longer cancer histories are genetically more distant from their common ancestor or their primary tissue of origin than those of patients with a shorter cancer history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Evidence has been accumulating in the literature regarding treatment-induced genomic remodelling15,16,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37, especially implicating ESR1 and PTEN alterations in endocrine and PI3K-inhibitor resistance, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our series, four out of the five ER-positive patients received aromatase inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no ESR1 mutations have been detected in their distant metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the patients received any PI3K-inhibitor making it impossible to evaluate resistance mechanisms associated to this treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, by characterizing the genomic alterations that shape metastatic genomes, we have gleaned new insights into the dissemination patterns of breast cancer with potential clinical implications: (1) cascading dissemination from metastases appears to be a major route of metastatic progression in early, radically resected breast cancer and (2) primary tumours at diagnosis may not adequately represent advanced metastatic disease advocating the need for genetic characterization of multiple metastatic lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very recent technical advances in the assessment of circulating tumour DNA38 may both allow the early detection of micrometastatic disease before recurrence and may better capture tumour heterogeneity of metastatic disease guiding the best therapeutic options for early and advanced breast cancer patients in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genomic alterations uniquely defining breast cancer metastases from an aetiological

system for filtering SNVs', 'A five-tier system was devised to filter SNVs for downstream analysis (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We considered tier-0 SNVs as any SNV indexed in any sample including the matched germline reference by exome sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tier-1 SNVs are those that were further called somatic after comparison with the germline reference while tier-2 SNVs are the subset of tier-1 which have been further validated and confirmed somatic by Sequenom MassARRAY.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tier-3 SNVs are the further subset that was confirmed present by targeted deep amplicon sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to formalin fixation and paraffin embedding, at some loci, all four bases were often observed at low frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to determine the background noise of the targeted deep sequencing experiments, we selected 25 bp upstream and downstream of tier-2 SNVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each position, the number of reads for the reference nucleotide and the other 3 non-reference nucleotides was determined using GATK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude possible SNPs or SNVs other than the one of interest, we removed all data points that showed more than 10% non-reference reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then pooled all the data for each mutation type (AT greater than CG, AT greater than GC, AT greater than TA, CG greater than AT, CG greater than GC and CG greater than TA) and calculated the average background signal and s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From these estimates, the highest value observed was 1.59%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we chose a conservative value of 3% as the final cut-off for calling a mutation present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present context, several samples were matched to a given patient and we found it equally important to have a high coverage to call a mutation present in one sample, as it is to call absence in another paired sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at the tier-3 level, we first filtered all SNVs in all matched samples to have a coverage of  greater than 1,500 × and kept samples with a minimum of 75% non-missing values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then excluded all SNVs with  greater than 1 missing value across any of the matched samples previously retained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reversed the filtering order for VAFs by first eliminating SNVs that were called absent  less_than 3% across all matched samples previously retained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of low CCF, it is likely that some samples have a lower total number of SNVs called present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a lower number of detected mutations could also be biologically grounded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we use a lenient filtering to exclude samples with potentially low CCFs by requiring that  greater than 20% of SNVs be called present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some samples showed a large number of SNVs or had limited starting DNA available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For those samples, we were compelled to skip validation by Sequenom MassARRAY and thus the tier-2 level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we required that for all samples where a matched-SNP array and targeted sequencing were available, that the sample displays a CCF  greater than 30% as determined by SNP array.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All SNVs from that sample were then referred to as tier-4 SNVs', 'SNP array analysis', 'For the estimation of CNAs, a total of 64 samples were shipped for processing to the Affymetrix Research Services Laboratory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normal and tumour DNA from FFPE samples were genotyped using the Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE Express 2.0 arrays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Routine formalin fixation and paraffin embedding frequently damages DNA causing wavy profiles, which may be wrongly interpreted as copy number aberrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the median absolute pairwise deviation (MAPD) and the median auto-correlation (MAC) across the log2 ratio intensities were used as quality control for the SNP arrays (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples with an MAPD greater than 0.7 or an MAC greater than 0.3 were discarded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples suspected to have a low CCF on visual inspection of the BAF tracks were flagged and after processing, those confirmed to have less than 30% CCF were discarded from downstream applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the remaining samples, only informative probes displaying heterozygous genotype (AB) and copy-neutral state (2) in the matched normal sample were kept for analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the added value of multiple-matched samples per patient to infer breakpoints, which may otherwise have been missed due to differences in CCF across the various samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The log2 ratio intensities and BAF, grouped per patient, were segmented jointly using the multitrack PCF algorithm in the R package copynumber47 to determine common breakpoints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The penalty parameter  determining discontinuities in the log2 ratio and BAF tracks was set individually for each patient after visual inspection of the segmentation profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, all segments that were less than three s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  away were merged with their immediate neighbours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integer level estimates of total copy number and major allele were obtained using GAP48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the estimates returned by GAP with two other mainstream programs: (1) ASCAT49 and (2) ABSOLUTE21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unless otherwise stated, the parameter sets for each programme were kept at default values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ASCAT, the parameter , which determines the platform-specific compression ratio, was set to 0.8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The programme returns one default estimate of ploidy and CCF, which was used in the comparison against GAP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABSOLUTE was run in total copy mode and model based evaluation against the SNP6 platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fraction of the genome allowed to be non-clonal was set to infinity so that the maximum number of solutions could be evaluated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ABSOLUTE returns a set of possible values for ploidy and CCF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The closest solution to that returned by GAP in Euclidean space, after rescaling ploidy values to unit distance, was chosen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results obtained by GAP, ASCAT and ABSOLUTE are contrasted in Supplementary Fig 10a,b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all three cases, the Spearmans  between the estimated CCF was high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of ploidy estimates, the correlation between GAP and ASCAT was relatively low due to two reasons: (1) several matched samples from two patients displayed ploidy values outside the range considered by ASCAT and (2) at several loci displaying high copy numbers, GAP truncates the estimate to 8 while ASCAT does not thereby affecting the true estimate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We computed the Cohens  coefficient between ASCAT and GAP to measure the agreement in total copy numbers and major alleles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are displayed in Supplementary Fig 10c while the correlation of the  coefficients for total copy numbers and the absolute difference in ploidy between the two algorithms is shown in panel d. The results showed that the disagreement between the two programs in the phasing of alleles and estimation of total copy numbers is in fact linked to the discordances in ploidy (=0.898, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the present dataset contained matched samples and may represent a biased result, we used an additional dataset of 125 unrelated samples profiled using similar Affymetrix OncoScan SNP arrays (unpublished data) to reproduce the analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Figure 11a,b shows a very good correlation between the two estimates of ploidy (=0.885, P less_than 0.01) and CCF (=0.907, P less_than 0.01).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the correlation of the  coefficients for total copy numbers and the absolute difference in ploidy (=0.733, P less_than 0.01) or CCF (=0.119, P=0.147) shows that it is, in fact, the incorrect estimation of global genomic mass that leads to disagreement between the two algorithms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Figure 11fm contrasts the results from GAP and ASCAT for four samples with increasing genomic mass and illustrates the complexity of choosing the correct solution of CCF and ploidy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the present context of matched samples and because GAP allowed for manual review of ploidy solutions, we opted for this package for downstream analyses taking into consideration the maximal limit of eight copies imposed by the software as follows: (1) SNVs that occurred at loci where the total copy number was 8 or a major allele count  greater than 4 was observed were not considered for the estimation of CCF or clonal frequency and (2) similarly for the phylogenetic reconstructions using CNAs, except in the case of high ploidy tumours (that is, 1/69, 7/67, 8/82 and 10/80) any locus displaying a total copy number of 8 or a major allele count  greater than 4 in any sample was removed from all matching samples of that particular patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Estimation of CCF and clonal frequencies from
