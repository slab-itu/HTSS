Akkermansia muciniphila mediates negative effects of IFN on glucose metabolism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cross-talk between the gut microbiota and the host immune system regulates host metabolism, and its dysregulation can cause metabolic disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that the gut microbe Akkermansia muciniphila can mediate negative effects of IFN on glucose tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In IFN-deficient mice, A. muciniphila is significantly increased and restoration of IFN levels reduces A. muciniphila abundance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that IFN-knockout mice whose microbiota does not contain A. muciniphila do not show improvement in glucose tolerance and adding back A. muciniphila promoted enhanced glucose tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We go on to identify Irgm1 as an IFN-regulated gene in the mouse ileum that controls gut A. muciniphila levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A. muciniphila is also linked to IFN-regulated gene expression in the intestine and glucose parameters in humans, suggesting that this trialogue between IFN, A. muciniphila and glucose tolerance might be an evolutionally conserved mechanism regulating metabolic health in mice and humans.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'An important advance of the last couple of decades in biomedical science is the recognition that mammalian organisms do not function as a collection of functionally independent systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, there is extensive cooperation among systems that is essential for life, and its absence can result in dysfunction and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous studies have revealed the involvement of the immune system in regulation of metabolism, and how the alteration of the immune system can contribute to metabolic abnormalities such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies have primarily focused on immune cell effects on fat, liver and muscle, as besides the pancreas, these tissues are considered major metabolic organs responsible for glucose and lipid metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One such example is the influence of IFN, which is a central cytokine of the immune system, on systemic glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown that mice deficient in IFN have improved glucose tolerance6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, this phenomenon has been attributed to reduced hepatic glucose production6 and increased insulin sensitivity, possibly related to reduced adipose inflammation in case of obese animals8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'More recently, the gut has emerged as an important player in systemic metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides producing several hormones, the gut harbours thousands of microbes (the gut microbiota) which themselves function as a metabolically active organ9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, by modulating the composition and dynamics of the gut microbiota, the immune system may ultimately exert a major impact on the metabolism of the organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few recent studies have demonstrated physiologically important trialogues among the immune system, gut microbiota and metabolism11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite the emerging evidence of importance of such trialogues, much research continues to focus on two-component dialogues, thus failing to appreciate the complete picture of communication between multiple systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the current study, we addressed whether the established dialogue between IFN and glucose metabolism involves a third playerthe gut microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using systems biology approaches and analysing transkingdom interactions we found that, indeed, the effect of IFN on glucose tolerance is mediated by one of the members of mouse gut microbiota, A. muciniphila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we have identified immunity-related GTPase family, M (Irgm1) as an IFN-regulated host gene responsible for control of A. muciniphila levels in the gut.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the investigation of human subjects revealed that A. muciniphila may play similar roles in mouse and human physiology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'IFN-regulated bacterial modulators of glucose metabolism', 'Similar to previous reports6,7,8, we observed that glucose tolerance is significantly improved in IFNKO mice (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To start addressing our hypothesis that gut microbiota is a mediator of effect of IFN on glucose metabolism, we first treated wild-type (WT) and IFNKO mice with a cocktail of antibiotics that has been successfully employed in previous studies to eliminate the majority of gut bacteria to test their role in host physiology15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, glucose metabolism was improved following antibiotic treatment in both genotypes (Fig 1a), which is consistent with previous findings that, as a whole, microbiota worsen glucose metabolism18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly for this study, treatment with antibiotics abolished differences between the two genotypes, supporting our hypothesis that microbiota mediate the effect of IFN on glucose metabolism (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Body weight and food intake alone could not consistently explain differences in glucose tolerance (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Identification of A. muciniphila as a predicted

sought to determine microbe(s) mediating effect of IFN on glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such microbes would need to fulfill two criteria: (1) to be regulated by IFN and (2) to regulate glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in the exploratory phase, we first assessed which microbes were differentially abundant under IFN perturbation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, in a separate set of analyses using correlations with metabolic measurements, we identified which of the IFN-regulated bacteria could be potential regulators of glucose metabolism (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify such microbes and to minimize confounding effects, we used two independent methods to perturb IFN levelsgenetic disruption of IFN and blockade with anti-IFN antibody (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When microbial abundances between IFNKO and corresponding wild-type mice were compared by sequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, 555 differentially abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified, corresponding to 33 different genera (Supplementary Fig 2A, Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, to narrow and validate our findings, we used a second method to perturb IFN levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We took advantage of the fact that germfree mice have very low levels of systemic and intestinal IFN and that microbiota induce expression of this cytokine in the gut22 (Supplementary Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We colonized wild-type germfree mice with microbiota from IFNKO mice and blocked the rising levels of IFN with an anti-IFN antibody to maintain low levels during colonization while a control group was treated with rat IgG (Supplementary Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that taxa that have similar differential abundance in both experiments (genetic knockout and antibody blockade) are more likely to be regulated by IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, we observed a significant increase in IFN levels 7 days after colonization that was prevented by anti-IFN antibody injection (Supplementary Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing of the 16S rRNA in caecum revealed that 248 OTUs were differentially abundant (Supplementary Fig 2D, Supplementary Data 2), of which 69 OTUs were concordant with the IFNKO versus WT results (Fig 1c, Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Once we identified IFN-regulated bacteria, we searched for those that would be predicted to mediate the effect of the cytokine on glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this, we analysed correlations between the abundance of IFN-regulated microbes and glucose metabolism parameters such as fasted glucose levels and area under curve of glucose tolerance test (AUC-GTT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis was performed in IFNKO mice so that direct effects of IFN could not bias the correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this approach23, microbial candidates that mediate the effect of IFN on glucose metabolism should present a positive correlation with glucose levels and AUC-GTT if they are enriched in the presence of IFN, and negative correlation if they are depleted by IFN (see experimental outline in Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through this analysis we identified four different OTUs, all corresponding to A. muciniphila, as top candidate improvers of glucose metabolism (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased abundance of A. muciniphila is detected in both the ileum and stool of IFNKO mice, and levels in the stool are representative of those in the ileum (Fig 1e, Supplementary Fig 2B,C) and correlate to fasting glucose and AUC-GTT (Fig 1f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, one OTU corresponding to Bacteroidetes S24-7, which could not be assigned to a specific taxon, was identified as a top candidate for worsening of glucose tolerance metrics (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  muciniphila mediates effect of IFN on glucose tolerance', 'A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  muciniphila is a well-known, cultivable species present in both the mouse and human microbiota24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, A. muciniphila has previously been linked to metabolismit is reduced in obese mice and patients, and restoration of its levels improves glucose metabolism in mouse models of metabolic disease25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis, thus far, predicted A. muciniphila as a key candidate for improvement of glucose tolerance in lean IFNKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate this relationship, we performed a series of confirmatory loss- and gain-of-function experiments (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we restored IFN levels in KO mice by administering exogenous recombinant IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All IFNKO mice showed identical initial glucose tolerance (Fig 2b) at the start of the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following 2 weeks of injections, serum IFN levels were elevated compared with PBS control, but did not reach wild-type levels; therefore it is unlikely that activation of IFN pathways was induced above what would be expected for wild-type mice (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice that received IFN showed significantly worse glucose tolerance than PBS controls (Fig 2c), coincident with a decrease in abundance of A. muciniphila levels (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate the ability of IFN to regulate A. muciniphila as well as to regulate glucose tolerance, but do not rule out the possibility that these two effects are independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: IFN reconstitution validates IFN as a regulator of A. muciniphila and glucose tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Experimental outline describing the

acts through A. muciniphila as our predictive analysis suggests, we bred IFNKO mice with A. muciniphila-negative wild-type mice to generate A. muciniphila-negative IFN heterozygotes, which were then interbred to ultimately obtain A. muciniphila-negative IFNKO mice (IFNKO/Akkneg) that was possible due to lack of exposure from heterozygous parents (Fig 2a middle panel; Supplementary Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After three generations of breeding, we achieved close to non-detectable levels ( less_than 1 copy per ng bacterial DNA) of A. muciniphila in the stool of IFNKO mice (Supplementary Fig 4D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no difference in glucose tolerance between wild-type and IFNKO/Akkneg mice (Fig 3b), demonstrating that by removal of A. muciniphila from the system we could abrogate the effect of IFN on glucose levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we reasoned that the breeding strategy might have altered the abundance of other taxa in gut microbiota in addition to A. muciniphila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we performed 16S rRNA gene profiling of the IFNKO/Akkneg microbiota compared with natively A. muciniphila positive mice from Jackson Labs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified only three taxa other than A. muciniphila to be different following this breeding strategy (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to test whether A. muciniphila, and not some other altered taxa, was causative of metabolic improvement in IFNKO mice, we reconstituted a subset of IFNKO/Akkneg mice with A. muciniphila (IFNKO/Akkpos) (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seven days after colonization we observed better systemic glucose tolerance in IFNKO/Akkpos mice, while IFNKO that did not receive A. muciniphila continued presenting glucose tolerance similar to wild-type mice (Fig 3d, Supplementary Fig 4), thus confirming that A. muciniphila is sufficient to mediate the effects of IFN on systemic glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we restored IFN levels in these IFNKO/Akkneg and IFNKO/Akkpos mice through injection of recombinant IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only mice carrying A. muciniphila responded to treatment by worsening of glucose tolerance (compare Fig 3f to Fig 3h, Supplementary Fig 4), thus demonstrating that IFN acts by controlling A. muciniphila to worsen glucose tolerance in IFNKO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previous studies primarily linked A. muciniphila to glucose metabolism in obese mice26,27, we also tested its ability to improve glucose metabolism in lean wild-type mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, administration of A. muciniphila enhanced glucose tolerance in lean wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: A. muciniphila is required for IFN regulation of glucose tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Experimental scheme: A.

abundance of other microbes that could, in turn, alter glucose tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we performed analysis to identify microbes that are potentially regulated by A. muciniphila and have evidence to be related to glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified three microbial genera that showed different abundance after A. muciniphila colonization and correlation to glucose tolerance, including Akkermansia, (False discovery rate (FDR) less_than 0.1; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A. muciniphila presented the strongest and most significant correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these other microbes might be interesting areas of further study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also possible that IFN injection altered microbes in addition to A. muciniphila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore we performed a similar analysis as above, comparing taxa abundance before and after injection within IFNKO/Akkpos mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some minor trends of alteration of microbe abundance were observed, no genera except A. muciniphila were significantly altered by rIFN injection at FDR less_than 0.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, although we cannot rule out a role for other microbes in mediating glucose tolerance upon administration of A. muciniphila and following injection of rIFN, our analysis did not provide any plausible candidate that may play a role in glucose tolerance responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Irgm1 is a mediator of the effect of IFN on A. muciniphila', 'Now that we have established A. muciniphila as a main contributor to improved glucose tolerance in IFNKO mice, the question remained how IFN controls A. muciniphila levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN has a central role in orchestrating response to multiple gut microbes by driving different effector mechanisms28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify genes mediating effect of IFN on A. muciniphila, we employed a comprehensive approach by measuring global gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a first step of our analysis we searched for mouse genes whose expression is regulated by IFN in the ileum, but not dependent on the presence of A. muciniphila in the gut microbiota (that is, genes located downstream of IFN and upstream of A. muciniphila).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To detect these genes we compared ileal gene expression between wild-type, IFNKO/Akkneg and IFNKO/Akkpos mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

regulators were Stat1, Igtp, Tap1 and other genes representing the aforementioned immune pathways (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Often further investigation is focused on hub genes because of their potential probability to be master regulators of processes29,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, however, we were specifically interested in IFN-dependent genes positioned at the interface of the host gene regulatory network and A. muciniphila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To infer these genes, we again used causal inference analysis similar to that which was previously described for A. muciniphila discovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this analysis, we derived a ranking calculation that considered differential gene expression, correlation of each gene to A. muciniphila levels and peripheral-ness of a gene in the network (see Methods section for complete details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis revealed a few potential inhibitors of A. muciniphila, with Irgm1 being the top ranked candidate by this index (Fig 4c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next we tested the prediction of Irgm1 being an inhibitor of A. muciniphila by comparing abundance of this microbe between Irgm1 knockout mice (Irgm1KO) and control mice in two different mouse facilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, despite a large difference in overall A. muciniphila abundance between the two sites, Irgm1KO mice had increased abundance of this microbe compared with their corresponding wild-type controls (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate that this increase was due to the absence of Irgm1 and not a feedback loop altering IFN signalling overall, we examined global gene expression in the ileum of these mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, very few genes from our previously identified IFN-dependent network were significantly altered (Supplementary Data 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, IFN itself was not changed, nor were any of our top candidate A. muciniphila regulators from our previous network analysis (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these results corroborate our computational prediction that Irgm1 is a significant factor in regulation of A. muciniphila by IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  muciniphila relates to glucose and IFN in humans', 'A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  muciniphila is also a frequent resident of the human gut microbiome24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we took advantage of a cohort of subjects enrolled by Brazilian Advento Study Group to see if the relation between A. muciniphila and metabolism we observed in mice can be also found in human population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigations have recently related levels of A. muciniphila with diabetes and/or obesity25,32,33,34, however, several other metagenomic studies did not report an association between this bacterium and metabolic abnormalities in humans35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that multiple gut microbes besides A. muciniphila may influence glucose metabolism, we speculated that in cases where this microbe is at low levels, it is less likely to contribute considerably to the phenotype because other more abundant microbes would be stronger players.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To define biologically significant levels, we referred back to our IFNKO mice that presented negative correlation between A. muciniphila and fasting glucose levels (Fig 1f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance of A. muciniphila was  greater than 1% in the majority of those mice (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, from the total of 295 human subjects we selected those with abundance of A. muciniphila 1% (N=94).

=0.01, respectively) (Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used American Diabetes Association guidelines37,38 for classification of these subjects into three groups based on glycaemia status by fasting plasma glucose, 2 h plasma glucose (2-PG) and HbA1c and assessed A. muciniphila abundance in these groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individuals with normal glucose metabolism showed significantly higher A.

Therefore, we turned to another group of human subjects in whom we had measured global gene expression and A. muciniphila levels in duodenal biopsies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This group of subjects consisted of three subgroups including healthy volunteers, and two different groups of patients with common variable immunodeficiency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis showed a trend to a negative correlation (Pearson r0.3, P=0.127) between IFN gene expression and A. muciniphila levels (Fig 5d, top gene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we decided to analyse the human gene signature corresponding to mouse homologues we have defined as stimulated by IFN in the murine intestine (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Out of about 220 mouse genes, we found 162 human homologues with 141 of them being detectable in duodenal biopsies.

5d, test for one proportion P less_than 0.0001, Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, despite small sample sizes in each individual group, the combined analysis showed consistent negative

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our study has uncovered a missing link between IFN and glucose metabolism by demonstrating that a gut commensal, A. muciniphila, is a key microbe responsible for improved glucose tolerance observed in IFNKO mice (Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, two primary players that have been revealed to mediate the effect of IFN (Irgm1 and A. muciniphila) could not have been easily predicted based solely on the existing knowledge in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, the generation of testable hypotheses in both cases was mainly a result of causal inference involving trankingdom network analysis that we have recently developed (reviewed in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach has been previously successful in finding microbes and microbial genes that affect host phenotype15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the first time, however, when such strategy aided in prediction of host gene controlling a specific member of gut microbiota.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is well established that IFN is important for control of multiple, primarily intracellular, pathogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of this cytokine on gut microbiota, however, has not been explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using two methods (genetic deletion and blocking antibody) we revealed that multiple OTUs from commensal microbiota were affected by IFN (Fig 1, Supplementary Data 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following identification of IFN-regulated microbes, causal inference analysis allowed us to discern candidates relevant to the phenotype of interest (that is, glucose levels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then validated the prediction that A. muciniphila is a mediator of effect of IFN on glucose metabolism by colonizations of different hosts with A. muciniphila and reconstitution of IFNKO mice with recombinant IFN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altogether, the colonization of IFNKO and wild-type mice with A. muciniphila shows that that this bacterium can improve glucose metabolism (fasting glucose and glucose tolerance) in different hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cannot, however, make a definitive conclusion which other microbes might be required for its effect on glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although, in the current study we did not investigate which type of immune cells are of the source(s) IFN, intraepithelial T lymphocytes are the most plausible candidates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides their ability to produce IFN, intraepithelial T lymphocytes are the strongest responders among cells of adaptive immune system to changes in the microbiota15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This agrees with a recent study demonstrating that A. muciniphila levels are higher in mice deficient of T and B lymphocytes (Rag1KO) than in wild-type mice41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also inferred and validated a molecule downstream of IFN, Irgm1, as a regulator of A. muciniphila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Irgm1 has been previously implicated in the control of intracellular pathogens42,43, Irgm1KO mice also have Paneth cell abnormalities44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the secretion of antimicrobial proteins from Paneth cells is induced by IFN (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  45), we can speculate that Irgm1 may be a part of this signalling cascade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ultimately, impaired production of antimicrobial peptides in the gut of IFNKO mice may be a potential mechanism leading to outgrowth of A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  muciniphila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The second most favourable candidate among those identified as host genes-regulators of A. muciniphila is ubiquitin D (Ubd or FAT10; Fig 4c,d), Interestingly, disruption of Ubd in mice has been shown to improve glucose tolerance along with other metabolic parameters but the impact on gut microbiota has not been examined46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while we have shown that Irgm1 is a mediator of the effect of IFN on A. muciniphila, it is plausible that other IFN-dependent mechanisms may also contribute to this phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results from human subjects demonstrate that A. muciniphila regulation of metabolism may be an evolutionally conserved mechanism between mice and humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relevance of the trialogue (IFNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  muciniphilaglucose metabolism) to human health is further supported by evidence of increased levels of IFN producing cells in diabetes47,48 and decrease abundance of A. muciniphila25,32,33,34 in obese and diabetic patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, A. muciniphila levels have been recently demonstrated to negatively correlate with several inflammation markers associated with metabolic disease in mice49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results suggest that loss of this bacterium can be due to local immune activation in the gut during disease and that this loss has implications for systemic metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This topic warrants further investigation that should involve comprehensive evaluation of patients immune status including in intestinal tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings may also explain response of mice to metformin, the most widely used drug for type 2 diabetes, that was also shown to block IFN production50 and to increase levels of A. muciniphila in mice27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this particular mechanism might be different in mice and humans because neither our data (Supplementary Fig 6) nor other more comprehensive human studies51 found association between A. muciniphila and treatment with metformin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally our study revealed a new homeostatic regulatory process in mammalian organisms, where a member of different kingdom, A. muciniphila, constitutes an integral part of the interaction between the supposedly functionally distinct and distant systems of immunity and glucose metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our results and other published work in mouse models and human subjects suggest that this transkingdom interaction may be common in mammals25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the years, biologists have drawn boundaries between systems and kingdoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results highlight the fact that these boundaries must be crossed to fully understand the complexity of living organisms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
