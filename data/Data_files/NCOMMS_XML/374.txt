Therapeutic surfactant-stripped frozen micelles  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Injectable hydrophobic drugs are typically dissolved in surfactants and non-aqueous solvents which can induce negative side-effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatives like top-down fine milling of excipient-free injectable drug suspensions are not yet clinically viable and bottom-up self-assembled delivery systems usually substitute one solubilizing excipient for another, bringing new issues to consider.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that Pluronic (Poloxamer) block copolymers are amenable to low-temperature processing to strip away all free and loosely bound surfactant, leaving behind concentrated, kinetically frozen drug micelles containing minimal solubilizing excipient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach was validated for phylloquinone, cyclosporine, testosterone undecanoate, cabazitaxel and seven other bioactive molecules, achieving sizes between 45 and 160 nm and drug to solubilizer molar ratios 23 orders of magnitude higher than current formulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypertonic saline or co-loaded cargo was found to prevent aggregation in some cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Use of surfactant-stripped micelles avoided potential risks associated with other injectable formulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistic insights are elucidated and therapeutic dose responses are demonstrated.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Of over 2,000 approved drugs in 2015 in the DrugBank database1, 14% have predicted LogP values greater than 4, corresponding to very hydrophobic compounds which partition over 10,000 times more preferentially in octanol than in water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To administer these compounds by injection, dissolution is required, and water-based solutions avoid the risks of embolisms resulting from injection of oils2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on the hydrophobicity and chemical properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), injectable hydrophobic drugs are dissolved with a range of solubilizing excipients5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Non-ionic surfactants including Cremophor EL and Tween-80 are used in numerous clinical formulations but modulate drug behaviour and carry the risk of side-effects including anaphylactic shock and neurotoxicity6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One approach for injection of hydrophobic APIs involves top-down methods to reduce drug size into sub-micron particles via milling or pressure homogenization8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This practice has been successfully applied to orally administered medicines9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, injectable APIs must be strictly free from microbial contamination and such drug suspensions usually contain particles too large for sterile filtration, a preferred sterilization method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Suspensions tend to settle out of solution, presenting the possibility of inaccurate dosing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, administration of very large particles poses the risk of embolism11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the challenges facing top-down approaches, there has been interest in the development of nanoscale drug-delivery vehicles formed from bottom-up methods12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include nanocrystals15, liposomes16, albumin17, polymer nanoparticles18, micelles19 and cyclodextrins20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanocrystals yield the highest ratio of drug to excipient, but face the same impeding challenges as top-down approaches to injectable drug suspensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Emulsion-templated freeze drying techniques produce dry monoliths that can be smoothly dispersed in liquids for injection, but further research is ongoing to better develop into this methodology21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liposomal doxorubicin has been shown to reduce cardiotoxicity, although it is not necessarily more efficient than the free drug23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Albumin-bound paclitaxel has performed well in clinical trials24, but this may be attributed to higher dosing enabled by elimination of the solubilizing surfactant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, clinically viable nanoscale drug-delivery systems have become successful by addressing problems with current clinical formulations, as opposed to becoming a generalized vehicle for hydrophobic drug solubilization, a role that has arguably been assumed by non-ionic surfactants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Compared with the API itself, the excipient in nanoscale drug-delivery vehicles represents a substantially larger component of the total injected mass, particle size and molarity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systems that use too little solubilizing excipient generally cannot yield small and stable formulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liposomal formulations of doxorubicin can have drug to lipid mass ratios as high as 0.3:1, but are typically closer to 0.1:1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Polymeric nanoparticles usually have a similar range of drug to polymer mass ratios26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A drug-delivery system with a higher drug to excipient ratio could be useful as a generalized vehicle to solubilize hydrophobic drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would minimize side-effects of the vehicle itself and might also enable higher concentrations of drug to be used, which would be useful for situations in which drugs need to be administered in smaller volumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Micelles based on block copolymers, another type of surfactant, have been used for drug delivery and some Pluronic (Poloxamer, triblock copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO)), are approved excipients for pharmaceutical use27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pluronics have shown promise due to their high drug loading and self-assembly properties30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are commercially available at large scale, with varying poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(propylene oxide) block lengths and ratios, so that surfactant parameters can easily be varied31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, Pluronic is used together with hydrophobic drugs to develop surfactant-stripped induced frozen micelles (ss-InFroMs) as a new class of drug-delivery vehicles suitable for delivering a wide range of hydrophobic cargo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By lowering the temperature to modulate the critical micelle concentration of Pluronic, loose and free surfactant can be stripped away, leaving behind concentrated drug frozen micelles with extremely high drug-to-excipient ratios.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Surfactant-stripped induced frozen micelles (ss-InFroMs)', 'Pluronic F127 (F127) has a concentration-sensitive critical micellar temperature (CMT)33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach of modulating temperatures above and below Pluronic CMT was used to reversibly and thermochromically switch near infrared (NIR) dyes from nanoparticulate to microcrystalline form34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a hydrophobic NIR dye, 5,9,14,18,23,27,32,36-octabutoxy-2,3-naphthalocyanine (ONc), could form induced frozen micelles in aqueous solution using F127 (refs 35, 36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the temperature was lowered below the CMT, free and loose surfactant (without incorporated ONc) converted to unimeric form and could be removed by membrane filtration, leaving pure and highly concentrated frozen micelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if this phenomenon was unique to Pluronics, ONc was solubilized with other common surfactants (10% w/v aqueous solutions) including Tween, Cremophor, Tergitol, and Brij.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10% Pluronic corresponds to a concentration above the CMC but avoids formation of mesophase structures that would induce additional complexity in the self-assembly process (see Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When subjected to low temperature centrifugal filtration, only Pluronic enabled free surfactant removal, yet retention and concentration of the cargo (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other surfactants were not suitable likely because they could not induce the formation of kinetically frozen micelles or because they were not amenable to CMC-switching for low-temperature surfactant removal and the resulting increase in cargo concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Surfactant-stripped induced frozen micelles (ss-InFroMs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

'Having established Pluronic as possibly the only broadly-available biocompatible surfactant suitable for generating ss-InFroMs, we examined if these could also be generated from therapeutic molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phylloquinone (vitamin K1, VK1) is administered clinically to both neonates and warfarin-overdosed patients to prevent or correct deficient blood clotting and has a similar hydrophobicity as ONc (predicted LogP of 8.5 for VK1 and 9.3 for ONc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following dissolution in a 10% w/v F127 aqueous solution, the temperature of the VK1 solution was lowered to 4 °C, and the vast majority of F127 could be selectively stripped away using diafiltration, leaving behind pure and concentrated VK1 ss-InFroMs (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmission electron microscopy showed that ss-InFroMs formed 70 nm diameter spherical particles (Fig 1c), consistent with dynamic light scattering (DLS), which showed that no significant size change occurred during storage (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of our recently reported geometric calculation estimates35, each 70 nm particle contained 1.8 × 105 VK1 molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Powder diffraction analysis of freeze-dried ss-InFroMs did not reveal any crystallinity, suggesting an unorganized stacking of VK1 in hydrophobic nano-phased pockets within the ss-InFroMs (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to probe the interactions between hydrophobic cargo and F127.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with a 10% F127 aqueous solution containing pristine micelles, the addition of VK1 to a 10% F127 solution resulted in a 30% decrease in micellization enthalpy during heating and cooling cycles (Fig 1d and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the majority of the F127 behaved thermodynamically similarly to free micelles following VK1 addition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, following surfactant stripping, ss-InFroMs exhibited no detectable micellization energy change, since all free F127 was removed and the micelles were kinetically frozen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When purified ss-InFroMs were diluted back into a 10% F127 solution, micellization energy returned to characteristic levels of the pre-washed VK1 samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that ss-InFroMs attract some free surfactant as a loosely bound F127 layer surrounding a core of tightly bound F127 and VK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DSC cooling curves (corresponding to unimerization) were broader than the heating curves (corresponding to micellization), whereas F127 alone exhibited fully reversible heat flow (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be explained by the equilibrium between loosely bound F127 and free F127, which makes it possible to remove the loosely bound layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A schematic process of the proposed CMC switching and washing process is illustrated in Supplementary Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) VK1 reporter system was developed to study hydrophobic cargo exchange using the donor dye 2,9,16,23-tetra-tert-butyl-29H-31H-phthalocyanine (BPc), which has similar hydrophobicity to VK1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When solubilized alone with F127, BPc was non-fluorescent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when loaded at 1% together with 99% VK1, BPc became highly fluorescent with altered spectral properties, due to reduction in homoaggregation-induced quenching (Supplementary Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BPc-doped VK1 InFroMs (since these particular micelles were not stripped of surfactant, we refer to them as InFroMs, as opposed to ss-InFroMs) were used as a donor to VK1 InFroMs doped with a FRET acceptor, Zinc-2,11,20,29-tetra-tert-butyl-2,3-naphthalocyanine (ZnBNc), another hydrophobic dye which has good absorption spectral overlap with BPc emission (Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When donor and acceptor dyes were pre-mixed by dissolving them with VK1 in a single methylene chloride (DCM) solution followed by dropwise addition into F127 to generate InFroMs, strong FRET was observed as evidenced by an 80% decrease in donor emission (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when donor and acceptor micelles were combined after formation, no appreciable energy transfer occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even following surfactant stripping and 2 weeks later, the same lack of cargo exchange was observed, demonstrating a strongly kinetically frozen nature of InFroMs (Fig 1e and Supplementary Fig 5d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NMR experiments were conducted to gain insights on how InFroMs change following surfactant-stripping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diffusion coefficients of VK1 protons within InFroMs were 3 orders of magnitude lower than those of freely rotating small molecules (typically in the range of 109 m2 s1), as expected for drugs incorporated in micelles (Supplementary Fig 6a, 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following surfactant stripping, the viscosity-corrected diffusion coefficient of VK1 decreased further (Supplementary Fig 6a, 6b), as removal of excess F127 enabled drugs to become more locked within micelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the pre-wash sample, additional peaks besides those characteristic of F127 and VK1 were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small peaks at 8.1, 6.4, 6.0, 5.2 and 4.2 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in the pre-wash VK1 sample were observed which may originate from a small proportion of VK1 only loosely bound to F127.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The diffusion coefficients of those smaller peaks were greater than the diffusion coefficients of the major peaks of VK1, presumably tightly bound to F127.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The small peaks likely correspond to small proportion of more rapidly diffusing, peripherally bound VK1 in equilibrium with VK1 in the core of the micelle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These peaks disappeared after surfactant-stripping, suggesting that the loosely bound VK1 was driven deeply into the frozen micelles as excess surfactant was removed (Supplementary Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correlation spectroscopy (COSY) conclusively confirmed that the small peaks observed were from VK1, and not other impurities (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of NMR peak analysis, diafiltration-based surfactant stripping resulted in a final drug to solubilizer (VK1:F127) molar ratio of over 50:1 (Fig 1f and Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is orders of magnitude greater than mixed micelle and Tween-80 formulations of VK1 that have been used clinically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VK1 ss-InFroMs could also be generated with Pluronic F68 in a similar manner (Supplementary Fig 9a), achieving a VK1:F68 molar ratio of 25 (Supplementary Fig 9b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Powder diffraction analysis did not reveal any crystallinity in F68 VK1 ss-InFroMs, suggesting VK1 was dispersed similarly to F127 ss-InFroMs (Supplementary Fig 9c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The removal of excess surfactant not only enabled high drug to surfactant ratios, but also enabled VK1 concentration to unusually high levels (150 mg ml1, see Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be potentially be useful for applications where limited injection volumes are preferred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large excess of F127 used before surfactant stripping was found to be essential, since when VK1 was simply directly dissolved with the same molar ratio of 50:1 VK1:F127 and sonicated, drug solubilization was ineffective (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Having a concentrated drug solution could be useful for administration of low volumes of API.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the surfactant Tween-80 could also dissolve VK1 at a high concentration (100 mg ml1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The haemolytic activity of these two solubilization systems was examined in fresh human red blood cells to examine side effects of a potential high API concentration, low injection volume approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1g, no appreciable human erythrocyte damage was induced by VK1 ss-InFroMs whereas the Tween-80 induced haemolysis, due to surfactant action of lysing membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Properties of ss-InFroMs formed from diverse biologically active cargo.Full size table', 'VK1 ss-InFroMs were assessed for countering the effects of warfarin in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following intravenous administration, VK1 ss-InFroMs exhibited a circulating half-life of 6.7 h (Supplementary Fig 11), showing that they were not rapidly cleared from the blood, as would be the case for pure drug suspensions with large particle size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, mice were exposed to warfarin for 24 h and then were administered VK1 ss-InFroMs via intravenous injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1h, VK1 ss-InFroMs rescued mice from warfarin-induced blood clotting inhibition in a dose-dependent manner, with efficacy in the same general range as previous reports using conventionally solubilized VK1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in mice, VK1 ss-InFroMs became bioavailable in vivo and provided good efficacy without observable adverse side-effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hypertonic saline to enhance generation of ss-InFroMs', 'Whereas VK1 and ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, readily formed ss-InFroMs in water with F127 (see Table 1), initial experimentation with other drugs such as cyclosporine A (CsA) did not yield positive results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CsA is an immunosuppressive cyclic peptide commonly administered orally and intravenously used to prevent transplant rejection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ivermectin and CsA have similar LogP values of 4.4 and 4.1, respectively, both lower than VK1, which has a LogP value of 8.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, due to other chemical properties, ivermectin, but not CsA could partition favorably into F127 micelles and avoid aggregation during surfactant stripping in deionized water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this problem for CsA, hypertonic saline was investigated as a means to improve micelle stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With addition of 3 M sodium chloride, CsA ss-InFroMs were able to form stable nanoparticles following surfactant-stripping (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this is a high concentration of salt, current intravenous drug administration usually involves dilution of a drug concentrate before administration, so using this approach would convert the hypertonic saline to physiological levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presumably, the salt makes the solution more polar, resulting in more stable partitioning of the hydrophobic cargo into the frozen micelle core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only does salt impact micellization38, it also lowers the CMC, thereby making the surfactant F127 stripping process from CsA ineffective at 4 °C (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since salt also depresses the freezing point of water, subzero temperatures could be used to remove F127 from CsA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting CsA ss-InFroMs had a diameter of 100 nm and were stable for over 2 weeks, based on DLS measurement (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like VK1, the CsA molar ratio in ss-InFroMs was orders of magnitude higher than existing clinical formulations (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Pluronic F68 could not form InFroMs even with hypertonic saline (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might be due to the substantially decreased hydrophobic PPO block length ( less_than 50%), and an order of magnitude higher CMC compared with F127 (Supplementary Table 1), leading to weaker micellar hydrophobic interactions that did not sufficiently drive association of the drug with the Pluronic F68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When CsA ss-InFroMs were administered to mice before injection of immunogenic sheep red blood cells, they safely and effectively inhibited the immune system IgM response in a dose dependent manner, as expected for an immunosuppressive drug (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2:

hypertonic saline was used (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To strip excess F127 from T-undec InFroMs in 4 M sodium chloride, diafiltration was conducted at 16 °C using a custom-built propylene glycol and dry ice submersion bath.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excess F127 was removed effectively (over 85% of the starting F127) by low temperature washing, resulting in T-undec ss-InFroMs, with a size of 110 nm (Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The T-undec to excipient molar ratio in ss-InFroMs was over 30 times higher considering that the oil used in current formulation is an excipient itself (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oil is commonly and safely used for intramuscular administration of steroidal compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, microembolisms can occur with accidental injection into veins or translocation of oil into the circulatory system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the capability of ss-InFroMs to bypass this issue, T-undec ss-InFroMs were formed with 2% fluorescent BPc doped as a detection probe, as that amount of BPc yielded the highest fluorescence signal (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shortly following intravenous injection, no significant fluorescence was detected from extracted organs (Fig 2g) as most of the ss-InFroMs remained in circulation (Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the castor oil formulation using the same amount of BPc demonstrated accumulation in the lungs, likely due to the formation of microemboli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high injectable drug concentrations achieved with ss-InFroMs could enable new parenteral dosing routes for hydrophobic compounds that have been limited largely to intramuscularly administration in oil.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Castrated mice that were treated subcutaneously with T-undec ss-InFroMs exhibited a dose response in their testosterone levels which could reach similar levels to non-castrated mice (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cargo co-loading to enhance generation of ss-InFroMs', 'The taxane family is used as frontline chemotherapy for numerous cancer indications and there is interest in developing novel and stable taxane formulations39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As taxanes are administered intravenously in rather large doses (that is, 100 s of mgs), high amounts of Cremophor or Tween-80 and ethanol (up to 25 ml each) are usually used to dissolve the drug and are co-administered to patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial attempts at dissolving taxanes in F127, even in hypertonic saline, yielded formulations that were prone to aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this problem, we developed a hypertonic saline strategy together with cargo co-loading to generate ss-InFroMs formed from cabazitaxel (CTX), a third generation taxane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 10mgmL1, CTX could not be solubilized in F127 without hypertonic saline (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, since hypertonic saline must be diluted before intravenous administration, an additional obstacle encountered was that, following dilution in plain water, CTX rapidly aggregated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that addition of a co-loaded cargo might slow or prevent this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), a naturally occurring and abundant hydrophobic vitamin found in the mitochondria inner membrane, was co-loaded with CTX in F127 micelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3b, with a CTX:CoQ mass ratio of 10:2, no appreciable precipitation of CTX occurred in 6 h following dilution in water, whereas without CoQ co-loading, 40% of the CTX precipitated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This period would be sufficient to administer the drug via infusion to the patient.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The kinetics of precipitation are shown in Supplementary Fig 18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within InFroMs, CoQ likely interferes with those intermolecular CTX interactions which lead to aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The salt-assisted co-loading method was also applied to other taxanes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CoQ and another non-toxic co-loading

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Pluronic block copolymers, but not other surfactants, were able to generate induced frozen micelles with sufficiently hydrophobic cargo that could be subjected to CMC-switching and surfactant stripping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach enables unusually high drug to excipient molar ratios and drug concentrations, with the hydrophobic cargo remaining in a stable core with minimal inter-micellar exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Minimizing the amount of excipient not only holds potential to enable higher dosing due to reduced adverse side-effects but also minimizes unexpected carrier effects that can modulate drug function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high concentration of drugs achievable with ss-InFroMs could be useful for specific applications where low volumes are desired, such as topical drug delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In several cases, ss-InFroM formation could be assisted with hypertonic saline and hydrophobic cargo co-loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chemical properties which determine whether or not APIs will or will not be suitable for ss-InFroM formation have yet to be determined, although less hydrophobic compounds (for example, LogP less_than 3) have not yet been found that are suitable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work is also required to characterize the long term stability of ss-InFroMs and to see if they are amenable to lyophilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the data presented here show that ss-InFroMs represent a safe, accessible and generalizable material for formulating hydrophobic APIs with minimal excipient.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
