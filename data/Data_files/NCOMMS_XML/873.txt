P113 is a merozoite surface protein that binds the N terminus of Plasmodium falciparum RH5  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites is necessary for malaria pathogenesis and is therefore a primary target for vaccine development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RH5 is a leading subunit vaccine candidate because anti-RH5 antibodies inhibit parasite growth and the interaction with its erythrocyte receptor basigin is essential for invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RH5 is secreted, complexes with other parasite proteins including CyRPA and RIPR, and contains a conserved N-terminal region (RH5Nt) of unknown function that is cleaved from the native protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we identify P113 as a merozoite surface protein that directly interacts with RH5Nt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using recombinant proteins and a sensitive protein interaction assay, we establish the binding interdependencies of all the other known RH5 complex components and conclude that the RH5Nt-P113 interaction provides a releasable mechanism for anchoring RH5 to the merozoite surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exploit these findings to design a chemically synthesized peptide corresponding to RH5Nt, which could contribute to a cost-effective malaria vaccine.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Malaria is a deadly infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites which is responsible for up to one million deaths annually, primarily in young children living in sub-Saharan Africa1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Malaria symptoms result from the blood stages of P. falciparum infections when a form of the parasite called the merozoite recognizes and invades host erythrocytes where it replicates asexually2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since invasion is an essential and extracellular step in the parasite lifecycle, it may be targeted by vaccine-induced antibodies3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After initial recognition of the host erythrocyte, the pear-shaped merozoite orientates itself so that its apical protuberance is in direct apposition to the host membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This triggers the subsequent release of parasite invasion ligands from intracellular secretory organelles including the micronemes and rhoptries3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An electron-dense nexus between the host and parasite membranes is formed which opens out into a ring-like moving junction which envelops the merozoite, finally resealing behind it, such that the parasite is completely internalized within an intraerythrocytic parasitophorous vacuole5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The whole process is rapid, taking just a few seconds6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The biochemical interactions involved in invasion are being identified, and their roles in each of these steps determined4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular current interest is the interaction between the parasite reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 (RH5) and its erythrocyte receptor, basigin7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RH5 was first identified by searching the P. falciparum genome sequence for homology with the sequences of other RH family members, and the inability to select RH5-deficient parasites in vitro suggested it was required for blood-stage growth8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of RH5 as an invasion ligand was established by the identification of basigin as its erythrocyte receptor, and the demonstration that the RH5-basigin interaction was both essential and universally required for invasion9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RH5 is detected within the rhoptries of merozoites, relocating to the moving junction during invasion8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Live imaging in the presence of fluorescent calcium-sensitive dyes and RH5-basigin interaction antagonists revealed that merozoites could still adhere and deform erythrocytes leading to the conclusion that the RH5-basigin interaction was necessary for, and directly preceded, rhoptry release just before the formation of the moving junction4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein sequence of RH5 is conserved between strains10, can elicit antibodies that inhibit parasite growth in vitro11,12,13,14, and RH5-based vaccines are protective in a non-human primate P. falciparum infection model15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These properties of RH5 have made a deeper understanding of its mechanism of action a priority but many basic questions remain unanswered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the lack of any obvious protein sequence feature for anchoring RH5 to a membrane suggests the existence of another mechanism for tethering RH5 to the merozoite surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, RH5 is detected in parasite culture supernatants as both full length (RH5FL, 63kDa) and processed (RH5Ct, 45 kDa) forms but the function of this processing is unknown8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptide sequencing of purified recombinant RH5 and anti-RH5 antibodies with known epitope locations revealed that RH5Ct lacks the N-terminal region (RH5Nt), which is predicted to be disordered8,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RH5Ct folds into a kite-like shape19,20 and contains a small (1,500 Å2) binding interface for basigin, consistent with the low interaction affinity (KD 1 M)9, leaving much of its solvent-exposed surface available for simultaneous binding with other proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Size separation of parasite proteins from culture supernatants by gel filtration revealed that RH5 is part of a larger (200 kDa) complex, that includes two other parasite proteins: RIPR (RH5 interacting protein)16 and CyRPA (cysteine-rich protective antigen)21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both RIPR and CyRPA are predicted to be secreted proteins16,22 (although see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  21) which suggests that they do not tether RH5 to the merozoite surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these proteins were identified from bulk parasite extracts as purified complexes, we do not know whether RIPR and CyRPA bind RH5 directly, nor whether they interact in a mutually exclusive fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One further intriguing and unanswered question in relation to the function of RH5 is the role of its N terminus (RH5Nt), which is absent from the processed form of RH5 detected in parasite culture supernatants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region is predicted to be highly disordered and flexible, to such a degree that it was purposefully removed to promote crystal formation for structural studies19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this, RH5Nt is particularly well conserved with just a single non-synonymous polymorphism described at very low frequency ( less_than 1%) in African isolates13, and contains the epitope for a potent invasion-blocking monoclonal antibody18 demonstrating RH5Nt has an important role in RH5 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use a sensitive assay that detects interactions between recombinant proteins to show that the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein P113 interacts directly with the N terminus of unprocessed RH5, providing a mechanism by which the RH5 invasion complex is tethered to the merozoite surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We additionally determine the binding interdependencies between the individual components of the RH5-basigin invasion complex, which, together with RH5 processing, suggests the existence of a one-way switching mechanism that releases the RH5 complex from the merozoite surface during erythrocyte invasion by P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  falciparum.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The N terminus of RH5 has no role in basigin binding', 'The Plasmodium falciparum RH5 protein is detected as full length and processed forms in both parasite culture supernatants and when expressed recombinantly in either mammalian13 or insect cells20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the sites of processing when expressed in mammalian cells, RH5 was purified, resolved as four bands by SDSPAGE, and the N terminus of each determined by Edman protein sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major band (RH5Ct) was consistent with the main processed form of RH5 observed in parasite supernatants (Fig 1a) and its N terminus is close (14 amino acids C-terminal) to the cleavage site observed when RH5 is expressed in insect cells20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest band matched the expected mass of the full-length unprocessed protein (RH5FL) and this was confirmed by protein sequencing (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine which of the processed forms were able to interact with the basigin receptor, we made recombinant forms of RH5 corresponding to each of these fragments and tested their ability to bind basigin using a protein interaction assay designed to detect low-affinity extracellular protein interactions called AVEXIS (for AVidity-based EXtracellular protein Interaction Screen23) (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the co-crystal structure of RH5 with its receptor, we observed that RH5Ct bound basigin, whereas RH5Nt did not (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to show that RH5Ct bound with similar binding parameters to the full-length RH5 protein9 (Supplementary Table 1; Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of RH5 does not play a direct role in basigin binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The N-terminal domain of RH5 is not involved in basigin binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Purified tagged recombinant RH5 expressed by HEK293 cells resolved as four species by SDSPAGE under reducing conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N-terminal sequence of each species was determined by Edman degradation and is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The N-terminal region of RH5 is not involved in basigin binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The indicated RH5 fragments were expressed as biotinylated bait proteins and probed for interactions with a highly avid -lactamase-tagged basigin prey protein using the AVEXIS assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full length (FL) and the major processed form (RH5Ct) of RH5 bound basigin but the N-terminal region (RH5Nt) did not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bars represent means±95% confidence intervals;

no interactions with either RIPR or CyRPA were detected (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P113 was initially discovered in a study designed to identify GPI-anchored merozoite proteins by purifying detergent-resistant membrane proteins from mature blood-stage parasites26, and was subsequently found to be one of the most abundant proteins isolated from high molecular mass complexes on the merozoite27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P113 has been detected at other stages of the lifecycle including the sporozoite28 and gametocyte29, and the inability to select P113-deficient parasites suggests that it is essential for blood-stage growth2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An informative and rapid validation test for interactions detected using the AVEXIS approach is to determine whether the interaction is dependent on the bait-prey orientation23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To establish this, we expressed the entire ectodomain of P113 as an avid prey, and showed that it could interact with both RH5Nt and RH5FL, but not RH5Ct (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrated this interaction by showing that RH5Nt but not control RH5Ct-coated beads could purify native P113 from parasite culture lysates (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using antibodies against P113, we could show that it is expressed in early and late-stage schizonts and on the surface of free merozoites by co-staining with the established merozoite surface markers MSP9 (Fig 2d) and MSP1 (Supplementary Fig1a), findings that are consistent with an independent study30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies to P113, unlike those to a marker of the inner membrane complex (MTIP), stained both permeabilized and unpermeabilized merozoites demonstrating P113 is surface localized (Supplementary Fig1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data identify P113 as an RH5 interacting partner at the merozoite surface and a new member of the RH5 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: The N-terminal domain of RH5 interacts with the merozoite surface protein P113.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The N-terminal domain of RH5 (RH5Nt, F1-K116) was expressed as a pentameric, -lactamase-tagged prey protein and systematically tested for interactions against a library of recombinant P. falciparum merozoite receptor ectodomains and secreted bait proteins using the AVEXIS assay;

another component to the RH5 invasion complex that is known to include the merozoite proteins CyRPA21 and RIPR16, which both co-immunoprecipitate with RH5 from parasite supernatants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying protein complexes using this method does not immediately establish which proteins directly interact with each other, nor whether the components can bind simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these questions, we used our collection of recombinant P. falciparum merozoite proteins expressed in mammalian cells24,25 together with the AVEXIS assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, we have shown that direct binary interactions can be detected using this approach between RH5FL/Ct and basigin (Fig 1b and9) as well as RH5FL/Nt and P113 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Screening the merozoite

components of the complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first established that a basigin prey could be captured by a P113 bait by adding increasing concentrations of purified monomeric RH5FL, but not RH5Ct or

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'RH5 is a strong candidate for inclusion in a malaria vaccine because it is susceptible to vaccine-elicited antibodies and its interaction with the basigin receptor is essential for invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that RH5 interacts with both host and parasite proteins has led to a model whereby RH5 functions as a central organizing component of a protein complex formed at the nexus of the merozoiteerythrocyte interface that triggers further rhoptry release and the formation of an open connection through which other invasion proteins can be delivered to establish the moving junction4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One missing component of this model is a molecular explanation for how the secreted RH5 protein is localized to the merozoite surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use a library of recombinant proteins and a sensitive assay designed to detect low-affinity extracellular interactions to identify the GPI-anchored merozoite surface protein P113 as a direct interacting partner of RH5 which could provide such a tethering mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that the P113 interaction site on RH5 lies within the N terminus of RH5a region which is absent from the major form of RH5 that is detected in parasite culture supernatants, and therefore provides a regulatory mechanism by which RH5 could be released from the merozoite surface during invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, by using individual components of the RH5 complex, we have determined that not all constituents of the RH5 complex can interact simultaneously, again suggesting that there is an ordered schedule of protein interactions that could delineate separable molecular events during invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding the contributions described here into a broader context compiled from many other researchers suggests the following model (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: A model describing the role of the RH5 complex and its interaction with P113 during erythrocyte invasion.Before invasion, the different components of the RH5 invasion complex are segregated within different subcellular locations of the merozoite and therefore purposefully prevented from interacting: RH5 is located in the rhoptries, CyRPA and RIPR in the micronemes, and P113 on the surface of the merozoite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following engagement of the erythrocyte and release of the rhoptry contents, RH5 is tethered via its N-terminal region at the merozoite membrane by the surface-localized multimeric P113, enabling direct presentation to the basigin receptor on the erythrocyte surface and leading to the formation of an open connection for other invasion ligands to be secreted (1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AMA1/RON complex initiates the formation of the moving junction (2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The localized secretion of CyRPA and RIPR from the micronemes leads to the formation of the RH5-CyRPA-RIPR-basigin invasion complex which, either because of the cleavage of RH5 to remove the N-terminal region, and/or because P113 and RIPR cannot simultaneously bind the RH5 complex would release RH5 from the P113 tether at the merozoite surface to licence invasion (3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P113-RH5 complex would therefore only be fleetingly formed during the rapid invasion process resulting in a soluble post-invasion RH5Ct-CyRPA-RIPR complex.Full size image', 'Proteomics studies of P. falciparum blood-stage membrane preparations have shown that P113 is GPI-anchored and one of the most abundant proteins constitutively present on the merozoite surface26,27,38, which we show here is likely to be clustered on the surface as tetramers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are few studies on P. falciparum P113, but antibody responses against P113 have been shown to be associated with protection from malaria in study cohorts from both Africa39 and Papua New Guinea40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it is unclear precisely when RH5 is proteolytically cleaved during the rapid invasion process, it is tempting to speculate that at least a proportion of RH5 is released from rhoptries as an unprocessed full length form and confined to the merozoite surface via direct interactions between its N-terminal region and P113 with a relatively high (KD=0.3 M) binding affinity; the clustering of P113 may be important for increasing local binding avidity for RH5FL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show here that RH5FL can simultaneously bind P113 and basigin through the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively, so that it is molecularly possible for RH5 to bridge the merozoite and erythrocyte membranes through these interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P113-RH5-basigin complex may then trigger secretion of other parasite ligands including the AMA1/RON complex which lead to the formation of the moving junction4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have established here that the secreted CyRPA protein can bind RH5 within the P113-RH5-basigin complex, and because we could detect direct interactions between RIPR and CyRPA but not RH5, CyRPA may perform the role of recruiting RIPR to the RH5 complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide two possible mechanisms for RH5 complex release from P113 at the merozoite surface: (1) the proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal region of RH5; and (2) the mutually exclusive binding of RIPR and P113 to the RH5 complex, which suggests that the recruitment of RIPR to the complex would allow its release from the merozoite surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we suggest that at the moment of invasion, RH5 is locally concentrated and presented to the basigin receptor at the site of contact between the merozoite and erythrocyte through interactions with surface localized P113.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of the CyRPA and RIPR proteins to RH5 may act as a one-way switch to licence the next step of the invasion process by releasing the RH5 complex from the surface-tethered P113 due to the mutually exclusive binding of RIPR and P113 in the RH5 complex, and/or recruitment of a protease that cleaves the N-terminal region of RH5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identification of the protease/s responsible for RH5 cleavage will be an important step in understanding the function of the RH5 invasion complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whilst the observation that aprotinin can reduce RH5 processing suggests the involvement of a serine protease, RH5 is not a predicted or experimentally validated substrate of the well-characterized parasite blood-stage serine proteases, the subtilisins including SUB131.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One intriguing evolutionary puzzle is that clearly identifiable orthologues of each component of the RH5 complex do not necessarily co-occur in the genomes of different Plasmodium species: orthologues of both P113 and RIPR are found across Plasmodium species that infect both primates and rodents; CyRPA orthologues are present in primate, but not the rodent parasites; and RH5 is further restricted to a subset of the primate parasites closely related to P. falciparum within the subgenus Laverania.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most likely, the proteins encoded by these genes perform different roles in these species but have been co-opted by P. falciparum together with the evolution of the RH5 protein for their roles in invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional studies in P. berghei, for example, have shown that P113-deficient parasites could complete their lifecycle, but had lower numbers of parasites making the transition from sporozoites to the liver-stage form41; and, more recently, P113 has been shown to be a peripheral member of the PTEX translocation machinery which is conserved across Plasmodium spp.42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we show that a linear peptide corresponding to the N terminus of RH5 retains the functional ability to bind P113 and, importantly, could elicit antibodies that inhibit parasite growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is of interest because peptides can be synthesized at scale and are chemically definedboth relevant considerations for the production of a vaccine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent and continuing developments in adjuvant-enhancement of peptides to safely elicit high-titre antibody responses such as the use of albumin-binding amphiphilic molecular groups may present new opportunities in the development of cost-effective vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An affordable and highly effective malaria vaccine would undoubtedly be an important control measure to improve the lives of the billions of people who live at risk of this deadly infectious disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
