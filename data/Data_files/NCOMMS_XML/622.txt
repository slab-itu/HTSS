Interaction between prion protein and toxic amyloid  assemblies can be therapeutically targeted at multiple sites  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
"A role for PrP in the toxic effect of oligomeric forms of A, implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been suggested but remains controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that PrP is required for the plasticity-impairing effects of ex vivo material from human AD brain and that standardized A-derived diffusible ligand (ADDL) preparations disrupt hippocampal synaptic plasticity in a PrP-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We screened a panel of anti-PrP antibodies for their ability to disrupt the ADDLPrP interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies directed to the principal PrP/A-binding site and to PrP helix-1, were able to block A binding to PrP suggesting that the toxic A species are of relatively high molecular mass and/or may bind multiple PrP molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two representative and extensively characterized monoclonal antibodies directed to these regions, ICSM-35 and ICSM-18, were shown to block the A-mediated disruption of synaptic plasticity validating these antibodies as candidate therapeutics for AD either individually or in combination."  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
"Soluble non-fibrillar forms of amyloid -protein (A) have been implicated in, and shown to correlate with, disease progression in animal models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and patients with AD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low nanomolar concentrations of synthetic A are known to disrupt synaptic plasticity in vivo and in vitro, but the conformation and size of the A species responsible remain unclear2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has recently been reported that the prion protein (PrPC) can function as a cellular receptor for a preparation of synthetic A referred to as A-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs) and that PrPC is required for the disruption of synaptic plasticity mediated by ADDLs6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanomolar affinity of binding has been reported7,8,9 and a single anti-PrP monoclonal antibody with an epitope around residues 95105 blocked ADDL binding and toxicity6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In further studies, constitutive knockout of PrPC expression reversed several pathological phenotypes in a mouse model of AD10 as did peripheral treatment of the same mouse model with an anti-PrP antibody11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'If confirmed, such a finding is of considerable importance given the extensive investigation of targeting PrPC for prion disease therapeutics12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the abolition of neuronal PrP expression in the adult murine nervous system is without serious consequence13,14 and both small molecule12 and monoclonal antibody therapeutics15 have been extensively studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed therapeutic molecular interactions with PrPC have been characterized and fully humanized anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies have been produced for clinical studies in human prion disease16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, a number of groups have since reported deleterious effects of A that do not require PrP expression7,8,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, it is important to recognize that a range of different A preparations have been used and that this may in part explain some of the conflicting reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, discrepancies between animal, tissue, cellular and biochemical AD models with respect to a possible role for PrPC are to be anticipated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AD is a heterogeneous disease and perhaps better considered to be a clinicopathological syndrome with multiple genetic and environmental factors involved in its aetiology and progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The many reported animal models of AD each recapitulate only part of this syndrome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if PrPC is indeed an important receptor for toxic A species, it would not be reasonable to expect PrPC ablation to rescue all aspects of pathology in each model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, given that the concentration of the active species is not known and may differ between studies by different groups some effects may be due to higher A concentrations, which could elicit nonspecific toxic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first sought to repeat the studies of Laurén et al.6 on synaptic plasticity, using congenic wild-type and PrP null lines, to confirm the PrP-dependence of the toxicity of our ADDLs and to characterize the putative PrP:A interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the poor characterization and variable toxicity of different A preparations, we were careful to use only formulations which caused impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) and conformed to defined biophysical criteria consistent with previous descriptions of ADDLs3,6,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as it is unclear whether A species similar to those found in ADDL preparations are present in human brain, we considered it essential to also determine if PrPC was required for the synaptic plasticity-impairing effects of AD brain-derived A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thereafter, we proceeded to further studies aimed at characterization of the putative therapeutic target and approaches to block PrP:A interaction and its effects on synaptic plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We confirmed that well-characterized ADDL preparations inhibit LTP in a PrP-dependent manner and that the block of LTP mediated by the most disease-relevant form of A, A extracted from AD brain, requires expression of PrP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also report the development of a high-throughput screen, which allowed us to identify antibodies that recognize certain epitopes contained both within and outside the previously characterized A:PrP-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, antibodies to helix-1 of PrP, prevented ADDL binding to PrP and the block of LTP mediated by both ADDLs and AD brain-derived A.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Characterization of reproducible preparations of ADDLs', 'We used a standardized procedure to generate ADDL preparations from A142 or bADDL preparations from biotinylated A142 (bA142) and then assessed the consistency of the species produced using a battery of biophysical tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both unmodified and biotinylated A were used to confirm that biotinylation did not fundamentally alter the properties of the oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using three different running buffers showed that both ADDLs and bADDLs had highly similar profiles producing two prominent peaks (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first peak eluted in the void volume and the second eluted in a volume consistent for A monomer20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, both peaks had trailing and leading shoulders suggesting the presence of low abundance oligomers intermediate in size between A monomer and the void material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the limited size resolution of SEC, and the possibility of forming artefacts owing to non-ideal interactions with the column, we also analysed our bADDL preparations using a solution-based technique, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sedimentation of bADDLs occurred in two distinct phases containing 60 and 40% of the material, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The initial sedimentation contained a mixture of species with calculated masses ranging from 90 to 400,000 and accounted for around 60% of the peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slowly sedimenting portion contained a single species with calculated molecular weight of 56,000 close to the value expected for monomeric, biotinylated A peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the SEC results, the AUC data confirm that bADDL preparations are heterogeneous and include A monomer, small amounts of low n-oligomers and species with calculated masses  greater than 90,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noteworthy that in all samples tested bADDL preparations contained slightly greater amounts of high-molecular-weight species than did ADDLs (Fig 1a; Supplementary Fig S1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with other biophysical assessments, negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) confirmed that ADDL and bADDL preparations contained a mixture of different sized species, ranging from globular structures of 812 nm diameter and flexible rods of 1560 nm in length and 510 nm diameter (Fig 1c,d; Supplementary Fig S2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These structures are reminiscent of those detected by Laurén et al.6, but are in contrast to the entirely globular structures observed by Chen et al.9 and Balducci et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  when prepared using simple phosphate buffer7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The species detected by SEC, AUC and EM were SDS-labile and migrated on SDSPAGE predominantly as monomer (Fig 1e,f), however, a small amount of higher molecular weight A species were detected if samples were not boiled before SDSPAGE and proteins visualized by western blotting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a major factor which we have found to influence production of ADDL preparations of consistent composition is the effective solubilization of hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP)-treated A, we used SDSPAGE and silver staining as a simple means to measure the total amount of A present in all our ADDL preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experiments revealed that the actual concentration of total A in our ADDL preparations varied between 70 to 90 M (based on the molecular weight of A monomer), less than the 100 M concentration based on the starting amount of A used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 1: Biophysical characterization of A species present in the bADDL preparation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Size-exclusion chromatography of two different

characterize our bADDL and ADDL preparations, we sought to assess their effect on synaptic plasticity and to determine whether this effect required expression of PrP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, both our bADDL and ADDL preparations significantly inhibited LTP in hippocampal slices from wild-type FVB/N and C57Bl/6J mice (P less_than 0.01, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Fig 2a; Supplementary Fig S3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using an FVB/N congenic PrP null mouse line we next investigated whether this A-mediated inhibition of LTP required the expression of PrP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in a previous study using another PrP null mouse model6, bADDLs that blocked LTP in wild-type mice failed to impair LTP in the hippocampi of our PrP null mice (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these results suggest a potential role for PrP in bADDL-mediated depression of hippocampal LTP, it is not clear if such preparations include A species that occur in AD brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we sought to determine whether water-soluble extracts of AD brain that contain SDS-stable A dimers also required the expression of PrP for their plasticity-impairing effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these experiments, we used a brain extract from a non-demented control subject that lacked detectable A and a Tris-buffered saline (TBS) extract from an AD brain that contained significant amounts of A monomer and SDS-stable dimer (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in earlier experiments21, the A-containing extracts potently inhibited LTP in slices from FVB/N mice (Fig 2d, P less_than 0.01, one-way ANOVA), whereas TBS extracts that lacked A had no effect (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, as was the case with bADDLs (Fig 2b), the block of LTP mediated by brain-derived A required the expression of PrPC, with the AD-TBS extract unable to alter LTP in hippocampal slices from PrP null mice (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, application of TBS extract from a control brain, that lacked detectable amounts of A, had no effect on LTP in slices from either PrP expressing or PrP null FVB/N mice (Fig 2d and 168±10% versus 164±10%, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings provide important evidence that PrP is required for the plasticity-impairing effects of pathogenically relevant brain-derived A species and suggest that PrP may be required for the changes in synaptic function that characterize the earliest stages of AD22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As yet, it is unclear as to how the active A species in human brain relate to the active species present in an A preparation such as ADDLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth pointing out that both sources are heterogenous, ADDLs contain a mixture of different sized A species ranging from monomer to 2 MDa19 and the water-soluble extract of AD brain contains A ranging from monomer to 70 kDa21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of water-soluble brain extracts, fractions rich in SDS-stable dimers have been shown to mediate synaptotoxicity, however, whether this activity is mediated by discrete A dimers, or assemblies built from SDS-stable dimers is not clear21,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we have recently shown that synthetic A dimers alone are not synaptotoxic, but must assemble into larger pre-fibrillar A structures to perturb synaptic plasticity23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, although we cannot yet provide a direct comparison of the biophysical properties of brain-derived A and the polydisperse collection of assemblies that constitute ADDLs, it is remarkable that both ADDLs and human brain-derived A require the expression of PrP to exert their toxic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: PrPC is required for the inhibition of LTP by bADDLs and A-containing extracts of human brain.fEPSPs were recorded from the CA1 region of the

requirement for PrP for the plasticity-impairing activity of both AD brain-derived A and ADDLs, we then set out to investigate whether active preparations of A bound to PrP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous characterization of the PrP:A interaction has been carried out using preparations of synthetic A that acted in a PrP-independent manner7, had not been shown to be toxic8,9 or were studied at micromolar concentrations7,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We probed the interaction using a high-throughput plate-based DELFIA (dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescent immunoassay).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A binding response between huPrP23231 and either bADDLs or ADDLs was detected at low nanomolar concentrations with apparent dissociation constants for total A of 82±7 and 100±30 nM, respectively (Fig 3a), with no indication of a tight-binding component (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the total concentration of A present in our stock solution was on average 20% less than the 100 M value derived from the weight of starting peptide powder, that a significant portion of the peptide remained as monomer (Fig 1a,b), and that the molar concentration of A oligomers must (because of their higher molecular weight) be lower than the concentration based on monomer content, it is evident that one or more of the species present in ADDL preparations binds PrP very tightly, probably in the picomolar range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, A monomer exhibited no binding to PrP at concentration 3×107 M (Supplementary Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonspecific oligomer binding to a background BSA surface was observed for both ADDLs and bADDLs when the concentration was raised from high nanomolar to low micromolar, highlighting the importance of probing this interaction in the nanomolar range using well-defined A preparations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the modest binding observed when micromolar concentrations of monomer were used likely resulted because spontaneous aggregation of A occurs in this concentration range23 and, once formed, such aggregates could bind to PrP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, all subsequent experiments were carried out using bADDLs at a concentration of 100 nM (monomer equivalent A) where the most specific interaction could be measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that both PrP24 and A25 are known to contain high-affinity for copper-binding sites in relevant positions, the possibility that their interaction may be mediated by copper chelation was investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of up to 10 mM EDTA did not change the level of bADDL binding (Supplementary Fig S5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At these concentrations, EDTA should be capable of displacing copper from both PrP and A26 thus excluding simple, nonspecific copper chelation as the mechanism for the PrP:A interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: bADDLs avidly bind PrP in a manner that can be blocked by certain anti-PrP antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Dose response curves of ADDLs (green) and bADDLs

high-affinity PrP:A interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A competition assay, whereby increasing concentrations of the different PrP constructs were co-incubated with bADDLs to prevent binding to surface-bound huPrP23231, confirmed that the interaction could occur in solution and revealed that while the region 2390 did not appear to contain a separate high-affinity-binding site, it was indeed involved in modulating the high-affinity interaction (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then tested the ability of the antibody ICSM-35, which binds to an epitope contained in residues 95105 of PrP27, the putative site of ADDL binding6 for ability to block the PrP:A interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This antibody blocked binding of bADDLs to PrP in a classical dose-dependent manner with an IC50=10.4±1.7 nM (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A screen of 28 PrP-binding antibodies pre-incubated with PrP before the addition of bADDLs showed that all antibodies that bound fully to PrP were capable of blocking bADDL binding, at least in vitro, although their efficacy varied (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences in efficacy were clearly epitope dependent, with those interacting directly with the putative ADDL-binding site most effective, followed by those that bind to helix-1 of PrP, whereas those binding to other structured regions of the protein were the least effective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was no epitope-dependent correlation between the level of antibody binding and the level of inhibition, although, as expected, individual antibodies that failed to remain bound to PrP did not inhibit bADDL binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the two best characterized antibodies that bind to helix-1 and the 95105 epitope (ICSM-18 and ICSM-35, respectively), both bind to full-length human prion protein with affinities of 10 nM, block ADDLs with inhibition constants of 20 nM, yet still differ in the magnitude of their inhibition (Supplementary Fig S4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ICSM-18 and ICSM-35 were chosen for further characterization as representative members of the groups that bind to helix-1 and the 95105 epitope, respectively, because of their proven efficacy as anti-prion therapeutics and they do not cause acute toxicity15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the structure of the PrP:ICSM-18 complex has been solved at atomic resolution16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ability of ICSM-18 to block the interaction, despite binding to an epitope far-removed from the 95105 segment, is surprising (Fig 3f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unlikely that the on-rate of PrP with the A is reduced significantly by linking with the antibody, as the enlarged structure will diffuse only slightly more slowly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dissociation rate of PrP from the A structure is not likely to increase by linking interactions with the antibody owing to bulk-solvent effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antibody is also unlikely to cause disruption of the water structure or dielectric properties around the PrP:A interface; hence, hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions will be largely unaffected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, if PrP:PrP contact is needed to stabilize the PrP layer adhered to the A aggregates, then interaction with the antibody would certainly prevent this and weaken the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple PrP-binding sites would suggest the bound A assemblies contains a repeat structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be that such antibodies prevent the binding of larger A assemblies but not smaller species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, reorganization of the protein on the membrane surface could bring these epitopes into close proximity allowing ICSM-18 to sterically block the interaction, although this is unlikely to be the cause of the effect in a plate-based biochemical assay and would not explain the stronger inhibition of helix-1-directed antibodies compared with those that bind to structured areas closer to the A oligomer-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either option opens up the possibility of using multiple antibodies to therapeutically block this interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these results validate the use of this novel high throughput system as a useful first round screen to identify candidate therapeutics capable of inhibiting or modulating ADDL binding to PrP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Antibodies block the A-mediated disruption of LTP in vivo', 'To further assess the potential of two lead monoclonal antibodies identified in our screen, and that belong to the two groups of antibodies that most effectively blocked ADDL binding to PrP in vitro (Fig 3e), we examined whether these antibodies could also block A-mediated impairment of synaptic plasticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure the effect was not just present in FVB/N mice, this part of the study was carried out using hippocampal slices from C57Bl/6J mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perfusion of slices from C57Bl/6J mice with ADDLs 30 min before LTP induction significantly depressed LTP compared with slices treated with buffer control alone (Fig 4a, P less_than 0.01, one-way ANOVA), whereas previous application of low concentrations of the anti-PrP antibody, ICSM-35 (2 g ml1, 13 nM) abolished the ADDL-mediated impairment of LTP (Fig 4a, P less_than 0.01, one-way ANOVA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, when slices were incubated with ICSM-18 20 min before ADDLs this antibody also protected against

to helix-1 of PrP16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, unlike ICSM-35, which should directly target the ADDL-binding site, ICSM-18 may act by hindering formation of the PrP:A interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

efficacy of one of the antibodies, ICSM-18, in a different species, the rat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would confirm if the PrP-dependence of A toxicity was species, as well as mouse strain, independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We directly compared the ability of ICSM-18 with an IgG1 isotype control antibody to abrogate the inhibition of hippocampal LTP by the pathophysiologically relevant A-containing TBS extract of AD brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, to confirm that the involvement of PrP was not limited to extracts from a single AD brain, we used extracts from different AD and control brains than those used in Figure 2d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  pre-injection of the anti-PrP antibody completely prevented the AD brain A-mediated inhibition of

less_than 0.05 compared with baseline, paired t-test; P greater than 0.05 compared with vehicle-injected controls at 3 h, one-way ANOVA, data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, acute administration of soluble extract from AD brain (5 l, i.c.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ; Fig 4c) completely inhibited LTP at 3 h post-HFS in an A-dependent manner in animals injected 30 min previously with the control antibody

#@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in animals that were pre-injected i.c.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with ICSM-18 (30 g) HFS induced robust LTP (P less_than 0.05 compared with baseline (paired t-test) and compared with AD brain A+control IgG1, one-way ANOVA) that was similar in magnitude to controls (P greater than 0.05, one-way ANOVA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When injected alone, neither ICSM 18 nor the control IgG1 significantly affected the magnitude of LTP (Supplementary Fig S6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that sequence-selective targeting of PrP using antibodies can ameliorate the plasticity-impairing activity of AD brain-derived material in rats in vivo corroborates our in vitro finding with ADDLs and strongly encourages further exploration of this approach as an attractive therapeutic strategy.'

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'These data support the earlier finding that PrPC functions as a receptor for mediating toxicity of certain A species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That the inhibitory effect of ADDLs on synaptic plasticity is PrPC-dependent has been confirmed using in vitro LTP recordings from congenic wild-type and PrP null mice and importantly that PrP expression is required for the plasticity-impairing activity of human brain-derived A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There has been much debate about the nature of biologically relevant A oligomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used two distinct preparations, one prepared from synthetic A142 to form ADDLs, and which we were careful to confirm to be biologically active and the other derived from the water-soluble phase of human AD brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using ADDLs, which are known to be active and to have similar biophysical characteristics as those used by Lauren et al, we could test the veracity of earlier reports that A toxicity was mediated (at least in part) through PrP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, both preparations inhibited LTP in a PrP-dependent manner, suggesting that the ADDL preparation contained a component with similar properties to those found in AD brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterogeneous preparations of A aggregates are known to have nonspecific cytotoxicity at high concentrations and it would therefore be incorrect to interpret a failure of PrP targeting to ameliorate such nonspecific toxicity as excluding a role for PrP in A-mediated neurotoxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to expect PrP ablation to block toxicity in all aspects of all models would be to oversimplify a complex problem.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dependence of toxicity on particular receptors in individual animal models of AD may allow us to ascertain which models correctly mimic particular aspects of AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A number of synaptic proteins have been shown to affect the binding and toxic effects of A. mGluR5 was shown to affect binding of A oligomers to excitatory synapses with anti-mGluR5 antibodies reducing A oligomer binding by 50% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a similar level of reduction shown by PrP6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the affect of this receptor on A binding was directly visualized, a binary interaction between A and mGluR5 has not been proven.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EphB2 was recently shown to co-precipitate with cell-derived A and the fibronectin-repeat domain was shown to be critical29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, a direct binary interaction has not been proven.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LTP deficit in the J20 mouse model of AD, caused by downregulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, was reversed by overexpressing EphB2 and it would be interesting to see if this also applies to exogenous human brain-derived A or whether this requires in situ A present over longer periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have shown N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor are involved in toxic effects related to ADDLs but appear not to bind directly30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that PrP has been suggested to interact with NR2D subunits and attenuate excitotoxicity31 it is plausible that a number of these proteins are involved in A toxicity through similar pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that sense, the lack of a vital PrP function would make it a most attractive therapeutic target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, the demonstration that A-mediated inhibition of LTP in vivo and in vitro can be blocked by anti-PrP antibodies further extends these findings, arguing against the effect in PrP null mice being due to unknown protective effects of constitutive PrP ablation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That antibodies raised against two structurally and sequentially different regions of the protein are active strongly argues that PrP is the target of these antibodies in vivo and that the effect is not nonspecific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these same antibodies have already been used to successfully treat prion disease in mice without causing toxic effects15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PrP:A-binding interaction has been further characterized using material of known biological activity and a biophysical assay developed to investigate potential therapeutic agents, which might efficiently disrupt this interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies ICSM-18 and 35, already extensively studied in vivo in mouse and fully humanized for investigation as putative human anti-prion therapeutics, potently inhibit A-induced effects on synaptic plasticity both in vitro and in vivo suggesting that the humanized versions of these antibodies should be considered for potential AD therapeutic trials either individually or in combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As both ADDL preparations and A extracted from human brain in aqueous buffer are highly heterogeneous, additional studies are required to biophysically characterize the key toxic species that bind to PrP.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
