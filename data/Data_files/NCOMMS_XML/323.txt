Chimeric 2C10R4 anti-CD40 antibody therapy is critical for long-term survival of GTKO.hCD46.hTBM pig-to-primate cardiac xenograft  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Preventing xenograft rejection is one of the greatest challenges of transplantation medicine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe a reproducible, long-term survival of cardiac xenografts from alpha 1-3 galactosyltransferase gene knockout pigs, which express human complement regulatory protein CD46 and human thrombomodulin (GTKO.hCD46.hTBM), that were transplanted into baboons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our immunomodulatory drug regimen includes induction with anti-thymocyte globulin and CD20 antibody, followed by maintenance with mycophenolate mofetil and an intensively dosed CD40 (2C10R4) antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Median (298 days) and longest (945 days) graft survival in five consecutive recipients using this regimen is significantly prolonged over our recently established survival benchmarks (180 and 500 days, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the reduction of CD40 antibody dose on day 100 or after 1 year resulted in recrudescence of anti-pig antibody and graft failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In conclusion, genetic modifications (GTKO.hCD46.hTBM) combined with the treatment regimen tested here consistently prevent humoral rejection and systemic coagulation pathway dysregulation, sustaining long-term cardiac xenograft survival beyond 900 days.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Previous pig-to-primate xenotransplantation studies have been beset with treatment-related complications and delayed xenograft rejection characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy (TM) and consumptive coagulopathy (CC)1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, the longest survival for heterotopic cardiac xenografts using alpha 1-3 galactosyltransferase gene knockout (GTKO) or GTKO.hCD46 Tg pigs and immunosuppression (IS) that included CD154 antibody was 179236 days, however, the xenografts ultimately succumbed to the characteristic properties of delayed rejection4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have recently reported survival beyond 1 year of GTKO.hCD46.hTBM pig heart xenografts that were heterotopically transplanted into a baboon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The immunomodulatory protocol utilized CD40 antibody, documenting an attenuated anti-pig antibody elaboration, absence of TM in the graft and reduced incidence of systemic CC6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer-term and reliable prevention of xenograft rejection in this preclinical model has not previously been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, using baboon recipients of GTKO.hCD46.hTBM porcine hearts, we evaluated an iterative modification of our previous immunomodulation strategy, one that primarily targets the anti-CD154-CD40 co-stimulation pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report consistent prevention of xenograft rejection in association with ongoing CD40 (2C10R4) antibody treatment resulting in graft survival beyond 2 years.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Anti-CD40 significantly prolongs graft survival', 'The rationale for using GTKO) pigs to avoid anti-Gal antibody-mediated rejection, with additional human complement regulatory protein (hCD46) expression to suppress complement activation, has been previously reported5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the benefits of anti-CD154/CD40, CD20 and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) immunosuppressive treatment on xenograft survival prolongation in baboons have been described4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used our established heterotopic cardiac xenotransplantation model using GTKO.hCD46 porcine donors9,10, engineered to additionally express the human thromboregulatory protein, human thrombomodulin (hTBM)11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This genetic modification is intended to reduce thrombo-dysregulation often associated with xenografts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific pathogen-free baboons received a co-stimulation pathway-blocking drug regimen described in Table 1, including a non-depleting primatized CD40 monoclonal antibody (2C10R4) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postoperatively, a telemetry implant was used to continuously monitor graft contractility, electrocardiogram (EKG) and body temperature14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Telemetric surveillance was supplemented with constant video monitoring of the recipient baboon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hearts from GTKO.hCD46 pigs engineered using one of two hTBM gene constructs with different promoters (ICAM in baboons #110, #210 and #910 and TBM in baboons #15009 and #510) were used (Fig 1a; cloned from founder lines selected for high endothelial expression of hTBM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was the first time this hTBM transgene was used and the efficacy of the two available promoters was not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ICAM-2 promoter was clearly superior in expression/functionality of TBM in endothelial cells, both by flow cytometry and generation of antigen presenting cell (APC), when compared with endothelial cells from the pTBM-TBM pigs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, immunochemistry of heart tissue (n=1 for each promoter type) indicated more robust expression of hTBM generated by the porcine endogenous TBM promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both promoters provided significant expression of TBM on the cardiac vascular endothelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the transplanted TBM+ hearts with the TBM promoter perform as well or better than the ones bearing the ICAM-2 promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histologic depiction of the representative expression of hTBM on porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Until recently, all attempts using conventional or experimental immunosuppressive regimens and various genetically engineered donor pigs have yielded inconsistent short-term success, with substantial recipient morbidity and graft survival typically  less_than 9 months4,5,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although further improvements may be necessary for both donor genetics and recipient treatment to achieve consistent orthotopic heart xenograft performance and justify potential clinical applications, our data show that the use of GTKO.hCD46.hTBM donor pigs and an CD40 (2C10R4) antibody-based immunomodulatory regimen is associated with significantly prolonged graft survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This regimen was well tolerated in baboons with no evidence of significant infections related to IS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our opinion, this regimen appears potentially safe for human application for patients suffering from end-stage organ failure who might be candidates for initial trials of xenotransplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our future efforts are to improve this immunomodulatory regimen to a level that is analogous to what is used for allotransplantation and to further tailor the immunosuppressive regimen accordingly when a less immunogenic ideal genetically engineered donor is available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the expression of human complement pathway regulatory proteins8,20,21, the absence of Gal epitope in GTKO pigs and both modifications together5,22,23 reduced the incidence of hyperacute rejection and early graft failure, these modifications have proven insufficient to prevent the delayed antibody-associated xenograft rejection in the context of intensive conventional or experimental IS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This form of rejection is characterized by TM in the graft and CC in the recipient4,24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the role of a carbohydrate antigen N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5GC) in xenograft rejection in humans has been described27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baboons, however, do not have antibodies against this carbohydrate as they naturally express Neu5GC antigen, and therefore the impact of Neu5GC on graft rejection cannot be studied in this model28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, pigs have been engineered where CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH), the gene for the enzyme that is responsible for depositing this carbohydrate on the endothelial surface, has been knocked out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of this carbohydrate antigen from the pigs will likely eliminate rejection due to anti-Neu5GC antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, based on known interspecies molecular incompatibilities29 and coupled with direct evidence that organ and systemic coagulation pathway dysregulation is implicated in late xenograft rejection, several human thromboregulatory molecules are being explored to inhibit primary (due to intrinsic interspecies molecular incompatibilities) or elicited (by innate or adaptive immune injury) mechanisms suspected of contributing to the TM and CC phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For GTKO organs, with or without additional genetic modifications, xenograft rejection is generally associated with a robust antibody response directed against multiple non-Gal carbohydrate and protein antigens30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although anti-non-Gal antibody is not always detected at the time of graft or recipient demise, we hypothesized that incomplete control of elicited anti-pig immunity associated with previous regimens constitutes a key barrier to clinical application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Historically, IS using conventional, clinically used agents have been relatively ineffective to prevent xenograft injury and associated phenomena, even at doses associated with significant recipient morbidity and mortality3,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of B cells using CD20 antibody was associated with improved xenograft and recipient survival when administered with conventional IS3 or co-stimulation pathway blocking agents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of our experience using blockade of the CD40/154 pathway combined with of induction anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), CD20 antibody5,7,8,23 and ongoing MMF, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate an intensified immunomodulatory CD40 regimen in concert with GTKO.hCD46.hTBM grafts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report xenograft survival consistently extending beyond 4 months (median of 298 days) in five consecutive recipients of heterotopic GTKO.hCD46.hTBM heart xenografts treated with a clinically applicable, intensified CD40 antibody maintenance regimen, and graft survival prolongation with normal histology beyond 1 year in two cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although immunologic tolerance was not achieved, donor-specific hypo-responsiveness was observed, and immunoregulation was maintained in the T- and B-cell compartments during ongoing CD40 antibody and MMF treatments in two long-term animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, CC and TM were not observed during treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We noted that B cells failed to produce antibodies despite the reconstitution of naive B-cell phenotypic profile in peripheral blood 24 months after cessation of CD20 antibody treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although induction ATG and CD20 antibody and ongoing MMF therapy may contribute to this, we speculate that sustained suppression of B-cell function is primarily attributed to the ongoing CD40 antibody treatment since IgM-stimulated B-cell antibody production in vitro and elaboration of anti-pig antibody was observed in vivo around the time CD40 antibody became undetectable in the serum, and in the context of ongoing MMF treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we consider it likely that both CD40 antibody (by mediating control of anti-pig B-cell maturation) as well as the hTBM transgene (by reducing the consequences associated with one of several identified interspecies coagulation pathway incompatibilities) were necessary to achieve the observed xenograft survivals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As in previous work, removal of CD40 antibody resulted in graft loss, underscoring the importance of this pathway to regulate xenograft rejection or acceptance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important role for hTBM is suggested by our current work, as we have shown that ongoing treatment with the anti-CD154-CD40 co-stimulation blockade antibody is associated with inconsistent protection of GTKO.hCD46 grafts from TM with graft survival limited to 8 months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is mechanistically plausible that interplay between coagulation, anti-pig antibody, complement and T cells contributed to xenograft rejection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, one important observation was the absence of CC, a hallmark of delayed xenograft rejection1,2,3,8 in all five animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that the three genetic modifications used here (GTKO.hCD46.hTBM) played a significant role in avoiding this complication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although additional work will be necessary to determine which components of this pharmacologic regimen are necessary, in addition to optimizing drug dosing and evaluating the importance of the hTBM transgene, this result represents an important finding for the field of xenotransplantation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its potential clinical relevance is underscored, since several non-depleting CD40 antibodies are in late-stage preclinical development (clinicaltrial.gov identifier NCT01561911, NCT00001789).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, there was a concern that the pig heart, with its normal development, may grow out of the abdominal cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our serial echocardiographic estimates of cardiac xenograft volume throughout a 2-year time span suggest that juvenile pig grafts exhibit neither supraphysiologic growth nor pathologic hypertrophy in this heterotopic transplantation model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, the current results confirm the pivotal importance of the CD40-CD154 co-stimulation pathway in the immunopathogenesis of xenograft rejection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, they support our working hypothesis that local expression of human thromboregulatory molecules by a GTKO.hCD46 graft is likely sufficient, and almost certainly necessary to prevent coagulation-related xenograft injury and associated pathology in the context of the regimen employed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further work is required to confirm these current findings and test them in a life-supporting preclinical model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If successful, the approaches described here could help translate xenotransplantation of the heart and other organs into a potentially transformative therapeutic option for the thousands of transplant candidates who may benefit from the timely availability of a porcine organ.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
