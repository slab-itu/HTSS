TAL effector driven induction of a SWEET gene confers susceptibility to bacterial blight of cotton  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors from Xanthomonas citri subsp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  malvacearum (Xcm) are essential for bacterial blight of cotton (BBC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, by combining transcriptome profiling with TAL effector-binding element (EBE) prediction, we show that GhSWEET10, encoding a functional sucrose transporter, is induced by Avrb6, a TAL effector determining Xcm pathogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Activation of GhSWEET10 by designer TAL effectors (dTALEs) restores virulence of Xcm avrb6 deletion strains, whereas silencing of GhSWEET10 compromises cotton susceptibility to infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A BBC-resistant line carrying an unknown recessive b6 gene bears the same EBE as the susceptible line, but Avrb6-mediated induction of GhSWEET10 is reduced, suggesting a unique mechanism underlying b6-mediated resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show via an extensive survey of GhSWEET transcriptional responsiveness to different Xcm field isolates that additional GhSWEETs may also be involved in BBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings advance our understanding of the disease and resistance in cotton and may facilitate the development cotton with improved resistance to BBC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cotton (Gossypium spp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is an economically important crop and provides a significant source of fibre, feed, foodstuff, oil and biofuel products worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cotton genus is composed of at least 45 diploid and 5 tetraploid species1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tetraploid (AD genome) species, including G. hirsutum that produces 95% of the worlds cotton fibre, is likely derived from a hybridization between an A-genome-like ancestral species resembling G. arboreum and a D-genome-like ancestral species resembling G. raimondii2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The availability of the draft genome sequences for G. raimondii, G. arboreum, G. hirsutum and G. barbadense not only provides genetic resources to study the complex genome evolution and polyploidization process, but also lays the foundation for functional genomic approaches to dissect cotton gene functions with a goal to improve its agricultural performance in the face of biotic and abiotic stresses3,4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Bacterial blight of cotton (BBC), caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  malvacearum (Xcm), is among the destructive diseases of cotton9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following epidemics in the 1970s, the disease has occurred sporadically in the United States, but in the past several years re-emerged as a significant yield constraint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are pressing needs to address the underlying mechanisms of susceptibility and resistance to BBC in cotton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xcm injects effector proteins into plant cells via the type III secretion system to promote pathogenicity in plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of corresponding resistance (R) proteins, some of these effectors trigger resistance and function as avirulence proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, all known pathogenicity and avirulence factors (encoded by so called pth and avr genes) of Xcm are transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAL effectors functionally resemble eukaryotic transcription factors and upregulate host genes by directly binding to their promoters11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAL effectors are highly conserved among different Xanthomonas spp., with an N-terminal type III translocation signal, a central repeat region (CRR) and C-terminal nuclear localization signals followed by an acidic activation domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteins differ mainly in the CRR, which consists of 1.533.5 copies of near-perfect repeats of 3334 amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These repeats are conserved with the exception of the 12th and 13th residues of each copy, defined as the repeat variable di-residue (RVD)13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each RVD targets a specific nucleotide of the promoters of host genes, creating a code, such that the sequence of RVDs defines the effector-binding element (EBE); each EBE starts, however, with a nearly invariant thymine, which is specified in a yet unclear manner by structures immediately N terminus of the CRR13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among the identified TAL effector targets include a group of pepper genes upregulated by AvrBs3 from X. campestris pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  vesicatoria (Xcv)17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include the R gene Bs3 and UPA20, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor regulating plant cell hypertrophy19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Os8N3/Xa13/OsSWEET11, essential for reproductive development, is a rice susceptibility (S) gene targeted by TAL effector PthXo1 from X. oryzae pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  oryzae (Xoo)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The xa13 allele, which is unable to be induced by PthXo1, acts as a recessive r gene against Xoo infection21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, four Os8N3/Xa13/OsSWEET11 homologues, rice Os11N3/OsSWEET14 and Xa25/OsSWEET13, pepper UPA16 and cassava MeSWEET10a are also targeted by TAL effectors from Xoo, Xcv and X. axonopodis pv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  manihotis (Xam), respectively23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was hypothesized that Xanthomonas spp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  induces the expression of SWEET genes during infection to transport sucrose to the apoplast, thereby providing the bacteria with a carbon source20,23,25,26,27,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TAL effectors from X. citri sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  citri (Xcc), the causal agent for citrus bacterial canker, induce the expression of CsSWEET1 in citrus, but the CsSWEET1 does not contribute demonstrably to susceptibility; another TAL effector target, however, CsLOB1, does function as an S gene, promoting the characteristic pustule formation and bacterial multiplication31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other characterized TAL effector targets include the rice bacterial blight R genes Xa27 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32), Xa23 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33) and Xa10 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34), the bacterial leaf streak of rice S gene OsSULTR3;6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35) and the pepper bacterial spot R gene Bs4C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous work identified at least 10 TAL effectors from the cotton pathogen XcmH1005 and showed that a mutant with a deletion of seven tal genes was no longer able to cause observable water-soaking symptoms on Acala44 (Ac44), a BBC susceptible line of cotton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Avrb6 from XcmH1005 was among the first examples of an individual TAL effector important for Xcm virulence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An avrb6 mutant of XcmH1005, XcmH1407 (XcmH1005avrb6), showed reduced water-soaking, whereas when expressed in a relatively weak virulent strain XcmN1003, Avrb6 enhances water-soaking37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although it does not affect in planta bacterial multiplication, Avrb6 plays a major role in release of bacteria from the leaf interior to the leaf surface during infections37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To identify the TAL effectors responsible for virulence and their targets, we sequenced the whole genomes of Xcm strains XcmH1005 and XcmN1003 and assembled the full repertoire of TAL effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, we deployed genome-wide gene expression profiling in cotton coupled with TAL effector DNA-binding code-assisted EBE prediction and identified the clade III sucrose transporter gene GhSWEET10 as a target of Avrb6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined that GhSWEET10 is a major S gene for BBC by using dTALEs to induce it independently of any other possible Avrb6 targets and by silencing it with Agrobacterium-mediated virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, other members of the clade III GhSWEET genes are strongly induced by different Xcm field strains responsible for recent re-emergence of the disease in the southern United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data indicate that cotton GhSWEET10 and likely other SWEET sugar transporters in the same clade play a major role in BBC and suggest that newly evolved or horizontally transferred TAL effectors targeting these genes attribute to the re-emergence of BBC in the field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a BBC-resistant cotton line carrying b6, a genetically complex resistance gene that has not yet been molecularly identified, showed markedly reduced Avrb6-mediated induction of GhSWEET10, ostensibly due to promoter polymorphisms outside the EBE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests a novel mechanism for resistance that may represent a genetic determinant of b6.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome and TAL effector sequences of XcmH1005 and N1003', 'The strains XcmH1005, a rifamycin-resistant derivative of XcmH, and XcmN1003, a spectinomycin- and rifamycin-resistant derivative of XcmN, are two Xcm strains that cause water-soaking on Ac44 cotton38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To set the stage for identifying the role that TAL effectors in these strains play in BBC, we generated complete genome sequences using single molecule real-time sequencing (Pacific Biosciences; hereafter PacBio sequencing).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The H1005 genome consists of a circular chromosome of 5,212,564 bp and a plasmid, pXcmH39 of 88,283 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The N1003 genome consists of a circular chromosome of 5,218,607 bp and a plasmid, herein designated as pXcmN, of 59,644 bp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general features of each genome are presented in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall architectures of the two chromosomes are highly similar, with a single, large inversion (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasmids are dissimilar, with only a few, relatively small regions of homology (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tal genes of the two strains are largely distinct (Fig 1b and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H1005 encodes 12 TAL effectors with six in the chromosome and six in pXcmH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten of these are Avr proteins named previously based on reactions of differential cotton lines to transformants of an otherwise-compatible Xcm strain carrying corresponding cosmid subclones: AvrB4, AvrB5, Avrb6, Avrb7, AvrB101, AvrB102, AvrB103, AvrB104, AvrBIn and AvrBn38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another is PthN2, originally characterized in XcmN1003 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The twelfth is uncharacterized, and we designated it as Tal6XcmH1005, following a previously described naming scheme41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  XcmN1003 harbours nine tal genes, five on the chromosome and four on pXcmN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four on the chromosome and one on the plasmid however are disrupted by a frameshift mutation or a large insertion in the repeat region or the 3 end of the gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the disrupted genes, tal1, on the chromosome, carries only a last repeat and is otherwise complete until an integrase insertion further downstream.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another of the disrupted genes, pthN on pXcmN, is otherwise identical to pthN, an XcmN1003 tal gene shown previously to contribute to water-soaking without triggering resistance on commercial US cotton varieties10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intact pthN gene is also located on pXcmN, along with pthN2, which also contributes to water-soaking, but less strongly10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another intact tal gene, tal7XcmN1003, also resides on the plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fourth intact gene is avrBn located on the chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from pthN, pthN, pthN2 and avrBn, no other XcmN1003 tal genes show obvious similarity in their RVD sequences to any other tal genes in either strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The divergence in tal gene content between the two strains, both with respect to RVD composition and genomic location of orthologs, is striking, which is in line with the fact that they were isolated from geographically distant regions38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Genome characteristics of XcmH1005 and XcmN1003.Full size table', 'Figure 1: Comparison of whole genomes and tal genes

Avrb6', 'Avrb6 is a TAL effector in XcmH1005 that causes strong water-soaking in the cotton line Ac44 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we used the Ac44E-tetraploid genotype, which is a single plant selection from Brinkerhoffs original Ac44 parent42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ac44E has similar morphology to Ac44 except it has more abundant flowers and is slightly more susceptible to BBC than Ac44 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the cotton genes that are specifically activated by Avrb6, we used an integrative approach involving a whole-genome RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of protoplasts of Ac44E expressing Avrb6 and computational prediction of Avrb6 EBEs in cotton (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to the whole plant-pathogen infection assay, the homogenous protoplast mesophyll cell system expressing the individual bacterial effector circumvents the complication of multiple pathogen effectors and elicitors that could spontaneously activate or suppress a large number of host genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cloned the full-length coding sequence of Avrb6 from XcmH1005 into a plant expression vector with an HA-epitope tag at the C terminus under the control of the 35S CaMV promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sequence was confirmed via Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An immunoblot analysis with an -HA antibody detected a major polypeptide slightly above the 100 kDa marker, which matches the predicted molecular mass of 108 kDa for Avrb6 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further subcloned the 35S::avrb6-HA expression cassette into a binary vector and performed Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression assays in Ac44E cotton and Nicotiana benthamiana.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2c, we observed a similar result as in cotton protoplasts with a major polypeptide being detected at 108 kDa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we performed RNA-Seq analysis with cotton protoplasts 12 h after transfection with the avrb6 construct or a vector control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 3950 million raw read pairs and 3646 million cleaned read pairs were obtained for each sample, which corresponds to 450 × coverage of 77,267 annotated protein-coding transcripts1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a twofold expression change and an adjusted P value  less_than 0.05 as cutoffs, and using the G. raimondii genome sequence as a reference (the tetraploid genome sequence was not available at the time), we identified 2,026 genes that were induced by Avrb6 (Fig 2d and Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify genes with potential EBEs for Avrb6, we used the TALE-NT 2.0 Target Finder tool to examine all gene promoter sequences in the G. raimondii genome, using the standard score ratio cutoff of 3.0 (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The list of genes displaying one or more putative EBEs was then intersected with the list of genes upregulated by Avrb6 to produce a list of candidate of Avrb6 targets (Table 2 and Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These candidates were ranked by the probability that the predicted EBE is functional by using a machine-learning algorithm based on the output of TALE-NT 2.0 and the genomic context of the predicted EBEs35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, among the top candidates, Gorai.008G209000.1, a homologue of the SWEET sucrose transporter genes that serve as S genes in rice and cassava, was induced 6,000-fold by Avrb6 and has an EBE with a probability of 1 (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other top candidates include Gorai.007G067700.1, Gorai.010G056300.1, Gorai.009G327300.1 and Gorai.008G047400.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used the gene IDs from G. raimondii to identify their homologues in G. hirsutum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gene IDs of the homologues identified in G. hirsutum are Gh_D12G1898 for Gorai.008G209000.1, Gh_D11G0631 for Gorai.007G067700.1, Gh_D06G0459 for Gorai.010G056300.1, Gh_D05G2954 for Gorai.009G327300.1 and Gh_D12G0420 for Gorai.008G047400.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genes were named GhSWEET10D (see below for explanation), Gh067700, GhKBS1, GhHLH1 and GhMDR1, respectively, based on their predicted gene annotation.

candidate genes, we performed reverse transcription (RT)PCR assays using Ac44E cotton protoplasts transfected with Avrb6 or with an empty vector as control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The top five candidates, GhSWEET10, Gh067700, GhKBS1, GhHLH1 and GhMDR1, were strongly induced by Avrb6 compared to the vector control (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further confirmed induction in cotton leaves by inoculating Xcm strains with or without avrb6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HM2.2S is derived from H1005 with a deletion of at least seven tal genes including avrb6, while HM2.2S (avrb6) is HM2.2S carrying avrb6 in plasmid vector pUFR127 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H1005avrb6 is an avrb6 mutant derivative of XcmH1005 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously reported, avrb6 in different Xcm strains induced strong water-soaking on Ac44E cotton37 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that water-soaking was only induced by the Xcm strains carrying avrb6 (HM2.2S (avrb6), HM2.2S (placZ::avrb6)a strain that contains the plasmid pUFR135 which expresses avrb6 driven by the lacZ promoter, H1005 (placZ::avrb6) and H1005).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3c, the induction of GhSWEET10, Gh067700, GhKBS1 and GhMDR1 by the strains carrying avrb6, HM2.2S (avrb6) and H1005, was stronger than that by strains lacking avrb6, HM2.2S and H1005avrb6, at 12- and 24-h post inoculation (hpi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We could not amplify the GhHLH1 gene in cotton likely due to low transcript level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore whether GhSWEET10, Gh067700, GhKBS1 and GhMDR1 are directly induced by Avrb6, we added the eukaryotic protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX; 50 M final concentration) to the Xcm suspensions and inoculated into Ac44E cotton leaves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each gene was still induced by strains carrying avrb6, H1005 and HM2.2S (avrb6), in the presence of CHX at 24 hpi (Fig 3d), suggesting that new protein biosynthesis is not required for induction of these genes and that they are direct targets of Avrb6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effectiveness of CHX in suppressing protein synthesis in this context was confirmed by its suppression of Avrb6 protein expression in a separate Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression assay in Ac44E cotton (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine potential polymorphisms in these gene promoters between the sequenced cotton and Ac44E cotton used in this study, we amplified each promoter from Ac44E for sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This revealed that each of the promoters possesses an Avrb6 EBE except Gh067700, which has a 1 bp deletion in the EBE in Ac44E (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm whether Avrb6 activates the genes by targeting the EBEs, we amplified 800 bp upstream of the translational start site of each gene, cloned each of these fragments upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (LUC) and performed a cotton protoplast-based transactivation assay (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to an empty vector control, co-transfection of Avrb6 strongly activated pGhSWEET10D::LUC with about 110-fold induction, and also activated pGhKBS1::LUC and pGhMDR1::LUC with about 1520-fold induction (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significantly, these promoters were not activated by PthN, another Xcm TAL effector with an RVD sequence distinct from Avrb6, indicating specificity of activation by Avrb6 (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the observation that Gh067700 in cotton Ac44E carries a nucleotide deletion in Avrb6 EBE, pGh067700::LUC was not activated by Avrb6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, pGhHLH1::LUC was not significantly activated by Avrb6, though its promoter possesses a predicted Avrb6 EBE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the promoter of GhSWEET10D was strongly induced by Avrb6, we tested the role of the EBE by mutating two nucleotides to create a version of pGhSWEET10D::LUC with a CA to GG substitution in the EBE (mEBE; Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Avrb6 strongly activated pGhSWEET10D::LUC carrying the wild-type EBE, but not the mEBE (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data indicate that Avrb6 directly and specifically activates GhSWEET10D, and likely GhKBS1 and GhMDR1, and that the EBE is required for Avrb6-induced expression of GhSWEET10D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Avrb6 directly induces cotton gene transcription in the absence of protein synthesis.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'BBC caused by Xcm is among devastating diseases that limit cotton yields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite several TAL effectors being cloned from Xcm, no R or S genes have yet been molecularly identified, mainly because of the large and polyploidy nature of the cotton genome and limited molecular and genomic tools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The approach taken in this study successfully overcame these challenges to establish a role for SWEET-mediated susceptibility in BBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GhSWEET10 was strongly induced by Avrb6 during Xcm infection and was identified as an S gene for BBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterization of BBC-resistant line Acb6 revealed sequence differences in the GhSWEET10D promoter, but not in the EBE, that impair activation by Avrb6, possibly relating to resistance mediated by the b6 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, surveys of different Xcm field isolates showed that two additional clade III GhSWEETs were highly induced during infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It appears that the evolution of novel TAL effectors that induce these additional clade III GhSWEET members may have contributed to the recent re-emergence of BBC in the United States.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The SWEET family members are key S genes common to several diseases caused by different Xanthomonas species47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, only clade III SWEET genes are targeted by pathogens that use TAL effectors to facilitate disease46,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Members of clade III SWEET genes are known to transport sucrose, which likely serves as a carbon source for the pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, it was recently shown that two clade III SWEET genes in Arabidopsis, AtSWEET13 and AtSWEET14, can also transport plant hormone gibberellin to modulate growth and development49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rice, Xoo can target three clade III SWEET genes to cause susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Xoo TAL effector PthXo1 targets OsSWEET11 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20); PthXo2 targets OsSWEET13 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27); and AvrXa7 targets OsSWEET14 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cassava, Xam can use TAL20Xam668 to target MeSWEET10a, another clade III SWEET gene25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In at least one case, a host SWEET gene is targeted by multiple TAL effectors from different strains of the pathogen: in addition to AvrXa7, OsSWEET14 is targeted by PthXo3, TalC and Tal5, each from a different Xoo strain23,28,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central role of SWEETs in susceptibility is further supported by our data, as we have identified GhSWEET10 as a clade III SWEET gene in cotton targeted by Avrb6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we observed that several different Xcm field isolates strongly induce two additional clade III GhSWEETs, GhSWEET14a and GhSWEET14b, but not GhSWEET10, during infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since XcmH1005 is a strain derived from an older race, and since these field isolates were collected within the past year, this strongly suggests that new TAL effectors have evolved in these field isolates to target new SWEETs and break resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The striking differences of the tal gene content and the localization of the pthN2 gene on chromosome or plasmid in XcmH1005 and XcmN1003 are consistent with the notion that TAL effectors in Xcm may evolve rapidly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is also possible that TAL effectors from these recent strains can activate another target, either another SWEET gene or a gene in different family, to cause susceptibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was revealed that TalC from Xoo can still cause disease on rice, despite having its corresponding EBE from OsSWEET14 artificially mutated, suggesting that preventing TalC-mediated SWEET14 activation alone is not sufficient to prevent susceptibility51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, even though GhSWEET10, GhSWEET14a and GhSWEET14b reside in clade III, it is still unclear if they function similarly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional biochemical analyses are needed to further understand the function of these genes in BBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterizing the spectrum of SWEET-targeting TAL effectors and the relative contributions of their targets to susceptibility, both in the older strains and the recent isolates, is an important future objective.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The CRR of TAL effectors determines their DNA-binding specificity for targeted gene activation in disease or resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inventory of the repeat sequences is essential to predict important TAL effector targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the repeats are generally impossible to assemble from Illumina-sequencing reads and challenge remains even with Sanger sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PacBio sequencing has proven to be an effective approach however52,53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used PacBio sequencing to reveal the whole repertoire of TAL effectors in XcmH1005 and XcmN1003.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 12 TAL effectors encoded by H1005 (six in the chromosome and six in the plasmid) and 9 encoded by N1003 (five in the chromosome and four in the plasmid).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to GhSWEET genes, another shared class of targets across TAL effectors of different Xanthomonas species is transcription factor genes19,31,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In at least one case, the CsLOB1 transcription factor of citrus, and other members of CsLOB1 family also function as S genes31,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to determine whether targets of other TAL effectors in H1005 and N1003 similarly include transcription factor genes, or yet novel types of targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to revealing a host factor essential for disease symptom development, our study yields insight into the nature of BBC resistance mediated by b6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially characterized as recessive57, genetic linkage mapping analysis suggests that the genetic basis of b6-resistance is rather complex and exhibits a quantitative inheritance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In

of GhSWEET10 by Avrb6 in Acb6 is compromised likely not due to the sequence polymorphism at the EBE, suggesting a novel mechanism underlying b6-mediated resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first report of polymorphisms outside the EBE itself that impair activation by a TAL effector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The b6-mediated resistance is accompanied by the HR at the site of infection, and this is triggered specifically in the presence of Avrb6 (refs 10, 38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a dTALE-activating GhSWEET10 only results in water-soaking, but not HR in Acb6, suggesting that GhSWEET10 does not mediate Avb6-induced HR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is likely that HR is due to the activation of another target by Avrb6 in Acb6, but not in Ac44E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it seems possible that b6 comprises at least two genetic determinants, one manifesting in reduced susceptibility (lower expression of the GhSWEET10 S gene) and the other mediating the defence-associated HR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps both need to be present to support the full level of resistance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nevertheless, our findings suggest a strategy to improve BBC resistance in cotton through genome editing of TAL effector EBEs in SWEET genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome editing has been successfully used in rice to mutate the OsSWEET13 S gene and generate plants resistant to Xoo strains that depend on TAL effector PthXo2 as a major virulence factor27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An advantage of this strategy is that relatively minor sequence changes could be made that will destroy the EBE while being unlikely to impinge on native promoter activity and without affecting the coding region, keeping endogenous function of the SWEET gene intact51,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The successful knockout of all homeologs of the Mlo gene in hexaploid wheat in a single genome editing experiment indicates that disrupting EBEs in SWEET genes in cotton is likely feasible60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As new TAL effectors important for virulence of this pathogen are characterized in the future, this system could be used to edit the EBEs in the corresponding targets, whether GhSWEET genes or other BBC S genes yet to be discovered, and to generate plants with broad-spectrum BBC resistance via pyramiding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not least, duplicating the Acb6 genotype of GhSWEET10 in the Ac44E background and in other susceptible genotypes would be a powerful approach to dissect the genetic determinants of b6-mediated resistance, potentially by uncoupling loss of susceptibility from the HR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such characterizations would also likely lead to new strategies for improved control of BBC.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
