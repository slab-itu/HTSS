Metal-free photochemical silylations and transfer hydrogenations of benzenoid hydrocarbons and graphene  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The first hydrogenation step of benzene, which is endergonic in the electronic ground state (S0), becomes exergonic in the first triplet state (T1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in line with Bairds rule, which tells that benzene is antiaromatic and destabilized in its T1 state and also in its first singlet excited state (S1), opposite to S0, where it is aromatic and remarkably unreactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we utilized this feature to show that benzene and several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to various extents undergo metal-free photochemical (hydro)silylations and transfer-hydrogenations at mild conditions, with the highest yield for naphthalene (photosilylation: 21%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantum chemical computations reveal that T1-state benzene is excellent at H-atom abstraction, while cyclooctatetraene, aromatic in the T1 and S1 states according to Bairds rule, is unreactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, also CVD-graphene on SiO2 is efficiently transfer-photohydrogenated using formic acid/water mixtures together with white light or solar irradiation under metal-free conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Aromaticity is a core concept in organic chemistry1,2, yet, it is essentially only used to rationalize properties and processes in the S0 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 1972, Baird applied perturbation molecular orbital theory to show that annulenes with 4n+2 -electrons in their lowest * triplet states are destabilized (antiaromatic) relative to two polyenyl monoradicals while annulenes with 4n -electrons are stabilized (aromatic)3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rule, which is opposite to Hückels rule for the S0 state5,6, has been verified by numerous high-level quantum chemical calculations7,8, and it also applies to the S1 states of cyclobutadiene, benzene and cyclooctatetraene (COT)9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wan and co-workers pioneered the experimental development of excited state aromaticity when reporting the involvement of aromatic 4 cationic species in the photosolvolysis of fluoren-9-ol and photoreactions leading to 4n-electron arenes12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later, Bairds rule was utilized by Ottosson and co-workers to rationalize experimentally determined T1- and S1-state energies of substituted fulvenes15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, excited-state aromaticity and antiaromaticity can be used to explain a range of earlier photophysical and photochemical observations8,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, spectroscopic evidence for Bairds rule in the T1 state was provided by Kim and co-workers18, who investigated two bis-rhodium hexaphyrins of which one is aromatic and the other is antiaromatic in the S0 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In their T1 states, the hexaphyrins interchanged the absorption spectral characteristics, and computed aromaticity indices revealed that this change could be connected to an aromaticity/antiaromaticity reversal when going from the S0 to the T1 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar spectral switch was recently observed for another pair of hexaphyrins on excitation to S1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tovar and co-workers also reported on a tetracyano-substituted quinoidal methano10annulenic species with a low-lying triplet state20, belonging to a compound class that can be described as HückelBaird hybrids21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, two of us reviewed theoretical/computational findings on the T1 and S1 antiaromatic character of benzene jointly with findings on various photoreactions of benzene derivatives, concluding that excited state antiaromaticity triggers photoreactivity17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With reference to the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde split personality drama22, benzene in its antiaromatic first excited states was labelled a molecular Mr Hyde while benzene in the S0 state is a molecular Dr Jekyll8,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, both Baird and Aihara postulated from theory that antiaromaticity drastically increases the reactivity of benzene in its first excited states3,23, and Alabugin and co-workers recently utilized this feature to rationalize the photochemically initiated C1C5 cycloaromatization reaction of benzannelated enynes to benzofulvenes24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, recognition of the antiaromatic destabilization of benzene should be useful for the development of new photoreactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The first hydrogenation step of benzene in S0 is endothermic due to aromaticity loss, contrary to the hydrogenation of alkenes and acyclic polyenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the hydrogenation of arenes typically progresses only with metal catalysts under high pressures and/or high temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, in light of Bairds rule, hydrogenations and other formal -bond additions to benzene should be considerably more facile in the T1 and S1 states than in the S0 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few such additions to arenes have earlier been observed, but none were linked to relief of excited state antiaromaticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-temperature (196 °C) solid-state photoreactions of small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with aliphatic hydrocarbons, yielding alkylated or hydroxyalkylated products as well as dihydrogenated aromatics, were reported.25,26 For mixed durenenaphtalene crystals, variations in phosphorescence decay rates with temperature, pressure and deuterium labelling were attributed to hydrogen abstraction from durene by triplet-state naphthalene, leading to naphthyl radicals27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acenaphtylene, benzaanthracene and phenanthrene in benzene solution were photoreduced by tri-n-butyltin hydride to dihydrogenated PAHs28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, at room temperature small PAHs only photoreacted with alcohols or alkanes when very high pressures were applied29, although Jeevarajan and Fessenden showed by electron paramagnetic resonace spectroscopy at ambient temperature and pressure that benzoic acid derivatives in their * states, that is, with the benzene ring as the photoreactive moiety, abstract hydrogen from iso-propanol to yield transient benzenium (cyclohexadienyl) radicals30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with Bairds rule and the computationally verified excited-state antiaromatic character of benzene8,17, these studies point to a largely underexploited area of benzene photochemistry that could provide access to formal -bond photoadditions (stepwise or concerted) to benzene, PAHs and graphene under mild metal-free conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Herein, we present computational and experimental results that show that our basic hypothesis is correct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to computations, the first photohydrogenation step of benzene is exergonic while that of COT is endergonic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metal-free photoreactions with triethylsilane, used as a heavy dihydrogen, gave silylated products with the highest yield for naphthalene (21% combined yield of the two triethylsilylnaphthalenes and 6% for triethylsilylbenzene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments as well as computations indicate that the photoreactions progress via the T1 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, large PAHs were photo(hydro)silylated, and also transfer-photohydrogenated, to gradually lower degrees with increased size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is remarkable that graphene on SiO2 was efficiently transfer-photohydrogenated and photo(hydro)silylated on white light or solar irradiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two tentative explanations involving excited-state antiaromaticity for the graphene photoreactions are given, yet, these reactions may also be outside the realm of excited state antiaromaticity alleviation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Computational assessment of the hypothesis', 'We argue that the first hydrogenations of 4n+2annulenes are considerably more facile (possibly exothermic and exergonic) in the T1 than in the S0 state, and the opposite for 4nannulenes (Fig 1a) reflecting that antiaromaticity is alleviated in the first while aromaticity is lost in the latter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, in both the S0 and T1 states, there should be zigzag variations in the first hydrogenation energies for each additional -bond in the annulene series, however, our hypothesis is that the sense in the zigzag relationships is opposite in the two states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Hypothesis and computed reaction energies for the first step in the S0- and T1-state hydrogenation of annulenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematics of our hypothesis that exergonicity/endergonicity of the first hydrogenation step reverses when going from the S0 to the T1 state, both for 4n- and 4n+2annulenes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Calculated average free energies of the first hydrogenation reaction at (U)B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level for a selection of annulenes (neutral, cationic and anionic) with 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 -electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For electronic energies, see Supplementary Tables 37.Full size image', 'Neutral, cationic and anionic annulenes with m=4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 -electrons, all with (near-)planar structures in both the S0 and T1 states, were examined computationally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of hydrogenation reactions regarded for each m range from 2 (m=4) to 31 (m=12) (Supplementary Figs 9597).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clear zigzag patterns in the first hydrogenation energies at (U)B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level were evident in both states (in Fig 1b displayed as the average first hydrogenation energies for each m).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the sense in the zigzag relationships on the number of -electrons is opposite in the T1 and S0 states, confirming our hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the first hydrogenation step of T1-state benzene at 298 K, leading to cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is exergonic by 17.7 kcal mol1 while this reaction for COT in the T1 state is endergonic by 18.6 kcal mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, T1-state COT takes the position of benzene in the S0 state and benzene in the T1 state takes that of COT in the S0 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Motivations for experimental set-up and reagents used', 'We considered direct photohydrogenation with dihydrogen too hazardous experimentally and turned to (i) metal-free photohydrosilylations using triethylhydrosilane (Et3SiH) as a heavy dihydrogen, and (ii) metal-free transfer photohydrogenations with formic acid (HCOOH).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photohydrosilylation reactions were mainly performed in a Rayonet photoreactor at ambient conditions with lamp emission at 254 (4.88 eV) or 300 nm (4.13 eV); however, for some experiments an immersion well photoreactor with a Hg lamp was used or a Fluorolog-3-22 instrument equipped with a Xe lamp as a light source allowing for monochromatic irradiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The trialkylmonosilane selected absorbs only in the vacuumultraviolet region with a strong excitation measured at 151 nm (8.21 eV; Supplementary Fig 29)31, and the first transition (a nearly forbidden transition) calculated at 181 nm (6.84 eV) according to TD-B3LYP (Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, photodissociation of triethylsilane into silyl radicals is not feasible (for experiments disproving free radical formation through photolysis of Et3SiH, see Supplementary Figs 3040 and the corresponding discussion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, HCOOH shows a weak excitation at 215 nm (5.77 eV), extending until 250 nm/4.96 eV, but photodecomposition into CO and H2O, and into CO2 and H2, occurs only with  less_than 260 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our photoreactions using HCOOH were performed at 300 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the metal-free photosilylations of benzene versus COT', 'When a benzene solution of triethylhydrosilane was irradiated at =254 nm, several different products were formed; the most significant soluble non-polymeric product being phenyltriethylsilane obtained in 6% isolated yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This product forms via a route that involves triethylsilylcyclohexadiene intermediates (Fig 2b), compounds identified in transient quantities by gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GCMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the major photoproduct is insoluble polymers, which could form along a few different routes (Supplementary Fig 109).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the photoreaction was carried out with an aerated benzene solution of triethylsilane, no polymers were formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the GCMS conversion to phenyltriethylsilane was significantly reduced (0.35%), and instead the formation of siloxanes was observed (Supplementary Fig 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Photosilylation of benzene and attempted photosilylation of cyclooctatetraene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) ACID plot of benzene in its antiaromatic T1 state with the direction of the paramagnetic ring current indicated by arrows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Scheme showing the photoreaction of benzene with Et3SiH leading to two isomeric hydrosilylated intermediates, and subsequently, to phenyltriethylsilane and polymeric products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) ACID plot of COT in its aromatic T1 state with the direction of the diamagnetic ring current indicated by arrows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Scheme showing that COT remains unreacted when irradiated in 10-fold excess of Et3SiH for 24 h.

size image', 'So what is the mechanism for triethylsilane photoaddition to benzene, and does excited state antiaromaticity relief play a role?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The photoreactivity of COT towards Et3SiH is elucidating: contrary to benzene, COT is recovered unchanged after 24 h of 254 nm irradiation (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computations with Me3SiH as a model for Et3SiH reveal that benzene in its T1 state is excellent at H-atom abstraction (while T1-state COT is the opposite) because the activation free energy for the reaction leading from a preceding van der Waals complex to the benzenium and trimethylsilyl radicals at B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311+G(d,p) level is merely 2.4 kcal mol1 (Fig 2e; for CCSD(T) results see Supplementary Fig 101).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation energy for H-atom abstraction from Me3SiH by the tert-butoxy radical, a well-known radical photoinitiator33, is 8.2 kcal mol1, whereas H-atom abstraction by T1-state COT requires 35.9 kcal mol1 (Fig 2e) and by cycloocta-1,3,5-triene, a T1 nonaromatic linearly conjugated triene, requires 15.5 kcal mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the T1 potential energy surface for H-atom abstraction from Me3SiH by T1-state benzene unambiguously support our experimental observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the differences in degree of (anti)aromaticity between the isolated T1-state benzene and COT, and the corresponding transition-state structures, as well as annulenium product radicals (see the Supplementary Information), reveal that T1 antiaromaticity is alleviated in the reaction for benzene while T1 aromaticity is lost for COT, showcasing the predictive power of Bairds rule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In support of our conclusion that the reaction progresses in the T1 state, the activation energy for H-atom abstraction from Me3SiH by S1-state benzene, calculated with CASPT2//CASSCF, is 27.2 kcal mol1 relative to isolated reactants, 20 kcal mol1 higher than in the T1 state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Formation of the triethylsilylcyclohexadiene intermediates should occur after spin-flip of the triplet benzenium and triethylsilyl radical pair to a singlet radical pair, which according to our calculations (CASPT2 energies on UB3LYP geometries) progresses without activation barrier leading to a gain in free energy of 39.6 kcal mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polymers that are observed as major product could form along a variety of pathways: (i) the silylcyclohexa-1,4-diene intermediates photopolymerize as confirmed by irradiation of pre-prepared triethylsilylcyclohexa-1,4-diene (Supplementary Figs 5254 and the corresponding discussion); (ii) the silyl radicals formed could initiate radical chain processes through addition with benzene, although the free energy of activation for this process (14.8 kcal mol1 with UB3LYP-D3) represents a substantial barrier in contrast to the barrierless and exergonic collapse of the singlet benzenium and triethylsilyl radical pair; and finally (iii) benzene when excited could undergo photocycloaddition reactions with the silylcyclohexadiene intermediates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the yield for the photohydrosilylation step could be higher than that observed for phenyltriethylsilane formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It can also be noted that formations of triethylsilylcyclohexadienes are endergonic reactions in S0 (21.6 kcal mol1 for formation of the cyclohexa-1,3-diene and 20.7 kcal mol1 for formation of the cyclohexa-1,4-diene).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'T1-state antiaromaticity of PAHs', 'The T1 antiaromaticity of benzene, naphthalene, anthracene and larger PAHs was analysed through ACID plots (Anisotropy of the Induced Current Density) (Supplementary Figs 111117 and Supplementary Methods: Computational part), a method to visualize electron delocalization and ring currents, and two-dimensional (2D) NICS scans, NICS-XY (Nucleus Independent Chemical Shifts).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Focus on the T1 antiaromaticity in the computations is justified by the high intersystem crossing rates of PAHs and the longer T1- than S1-state lifetimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the T1 state, benzene, naphthalene, anthracene and pyrene all display paramagnetic ring currents typical for antiaromaticity (Figs 2a and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, antiaromaticity is present even though the T1 structures undergo geometry relaxations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, while the antiaromatic ring current is global for benzene and naphthalene, it is localized to the central ring in anthracene and to two of the four rings in pyrene, revealing that in larger PAHs the T1 antiaromaticity is not distributed over all rings (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results from this analysis is further validated by the NICS(1)zz values (Supplementary Fig 125).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antiaromatic character of the PAHs based on the magnetic indices also agree with an earlier graph theoretical study using Hückel molecular orbital theory which revealed substantial destabilization of PAHs in their first * states.34 A recent CASPT2 study of electronic aromaticity indices of small PAHs further confirm that they lose aromaticity upon excitation to the S1 state.35',

while the calculated activation barriers for the H-atom abstraction by naphthalene and phenantrene in the T1 states are much higher than that for benzene the yields/conversions for the photosilylations of the first two compounds are higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the initial yields of triethylsilylcyclohexadienes are higher than reflected in the low yield of

28.1 kcal mol1, in line with pyrene being unreactive) and are higher than non-aromatic cycloocta-1,3,5-triene (15.5 kcal mol1), showing that other factors than excited-state antiaromaticity relief

less CC bond length alternation than monomeric PAHs in their S1 and T1 states38,39, suggesting reduced antiaromaticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excimer-binding energies, calculated to 822 kcal mol1 in the T1

potential T1-state antiaromaticity of graphene', 'As the larger PAHs display very poor or no photoreactivity in our experiments, one may infer that the infinitely large PAH, graphene, would be unreactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, earlier computations of NICS and electron sharing indices, as well as calculations with the adaptive natural density partitioning method reveal that graphene aromaticity, in contrast to that of PAHs, is local with two -electrons over every hexagon40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the zero bandgap, an excited-state continuum is accessible with infinitesimal excitation energies, making it impossible to determine the influence of excited-state antiaromaticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, if applicable to these states, the antiaromatic character could be dispersed in the infinite 2D sheet and hence become exceptionally weak unless there are means for exciton and excited-state antiaromaticity localization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, graphene quantum dots (large PAHs) were found to display high intersystem crossing rates to long-lived triplet states (4 s)41, possibly enabling sequential multi-photon excitations and thus reactivity from higher (triplet) states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the triplet states of graphene undoubtedly are complex, two features connected to triplet-state antiaromaticity can be important for the understanding of graphene photochemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, for PAHs such as anthracene, pyrene, chrysene and triphenylene, T1 antiaromaticity localizes to a single or a few rings (Fig 3 and Supplementary Figs 113, 116, 119 and 120).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For graphene this could imply that triplet-state antiaromaticity localizes to edges having, for example, armchair segments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, StoneWales defects, composed of two 57 defects in antiparallel orientation42,43, could play a role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the StoneWales defect has a 14-electron perimeter, which could be T1 antiaromatic, our computations indicate that the two five-membered rings become antiaromatic in the T1 state (Supplementary Figs 135136).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, at least two possibilities for triplet-state antiaromaticity localization exist in graphene, providing for increased photoreactivity than the larger PAHs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, to what extent these play a role for graphene photochemistry need separate theoretical and computational investigations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Metal-free photoreactions with graphene', 'Even though our tests could be outside the realm of excited-state antiaromaticity,

that the water content of the HCOOH/H2O mixtures influences the degree of hydrogenation, and the optimal HCOOH/H2O ratio was found to be 1/1 (v/v; Supplementary Fig 82).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also the irradiation time influenced the extent of hydrogenation; 24 h with white light resulted in a twofold increase of the C1s sp3 signal area (and a roughly twofold decrease of C1s sp2 signal area) as compared with 6 h irradiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, irradiation of graphene with solar light for nearly 27 h on Crete, Greece, over two consecutive cloud-free days in August 2014 at 2627 °C resulted in highly hydrogenated graphene according to XPS (Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For detailed description of the experiment see Supplementary Fig 85 and Supplementary Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noteworthy, the degree of hydrogenation after this experiment was higher than after white-LED irradiation using the same 1/1 mixture (see the Supplementary Information).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raman analysis of the treated samples also showed an intense D band, in addition to a significantly less intense 2D band when compared with pristine samples (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations fully agree

image', 'A few photoinduced reactions with graphene have been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, the photochemical phenylation by Liu et al.53 occurs by hot-electron transfer from photoexcited graphene to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of benzoyl peroxide, initiating photodissociation, decarboxylation and formation of phenyl radicals that attach to graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noteworthy, tert-butyl peracetate, having a higher-energy LUMO, could not participate in hot-electron transfer and, accordingly, was unreactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Computations now reveal that neither a hot-electron nor a hot-hole transfer is possible from white-light photoexcited graphene to Et3SiH or HCOOH as their LUMOs and highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are placed at too high and too low energies, respectively (Supplementary Fig 131).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be mentioned that other transfer hydrogenation reagents tried were less efficient than HCOOH/water mixtures.

Si2p XPS spectrum of the treated graphene (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degree of graphene photo(hydro)silylation depends on illumination time, reaching a plateau after 24 h (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evidence that the new peak results from a triethylsilyl group covalently bonded to graphene is obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the projector-augmented wave54-based GPAW55 code (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The geometry optimized partially trans- and cis-hydrosilylated graphene sheets (Fig 6d for trans-adduct) shows Si2p XPS peaks at 102.49 and 102.70 eV, respectively, in line with our experimental value of 102.4 eV (Fig 6a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Noteworthy, cis-addition yields a hydrosilylated graphene, which is 9.5 kcal mol1 (0.41 eV) less stable per formula unit than the trans-adduct.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The computed bulk Si2p XPS peak of SiO2 is at 103.12 eV, which should be close to the substrate peak for pristine graphene on SiO2, that is, in the absence of Et3SiH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This value is rather consistent with the experimental value of 103.7 eV obtained for the SiO2 substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shift to lower binding energies for the Si2p XPS signal of the triethylsilyl group when compared with that of SiO2 can be rationalized by the lower electronegativity of carbon than of oxygen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results clearly reveal photofunctionalization of graphene by silyl group attachments, although it is not resolved whether the product is a hydrosilylated or silylated graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Metal-free
