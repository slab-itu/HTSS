Redox-switch regulatory mechanism of thiolase from Clostridium acetobutylicum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Thiolase is the first enzyme catalysing the condensation of two acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) molecules to form acetoacetyl-CoA in a dedicated pathway towards the biosynthesis of n-butanol, an important solvent and biofuel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we elucidate the crystal structure of Clostridium acetobutylicum thiolase (CaTHL) in its reduced/oxidized states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CaTHL, unlike those from other aerobic bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Zoogloea ramegera, is regulated by the redox-switch modulation through reversible disulfide bond formation between two catalytic cysteine residues, Cys88 and Cys378.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When CaTHL is overexpressed in wild-type C. acetobutylicum, butanol production is reduced due to the disturbance of acidogenic to solventogenic shift.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CaTHLV77Q/N153Y/A286K mutant, which is not able to form disulfide bonds, exhibits higher activity than wild-type CaTHL, and enhances butanol production upon overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these results, we suggest that CaTHL functions as a key enzyme in the regulation of the main metabolism of C. acetobutylicum through a redox-switch regulatory mechanism.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fermentative n-butanol production was first reported by Louis Pasteur in 1861, and the bioprocess was industrialized using Clostridium acetobutylicum isolated by Chaim Weizmann in the early 1900s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The acetonebutanolethanol (ABE) fermentation by Clostridium strains has been known to be the most efficient process for n-butanol production2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Due to the growing worldwide issues such as energy security and climate change, the biotechnological production of n-butanol has been receiving much renewed interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because n-butanol possesses much better fuel characteristics compared with ethanol, such as higher energy content, less corrosiveness, less hygroscopy and easier blendability with gasoline and diesel fuels4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has been known that in anaerobic bacteria of the genus Clostridium n-butanol is synthesized from acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) via six tightly regulated steps that are catalysed by independent proteins7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For more than two decades, numerous engineering attempts were made, ranging from genetic modifications to process optimization, aimed at improving n-butanol production by Clostridium strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite all such effort, n-butanol titres obtained were  less_than 20 g l1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8), which needs to be increased for competitive commercialization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the n-butanol biosynthetic pathway and to enhance the yield of n-butanol, enzymes in the n-butanol biosynthetic pathway have been introduced into commonly used industrial hosts such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus subtilis, because their genetic and physiological characteristics are well defined and various genetic tools exist to favour their modifications9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To enhance n-butanol production by Clostridium strains or engineered heterologous host strains alike, detailed understanding of the reaction and regulatory mechanisms of key enzymes involved in the n-butanol biosynthetic pathway is necessary12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our understanding on the regulatory mechanisms of the enzymes in the n-butanol biosynthetic pathway in Clostridium is rather limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present the crystal structure of C. acetobutylicum thiolase (CaTHL), a type II biosynthetic thiolase that catalyses the first step of n-butanol biosynthesis and condenses two acetyl-CoAs to acetoacetyl-CoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reveal that CaTHL, unlike other type II biosynthetic thiolases from aerobic bacteria, is regulated via modulation of a redox-switch, indicating that n-butanol production and the relevant metabolic fluxes in Clostridium are tightly regulated by thiolase.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

been reported in other type II biosynthetic thiolases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disulfide bond formation was followed by a large conformational change in the catalytic cysteine loop (CIGGGQG, residues

size image', 'Structure of the reduced form of CaTHL', 'The unusual disulfide bond formation and large structural changes observed in the oxidized form of CaTHL (but not in ZrTHL) raised the possibility of the influence of the redox state on the folding kinetics of CaTHL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the role of the redox state on the structural properties of CaTHL, the crystal structure of the reduced form of CaTHL was also determined using the C378S mutant CaTHL, a protein that cannot form a disulfide bond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The active state configuration of the reduced form of CaTHL was similar to that of ZrTHL, in which the two cysteine residues involved in the disulfide bond formation in the oxidized form positioned apart with a distance of 6.4 Å (Fig 2b,c,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catalytic cysteine loop in the reduced form of CaTHL moved back to the active site by 8 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the flexible region was found to be highly ordered, forming the native sheetturnhelix conformation as observed in ZrTHL (Fig 2c,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the reduced form of CaTHL, the positions of two catalytic cysteine residues and the conformation of the catalytic cysteine loop were restored, resulting in an active form of the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, the crystal structure of the reduced form of CaTHL in complex with CoA was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The catalytic residues such as Cys88, Cys378 and His348 were observed to be located at the same positions as those of the corresponding residues of ZrTHL, indicating that the catalytic mechanism might be identical to that of ZrTHL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the CoA-binding mode of CaTHL was quite unique when compared with that of ZrTHL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CaTHL, His218 residue, whose corresponding residue is Tyr218 in ZrTHL, is involved in the stabilization of pyrophosphate moiety of CoA, and Ser223 residue is located at the position of Ala223 in ZrTHL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in CaTHL, Arg133 residue from the neighbouring polypeptide is involved in the stabilization of pyrophosphate moiety of CoA through hydrogen bond, whereas the corresponding Lys133 residue in ZrTHL has conformation distal from the bound CoA (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Redox-switch regulatory mechanism of CaTHL', 'In general, redox-mediated modification of cellular proteins confers a response to reactive oxygen species, and the changes in response to redox status regulate the initiation of signal transduction pathways and the induction of gene expression21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The crystal structures of oxidized and reduced forms of CaTHL and its complex with CoA suggest that, unlike other known type II biosynthetic thiolases, CaTHL is regulated by a redox-switch modulation through reversible disulfide bond formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify a redox-switch modulation and the disulfide bond formation in CaTHL, the susceptibility of different thiolases, including CaTHL, ZrTHL and EcTHL, to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which causes the loss of enzyme activity, was examined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the thiolases were treated with various concentrations of H2O2, all three of them lost the activity in the presence of H2O2 at 100 M or higher concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When dithiothreitol (DTT) (10 mM) was added to switch the protein to a reduced state, the activity of CaTHL was almost completely recovered for all concentrations of H2O2, whereas the activities of ZrTHL and EcTHL could not be completely recovered when H2O2 concentration was higher than 100 M (Fig 3ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that CaTHL is reversibly inactivated by oxidative stress through the disulfide bond formation between the two catalytic residues, Cys88 and Cys378, which enables the enzyme to protect its active site from oxygen radicals and be reactivated upon switching back to a reducing condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The redox titration experiments were performed to determine the redox potential of the disulfide in CaTHL, and was 269.54 mV (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, ZrTHL and EcTHL seem to be permanently inactivated upon the oxidation of the corresponding catalytic cysteine residues to sulfinic or sulfonic acid, and cannot be switched back to the active enzymes under reducing condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: CaTHL

different organisms sense redox environment, CaTHL, ZrTHL and EcTHL proteins were treated with various concentrations of H2O2 and thiolase activity was measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DTT with 10 mM final concentration was then added to switch the environment to a reduced state, and compared the activity recovery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over 80% of activity was recovered from CaTHL that treated with even 500 M H2O2 (a), whereas almost no activity was recovered from ZrTHL and EcTHL that treated with more than 400 M H2O2 (b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Activity of four thiolases at various concentrations of

rather than forming a disulfide bond under oxidized condition19, which is responsible for the permanent loss of its activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, ZrTHL is a non-redox-switch regulated enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, the crystal structure of EcTHL was also determined at 2.10 Å resolution (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As hypothesized, there was no disulfide bond formation observed between the two catalytic cysteine residues, Cys89 and Cys379, under oxidized condition (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the absence of a disulfide bond, the catalytic cysteine loop and the flexible region had similar conformations to those of the reduced form of CaTHL, confirming that EcTHL is also non-redox-switch regulated (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, unlike ZrTHL and EcTHL, CaTHL senses the oxidative stress and protects its active site via reversible disulfide bond formation; this redox-switch modulation is a unique feature of CaTHL identified for the first

conferring such unique mechanism, as compared with other type II biosynthetic thiolases that possess the same catalytic mechanisms, similar overall domain architectures, and highly similar amino acid sequence identities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was hypothesized that a detailed structural comparison of the flexible regions of CaTHL, EcTHL and ZrTHL might provide an answer to this question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The flexible regions of EcTHL and ZrTHL are well stabilized by direct and water-mediated hydrogen bond network; on the other hand, in CaTHL, strong hydrogen bond interactions are not observed between the flexible region and its surrounding region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absence of hydrogen bonds might cause less stability of the flexible region in CaTHL (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Considering that the flexible region of CaTHL undergoes an order-to-disorder conformational change depending on the disulfide bond formation, it seems that the stability of the flexible region of CaTHL is not sufficiently high, leading to disulfide bond formation under oxidized condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would confer the redox-switch regulatory mechanism to the enzyme; on the other hand, the highly stabilized flexible regions of EcTHL and ZrTHL disable the rotation of the Cys378 residue and hence prevent disulfide bond formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, it can be concluded that the stability of the flexible region determines the regulatory mechanism of THL, and thus, the flexible region can be considered as a regulatory determinant region (RDR).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Role of CaTHL during the phase transition', 'It is well known that the fermentation of C. acetobutylicum shows two distinct phases: acidogenic phase where acetic and butyric acids are produced, followed by solventogenic phase where the acids produced are reassimilated and converted to n-butanol and ethanol with concomitant production of acetone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CaTHL competes with phosphotransacetylase involved in acetic acid biosynthesis for acetyl-CoA to produce butyric acid during acidogenic phase, while competes with aldehyde alcohol dehydrogenase during solventogenic phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, regulation of thiolase activity in C. acetobutylicum can contribute to controlling the ATP yield and NAD+ regeneration at the acetyl-CoA node (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intracellular CaTHL can be regulated by CoASH, butyryl-CoA and ATP; CaTHL is sensitive to CoASH at micro-molar level, and to butyryl-CoA and ATP at 1 and 10 mM, respectively24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been reported that solventogenesis is induced by a certain intracellular level of butyric acid and butyryl phosphate25,26,27 as well as the change of culture pH (refs 28, 29, 30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These previous findings might be explained by the newly discovered redox-switch regulatory mechanism of CaTHL, which might be involved in the regulation of switching from acidogenic phase to solventogenic phase in

gene was overexpressed in the C. acetobutylicum wild-type strain ATCC 824 under the control of its native promoter, n-butanol production (4.5 g l1) was decreased compared to the wild-type strain (10.7 g l1) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, butyric acid (7.1 g l1) and acetic acid (5.4 g l1) concentrations were higher than those (4.4 and 3.7 g l1, respectively) obtained with the wild-type strain (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Butyric and acetic acids were hardly reassimilated (Fig 5) with the low acetate uptake flux (rACUP) and butyrate uptake flux (rBUUP) (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6), indicating that overexpression of CaTHL disturbs proper phase transition from acidogenesis to solventogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. acetobutylicum overexpressing CaTHL cannot reassimilate butyrate promptly, which causes the genes responsible for solventogenic enzymes uninduced to respond to butyrate production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the expression of CoA transferase involving acid reassimilation was not detected during phase transition from acidogenic to solventogenic phases by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Supplementary Figs 7 and 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: In

the redox-switch regulatory mechanism of CaTHL and its effect on the regulation of C. acetobutylicum physiology, a non-redox-regulated CaTHL mutant was generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the

agent (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More interestingly, the mutated residues, V77Q, N153Y and A286K, were positioned to form hydrogen bonds with each other (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hydrogen bonds seem to contribute to the well-ordered conformation of the RDR in the CaTHLV77Q/N153Y/A286K mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the RDR of the mutant was stabilized, and thus prevented

the thlA-knockdown mutant complemented with the thlCa (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with the results of in vitro thiolase activity measurement, these results indicate that redox-regulatory mechanism of CaTHL is important in regulating n-butanol production in C. acetobutylicum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, the redox-switch regulatory mechanism of CaTHL is quite unique, and is responsible for modulating metabolic fluxes at the acetyl-CoA node during the fermentation of C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It has been shown that a redox-switch modulation is a general regulatory mechanism in peroxisomal type I degradative thiolases31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanism of redox-switch modulation of CaTHL is quite different from that of the type I degradative thiolase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In type I degradative thiolase, a disulfide bond is formed between one of the catalytic cysteine residues and a cysteine residue located in domain II of the enzyme.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, two catalytic cysteine residues are involved in the formation of a disulfide bond in CaTHL as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in the cysteine residues involved in the disulfide bond formation further causes a big difference in the mode of conformational changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the classification based on five  angles of disulfide bonds33,34, the configuration of the disulfide bond of CaTHL is +/LHSpiral, which is different from common configurations, such as RHStaple, LHHook, and /+RHHook, found in redox-switch regulated proteins using a reversible disulfide bond35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, peroxisomal type I degradative thiolase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtKAT) showed a LHSpiral configuration31 (Supplementary Fig 11; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously reported that succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenases from human and E. coli are controlled by different regulatory mechanisms, redox-switch or non-redox-switch modulation, although they have similar structures and catalytic reactions36,37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with the difference in regulatory mechanism of thiolases described above, we propose that enzymes performing the same catalytic reaction could possess different regulatory mechanisms, redox-switch or non-redox-switch modulation, depending on the cellular function of the enzyme and environmental redox potential in which the enzyme is located.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that C. acetobutylicum is a strict anaerobe and synthesizes n-butanol as a main fermentation product through the phase transition from acidogenesis to solventogenesis, it is likely that, unlike aerobic bacteria such as E. coli and Z. ramigera, it is adapted to have a redox-switch regulated THL for the precise control of the biphasic fermentation (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Schematic diagram of redox-switch modulation of CaTHL.CaTHL catalyses the condensation reaction of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an oxidized status, two catalytic cysteine residues, Cys88 and Cys378, are oxidized forming a disulfide bond, leading to the enzyme inactive and eventually the blockage of the C4 metabolites (n-butanol and butyric acid) biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the environment is switched to a reduced status, the disulfide bond is broken and thiol groups of two catalytic residues form an active site environment, enabling the C4 metabolites (n-butanol and butyric acid) biosynthesis.Full size image', 'For the formation of acetic acid, 1 mol of ATP is generated with 1 mol of CoASH regeneration from 1 mol of acetyl-CoA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, only 0.5 mol of ATP is generated with each mole of CoASH and NAD+ regeneration via the butyric acid pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, formation of the disulfide bond between the two catalytic residues Cys88 and Cys378 in CaTHL can be facilitated by intracellular events caused by changing level of CoASH, butyryl-CoA and ATP, while the disulfide bond can be reduced by reactions involving the cellular reductants (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, the intracellular redox status is in a reduced state under physiological conditions, which results in free thiols in most cysteine residues39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such intracellular reduced condition often results from the presence of cellular reductants: small peptides with redox-active cysteine residues (thioredoxin and glutaredoxin) and low-molecular-weight thiols (glutathione, glutathionylspermidine, coenzyme B, coenzyme M, mycothiol, ergothioneine, and so on).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in the oxidized form of CaTHL, the conformational change between the catalytic cysteine loop and the RDR forms a hole that enables the cellular reductants to access to the disulfide bond (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the hole size is not big enough to accommodate C. acetobutylicum thioredoxins (105106 amino acid residues) or glutaredoxin (76 amino acid residues).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the low-molecular-weight thiols can only be accommodated to the hole.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the glutathione system present and well understood in gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli and Alcaligenes faecalis, C. acetobutylicum lacks the genes for synthesizing glutathione.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it has been reported that thiols yet unknown are present at significant levels in clostridia40, suggesting that additional novel thiols might be involved in redox regulation of the two catalytic residues Cys88 and Cys378 in CaTHL (redox potential of 269.54 mV).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies will be needed to identify such novel thiols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It was interesting to find that non-redox-regulated mutant CaTHLV77Q/N153Y/A286K, incapable of forming disulfide bond, showed a higher in vitro enzyme activity than the wild-type enzyme (Fig 3d), which resulted in the enhanced butanol production upon its overexpression (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent study, CaTHL has also been engineered for reduced sensitivity towards its inhibitor CoASH through random mutant library screening41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 expressing a mutant CaTHL containing three amino acid substitutions (R133G, H156N and G222V) showed increased butanol production by 18% compared with the control strain41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, CaTHL seems to be responsible for controlling the metabolic fluxes in C. acetobutylicum by redox-switch modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further supporting these findings, overexpression of CaTHL in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 showed a remarkable metabolic shift that disturbed acidogenic to solventogenic transition (Fig 5; Supplementary Fig 6); the fermentation profiles were consistent with those reported previously, which showed production of 4.0 g l1 n-butanol, 6.7 g l1 butyric acid and 4.1 g l1 acetic acid by the recombinant ATCC 824 strain overexpressing CaTHL42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such metabolic shift in CaTHL overexpressing strain could simply be restored by co-overexpression of the adhE1Ca gene encoding aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase using the acidogenic ptb promoter42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-overexpression of the adhE1Ca gene together with the thlCa gene during the acidogenic phase could promote early n-butanol formation, which led to the normal phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that the redox-switch modulation indeed affects the in vivo activity of CaTHL, which consequently alters metabolic flux profiles and the fermentation phase transition as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have determined the unique crystal structure of C. acetobutylicum type II biosynthetic thiolase at 1.77 Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike other type II biosynthetic thiolases from aerobic bacteria, C. acetobutylicum thiolase is regulated by a redox-switch modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the structural findings together with the results of in vivo studies, we propose that the physiological regulation of C. acetobutylicum thiolase is mediated by redox-switch modulation during the biphasic fermentation, affecting overall metabolic flux distribution and the acidogenic to solventogenic phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results will be useful for deciphering fermentation characteristics of C. acetobutylicum, and designing metabolic engineering and fermentation strategies for enhanced n-butanol production.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
