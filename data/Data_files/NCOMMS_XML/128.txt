Ankyrin-mediated self-protection during cell invasion by the bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Predatory Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus are natural antimicrobial organisms, killing other bacteria by whole-cell invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-protection against prey-metabolizing enzymes is important for the evolution of predation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initial prey entry involves the predators peptidoglycan DD-endopeptidases, which decrosslink cell walls and prevent wasteful entry by a second predator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify and characterize a self-protection protein from B. bacteriovorus, Bd3460, which displays an ankyrin-based fold common to intracellular pathogens of eukaryotes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-crystal structures reveal Bd3460 complexation of dual targets, binding a conserved epitope of each of the Bd3459 and Bd0816 endopeptidases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complexation inhibits endopeptidase activity and cell wall decrosslinking in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Self-protection is vital  Bd3460 Bdellovibrio deleteriously decrosslink self-peptidoglycan upon invasion, adopt a round morphology, and lose predatory capacity and cellular integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis provides the first mechanistic examination of self-protection in Bdellovibrio, documents protection-multiplicity for products of two different genomic loci, and reveals an important evolutionary adaptation to an invasive predatory bacterial lifestyle.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Bdellovibrio are deltaproteobacteria that enter and kill diverse pathogenic Gram-negative bacterial species and have been tested as possible whole-cell antibacterial agents1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a periplasmic predator that enters through the outer membrane of prey and metabolizes the infected cell from within3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intracellular lifestyle of B. bacteriovorus requires many specialized adaptations4, one of which is the formation of the osmotically-stable bdelloplast, wherein the (usually) rod-shaped prey cell becomes rounded up immediately after Bdellovibrio instigates prey invasion5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This rounding is caused by prey peptidoglycan cell wall modification, catalysed by Bdellovibrio enzymes6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The B. bacteriovorus genome encodes many predation-associated genes, additional to those for self cell wall maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These gene products modify prey peptidoglycan in sequential, but different, ways to facilitate bdelloplast formation: withstanding initial predator-invasion without breaking; accommodating the invasive Bdellovibrio growing within; withstanding and becoming ready for final lysis when Bdellovibrio replication is complete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these cell cycle concepts and associated cell wall modifications are predicted and seen microscopically as events, few activities have been directly attributed to specific Bdellovibrio predatory gene products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously, we assigned prey cell rounding to the action of two secreted Bdellovibrio peptidoglycan DD-endopeptidases, Bd0816 and Bd3459, that act to modify the invaded cell wall via hydrolysis of the structural 3-4 peptide crosslinks6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prey morphology-change catalysed by these enzymes functioned as an occupancy signal, preventing wasteful entry by successive predators and speeding up prey invasion6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, rounded prey-bdelloplast formation, catalysed by the pair of DD-endopeptidase enzymes (Bd3459, Bd0816) was found to promote a 1:1 predator to prey cell ratio and drive population fitness, preventing self-competition between individual Bdellovibrio for the same prey cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature is important as although the long range encounter between predator Bdellovibrio and a cloud of potential prey involves chemotaxis7; the final short range encounter cannot be guided by chemotaxis as bacteria do not sense chemotactically along their cell bodies at short range8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, several Bdellovibrio will arrive at a single prey cell as they cannot use self or prey sensing to prevent this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Bdellovibrio are released as a cloud of predators by lysis of an adjacent infected bdelloplast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the occupancy signal of DD-endopeptidase-mediated rounding does prevent multiple entry to a single prey cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus these DD-endopeptidase enzymes are vital to predation efficiency but they also target peptidoglycan, which is common to both predator and prey; the evolutionary fitness benefit of eliminating auto-competition brings with it a risk of self-damage which must be mitigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structure and activity analyses of DD-endopeptidase Bd3459 revealed a highly active enzyme with an open active site adapted for prey peptidoglycan diversity, rather than self-wall maintenance (this was also inferred for the homologous Bd0816).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raised the intriguing question of how Bdellovibrio protects its own cell wall from modification/destruction by Bd3459 and Bd0816 passing through its own periplasm when invading prey6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we instigated a search to find a potential self-protection protein that could act to block endopeptidase activity in the predator, while such DD-endopeptidases were being secreted, past their own peptidoglycan cell wall to that of the prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus utilizes a small ankyrin repeat protein, Bd3460, to protect itself from endopeptidase activities during entry of prey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that endopeptidase complexation by Bd3460 prevents cell wall decrosslinking, and that both the Bd0816 and Bd3459 targets bind this self-protection protein via a common epitope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predators lacking this protection are observed to deleteriously self-round upon cell contact and endopeptidase induction; thus forming an abortive spheroplast-like shape at the entry pore and negating prey cell entry & killing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Characterization of a Bdellovibrio self-protection protein', 'Reasoning that protective protein(s) should act on both DD-endopeptidase gene products in the periplasm, we examined the gene neighbourhoods of bd0816 and of bd3460 initially looking for a common pair of potential immunity genes, which we didnt find.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene bd0816 is preceded by a small 150 bp gene without a signal peptide; bd3460 however encodes a small 23 kDa protein, with predicted ankyrin repeats on a signal peptide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ankyrin-repeat proteins (ARPs) are often involved in protein-protein interactions and can be found in several toxins and their associated immunity proteins9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ARPs are rare in bacteria, but are enriched in intracellular parasites of eukaryotes where they are chiefly used to modulate host cell processes11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bd3459 endopeptidase/bd3460 ARP gene synteny, albeit with ARP expressed after the protein it should protect against (see explanation later), is shared in other periplasmic predator genomes12, and is absent in related strains exhibiting epibiotic predation (which adhere to prey but do not invade13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cumulative evidence suggested that Bd3460 could represent the first self-protection protein identified in predatory bacteria, a hypothesis we test and validate in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Co-transcription of bd3459 and bd3460 was established via semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig 1, showing peak expression at prey invasion timepoints).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-purification of tagged Bd3459/Bd0816 and untagged Bd3460 indicated a 1:1 complex formation in-vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions were confirmed and quantified using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission measurements (Supplementary Fig 2);
