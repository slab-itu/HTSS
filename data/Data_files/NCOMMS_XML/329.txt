Drift transport of helical spin coherence with tailored spinorbit interactions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Most future information processing techniques using electron spins in non-magnetic semiconductors will require both the manipulation and transfer of spins without their coherence being lost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spinorbit effective magnetic field induced by drifting electrons enables us to rotate the electron spins in the absence of an external magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the fluctuations in the effective magnetic field originating from the random scattering of electrons also cause undesirable spin decoherence, which limits the length scale of the spin transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate the drift transport of electron spins adjusted to a robust spin structure, namely a persistent spin helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the persistent spin helix enhances the spatial coherence of drifting spins, resulting in maximized spin decay length near the persistent spin helix condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the enhanced distance of the spin transport, the transport path of electron spins can be modulated by employing time-varying in-plane voltages.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Transporting electron spins in spinorbit coupled systems is the key to developing future spintronics devices and spin-based information processing1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conduction electrons moving in semiconductors experience the spinorbit interaction (SOI) as an effective magnetic field, which enables us to rotate the electron spins in the absence of an external magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, the SOI also has an adverse effect: the fluctuations in the effective magnetic field originating from the random scattering of electrons also cause undesirable spin decoherence4, which limits the length scale of spin transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhancement of spin coherence during drift transport is essential for spin-based devices but has yet to be demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The two-dimensional electron systems in semiconductors are promising for manipulating travelling spins with controllable SOIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is not just because of their high mobility, which leads to high-speed spin transfer, but also because of the ability to tune the strength of the Rashba SOI5 by applying a vertical electric field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the tunability of the SOI also provides the chance to balance the Dresselhaus and Rashba SOIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This condition results in a robust spin structure for spin-independent scattering, namely a persistent spin helix (PSH), which has a helical spin density wave with an infinite spin lifetime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PSH has been theoretically predicted6,7 and experimentally demonstrated by measuring the lifetime of the helical spin mode generated by the transient spin grating technique8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we demonstrate the drift transport of electron spins in the PSH state, which has so far only been studied without lateral electric fields8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, Yang et al.11,12 observed the drift transport of helical spin structures under unbalanced Dresselhaus and Rashba SOI conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that the balanced condition realized by careful tuning of the gate-controlled Rashba SOI will effectively extend the length of the drift spin transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our experiment, a multi-cycle spin precession was observed for a specific direction, while it was completely quenched for other orthogonal directions, reflecting the achievement of an exactly balanced SOI condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A theoretical model reproduced the spin distributions well and revealed that the spin decay length is maximized near the PSH condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the enhanced distance of the spin transport, the transport path of electron spins can be modulated by employing time-varying in-plane voltages, suggesting the possibility of coherent spin manipulation via geometrically controlled SOIs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Sample design and measurement principle', 'We used two-dimensional electron systems in (001) IIIV semiconductor quantum wells (QWs), which provide SOIs suited to the direct observation of a PSH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The k-linear term of the SOI Hamiltonian for this system is written as HSO=()kyx(+)kxy, using a coordinate system with base vectors ,  and .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The parameters  and  represent the strengths of Rashba and Dresselhaus SOIs, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the balanced condition where = (=), the effective magnetic fields become unidirectional along y(x) and proportional to kx(ky), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This results in the appearance of a helical spin mode or PSH that is robust against spin-independent scattering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An optical technique using the magneto-optic effect enables us to access the helical mode through the distribution of the z-component of the spins, which forms stripe patterns in a two-dimensional plane9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To investigate the drift transport of helical spin states, we designed two samples, each of which contains a single GaAs/AlGaAs QW (dQW thicknesses of 15 and 25 nm) embedded in a high electron mobility transistor structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy band structures calculated by the k·p perturbation theory13 allowed us to estimate the strengths of  and , which are close to the PSH condition () for the 25-nm-thick QW, whereas they are far from the PSH condition ( less_than ) for the 15-nm-thick QW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were grown by molecular-beam epitaxy and fabricated into cross-shaped mesa structures with four ohmic contacts (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The samples were covered with semi-transparent Au gate electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The voltage applied to the ohmic contacts (Vx or Vy) creates electric fields to transport electrons in the QW plane, while the top gate voltage (Vg) allows us to tune the Rashba SOI strength simultaneously5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Creation of drift spin flows in a cross-shaped device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of top view of our samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) In-plane electric field dependence of spin distribution in steady state in 25-nm-thick QW at Vg=4.45 V.Full size image', 'We employed Kerr microscopy to measure the spin dynamics of drifting electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A circularly polarized pump light from a continuous wave (cw) Ti:sapphire laser generates electron spins oriented in the z direction at a certain position defined as (x, y)=(0, 0) on the QW, and a linearly polarized light probes the magneto-optic Kerr rotation K, which is proportional to the spin density at the focused position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the microscopic measurement of spin coherence, the pump and probe lights were focused on the sample with 6 and 3 m diameter spots, which are smaller than the typical spin precession length resulting from an SOI (20 m) estimated for the present QWs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Kerr imaging of drift spin transport', 'The application of an in-plane electric field changes the spin transport regime significantly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b shows a one-dimensional scan of K along the x-axis measured for different in-plane voltages Vx and a fixed Vg of 4.45 V applied to the 25-nm-thick QW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symmetrical diffusion of the spins at Vx=0 V shows the spin precession caused by the SOI, as reported previously9, but it only appears in a small area |x|10 m. When we increase |Vx|, the signal becomes asymmetric, indicating that spins flow in the electron drift direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Kerr signals observed under in-plane electric fields provided real-space imaging of the drifting spins in a steady state, whose dynamics have been previously investigated in QWs only with a Dresselhaus SOI by spin grating spectroscopy11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oscillating signal of drifting spins is maintained for a much longer distance than at Vx=0 V, thus enabling us to determine the SOI strengths more precisely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The effects induced by the coexistence of the Rashba and Dresselhaus SOIs appear as anisotropy of the spatial precession frequency for different moving directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2ac maps the spatial distribution of electron spins drifting in the  and 110 directions as well as that of spins without drift motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the 15-nm-thick QW under Vg=5.0 V (Fig 2a), the precessions have different spatial frequencies for the x and y directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is attributed to the anisotropic effective magnetic fields, which are expected to be proportional to |+| for kx and || for ky. Because of the moderate anisotropy of the effective magnetic field in the 15-nm-thick QW, the K oscillations caused by the spin precession have several periods in both directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, in the 25-nm-thick QW (Fig 2b,c) the extreme anisotropy has a large effect on the spatial precession frequency, namely the precessions of spins drifting along the y-axis slow almost to a halt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a slow precession cannot be resolved by the stripe patterns in the small region observed in the regime where no in-plane electric field is applied9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the extended transport length for drifting spins along y reveals a rotation of more than  caused by a small effective magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By carefully tuning Vg from 4.40 V (Fig 2b) to 4.28 V, (Fig 2c), we achieved a condition where the spin precession was halted completely even in the drifting regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates the uniaxial configuration of the effective magnetic fields, which provide the exact SU(2) symmetry with great accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Mapping of spins with/without in-plane electric fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Kerr rotation image of spins with/without in-plane electric fields in 15-nm-thick QW at Vg=5.0 V (a), and 25-nm-thick QW at Vg=4.4 V (b) and 4.28 V (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insets are cross-sectional patterns of drifting spins in the x and y directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (df) Spatial mapping of drifting spins simulated by SDD model, corresponding to af.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Insets show effective magnetic fields in k-space for given SOI parameters.Full size image', 'For a quantitative analysis of the spin dynamics during drift transport, we extracted two parameters that characterize the two-dimensional distribution of the Kerr rotation signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fitted the cross-sectional profile of the data with a function K(d)=exp(d/ls) cos(2d/LSO), where d is the distance from the origin, ls is the spin decay length caused by the spin diffusion and/or decoherence, and LSO is the spin precession length in which electron spins rotate a full cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2ac, the data are fitted well and allow us to obtain the SOI parameters by using the following relations:', '', '', 'where  and m* are Plancks constant and the effective mass of an electron, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LSO obtained by the fitting and SOI parameters calculated from Equations (1) and (2) are summarized in Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed that  is tuned by the gate voltage and has the same value as  at Vg=4.28 V.

wavenumber kF and drift wavenumber kd=m*vd/ are estimated to be 107 m1 or smaller for the condition used in the experiment, thus the cubic term (cubic=k3/) should be one or two orders smaller than the linear term (linear=2k/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ds values were estimated from the lateral broadening of the Kerr rotation signal for the spins drifting in the x direction (shown in Table 1), and the v

function of x and  for the drift spins moving in the x direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because we fixed the  value in the calculation, we can expect the spatial precession frequency  to increase linearly

LSO diverges from the balanced condition =, indicating that the suppression of the Dyakonov- Perel' (DP) spin relaxation caused by PSH also appears in the spin transport length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the fact that the spin decay length in the experiment is shorter than in the simulation could be due to spin decoherence caused by the cubic Dresselhaus term although its magnitude is one order smaller than the linear Dresselhaus term.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Figure 3: SOI dependence of spin dynamics of drifting spins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Comparison of simulated and
