Low excitatory innervation balances high intrinsic excitability of immature dentate neurons  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Persistent neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus produces immature neurons with high intrinsic excitability and low levels of inhibition that are predicted to be more broadly responsive to afferent activity than mature neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mounting evidence suggests that these immature neurons are necessary for generating distinct neural representations of similar contexts, but it is unclear how broadly responsive neurons help distinguish between similar patterns of afferent activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that stimulation of the entorhinal cortex in mouse brain slices paradoxically generates spiking of mature neurons in the absence of immature neuron spiking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immature neurons with high intrinsic excitability fail to spike due to insufficient excitatory drive that results from low innervation rather than silent synapses or low release probability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that low synaptic connectivity prevents immature neurons from responding broadly to cortical activity, potentially enabling excitable immature neurons to contribute to sparse and orthogonal dentate representations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The dentate gyrus (DG) has long been associated with the computational task of pattern separation, or the transformation of similar input patterns to output patterns that are less correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sparse population coding is an essential component of pattern separation because the storage capacity for neural activity patterns is inversely related to the proportion of active principal neurons in a network1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, sensory stimulation or spatial memory tasks activate only a small fraction of DG granule cells (GCs) ( less_than 5%)4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theories of DG pattern separation propose that strong inhibition selects small and distinct populations of active GCs in a manner that amplifies slight differences in inputs2,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, manipulating the small population of adult born GCs is sufficient to alter behaviours that require discrimination of similar contexts12,13,14,15,16, leading to the idea that adult born neurons have an important role in pattern separation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is unclear how GCs of various developmental stages contribute to DG network functions15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One way that newly generated GCs may contribute to DG function is if their distinct physiological properties confer unique contributions to coding processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ex vivo studies have shown that the morphological, intrinsic and synaptic properties of newly generated GCs undergo a protracted process of maturation during which immature GCs could transiently perform distinct network functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much attention has focused on a period when immature GCs are synaptically integrated within the circuit and also exhibit high intrinsic excitability that allow spiking in response to small current injections as well as distinctive integrative properties17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this developmental stage that occurs 4 weeks after cell birth, immature GCs also exhibit less synaptic inhibition than mature GCs, and afferent stimulation preferentially generates spiking in (that is, recruits) immature GCs over mature GCs20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in comparison to mature GCs, immature GCs appear to be highly excitable and broadly responsive, acting as good integrators of afferent activity15,23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, it is not clear how the physiological properties of immature GCs identified ex vivo contribute to putative higher order functions in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a theoretical standpoint it is surprising that broadly responsive neurons contribute to the computational task of pattern separation since neurons that act as integrators reduce sparse population coding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, inclusion of excitable immature GCs in a realistic network model degrades rather than improves pattern separation23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the contribution of immature GCs to network activity in vivo has been difficult to assess.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Preferential recruitment of immature GCs in vivo was reported using cFos as a proxy for neural activation6,7, but this conclusion has been disputed8,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo recordings from the DG of rodents has identified distinct functional populations with overall sparse patterns of activity in presumed principal cells4,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But the interpretation of how immature GCs contribute to this activity has been conflicting, ranging from the possibility that immature GCs make up the entire population of active DG neurons26 to more recent evidence that mature GCs are predominantly active during memory encoding27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At developmental stages when intrinsic excitability is high, immature GCs also exhibit features that suggest low glutamatergic synaptic connectivity, including small dendritic arbors, low spine densities and small evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs)18,20,22,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we assess the role of synaptic connectivity in recruiting spiking in mature and immature GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that low excitatory connectivity from the entorhinal cortex (EC) prevents excitable immature GCs from spiking in response to afferent activity that is sufficient to generate spiking in mature GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although immature GCs can spike with fewer active inputs than mature GCs (challenging the specific role of immature GCs in disambiguating input patterns), low innervation predicts that immature GCs sample a smaller component of EC afferent activity and thus exhibit lower correlations in synaptic inputs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Incorporating these results into a simple network model reveals that the combination of high excitability and low synaptic connectivity potentially provides an unexpected computational advantage wherein immature GCs enhance the range of EC activity levels that can be maintained with well-separated output representations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Immature GC spiking is limited by low excitatory drive', 'In adult hippocampal slices, immature GCs that are approximately 4 weeks post mitosis are more likely than mature GCs to spike in response to stimulation in the molecular layer (ML), a paradigm in which synchronized perforant path excitatory drive is above spike threshold hence spiking is largely determined by synaptic inhibition and almost all cells spike when inhibition is blocked20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, synchronous stimulation of a beam of perforant path axons in the ML may not provide excitatory drive representative of neuronal activity of EC projection neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, whole-cell (WC) recordings from mature GCs in vivo show a constant barrage of -modulated asynchronous EPSCs arising from EC that is associated with infrequent spiking31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus sought to compare the relative spiking probably of mature and immature GCs in response to more diffuse afferent activity provided by direct stimulation of EC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used NestinCreERT2 or NestinCreERTM4 mice22,32,33 crossed with Ai14 Cre reporter mice at 3036 days post tamoxifen injection to identify immature GCs (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with prior characterization of intrinsic and synaptic maturation of GCs in NestinCreERT2 mice22, at this interval tdTomato (tdT)-labelled (immature) GCs displayed repetitive spiking in response to current injections (Fig 1b,c), a characteristic that develops after 3 weeks of neuronal maturation in retroviral labelled GCs18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other intrinsic properties of immature GCs were consistent with 4-week-old GCs identified by retroviral labelling18,20 whereas unlabelled GCs with fully mature membrane properties were classified as mature (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The persistence of some immature intrinsic properties in GCs recorded up to 36 days post tamoxifen injection is consistent with the slow rate of maturation in the ventral hippocampus from mice housed under standard conditions30,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Identification of immature and mature GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Timeline of the experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (top) NestinCreERT2 mice received three daily tamoxifen injections at P22-24 to induce tdT expression followed by recordings 3036 days later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (bottom) Because of the lower efficacy of the NestinCreERT2 line58, some experiments were performed in NestinCreERTM4 mice that received 1 day of tamoxifen injection at P22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (right) Confocal image showing tdT-labelled cells in a 50 m section from a perfusion-fixed NestinCreERTM4 mouse at 36 days PTI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asterisks indicate putative type 1 cells with radial glial morphology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immature GCs with dendrites projecting through the ML (arrowheads) were targeted for recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 m.

Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, EPSPs in immature GCs were likewise smaller than EPSPs in mature GCs (Fig 2e), even when cell pairs with no input to the immature GC were excluded from analysis (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addition of gabazine enhanced EPSPs in immature GCs (amplitude increased from 6.7±1.3 mV to 8.1±1.4 mV, n=6, P=0.03, Wilcoxon test), but still failed to elicit spikes despite the ability of immature GCs to spike with current injections (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, enhanced intrinsic excitability of immature GCs does not fully compensate for reduced excitatory drive in this paradigm18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, sequential recordings from two mature GCs using the same paradigm resulted in identical EPSCs/EPSPs in the second mature GC, confirming that neighbouring mature GCs were sampling synaptic inputs from the same population of active fibres and that small EPSCs in immature GCs did not result from optimizing the stimulation for the first mature GC or other experimental bias (n=9 pairs of mature GCs; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, 3/18 (16.6%) of these mature GCs displayed spiking, confirming the spiking probability of mature GCs in this paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The small EPSCs in immature GCs and failure to spike under conditions where mature GCs could be recruited to spike suggests that synaptic connectivity plays a crucial role in selecting active GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But to rule out the possibility that our WC recordings altered spiking behaviour by disrupting the intracellular milieu, we also examined spiking using noninvasive cell-attached (CA) recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we could not assess excitatory drive (synaptic responses) using CA recordings, we first used WC recording from a mature GC to confirm effective MEC/LEC stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, without moving the stimulating electrodes, we assessed spiking using sequential CA recordings from multiple GCs within the field of view.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In nine experiments where we evoked relatively large EPSCs monitored by WC recordings from mature GCs, we made a total of 57 CA recordings from nearby immature and mature GCs (Fig 3a,b; note that there are many more mature GCs than immature GCs in each field of view).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the WC recordings, 22% of mature GCs (9/41) exhibited spikes in CA mode, whereas none of the immature GCs displayed spikes (0/16; 2=4.1, P=0.041).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The WC and CA results were not different, so we pooled all experiments to illustrate that immature GCs were less likely than mature GCs to spike in response to MEC/LEC stimulation (0/34 and 17/74, respectively, P=0.006; Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since immature GCs could spike in response to current injection, the failure to spike in response to EC stimulation resulted from insufficient excitatory depolarization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, comparing EPSPs and spiking probability illustrated that EPSPs in immature GCs generated by MEC/LEC stimulation were too small to achieve threshold (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus low excitatory drive can prevent spiking of immature GCs in response to MEC/LEC stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of spiking in this stimulating paradigm, however, does not mean that immature GCs fail to spike to any stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, preferential afferent-induced spiking of immature GCs indicates that they spike efficiently when they receive sufficient excitatory drive18,20,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, these results suggest that differential synaptic connectivity contributes to the spiking probability of mature and immature GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Lack of immature GC spiking using CA recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a, left) Cartoon depicting sequential CA recordings from multiple mature and immature GCs after confirming EPSCs in a WC recording from a mature GC (right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 pA, 50 ms.

(c) The fraction of spiking mature GCs was significantly higher than the fraction of spiking immature GCs, both for the CA recordings (left, 22% versus 0%; 2=4.1) and the combined CA and WC data set (right, 23% versus 0%; 2=7.29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total number of recorded cells is indicated in parenthesis.Full size image', 'Reduced excitatory drive monitored by AMPA and NMDA EPSCs', 'A potential caveat to the idea that immature GCs have less excitatory innervation than mature GCs is that newly generated GCs have silent synapses and a high ratio of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) to -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) that may underestimate synaptic connectivity measured exclusively by AMPAR EPSCs36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore assayed perforant path excitatory drive mediated by both AMPAR and NMDARs using simultaneous recordings of immature and neighbouring mature GCs during focal stimulation in the ML.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of gabazine, we recorded AMPAR EPSCs at 70 mV, using the depressing and facilitating paired-pulse ratio (PPR) to confirm medial perforant path (MPP) or lateral perforant path (LPP) stimulation, respectively22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with Fig 2, AMPAR EPSCs in immature GCs were smaller than in neighbouring mature GCs, for both MPP and LPP stimulation (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the number of fibres activated by the stimulating electrode was the same for each mature/immature GC pair, the smaller EPSCs in immature GCs likely reflect fewer active synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also blocked AMPARs with NBQX and found that NMDAR EPSCs recorded at 40 mV were likewise smaller in immature GCs during simultaneous recordings (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, low excitatory drive of immature GCs is apparent with both NMDAR EPSCs as well as AMPAR EPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess potential silent synapses, we quantified the NMDAR/AMPAR ratio by comparing AMPA EPSCs at 70 mV and NMDAR EPSCs at +40 mV in the same cells during simultaneous mature and immature GC recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For MPP stimulation the ratio was significantly higher for immature GCs, consistent with a higher proportion of NMDAR to AMPARs on developing GC dendrites36,37 (Fig 4c; n=8, paired t-test; P=0.004), whereas LPP stimulation generated a similar ratio (n=8, paired t-test P=0.7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that MPP synapses with immature GCs have more silent synapses than mature GCs, but the potential confound of poor voltage control at distal synapses make it difficult to interpret the LPP results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, the small amplitude of pharmacologically isolated NMDAR EPSCs (Fig 4b) suggest that silent synapses cannot account for low AMPAR-mediated excitatory drive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Reduced excitatory drive monitored by AMPA and NMDA EPSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a, left) Simultaneous recordings of AMPA EPSCs in mature (black) and immature GCs (teal) evoked by stimulation of the MPP (top) or LPP (bottom).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (right) Values from simultaneous recordings are connected by lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EPSCs in the MPP were 556±101 pA and 228±69 pA, n=10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EPSCs in the LPP were 455±100 and 130±25 pA, n=10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paired t-test **P=0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid symbols are mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 200 pA, 50 ms.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we assess the role of excitatory drive in afferent-induced spiking of immature and mature GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we show that the relative probability of perforant path-induced spiking depends on the stimulus paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although strong beam-like stimulation paradigms with supra-threshold excitatory drive generate preferential spiking of immature GCs because of their reduced inhibition20,21,22, we found that weaker (and potentially diffuse) stimuli preferentially recruited mature GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that low excitatory drive from the perforant path provides a previously underappreciated mechanism that prevents broad responsiveness of immature GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we show that low excitatory drive to immature GCs results from less innervation rather than functional differences at immature synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low innervation is consistent with the low frequency of mEPSCs and low spine density in retroviral labelled immature GCs18,47 as well as the small dendritic trees of transgenic-labelled immature GCs22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we extend our experimental results to predict how poorly connected immature GCs could contribute to network functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a simple statistical model, we show that excitable immature GCs with low innervation enhance pattern overlap at low input levels yet decrease pattern overlap at high input levels, potentially enhancing the range of input levels that can maintain well-separated output representations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these results suggest that low innervation counteracts high intrinsic excitability and contributes to distinct inputoutput transformations than expected for high excitability alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results suggest that the small dendritic structure of developing GCs has functional significance in limiting innervation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since immature GCs are in a transient period of cell growth, the magnitude of excitatory drive is correlated with morphological maturation and post-mitotic cell age18,22,29,30,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional and morphological maturation of newly generated GCs is heterogeneous as well as progressive, and depends on diverse factors including animal age, housing condition, septal-temporal location and local network activity19,30,34,48,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In young adult rodents, newly generated GCs exhibit relatively rapid dendritic and spine development during the first month after cell birth that continues over many subsequent weeks and is paralleled by the development of functional excitatory synapses18,22,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since developing GCs progress through immature stages when innervation is inversely correlated with intrinsic excitability22, our conclusions are relevant to understanding immature GC function across various stages of maturation with the caveat that the timing of a particular stage varies according to specific conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Developing GCs appear to undergo the same sequence of maturation regardless of the age of the animal, thus we also expect that the factors contributing to immature GC spiking in young adult mice are relevant to understanding the function of immature GCs generated in older adult mice that are typically used to assess behavioural consequences of DG neurogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is proposed that immature GCs are better integrators of afferent activity than mature GCs because of enhanced intrinsic excitability and reduced inhibition that enables preferential afferent-induced spiking15,20,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest an alternative view that low innervation counteracts broad responsiveness, an outcome that is not evident from experiments using afferent stimulation in which synaptic excitation is well above threshold20,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since cortical excitatory cells typically innervate each other at a small number of synaptic contacts44,45, low innervation suggests that immature GCs sample the activity of a significantly smaller fraction of EC projection neurons than mature GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low sampling of EC is consistent with the observed low overlap in synaptic inputs between immature and mature GCs, as well as between neighbouring immature GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low sampling could enhance response selectivity by permitting immature GCs to integrate the activity from a more restricted population of EC projection neurons than mature GCs, even as high intrinsic excitability and weak inhibition promote integration of the activity arising from that population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus we speculate that immature GCs have higher input selectivity than mature GCs, based on the observation in the visual system that small dendritic arborization (that is, low sampling of synaptic inputs) correlates with relatively high selectivity within a class of neuron51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo recordings from age-identified GCs will be required to assess this prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is important to reiterate that the lack of immature GC spiking in response to EC stimulation in our experiments does not mean that immature GCs are functionally silent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immature GCs display preferential spiking under conditions of strong excitatory drive20,22, indicating that they spike efficiently with sufficient excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, our results support the idea that sparse activity in mature and immature cells rely on distinct mechanisms, with inhibition strongly contributing to sparse mature GC activity whereas low excitatory innervation contributes to sparse immature GC activity22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extending the interpretation to in vivo functions is subject to the caveat that slice experiments compare spiking probabilities in response to synchronous activation of afferent fibres in a manner that is useful to assess relative synaptic connectivity and responsiveness across cell types/ages, but that may not fully predict how neurons respond to complex spatial-temporal patterns of afferent activity generated by sensory and spatial stimuli in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional experiments will also be required to assess the role of hilar mossy cell innervation in GC spiking52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Comparing our experimental results with the simulation requires qualifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The model implies that immature GCs mediate most if not all network activity at the very lowest EC input levels, ostensibly conflicting with the experimental data showing preferential recruitment of mature GCs in the EC stimulating paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the EC activity level of the experiments corresponds to an EC input level above the dotted line, since many mature GCs spike (in the absence of inhibition, Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this range, the lower NDP overlap in the 100% immature network (Fig 7c) implies a smaller fraction of active immature cells (compared with the 100% mature network) and is thus qualitatively consistent with the experimental data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this EC activity level there is no effective orthogonalization since NDP is well outside the tolerable range and it is insensitive to small percentages of immature GCs (Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises two major caveats of the model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the model assays output overlap as a function of input level rather than input correlations, thus it is not a conventional measure of pattern separation defined as the transformation of similar input patterns to output patterns that are less correlated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the lack of inhibition in the model compresses the range of inputs that can be orthogonalized, since synaptic inhibition provides input normalization that allows networks to respond to a wide range of inputs without saturation54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the model primarily serves to illustrate the main point that immature GCs with high excitability and low synaptic connectivity differentially affect NDP overlap across input levels, whereas high intrinsic excitability alone would be predicted to reduce population sparseness (and increase NDP overlap) across all input levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results can be incorporated into a broader view of the DGs function in hippocampal coding10,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the DG is relevant in driving CA3, it is necessary that its outputs have some minimal level of activityperfect separation is meaningless if no information is communicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even a very low activity level necessitates some minimal level of neuronal overlap; however, too much overlap presumably leads to interference in CA3 memory formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our simple model, maintaining low overlap requires that the ECs activity level can only be tolerated within a small range that is more than doubled by the inclusion of immature neurons (Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low percentage of immature GCs that is optimized for expanding this range could imply that small numbers of excitable but sparsely innervated immature neurons facilitate inputoutput transformations by promoting discrete network representations across variable levels of EC activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, it is important to consider that what young and mature neurons encode is likely as important as how they encode it15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One implication of differential synaptic connectivity is that old and young GCs could represent different aspects of information incoming from EC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because they are sampling more cortical space, mature GCs may encode and separate based on complex characteristics formed by many features of representation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of their limited sampling of EC, immature GCs may codify selective features of a representation with high fidelity due to their intrinsic excitability and low inhibition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this manner, immature GCs could encode a singular aspect of a representation, potentially providing selectivity within fewer dimensions, which may help in contextualizing information incoming from EC based on combinations of concurrent spatial or temporal features56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus immature GCs in the network could increase memory resolution or
