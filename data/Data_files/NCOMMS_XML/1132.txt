Real-time monitoring of hydrophobic aggregation reveals a critical role of cooperativity in hydrophobic effect  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The hydrophobic interaction drives nonpolar solutes to aggregate in aqueous solution, and hence plays a critical role in many fundamental processes in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important property intrinsic to hydrophobic interaction is its cooperative nature, which is originated from the collective motions of water hydrogen bond networks surrounding hydrophobic solutes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This property is widely believed to enhance the formation of hydrophobic core in proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cooperativity in hydrophobic interactions has not been successfully characterized by experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we quantify cooperativity in hydrophobic interactions by real-time monitoring the aggregation of hydrophobic solute (hexaphenylsilole, HPS) in a microfluidic mixer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that association of a HPS molecule to its aggregate in water occurs at sub-microsecond, and the free energy change is 5.8 to 13.6 kcal mol1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most strikingly, we discover that cooperativity constitutes up to 40% of this free energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide quantitative evidence for the critical role of cooperativity in hydrophobic interactions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hydrophobic interactions drive nonpolar solutes to aggregate in aqueous solution1,2, and hence play an important role in many fundamental processes in nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular theories3,4,5,6,7,8 and computer simulations9,10 of hydrophobicity suggest that water molecules need to break some of their hydrogen bonds to accommodate large nonpolar solutes (radius larger than 1 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This loss of waterwater hydrogen bonds will induce fluctuations and depletion of water density near large hydrophobic solutes10,11,12,13, and further lead them to collapse14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, hydrophobic interactions are originated from the collective motions of water hydrogen bond networks surrounding hydrophobic solutes16,17,18,19; hence, they are naturally cooperative20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to fundamental intermolecular interactions that are often treated as pairwise additive, such as ionic interactions, dipolar interactions and dispersion forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cooperativity is a phenomenon whereby the overall interaction for a system containing multiple molecules is stronger than the summation of individual pairwise interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such cooperative feature of hydrophobic interactions is widely believed to accelerate, stabilize and enhance the formation of hydrophobic core in proteins, the aggregation of misfolded proteins and the formation of lipid vesicles and micelles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent of contributions from cooperativity to these processes still remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Addressing this issue requires, first and foremost, quantitative measurements of hydrophobic interactions, which are very challenging as the size, chemistry and topography of solutes can affect the strength of hydrophobic interactions3,23,24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Microfluidic mixing techniques have been widely applied to investigate many important chemical and biological processes, including protein and RNA folding28,29,30,31,32, enzyme activities33,34 and vesicle formations35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we quantified the thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrophobic interactions in bulk solution by real-time monitoring of fluorescence induced by the aggregation of hexaphenylsilole37 (HPS, C40H30Si) in a state-of-the-art microfluidic mixer at microsecond timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this technique, we show that in the attachment of a HPS molecule to its aggregate, the free energy change is 5.8 to 13.6 kcal mol1, the timescale is sub-microsecond, and the cooperativity constitutes up to 40% of the free energy change.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Organic molecules, such as proteins and lipid, bury their hydrophobic components to form stable cores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrophobic interaction plays a crucial role in facilitating the collapse of protein chains into a globular shape25,45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The faster kinetics of hydrophobic aggregations (at microsecond), in contrast to protein folding (at millisecond or longer), suggest that the formation of protein cores by the aggregation of hydrophobic side-chains occurs at the early stage in the process of globular protein folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, we show that hydrophobic interaction, which is an interaction induced by collective behaviours of many water molecules, is strongly cooperative, and thus substantially enhance its strength during the aggregation of dispersed hydrophobic molecules in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We anticipate that our findings have profound implications in protein folding, as the protein core formation involves the collapse of hydrophobic side-chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We acknowledge that these two processes are different in many aspects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, flexible protein chains contain numerous conformations, while HPS molecules are relatively rigid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, multiple sources may contribute to cooperativity in protein folding, such as the cooperative helix melting process due to hydrogen bonding48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, even the extent of contributions by hydrophobic interactions to protein folding remains elusive49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spite of these differences, our findings highlight the important role of hydrophobic cooperativity (as large as 40%) in the initial collapse of protein chain to form into a globular shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expect that our experimental platform will have promising applications in studying hydrophobic interactions of a wide range of organic molecules with aggregation-induced emission50, and in investigating the impact of important factors such as temperature on hydrophobic effect.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Table 2 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we estimated F by approximating it to the pair strength in the smallest stable aggregate in a given solvent:', '', 'In particular, the smallest stable aggregate (n*+1) contains 37 molecules in the solvent with a DMSO mole fraction of 0, 0.16, 0.21, 0.26 and 0.32, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G can be obtained from equation (7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the summarization of the two-body potential of mean force between the (n+1)th molecule and the ith molecule in the aggregate is obtained as follows:', '', 'Substituting equations (7) and (14) into equation (11), we determined the hydrophobic cooperativity (Figs 1c and 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the data reported in Figs 1c and 3b,c start from the smallest stable aggregate in the corresponding experimental condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As our reported hydrophobic free energies at large n limit (Gn) become equivalent to the free energy of transferring a HPS molecule from water to the HPS phase, this makes it possible to directly estimate the cooperativity even without performing microfluidics experiments, provided that one could also obtain the pair potential of mean force (for example, from MD simulations discussed in Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Figs 17 and 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Kinetics of the hydrophobic aggregation', 'To resolve the kinetics of HPS aggregation, we have tracked the growth of the first nucleus formed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the theoretical model obtained previously, we derived the equation for nucleus growth as follows:', '', 'where n(tt) is the size of the aggregate at time tt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of equation (15), we obtained the nucleus growth curve as shown in Supplementary Fig 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we defined the time for attaching a HPS monomer to the aggregate as the time required for the aggregate to grow by one molecule in size, and the results are shown in Figs 1d and 3c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nucleation-growth curve (Supplementary Fig 7) suggests the microsecond timescale of HPS aggregation, which is comparable to the timescale of early stage protein folding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison is made between similar concentration of HPS in our experiment and local concentration of residues on a protein chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated local concentrations of protein residues by computing number of residues within a distance of the protein chain length (for example, a protein domain containing 89100 residues has a chain length of 2830 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting local concentration of protein residues (1.31.8 mM) is comparable with our initial HPS concentration in the microfluidics tube: 2.06.0 mM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The data that support the findings of this study as well as the computer code for the CNT and non-CNT theories are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
