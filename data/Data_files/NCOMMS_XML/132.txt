Identification of an allosteric binding site for RORt inhibition  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'RORt is critical for the differentiation and proliferation of Th17 cells associated with several chronic autoimmune diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report the discovery of a novel allosteric binding site on the nuclear receptor RORt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-crystallization of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of RORt with a series of small-molecule antagonists demonstrates occupancy of a previously unreported allosteric binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding at this non-canonical site induces an unprecedented conformational reorientation of helix 12 in the RORt LBD, which blocks cofactor binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The functional consequence of this allosteric ligand-mediated conformation is inhibition of function as evidenced by both biochemical and cellular studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RORt function is thus antagonized in a manner molecularly distinct from that of previously described orthosteric RORt ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This brings forward an approach to target RORt for the treatment of Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elucidation of an unprecedented modality of pharmacological antagonism establishes a mechanism for modulation of nuclear receptors.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Nuclear receptors (NRs) modulate transcription of particular sets of genes on binding of small lipophilic ligands and thereby regulate physiological parameters of cellular function1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NRs are also important pathological regulators in diseases such as cancer, diabetes and autoimmune disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combination of characteristics of NRs has given rise to some of the most notable pharmaceutical agents of the past century2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor (ROR) is a NR subclass that demonstrates great therapeutic potential3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, RORt, whose activity is required for the proliferation and functionality of immune Th17 cells, is the subject of intense investigation to modulate its activity to achieve clinical benefit4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Th17 cells exert an inflammatory, pathological role in autoimmune diseases7,8 and on stimulation produce pro-inflammatory cytokines9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antibodies directed against the cytokine IL17 have been clinically successful, proving the potential of targeting the Th17/IL17 axis10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Active RORt is a prerequisite for the differentiation of T cells into Th17 cells11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small-molecule inhibition of RORt has therefore been brought forward as a novel strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'NRs are characterized by the ability to bind small ligands at a highly conserved hydrophobic orthosteric-binding pocket located within the proteins ligand-binding domain (LBD)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A typical NR LBD exhibits a three-layered fold of 12 alpha helices and 23 -strands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligand binding in this pocket can activate or inhibit the receptor to various degrees15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helix 12 (H12, also called activation function-2, AF-2) can adopt distinct conformations in response to ligand binding, regulating the interaction of the LBD with cofactor proteins with resulting changes in gene transcription at a particular locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, on the binding of an agonist, H12 is stabilized in a conformation that facilitates the binding of a coactivator16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, antagonist binding induces a different H12 conformation unsuitable for coactivator binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NR drugs thus bind to this orthosteric-binding pocket and act as molecular switches that control NR transcriptional activity due to the positioning of H12 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This canonical ligand binding is associated with selectivity issues and mutation-induced antagonist/agonist switches for different NRs and therefore molecules that occupy allosteric-binding sites on NRs are highly sought after19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such allosteric modulation might be expected to induce conformational effects that are not dependent on competition with endogenous ligands and could provide enhanced potency/efficacy or greater specificity over canonical ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously identified a novel series of RORt inhibitors22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we characterize the mode of action of these inhibitors to guide an optimization program and surprisingly find a novel binding mode, thereby identifying the first allosteric-binding pocket for a highly potent, cellular active small NR ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural, biochemical and cellular data reveal that the unprecedented allosteric-binding modality confers both high potency and selectivity to RORt for these novel antagonists.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Helix 12 repositions to generate a novel binding pocket', 'Literature suggests that the RORs feature ligand-independent transcription, with their LBDs partially in a conformation promoting coactivator binding23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biological data and the co-crystal structures of RORt LBD bound to hydroxycholesterols24, and synthetic inverse agonistic ligands such as T0901317 (Fig 1a) have shown that the RORt LBD is still structurally responsive to ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For RORt, reports suggest that multiple small molecules affect antagonism via binding to the canonical orthosteric site13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high-throughput screen for molecules that disrupt the interaction of the RORt-LBD with steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) cofactor peptide, followed by a hit optimization program, led to the identification of indazoles as a novel class of RORt inhibitors, typified by MRL-871 (Fig 1a)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To elucidate the molecular basis of RORt modulation by MRL-871, we performed co-crystallization studies with an equimolar complex of RORt-LBD and MRL-871.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-crystals grew in two different space groups (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals in space group R32:H had unit cell dimensions of a=b=173.8, c=67.2 Å, diffracted to 2.3 Å resolution and contain one molecule per asymmetric unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystals in space group P6122 had unit cell dimensions of a=b=108.5, c=104.7 Å, diffracted to 2.2 Å resolution and also contain one molecule per asymmetric unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental electron density maps from both conditions showed clear density for all features of the protein, including MRL-871.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The overall structures from both sets were identical in all the features and the ligand conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RORt LBD crystallized with the typical NR arrangement of helices 111, but with the H12 positioned in a conformation unprecedented for all NR LBD complexes reported to date (Fig 1c, green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On top of that, the crystal structure revealed the binding site of MRL-871 to be different from the canonical orthosteric NR ligand-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MRL-871 binds instead to a previously unidentified allosteric pocket in the RORt LBD, located distal to the classical binding site (Fig 1c, orange).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystal structure analysis shows that this allosteric pocket, absent in the classical NR-folding motif, is formed by helices 4, 5, 11 and the reoriented flexible H12 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ortho-substituted trifluoromethyl and chloro moieties are spatially clearly positioned and impart a specific rotation to the phenyl group of MRL-871 and address hydrophobic sites in the allosteric pocket (Fig 1b,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrogen-bonding interactions exist between the molecules carboxylic acid group and the side chain of RORt residue Q329 as well as the main-chain amide hydrogen atoms of residues A497 and F498.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apart from these distinct polar interactions, the newly generated allosteric pocket is predominantly hydrophobic, because of the amino-acid side chains of residues on helices 4, 5, 11 and, notably, H12 and the activation function loop between helices 11 and 12 (AF-2 domain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The arrangement of the RORt LBD in the presence of MRL-871 generates a druggable molecular-binding site critically regulated by favourable interactions of MRL-871 with the AF-2 domain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions reposition the highly flexible H12 in a conformation unique among reported NR ligand structures, of either the agonist or antagonist type, and distinct from the previously reported RORt agonist-bound state1,6,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unique conformation induced by the binding of MRL-871 prevents interaction with cofactor peptides, which typically bind RORt through a conserved LXXLL motif, at the AF-2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Co-crystal structure of RORt with MRL-871.

variants of MRL-871 (MRL-058 and MRL-003) were also prepared and tested alongside an agonist and canonical inverse agonist in an AlphaScreen cofactor peptide recruitment assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indazoles MRL-871 and its derivatives MRL-058 and MRL-003 all inhibited coactivator binding in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2a) with half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 7±1 nM (MRL-871), 98±23 nM (MRL-058) and 280±117 nM (MRL-003), showing the antagonistic profile of the series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cholesterol, binding as agonist to the LBD, functioned as a weak activator, further enhancing the interaction of the RORtLBD with a cofactor peptide25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inverse agonist T0901319 demonstrated an IC50 value of 24±13 nM in this assay, which is in good agreement with previously reported values, but less potent than MRL-871 (refs 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data thus show that the allosteric-binding mode of the novel modulators as observed in the crystal structures translates into potent inhibition of coactivator peptide binding to RORtLBD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, these data also indicate that both ortho-substituents on the benzamide moiety are required to enhance RORt-binding affinity, which suggest that the observed binding mode in the crystal structure is most optimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Allosteric inhibition.

findings and gain more insight in the mode of action for these compounds, competitive binding assays for both MRL-871 (Fig 2c) and T0901317 (Fig 2d) were performed against fixed concentrations of cholesterol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the structural data, we hypothesized that MRL-871 should not compete with cholesterol for the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket, because they bind into different pockets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, the IC50 value of MRL-871 for inhibition of the RORt coactivator interaction should be independent of cholesterol concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing concentrations of cholesterol increase the RORt coactivator interaction, in line with the agonistic properties of cholesterol, as evidenced by an increased fluorescence ratiometric level with cofactor peptide (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MRL-871, however, effectively antagonizes the RORt coactivator peptide recruitment interaction, independent of cholesterol concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The competitive cofactor-binding assay for MRL-871 showed no significant change in IC50 value when performed in the presence of different concentrations of cholesterol (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the inverse agonist T0901317 competes for the same binding site as cholesterol, resulting in a competitive displacement and a cholesterol concentration-dependent increase of the IC50 value for T0901317 (Fig 2d); that is, RORt binding and inhibition by T0901317 becomes less potent in the presence of agonistic ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data demonstrate that the allosteric inhibition of coactivator binding to RORt by MRL-871 is both potent and independent of orthosteric site occupancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RORt mediates IL17a gene expression in EL4 cells4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The EL4 murine lymphoblast cell line constitutively expresses RORt, which drives production of IL17a (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that allosteric RORt modulation has also functional relevance at the cellular level, EL4 cells were treated with 10 M of modulators MRL-871, MRL-058 and MRL-003 for 24 h and IL17a messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RTPCR) (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of EL4 cells with the more potent MRL-871 and MRL-058 significantly reduced the IL17a mRNA levels, while the weaker MRL-003 did not reduce the mRNA levels, consistent with the lower biochemical activity observed for this compound.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result thus demonstrates that functional modulation of the allosteric pocket by small molecules results in cellular responses (that is, reduced gene transcription).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structural basis for ligand potency', 'The cofactor recruitment assay described above provides an indirect assessment of modulator potency since the site of cofactor interaction does not directly overlap with the binding site of the indazoles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, an orthogonal assay that directly and selectively probes the novel allosteric RORt-binding site is desirable for screening, characterization and optimization purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the co-crystal structure of RORt and MRL-871 (Fig 1c) to rationally design a synthetic ligand analogue containing a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) acceptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AlexaFluor 647 was connected to the six position of MRL-871 via a short molecular spacer (Supplementary Fig 1); this site of the molecule protrudes into an open channel in the crystal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This probe molecule proved to have a robust TR-FRET signal at low concentrations in the presence of His-tagged RORtLBD and an anti-His Europium chelate antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Titration studies in a TR-FRET assay revealed a Kd of 100±24 nM with the RORtLBD (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the parent MRL-871 was tested for the ability to compete with the allosteric probe, the resulting IC50 value was similar to that observed in cofactor recruitment assays (Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 2 Potency (mean±s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of selected RORt allosteric inverse agonists in

reporter assay and in functional inhibition of IL-17 production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To insure that the functional activity of the indazole series is attributable to inhibition of RORt, MRL-299 was tested

orientations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MRL-673, in contrast, exhibits 10-fold weaker potency in both the biochemical and cellular assays relative to MRL-367.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural comparison of, for example, MRL-367 and MRL-673 (Fig 3c) reveals that, while these compounds bind the same allosteric site, the position of the carboxylate ring of MRL-673 distorts the binding pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modification induces a displacement of the carboxyl group and highlights the importance of the polar interactions in the binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the carboxylate of MRL-673 makes the same number of polar contacts with RORt as MRL-367, the methylation induces the reorientation of the side chains of Phe498 and Tyr502.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This shift in the side chains and the accompanying shifts in the backbone of the C-terminal residues of Ala497 and Phe498, explains the lower receptor affinity and functional inhibitory potency.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'NR drug development has been based primarily on the ability of NRs to bind ligands at the highly conserved hydrophobic orthosteric pocket of the LBD, which is also the binding site of endogenous ligands1,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with unbound NRs, the binding of an agonist induces a conformational change that stabilizes the positioning of H12 and AF-2 domain, resulting in coactivator recruitment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding of antagonist or inverse agonist ligands typically destabilizes H12 and the AF-2 domain (possibly unfolding it) resulting in a lack of coactivator or enhanced corepressor recruitment, ultimately resulting in transcriptional inhibition at specific loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Numerous successful drugs targeting NRs have been developed, all working via this mechanism, but increasing resistance against certain cancer therapy oriented NR antagonists, as well as the challenge of targeting orphan receptors has increased the need for alternative site modulators of NRs19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to, for example, the efforts to target allosteric sites in protein kinases30, allosteric NR modulators may differentiate favourably versus orthosteric ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potential advantages of allosteric NR inhibitors are enhanced selectivity, no competition with increasing endogenous ligands during pathological conditions, and no sensitivity to agonist/antagonist switching due to mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The recently reported crystal structure of RORt with a potent tertiary amine orthosteric agonist revealed the coactivator-binding site on the LBD, in a classical NR H12 switch agonist mode and bound to a cofactor peptide motif (Fig 4a)31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new crystal structures of RORt reported here with MRL-871 and its analogues (Fig 3) reveal that these indazole modulators bind to a receptor position normally occupied by H12 in the non-liganded or agonist ligand-bound conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final orientation of H12 in the presence of the novel indazole modulators is such that the classical binding surface for the cofactor LXXLL motif is not only modified, but actively blocked (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This overall orientation effectively antagonizes cofactor binding to RORt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consequence of this allosteric modulator-mediated refolding of RORt is functional inhibition as evidenced by biochemical and cellular studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unique mode of allosteric binding reported thus provides a structural rationale for targeting NRs with small molecules in an orthogonal manner that does not require competition with canonical ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Molecular mechanism of allosteric RORt modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Agonistic conformation of RORt31 (PDB entry 4NIE) showing the position of the agonistic ligand (red) in the classical orthosteric ligand binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helices 11 and 12 (yellow) of the LBD are folded in a stable agonistic conformation, supporting binding of the LXXLL cofactor peptide (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Antagonistic conformation of RORt14 (PDB entry 4QM0) induced by a classical inverse agonist (purple) in the classical orthosteric ligand-binding site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Helices 11 and 12 of the LBD are unstructured (arrow).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Superposition of a and b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When H12 is disordered, the LXXLL cofactor peptides lack a complementary surface for binding to RORt (d) Antagonistic conformation of RORt, induced by allosteric modulator MRL-871 (orange).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MRL-871 makes direct contact with H12 (brown) at the allosteric site in the RORt LBD and stabilizes the folding of H12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Superposition of a and d.
