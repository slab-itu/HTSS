Cellular senescence drives age-dependent hepatic steatosis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The incidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) increases with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular senescence refers to a state of irreversible cell-cycle arrest combined with the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Senescent cells contribute to age-related tissue degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the accumulation of senescent cells promotes hepatic fat accumulation and steatosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report a close correlation between hepatic fat accumulation and markers of hepatocyte senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elimination of senescent cells by suicide gene-meditated ablation of p16Ink4a-expressing senescent cells in INK-ATTAC mice or by treatment with a combination of the senolytic drugs dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q) reduces overall hepatic steatosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, inducing hepatocyte senescence promotes fat accumulation in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, we show that mitochondria in senescent cells lose the ability to metabolize fatty acids efficiently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study demonstrates that cellular senescence drives hepatic steatosis and elimination of senescent cells may be a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce steatosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excess hepatic fat (steatosis) in individuals who drink little or no alcohol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAFLD is more prevalent in older populations and it ranges from simple liver steatosis, through non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanisms underlying this condition are not understood nor is why its prevalence increases with ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been speculated that ageing processes may promote NAFLD via different mechanisms, including adipose tissue dysfunction2, impaired autophagy3 and oxidative stress4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible cell-cycle arrest, which can be induced by a variety of stressors, including telomere dysfunction and genotoxic and oxidative stress5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Senescent cells frequently have increased secretion of a broad repertoire of proinflammatory factors, collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which can induce tissue dysfunction in a paracrine manner6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Senescent cells have mitochondrial dysfunction, with decreased oxidative phosphorylation and concomitantly increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)7,8, caused at least partly by failing mitophagy9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have demonstrated that selectively eliminating senescent cells can attenuate several age-dependent disorders10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant fraction of hepatocytes develop a senescent phenotype during the life course of mice13 and with age-related liver disease in humans14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the relationship between cellular senescence and liver fat accumulation remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we hypothesized that cellular senescence results in impaired fat metabolism and that removal of senescent cells may diminish liver steatosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found a close relationship between senescence markers and fat accumulation in hepatocytes of mice fed ad libitum (AL), dietary restricted (DR) or following dietary crossover and in a small cohort of NAFLD patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, clearance of senescent cells by suicide gene-meditated ablation of p16Ink4a-expressing senescent cells in INK-ATTAC mice and a senolytic cocktail of dasatinib plus quercetin (D+Q) reduced overall hepatic steatosis in ageing, obese and diabetic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, hepatocyte-specific induction of senescence by a local DNA repair defect resulted in liver steatosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we found that induction of senescence in mouse fibroblasts and hepatocytes resulted in decreased ability to metabolize fat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings suggest that interventions targeting senescent cells may be developed into therapies to reduce steatosis during NAFLD.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DR protects against liver fat deposition', 'In order to investigate the relationship between fat deposition in hepatocytes and hepatocyte senescence, C57BL/6 male mice were randomly assigned to AL or DR at 3 months of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 12 months of age, half the animals underwent a dietary switch (crossover) for 3 months, until the age of 15 months, when all mice were killed (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown previously15, both long- and short-term DR were able to rescue body weight increase under AL (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, and consistent with earlier observations15, liver weight increased in adulthood under AL conditions even faster than body weight (Fig 1b), and this was due to hepatic fat deposition (Fig 1ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Life-long DR suppressed fatty liver development (Fig 1ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, short-term DR starting at middle age, reversed the increased liver mass (Fig 1b) and liver fat accumulation (Fig 1ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrarily, short-term return to AL after long-term DR increased body and liver weight but hepatic fat deposition remained low for at least 3 months (Fig 1be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histopathological grading confirmed progressive steatosis in AL mice and absence or minimal steatosis in DR mice (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: DR is protective against liver fat deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Three-month-old male mice were split into two groups and assigned to ad libitum (AL) or dietary restricted (DR) food supply (animals were matched by body mass and food intake).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DR animals were offered 60% of AL intake as one food ration per day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 9 months of diet (at the age of 12 months), mice were split into 4 groups liver-weight to body-weight: AL (remaining on AL feeding, n=9), DR (remaining on DR feeding, n=10), AL to DR (switching from AL to restricted food supply, n=7), and DR to AL (switching from restricted to AL food supply, n=7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals stayed on the assigned food regime for 3 months until killed at 15 months of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Liver-weight to body-weight ratios in all the

'Telomere dysfunction leads to activation of a persistent DNA damage response (DDR) and is a feature of cellular senescence16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Telomere-associated DNA damage foci (TAF, denoting co-localization of H2A.X with a telomere PNA probe assessed by immuno-fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)) increase with age in mouse hepatocytes17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Presence of three or more TAF in a cell (Fig 2a) is a sensitive and robust marker of senescence18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of hepatocytes harbouring three or more TAF increased significantly with age in AL animals but was maintained at a constant low level in DR animals (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both types of crossover animals (AL to DR and DR to AL) showed a significantly lower frequency of hepatocytes containing three or more TAF than AL animals, remaining at a level similar to that found in DR animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same pattern was observed when analysing the average number of TAF per hepatocyte but not total frequencies of DNA damage foci (Supplementary Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next analysed the frequencies of hepatocytes harbouring another marker of cellular senescence, senescence-associated distension of satellites (SADS) (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Swanson et al.19 first reported that satellite DNA found at human and mouse centromeres unraveled from its compact state during senescence, a characteristic they designated as SADS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, similarly to TAF, frequency of SADS increased with age in hepatocytes and this was largely prevented by DR (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, frequencies of hepatocytes containing 4 SADS (Fig 2c,d) faithfully mirrored the pattern of TAF-positive cells (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hepatocyte senescence is also characterized by karyomegaly20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed hepatocyte nuclear size by morphometric analysis of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained liver sections and quantified frequencies of hepatocytes with a nuclear area  greater than 127 m2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, this senescence marker exhibited exactly the same pattern as TAF and SADS (Fig 2e): hepatocyte karyomegaly increased with age under AL, it was maintained at low levels under long-term DR, and was reduced during late-onset short-term DR and for at least 3 months following cessation of DR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, karyomegaly and SADS resulted in very similar quantitative estimates of senescent hepatocyte frequencies, while frequencies of cells with 3 TAFs were consistently lower (Supplementary Fig 2d), confirming earlier results showing that between two and three TAF are necessary and sufficient to induce senescence18,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, hepatocytes sorted into fractions with normal and karyomegalic nuclei via measuring nucleus size using ImageJ showed that significantly more karyomegalic hepatocytes expressed markers of senescence, including phospho-p38 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8), 4-HNE (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22), TAF and SADS, than hepatocytes with normal-sized nuclei (Supplementary Fig 2eh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: DR is protective against

#@NEW_LINE#@#  with 45 animals per group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant differences (one-way analysis of variance) are indicated with *P0.05 and **P0.001.Full size image', 'In order to define the impact of DR and AL dietary crossovers on senescence and fat accumulation, we conducted whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then identified all genes whose expression followed the same pattern as the senescence markers across all experimental groups (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the 10 most significantly enriched (false discovery rate 5%) Gene Ontology (GO) categories for the genes that followed this pattern included lipid modification, as well as several GO terms associated with inflammatory processes, such as phagocytosis and lymphocyte and leucocyte differentiation (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The parallelism between senescence markers and genes involved in inflammatory responses was anticipated because senescence entails molecular reprogramming and production of a unique secretome characterized by the increased release of cytokines, chemokines, extracellular matrix remodelling factors and growth factors23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These factors play a role in the recruitment of immune cells, such as T cells and macrophages, which may facilitate clearance of senescent cells24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, excessive fat deposition has been associated with enhanced inflammation26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, we found by immunohistochemistry that infiltration of CD3+ and CD68+ immune cells correlated with senescent markers and fat deposition in the liver of mice under the abovementioned dietary regimes (Supplementary Fig 2i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Senescent cell clearance decreases liver fat accumulation', 'To test whether senescent cells were a cause or consequence of fat accumulation, we used two different strategies to eliminate senescent cells from older animals: (i) the INK-ATTAC mouse, in which a small molecule, AP20187 (AP) induces apoptosis through dimerization of FKBP-fused Casp8, resulting in elimination of p16-expressing cells10,27 and (ii) the senolytic combination of the drugs D+Q, which selectively ablates senescent cells in vitro and in vivo12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first used INK-ATTAC mice at 24 months of age and treated them with either AP or with D+Q and then killed the animals at 27 months of age (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the treatments significantly altered body or liver weight (Supplementary Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, untreated INK-ATTAC mice at 27 months of age displayed higher frequencies of TAF-positive (Fig 3b) and karyomegalic (Fig 3c) hepatocytes than control AL mice at 15 months of age (compare with Fig 2b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both AP and D+Q treatment reduced the frequencies of TAF-positive hepatocytes (Fig 3b) and the average numbers of TAF per hepatocyte (Supplementary Fig 3d), but total DNA damage was only significantly changed with AP but not with D+Q treatment (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, AP also reduced the percentage of karyomegalic hepatocytes, while D+Q treatment resulted in a trend towards karyomegaly reduction (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we found that both AP and D+Q administration resulted in a significant reduction in hepatic fat deposition (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we exposed 6 month-old INK-ATTAC mice to normal chow or high-fat (HF) diet until animals were killed at 15 months of age (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HF diet increased the frequency of a variety of senescent markers in hepatocytes, including TAF, karyomegaly, mRNA expression of p16 (measured by p16 and eGFP RNA-ISH) and senescenceassociated galactosidase (SA--Gal) activity (Fig 3fk and Supplementary Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Started at 11 months of age, treatment with AP significantly reduced all analysed senescent markers in mice on HF diet (Fig 3fk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the observations made in aged mice, specific elimination of senescent cells significantly reduced hepatic fat deposition in mice exposed to HF diet (Fig 3l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found across all INK-ATTAC mice (irrespectively of treatment and age) that the percentage of p16- or eGFP-positive (detected by RNA-ISH) and karyomegalic hepatocytes positively correlated with the average number of TAF (Supplementary Fig 3gi), which further validates its utility as a marker of senescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Elimination of senescent cells decreases fat accumulation in the liver.

db/db mice that carry a mutation in the leptin receptor gene and are a well-established model of type 2 diabetes and are characterized by liver steatosis28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In db/db mice, treatment with senolytic cocktail D+Q was able not only to suppress the increased fraction of TAF-containing senescent cells but also significantly reduce liver fat accumulation (Supplementary Fig 3km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Hepatocyte-specific senescence induces liver fat', 'We then proceeded to test whether induction of senescence specifically in hepatocytes resulted in liver fat accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we generated mice with liver-specific inactivation of the DNA repair gene Xpg, hereafter designated Alb-Xpg mice, which results in accumulation of DDR markers and accelerated karyomegaly specific in hepatocytes29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that hepatocytes lacking Xpg over time exhibit increased markers of senescence such as TAF (Fig 4a and Supplementary Fig 4), karyomegaly (Fig 4b) and p21 activation (Fig 4c,d), which occurred concomitantly with increased age-dependent fat accumulation (Fig 4e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these data support the hypothesis that

the efficacy of mitochondrial ATP synthesis by coupled respiration decreases during ageing7 and in senescence8 and that a change in mitochondrial function is indeed essential for the establishment of the senescent phenotype30, we hypothesized that senescence might decrease the capacity of mitochondria to oxidize fatty acids, thus contributing to fat accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we induced senescence in hepatocyte cultures isolated from young mice using X-ray irradiation, as previous studies indicated that activation of a DDR was central to the initiation of hepatocyte senescence20,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we found that a senescent phenotype develops in cultured hepatocytes 1 week after irradiation, as shown by enhanced SA--Gal activity (Fig 5a,b) and persistent DNA damage foci (Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly to what we observed in vivo, fat droplet intensity measured by Nile red increased when comparing senescent to non-senescent hepatocytes (Fig 5e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were confirmed independently using the lipid probe BODIPY 493/503 (Supplementary Fig 5ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to investigate whether fat accumulation was due to impaired fatty acid oxidation, we measured cellular oxygen consumption in intact (non-permeabilized) hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the fatty acid palmitate was supplied as substrate, oxygen consumption increased to a lower extent in senescent hepatocytes than controls (Fig 5g), indicating that senescent hepatocytes had indeed decreased capacity to oxidize fatty acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was confirmed when mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation was inhibited by etomoxir.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the latter case, oxygen consumption was reduced more in controls than senescent hepatocytes (Fig 5h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate whether this phenomenon was restricted to hepatocytes, we performed similar experiments in mouse adult fibroblasts (MAFs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly to mouse hepatocytes, we found that X-ray irradiation resulted in induction of senescent markers (Supplementary Fig 5ei), which occurred within the same time frame as the accumulation of cytosolic fat droplets (Supplementary Fig 5km).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with a link between mitochondrial dysfunction and increased cytosolic fat, we found that mitochondria in senescent fibroblasts had a significantly lower respiratory control ratio (state 3/state 4 respiration rate) using the complex I-linked substrates, pyruvate and malate, resulting in reduced capacity to generate ATP by coupled respiration (Supplementary Fig 5n,o) together with decreased capacity to oxidize fatty acids (Supplementary Fig 5p,q).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, consistent with a causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction, senescence and fat accumulation, we found that treatment of MAFs with the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone induced markers of senescence (Supplementary Fig 5r,s) coupled with increased cytosolic fat droplet accumulation (Supplementary Fig 5t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data indicate that senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction reduces cellular fatty acid oxidation capacity resulting in increased fat deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Induction of senescence in hepatocytes causes mitochondrial dysfunction and reduces fatty acid

'Ageing and obesity are the major risk factors for many age-related diseases, including diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and NAFLD33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NAFLD and NASH are frequently associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thought that increased lipid dietary consumption, lipid synthesis or decreased lipid catabolism are major contributors to the excessive hepatic fat observed during NAFLD34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic steatosis has been proposed to contribute to liver injury by inducing inflammation, cell death, fibrosis and HCC35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cellular senescence has been implicated in the progression of liver disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms are not yet completely understood, and in some cases, senescence has been associated with detrimental effects but in others it is not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, telomere dysfunction, a major driver of hepatocyte senescence, has been shown to impair liver regeneration and induce liver cirrhosis in mice36 but was not significantly changed during ageing in the human liver37 and did not predict NAFLD32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, chronic inflammation has been reported to drive hepatocyte senescence and contribute to liver fibrosis18 and HCC38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Senescent cells have been found in the livers of NAFLD32, cirrhotic patients39 and in the liver of HF-fed mice40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast, it has been suggested that p53-dependent senescence of hepatic stellate cells contributes to reduced secretion of fibrogenic proteins and is, as a result, antifibrotic25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, another report suggested that activation of a proinflammatory phenotype in hepatic stellate cells could in fact drive obesity-mediated HCC41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus altogether it is still unclear if and how senescence contributes to liver dysfunction during ageing and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we found that modulation of dietary intake has similar effects on hepatocyte senescence and fat accumulation during ageing in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that DR reduced both hepatocyte senescence and fat accumulation for a long period after its cessation in agreement with the concept of a metabolic memory15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led us to hypothesize a common mechanism driving both phenotypes, namely, that an impaired ability to catabolize fat could be related to the senescent phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If this was the case, strategies aimed at removing senescent cells would be viable therapeutic strategies for reducing hepatic steatosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, using the INK-ATTAC mouse model in which senescent cells can be specifically deleted; we showed a reduction in liver fat content in older mice and mice exposed to HF diet, demonstrating a causal link between senescence and liver fat accumulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that deletion of p16INK4a-expressing cells improves multiple ageing phenotypes in progeroid mice10 and extends healthspan parameters in wild-type chronically aged mice and may increase their median lifespan11,27,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these studies, senescent cell clearance from INK-ATTAC mice was observed in multiple tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore do not exclude the possibility that the reduced steatosis we discovered is partially a secondary outcome of clearing senescent cells from other tissues besides the liver, specifically from adipose tissue where adipocyte senescence might compromise fat storage43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, using a liver-specific mouse model of impaired DNA repair, Alb-Xpg29, we found that induction of senescence specifically in hepatocytes resulted in increased fat deposition, which suggests that the effect can be cell autonomous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, using the combination of senolytic drugs, D and Q, we can effectively attain the same outcome in ageing and diabetic mice, opening the door to novel therapeutic approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results show that cell senescence can cause steatosis cell autonomously by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in reduced fat metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction is a regulated process driven by signalling through p21 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases8 and is associated with deregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway9,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This constitutes part of a central feedback loop that stabilizes the senescent phenotype8,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mitochondrial dysfunction is a feature shared by both ageing and obesity-related pathology, especially insulin resistance, and has been associated with impaired ability to produce energy and also increases production of ROS45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, markers of ROS-derived damage have been identified in the liver of obese individuals46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, mitochondrial-derived ROS has been shown to induce telomere dysfunction, thereby contributing to cellular senescence5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, our data demonstrate that mitochondria from senescent hepatocytes cultured in vitro are not as effective as young hepatocytes in catabolizing the fatty acid palmitate causing accumulation of lipids in the cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our study reveals that cellular senescence drives hepatic steatosis and suggests that targeting senescent cells may be a novel pharmacological strategy to reduce steatosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
