Zeeman splitting and dynamical mass generation in Dirac semimetal ZrTe5  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dirac semimetals have attracted extensive attentions in recent years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been theoretically suggested that many-body interactions may drive exotic phase transitions, spontaneously generating a Dirac mass for the nominally massless Dirac electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far, signature of interaction-driven transition has been lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work, we report high-magnetic-field transport measurements of the Dirac semimetal candidate ZrTe5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the large g factor in ZrTe5, the Zeeman splitting can be observed at magnetic field as low as 3 T. Most prominently, high pulsed magnetic field up to 60 T drives the system into the ultra-quantum limit, where we observe abrupt changes in the magnetoresistance, indicating field-induced phase transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is interpreted as an interaction-induced spontaneous mass generation of the Dirac fermions, which bears resemblance to the dynamical mass generation of nucleons in high-energy physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work establishes Dirac semimetals as ideal platforms for investigating emerging correlation effects in topological matters.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the past few decades, transition-metal pentatelluride ZrTe5 has attracted considerable attentions for its mysterious temperature anomaly1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Charge density wave was believed to be the origin of the anomalous peak in the temperature-dependent resistance but later it was excluded by experiments2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, both theory3 and experiments4,5,6 demonstrated that the band structure of ZrTe5 is very complicated with multiple bands contributing to the electronic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both single-frequency5,6 and multi-frequency4 Shubnikovde Haas (SdH) oscillations were reported in ZrTe5, suggesting a strong dependency of the electron states on the Fermi energy, EF, in the band structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, this material was reinvestigated as a candidate of Dirac semimetal7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A linear energymomentum dispersion of the electronic structure in ZrTe5 was demonstrated by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)8 and optical spectroscopy measurements9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The negative magnetoresistance caused by chiral magnetic effect was also observed through magnetotransport8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These experimental evidences all suggest that ZrTe5 is a Dirac semimetal candidate, which is similar to other Dirac semimetals11,12,13,14,15,16 with extremely large magnetoresistance17,18,19 and the negative magnetoresistance8,20,21,22 possibly induced by the chiral anomaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the single-particle physics of Dirac semimetals, including ZrTe5 is under intense study, the many-body correlation effects are much less investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A high magnetic field would significantly enhance the density of states near the Fermi level, thus effectively amplifying the correlation effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore highly desirable to investigate the behaviour of ZrTe5 in the high-magnetic field regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possible phase transitions in high-magnetic fields have been reported in semimetallic graphite and bismuth23,24,25,26,27,28,29, which, however, are not ideal Dirac semimetals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Dirac and Weyl semimetals, it has been theoretically suggested that a high-magnetic field may induce the dynamical mass generation30,31,32,33,34, namely, a Dirac mass is spontaneously generated by interaction effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on material details, the Dirac mass can manifest itself as charge density wave30,33,35, spin density wave31 or nematic state34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the mass generation has been observed at the surface of two-dimensional (2D) topological crystalline insulators36,37, so far there is no clear evidence of its occurrence in three-dimensional bulk Dirac materials, despite its closer resemblance to that occurring in particle physics38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, dynamical mass generation in three-dimensional Dirac semimetals hosts a number of unusual phenomena absent in two dimensions, for instance, it is expected that the topological dislocations associated with the dynamically generated mass may possess chiral modes35,39,40, holding promises to dissipationless transport inside three-dimensional bulk materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report systematic transport measurements of single-crystal ZrTe5 under extremely large magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our samples show good crystalline quality and exhibit sufficiently high electron mobility at low temperatures, enabling the observation of SdH oscillations under a relatively small magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By tilting the field direction, we mapped the morphology of the detected Fermi surface and examined the topological property of ZrTe5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extracted band parameters suggest ZrTe5 to be a highly anisotropic material.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, with a weak magnetic field the spin degeneracy is lifted, generating a pronounced Zeeman splitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, by taking advantage of the tiny Fermi surface, this material can be driven into its quantum limit regime within 20 T, where all the carriers are confined in the lowest Landau level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the magnetic field, we observe sharp peaks in the resistivity, which are naturally explained as dynamical mass generation coming from Fermi surface nesting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generated Dirac mass endows an energy gap to the nominally massless Dirac electrons, causing sharp increase in the resistivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings not only suggest ZrTe5 a versatile platform for searching novel correlated states in Dirac semimetal but also show the possibility on field-controlled novel symmetry-breaking phases manifesting the Dirac mass in the study of Dirac and Weyl semimetals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

temperature dependence of the resistance Rxx and Hall effect measurements provide information on the electronic states of a material in a succinct way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first carried out regular transport measurements to extract the fundamental band parameters of as-grown ZrTe5 crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a Hall bar sample, the current was applied along the a axis and the magnetic field was applied along the b axis (the stacking direction of the ZrTe5 layers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b shows the temperature dependence of the resistance Rxx of ZrTe5 under the zero field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An anomalous peak, the unambiguous hallmark of ZrTe5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4), emerges at around 138 K and is ascribed to the temperature-dependent Fermi energy shift of the electronic band structure42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hall effect measurements provide more information on the charge carriers responsible for the transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hall coefficient changes sign around the anomaly temperature, implying the dominant charge carriers changing from holes to electrons (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nonlinear Hall signal suggests a multi-carrier transport at both low and high temperatures, which is also confirmed by the Kohlers plot and our first-principles electronic structure calculations (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For convenience, a two-carrier transport model43,44 is adopted to estimate the carrier density and mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dominant electron exhibits an ultrahigh mobility of around 50,000 cm2 V1 s1 at low temperature, which leads to strong SdH oscillations as we will discuss later.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Around the temperature of the resistance anomaly, the electron carrier density has already decayed to almost one-tenth of that at low temperature, and finally holes become the majority carriers at T138 K (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed analysis of the two-carrier transport is described in Supplementary Notes 1 and 2 and in Supplementary Figs 18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fermi surface and quantum oscillations analysis', 'Elaborate measurements of angle-dependent magnetoresistance (MR) provide further insight into the band-topological properties of ZrTe5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A different external magnetic field geometry has been exploited to detect the Fermi surface at 2 K, as shown in Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the magnetic field B0.5T is applied along the b axis, clear quantum oscillations can be identified, indicating a high mobility exceeding 20,000 cm2 V1 s1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MR ratio  is around 10 (here R(B) is the resistance under magnetic field B and R(0) is the resistance under zero field), lower than previous results8 on account of different Fermi level positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the magnetic field is tilted away from the b axis, the MR damps with the law of cosines, suggesting a quasi-2D nature and a highly anisotropic Fermi surface with the cigar/ellipsoid shape.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is reasonable for a layered material45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A Landau fan diagram of arbitrary angle (Fig 2b) is plotted to extract the oscillation frequency SF and Berrys phase B according to the LifshitzOnsager quantization rule46: , where N is the Landau level index, SF is obtained from the slope of Landau fan diagram and  is the intercept.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Dirac fermions, a value of || between 0 and 1/8 implies a non-trivial  Berrys phase46, whereas a value of around 0.5 represents a trivial Berrys phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the integer indices denote the Rxx peak positions in 1/B, while half integer indices represent the Rxx valley positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid the influence from the Zeeman effect, here we only consider the N3 Landau levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the magnetic field along the b axis, the Landau fan diagram yields an intercept  of 0.14±0.05, exhibiting a non-trivial Berrys phase for the detected Fermi surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the same time, SF shows a small value of 4.8 T, corresponding to a tiny Fermi area of 4.6 × 104 Å2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The system remains in the non-trivial Berrys phase as long as 070° (Fig 2b inset and Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also obtained the angular dependence of SF as illustrated in the inset of Fig 2c where a good agreement with a 1/cos relationship is reached, confirming a quasi-2D Fermi surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as the magnetic field is rotated towards the c axis (70°), the Berrys phase begins to deviate from the non-trivial and finally turns to be trivial when B is along the c axis (Fig 2b inset, the two dark-red curves with intercept of 0.5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the oscillation frequency SF deviates from the cosines law and gives a value of 29.4 T along the c axis (Fig 2c inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Berrys phase development along with the angular-dependent SF unveils the quasi-2D Dirac nature of ZrTe5 and possibly a nonlinear energy dispersion along the c axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also confirmed by the band parameters such as the effective mass and the Fermi velocity, as described below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Angular MR and SdH

The second Landau level offers a better view of the Zeeman splitting because of the relatively small MR background, as marked by the dashed lines in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Rxy signal provides a much clearer signal: after subtracting the MR background, it reveals strong Zeeman splitting from the oscillatory component Rxy (Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 0.4 K, the fifth Landau level begins to exhibit a doublet structure with a broad feature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under higher magnetic fields, the separation of the doublet structure increases, in particular, the second Landau level completely evolves into two peaks, indicating the complete lifting of spin degeneracy due to the Zeeman effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To analyse the Zeeman effect occurred at such low temperature conveniently, we rearranged the spin phase factor in equation (1) by the product-to-sum formula47 (detailed mathematical process is available in Supplementary Note 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the oscillation component Rxx is equivalent to the superposition of the oscillations from the spin-up and spin-down Fermi surface', 'Figure 3: Zeeman splitting in ZrTe5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) MR behaviour of ZrTe5 at the temperature range of 0.263 K.

large g factor, it is understandable that the Zeeman splitting could be easily observed in a relatively weak magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have further carried out the theoretical Landau level calculations, which provides a clear insight into the Zeeman splitting as elaborated in Supplementary Note 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In short, when the magnetic field is along the b axis (z direction), the Landau level energy eigenvalues for n0 are , where B is the Bohr magneton, and in this case Ek=vzkz,  is the Landau level energy of the band bottom of the n=1 Landau level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the Landau levels are split by, resulting in the observed Zeeman splitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The angular-dependence of the Zeeman splitting can provide valuable information to probe the underlying splitting mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3e shows the first-order differential Rxy as a function of 1/Bcos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pronounced quantum oscillations with Zeeman splitting can be unambiguously distinguished and they align well with the scale of 1/Bcos, further verifying the quasi-2D Fermi surface as mentioned before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is noticeable that the spacing of the Zeeman splitting changes with the field angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, Zeeman splitting effect is believed to scale with the total external magnetic field so that the spacing of the splitting Landau level would not change with angle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the case of ZrTe5, the spacing of the Zeeman splitting, normalized by Bcos, is consistent with the quasi-2D nature (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The angular dependent Zeeman splitting can be attributed to the orbital contribution caused by strong spin-orbit coupling in ZrTe5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding the effect of the exchange interaction induced by an external field, we may decompose the splitting into an orbital-dependent and an orbital-independent part, where the former one depends on the shape of the band structure that leads to the angle-dependent splitting, and the latter one mainly comes from the Zeeman term that hardly contributes to any angular dependent splitting11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the highly anisotropic Fermi surface of ZrTe5 and the strong spin orbital coupling from the heavy Zr and Te atoms, the orbital effect in the ac plane of ZrTe5 is significant, giving rise to a highly anisotropic g factor and an angular-dependent Zeeman splitting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar phenomena have also been observed in materials such as Cd3As2 (refs 49, 57) and Bi2Te3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Magnetotransport under high magnetic fields', 'A high magnetic field up to 60 T was applied to drive the sample to the ultra-quantum limit to search for possible phase transitions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 4a shows the angular-dependent MR of ZrTe5 under strong magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurement geometry can be found in Fig 3f inset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several features are immediately prominent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, when the magnetic field is along the a axis, Zeeman splitting is observed, which is consistent with the theoretically solved Landau levels (Supplementary Note 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The g factor along the a axis extracted by formula (2) is 3.19, which agrees well with the anisotropy of g factor discussed above (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the magnetic field is along the c axis, spin-splitting is hardly observed, again consistent with the theoretical expectations and the recent magneto-spectroscopy results9 (Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the Landau level energy eigenvalues become , here Ek=vyky.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect of the magnetic field is the horizontal shifting of the degenerate Landau levels by ±gBB/vy in the ky vector direction (the field direction), instead of splitting the heights of the band bottom like the case when the field is along the a or b axis, thus there is no Landau level splitting in the quantum oscillation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, even with an external magnetic field up to 60 T (in the quantum limit regime), the MR feature still follows the Bcos fitting, confirming once again the quasi-2D nature of ZrTe5 (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, and most importantly, a huge resistance peak emerges at around 8 T, followed by a flat valley between 12 and 22 T, then the resistance increases and forms a shoulder-like peak at 30 T. It should be emphasized that the amplitude of the resistance at 8 T is much larger than the amplitude of SdH oscillations, so that the signal of the first Landau level has been submerged into the anomalous peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a few materials show analogous field-induced electronic instabilities, such as bismuth23,24,26, graphite25,29,59, and more recently the Weyl semimetal TaAs (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we have remarked, the SdH peak due to the n=1 Landau level merges into the anomalously large peak around B=8 T, which suggests that the n=2 Landau levels are empty and the electrons in the n=1 Landau level are responsible for the anomalous peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of Fermi level is schematically shown in Fig 4c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The peak can be naturally explained by the picture of dynamical mass generation (accompanied by a density wave formation, with the wave vector being the nesting vector) in the n=1 Landau levels, which leads to the generation of an energy gap for the electrons in these Landau levels, thus significantly enhancing the resistivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 4c, we illustrate one of the possibilities of nesting vectors responsible for this instability (the other possibility being two vectors connecting the Fermi momenta 1 to 3, and 2 to 4, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the vector  is slightly different from the vector  due to the Zeeman splitting, the density wave transition should also be Zeeman split, which is presumably responsible for the existence of a bump near the top of the peak in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Ultra-quantum limit transport and dynamical mass generation of ZrTe5 at 4.2 K.(a) Angular-dependent MR of ZrTe5 at 4.2 K under high magnetic field up to 60 T.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Finally, let us briefly compare ZrTe5 with the previously widely studied Dirac semimetals such as Cd3As2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Cd3As2, it is difficult to observe such field-induced density wave transitions with ultra-high magnetic field49,62 because of their high Fermi velocity along any directions, leading to lower density of states insufficient to achieve pronounced density wave transitions or dynamical mass generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the strong anisotropy of ZrTe5 leads to an exotic layered transport and a quasi-2D Fermi surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The consequent Fermi velocity along the b axis is very small, which strongly enhances the density of states when the magnetic field is along the b axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another advantage of ZrTe5 is the relatively tiny Fermi surface in ac plane, making it accessible to reach the low Landau level with relatively weak magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the strong magnetic field, the electronelectron interaction can be efficiently enhanced, amplifying the instability towards dynamical mass generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unambiguous Dirac feature in the ac plane together with the highly anisotropic Fermi velocity makes ZrTe5 an outstanding platform to study the field-induced instabilities of Dirac fermions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have studied the transport properties of the newly discovered Dirac semimetal ZrTe5, and found signatures of the field-induced dynamical mass generation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a quasi-2D Dirac material with small Fermi velocity along the layered direction, ZrTe5 is an ideal material to explore field-induced many-body effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study may open up a research avenue in the subject of Dirac and Weyl semimetals, namely, field-controlled symmetry-breaking phases manifesting the Dirac mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, it will also be highly interesting to search for the topological dislocations35,39,40 of the dynamically generated mass, which may host the dissipationless chiral modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a wider perspective, this study shows the possibility of investigating and engineering interaction effects in topological materials, topological semimetals in particular, by applying external fields.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
