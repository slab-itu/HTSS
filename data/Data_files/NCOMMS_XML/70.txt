Zinc regulates a key transcriptional pathway for epileptogenesis via metal-regulatory transcription factor 1  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common focal seizure disorder in adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In many patients, transient brain insults, including status epilepticus (SE), are followed by a latent period of epileptogenesis, preceding the emergence of clinical seizures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In experimental animals, transcriptional upregulation of CaV3.2 T-type Ca2+-channels, resulting in an increased propensity for burst discharges of hippocampal neurons, is an important trigger for epileptogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide evidence that the metal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1) mediates the increase of CaV3.2 mRNA and intrinsic excitability consequent to a rise in intracellular Zn2+ that is associated with SE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adeno-associated viral (rAAV) transfer of MTF1 into murine hippocampi leads to increased CaV3.2 mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, rAAV-mediated expression of a dominant-negative MTF1 abolishes SE-induced CaV3.2 mRNA upregulation and attenuates epileptogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, data from resected human hippocampi surgically treated for pharmacoresistant TLE support the Zn2+-MTF1-CaV3.2 cascade, thus providing new vistas for preventing and treating TLE.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Epilepsy affects 1% of individuals of all ages, socioeconomic backgrounds and races, and is the second most common cause of mental disability, particularly among young adults, accounting for a worldwide disease burden similar to that of breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic recurrent seizures often originate in the temporal lobe (temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)) and are pharmacoresistant in approximately a third of the patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surgical removal of the epileptic focus, albeit highly effective, represents a therapy option for only a fraction of patients4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Often, TLE develops as a consequence of a brain disease or of an acute brain insult (acquired or symptomatic TLE) via a multifaceted process referred to as epileptogenesis5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, a single episode of status epilepticus (SE) can induce the structural and functional alterations that lead to the emergence of chronic recurrent seizures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying the key epileptogenic mechanisms is essential for devising new treatments to prevent or attenuate the development of TLE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recent experimental and clinical evidence suggests that acquired transcriptional channelopathies play a role in epileptogenesis, as well as in the pathogenesis of other neurological disorders6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in rodents, SE induced chemically with pilocarpine (pilocarpine-SE) causes a marked increase in the propensity for intrinsic bursting in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, particularly in the early phase of epileptogenesis10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological analyses with subtype-selective blockers of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) disclosed the involvement of a Ni2+-sensitive-T-type Ca2+ current (ICaT) in this aberrant activity11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Congruently, ICaT was threefold upregulated early after SE, whereas other Ca2+ currents were unchanged or even reduced12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a significant upregulation of CaV3.2 mRNA, but not that of other T-type Ca2+-channel 1 mRNAs, was present in SE-experienced neurons and translated to an increase in CaV3.2 protein level13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the emergence of epileptic seizures was strongly attenuated in CaV3.2 knockout mice subjected to pilocarpine-SE13, indicating that transcriptional CaV3.2 upregulation may play a pivotal role in epileptogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has been shown that SE causes a rise in intracellular free Zn2+ concentrations (Zn2+i) in pyramidal cells14 and we have recently demonstrated that Zn2+, although acutely and reversibly blocking T-type channels15, induces a long-term upregulation of ICaT in hippocampal pyramidal cells in vivo16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we have aimed at delineating the signalling cascade linking the increase in Zn2+i to CaV3.2 promoter activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results in vitro indicate that this link is mediated by metal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting data obtained from viral transgenic mice and human TLE hippocampi suggest that MTF1 may be a target for treatment strategies aimed at impeding the development of epilepsy following acute brain insults.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we describe a novel mechanism of neuronal plasticity, which we refer to as the Zn2+MTF1CaV3.2 cascade, wherein a rise in Zn2+i activates MTF1, which then binds to MREs in the CaV3.2 gene promoter and increases transcription of this gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in CaV3.2 mRNA leads to enhanced expression of CaV3.2 channels and larger ICaT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In CA1 pyramidal cells, the ICaT increase causes regular firing cells to convert to burst firing, thereby enhancing the excitability of the hippocampal network10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our cumulative data suggest that this cascade may play a pivotal role in epileptogenesis triggered by pilocarpine-SE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, pilocarpine-SE leads to a rise in Zn2+i in CA1 pyramidal cells, appearing within a day and persisting for at least 1 week.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, exposure of cells to elevated Zn2+i induces transcriptional upregulation of CaV3.2 mediated by MTF1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, pilocarpine-SE causes a selective increase in ICaT in CA1 pyramidal cells12 that is underlain by transcriptional upregulation of CaV3.2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase is temporally correlated with the rise in Zn2+i and is reduced by transfection of these neurons with MTF1C (shown to interfere with Zn2+-induced CaV3.2 mRNA upregulation), suggesting a causal relationship between the two SE-induced effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, deletion of CaV3.2 markedly attenuates the emergence of recurrent seizures following pilocarpine-SE13, and this antiepileptogenic effect is mimicked by transfecting the hippocampi with MTF1C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the development of chronic TLE in the pilocarpine-SE model may be attenuated by targeting different components of the Zn2+MTF1CaV3.2 cascade that lead to CaV3.2 upregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found that Zn2+i increases, acting via MTF1, upregulate CaV3.2 promoter activity but do not affect transcription of other T-type Ca2+ channel subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This intriguing selectivity is due to the fact that only CaV3.2, but not CaV3.1 and CaV3.3, contain MREs in the 1.5-kb genomic region upstream of the start ATG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, gene promoters that harbour MREs are sparsely distributed throughout mammalian genomes25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only ones known to be regulated by MTF1 in a Zn2+i-dependent manner are the genes encoding for metallothioneins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are small, cysteine-rich proteins with a high affinity for Zn2+ and other heavy metals26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By increasing the expression of metallothioneins, MTF1 acts in a negative feedback manner to facilitate removal of excess free Zn2+ (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the pilocarpine-SE model, deleting CaV3.2 not only reduced the frequency of recurrent seizures in the chronic stage but also strongly protected the hippocampus from SE-induced neurodegeneration13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that transducing hippocampi with MTF1C also reduced chronic seizures frequency, but did not prevent neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy may be due to the fact that MTF1C overexpression also interferes with MTF1-mediated upregulation of metallothioneins, thereby allowing Zn2+i to increase to toxic levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this side effect, and to unequivocally prove that the reduction of seizures after treatment with MTF1C is due to a direct effect on the CaV3.2 promoter, the Zn2+-sensitive MRE in the CaV3.2 promoter could be genetically modified in vivo using the CRISPR/Cas complex28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent analysis of these mice in the pilocarpine-SE model will then reveal whether they experience less seizure activity as well as a reduced neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings suggest that pilocarpine-SE evokes the Zn2+MTF1CaV3.2 cascade by inducing a rise in Zn2+i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanism coupling SE to Zn2+i increase is yet unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the intense neuronal activity underlying SE, labile Zn2+ is released from glutamatergic terminals and may enter postsynaptic neurons via multiple routes14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, Zn2+ tightly bound to metallothioneins may be released by action of nitric oxide29,30, whose production is markedly increased during SE31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In either case, another potential strategy to impede the Zn2+MTF1CaV3.2 cascade would be the early application of cell permeable Zn2+ chelators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that Zn2+ is mandatory for many critical cell processes32, its chelation might lead to deleterious effects33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative strategy to impede the Zn2+MTF1CaV3.2 cascade would be to interfere with nitric oxide accumulation by application of nitric oxide synthase inhibitors or scavengers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological targeting of CaV3.2 blockers early after pilocarpine-SE may also prove to be antiepileptogenic, and selective CaV3.2 blockers are becoming available34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, MTF1 may be targeted pharmacologically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that activation and promoter binding of MTF1 require phosphorylation23,35 may enhance the development of inhibitory drugs, for example, by small molecule library screening36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As perspective, we suggest that pharmacological interventions targeting the Zn2+MTF1CaV3.2 cascade may prove as intriguing future option for treating pharmacoresistant TLE.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
