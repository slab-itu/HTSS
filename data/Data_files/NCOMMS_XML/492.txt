Spectral descriptors for bulk metallic glasses based on the thermodynamics of competing crystalline phases  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Metallic glasses attract considerable interest due to their unique combination of superb properties and processability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Predicting their formation from known alloy parameters remains the major hindrance to the discovery of new systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we propose a descriptor based on the heuristics that structural and energetic confusion obstructs crystalline growth, and demonstrate its validity by experiments on two well-known glass-forming alloy systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then develop a robust model for predicting glass formation ability based on the geometrical and energetic features of crystalline phases calculated ab initio in the AFLOW framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings indicate that the formation of metallic glass phases could be much more common than currently thought, with more than 17% of binary alloy systems potential glass formers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach pinpoints favourable compositions and demonstrates that smart descriptors, based solely on alloy properties available in online repositories, offer the sought-after key for accelerated discovery of metallic glasses.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Understanding and predicting the formation of multicomponent bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) is crucial for fully leveraging their unique combination of superb mechanical properties1 and plastic-like processability2,3,4 for potential applications5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process underlying the formation of BMGs is still to be fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It involves a multitude of topological fluctuations competing during solidification across many length scales9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-range processes, required by the typical non-polymorphic nature of the crystallization, and atomic-scale fluctuations, precursors of short-range ordered competing phases13, are all pitted against each other and against glass formation9,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations of amorphous phases have been attempted to disentangle the mechanism of glass formation16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23, within reasonable system sizes, using classical and semi-empirical potentials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they have been successful in investigating the influence of factors such as the atomic size and packing on the glass-forming ability (GFA), questions about competing crystalline phases and the dynamics of the process still remain, especially considering all the approximations demanded for performing long molecular dynamics simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, adopting ab initio methods has been challenging24: even while the most relevant metastable crystalline phases can be calculated and sorted by their energies25,26,27,28,29, the zero-temperature formalism, lacking vibrational free energy30, and the absence of an underlying lattice on which to build configurational thermodynamics31,32 make the problem impervious to direct computational analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Descriptors for bulk glass formationcorrelations between the outcome (glass formation) and other material properties, possibly simpler to characterize24have been proposed based on structural21,22,33,34, thermodynamic8,34,35,36,37,38, kinetic36,39 and electronic structure considerations21,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A few of these8,38 have been considerably successful in correlating with the GFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, they rely on experimental data, such as the (reduced) glass transition temperatures, that can only be obtained once the glass has been synthesized, and, therefore, cannot be used to make predictions for systems that have not yet been experimentally studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, a definite and clear picture for predicting GFA still remains to be found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In a seminal paper41, Greer speculated that confusion during crystallization promotes glass formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, challenges in a priori knowledge and ability to quantify such confusion have left this direction mostly unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this work we propose a definition of this confusion based on the following consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During quenching, crystal growth will occur whenever fluctuations lead to the formation of a crystalline nucleus larger than a critical size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, to obtain an amorphous solid, the formation of critical size nuclei has to be hampered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We postulate that the existence of multiple phases with very similar energy, implying similar probabilities of being formed, but dissimilar structures, will lead to the formation of several distinct clusters, which will intimately compete and thus keep each other from reaching the critical size needed for crystallization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate the power of this ansatz, we first characterize confusion by the approximate thermodynamic density of distinct structural phases of metastable states, obtained from ab initio calculations (Fig 1), and concurrent GFA measurements by combinatorial synthesis of alloy libraries and high-throughput nanocalorimetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As test systems, we focus on CuZr and NiZr.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the known BMGs, CuZr is probably the most broadly studied42,43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NiZr, on the other hand, is known for having poor GFA46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast between the two glass formers, one strong and one weak, corroborates our ansatz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After having established the efficacy of our approach, we extend it into a robust numerical model for building GFA spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This extension establishes the strength of our approach, leading to a descriptor that requires no experimental input and is computationally predictable, inexpensive and quick to calculate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Descriptor for confusion.If a particular alloy composition exhibits many structurally different stable and metastable crystal phases, which have similar energies, these phases will compete against each other during solidification, disrupting and frustrating the nucleation and crystallization processes,

'Using databases for materials discovery', 'Carrying out electronic structure ab initio calculations for the infinite number of available states for a given alloy system is obviously impossible, especially when no lattice model can be built31,32, as in the case of BMGs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we adopt the agnostic approach of exploring structural prototypes mostly observed in nature for these types of systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method, shown to be capable of reasonably sampling the phase space and predicting novel compounds25,26,27,28,32, is expected to estimate the thermodynamic density of states of an alloy system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use the binary alloy data available in the AFLOW set of repositories48,49 to count the number of different structural phases in a given formation enthalpy range as a function of the composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data were obtained utilizing the VASP50,51,52 code within the AFLOW computational materials design framework30,53, at the density functional theory level of approximation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binary alloy systems are fully relaxed in accordance with the AFLOW standard settings53, which uses the GGA-PBE54,55 exchange correlation, PAW potentials56,57, at least 6,000 k-points per reciprocal atom and a plane wave cutoff at least 1.4 times the largest value recommended for the VASP potentials of the constituents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multiple different crystalline phases for each particular stoichiometry are built from the AFLOW library of common prototypes30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A simple descriptor for glass formation', 'To quantify the level of disorder associated with an alloy system, we identify the most stable structures and count all of the available phases at the corresponding compositions, ordered by their formation enthalpy difference above the respective ground state, H.

the as-deposited state and after melt/quenching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanocalorimetry measurements reveal the glass transition, crystallization and liquidus temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These quantities

measurement consisted of two thermal cycles in which the thin-film samples were heated to above the melting point and then quenched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All samples show clear signals corresponding to glass transition, crystallization and melting when first heated from the as-deposited state, indicating that they were deposited in the amorphous state (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A better glass former has a lower critical cooling rate, so the amount of amorphous phase recovered after melt/quenching should scale with GFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe in Fig 3a that the magnitude of the crystallization peak after the first thermal cycle changes significantly with composition: Cu48.5Zr51.5 has the strongest crystallization peak and is thus expected to have the highest GFA among the samples tested; Cu55.5Zr44.5 on the other hand has no discernible crystallization peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is confirmed by calorimetry measurements obtained after cooling from the melted state: the heat released on solidification results in an exothermic peak in the cooling curve; the magnitude of this peak scales with the amount of crystalline phase formed on quenching and should be inversely proportional to the GFA (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimentally observed number of phases and the amorphous phase thickness obtained from the casting experiments are shown in Fig 3c.

distinct crystallization peaks, subsequent melt/quenching did not produce any amorphous samples, and no crystallization peaks are observed in scans obtained after melting (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#
