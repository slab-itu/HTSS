Local microRNA delivery targets Palladin and prevents metastatic breast cancer  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Metastasis is the primary cause for mortality in breast cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MicroRNAs, gene expression master regulators, constitute an attractive candidate to control metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that breast cancer metastasis can be prevented by miR-96 or miR-182 treatment, and decipher the mechanism of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that miR-96/miR-182 downregulate Palladin protein levels, thereby reducing breast cancer cell migration and invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A common SNP, rs1071738, at the miR-96/miR-182-binding site within the Palladin 3-UTR abolishes miRNA:mRNA binding, thus diminishing Palladin regulation by these miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regulation is successfully restored by applying complimentary miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A hydrogel-embedded, gold-nanoparticle-based delivery vehicle provides efficient local, selective, and sustained release of miR-96/miR-182, markedly suppressing metastasis in a breast cancer mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined delivery of the miRNAs with a chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, enables significant primary tumour shrinkage and metastasis prevention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data corroborate the role of miRNAs in metastasis, and suggest miR-96/miR-182 delivery as a potential anti-metastatic drug.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Metastases are the primary cause for mortality in breast cancer, the most common cancer in women regardless of ethnicity1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, one in eight women are diagnosed with and develop invasive/metastatic breast cancer2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metastasis is a multi-step process, comprised of a series of sequential steps, starting with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, local migration and invasion of cancer cells from the primary tumour to the surrounding host tissue, intravasation into blood or lymphatic vessels, dissemination via the blood or lymphatic stream, extravasation to distant organ, survival in dormancy and finally proliferation and angiogenesis within the organ3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a unique subpopulation of primary tumour cells that acquire special traits (arising from specific gene expression) that allow the cells to successfully complete all these steps will survive and produce secondary metastases4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, each step in that process provides potential targets for metastasis prevention.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, currently, breast cancer therapy lacks effective anti-metastatic strategies6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and are highly associated with tumorigenicity, invasion, and metastasis7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Precise sequence complementation between the seed region, comprising bases 2-8 from the 5 end of the miRNA, and its binding-site within the 3 untranslated region (3-UTR) of the target mRNA is necessary to exert the downregulation effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies show that germline sequence variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA-binding sites, can disrupt the downregulation by miRNAs, with a profound effect on gene expression levels and consequentially on the phenotype, including increased risk for cancer8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we aim to determine the potential effect of SNPs within miRNA-binding sites on metastatic breast cancer progression and their potential use as suppression targets to prevent metastasis, representing an urgent therapeutic need6 (see Fig 1 for schematic study design).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Schematic diagram of a stepwise omic-data integration which informs the in vivo therapeutic approach.Local miRNA delivery to the primary tumour is used to prevent breast cancer metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine the effect of genomic alterations on breast cancer, we performed a stepwise omic-data integration to generate a narrow list of potentially functional variants for cancer metastasis, in which we intersect two datasets: TargetScan and dbSNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we identified 20 SNPs, which are located at miRNA-binding sites in regulatory 3-UTR regions of genes that are related to breast cancer (in particular those involved in cytoskeleton organization) (a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro studies reveal miR-96 and miR-182 as key regulators of breast cancer cell motility via regulation of Palladin, which encodes a cytoskeletal protein that is required for organizing the actin cytoskeleton (b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical data analysis supports clinical relevance in a human breast cancer cohort (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data corroborate the role of miRNAs in metastasis regulation, and demonstrate that in vivo local delivery of miR-96 and miR-182 to the primary tumour can serve as a potential treatment to prevent breast cancer metastasis (d).Full size image', 'Bioinformatics analysis identified a SNP, which potentially influences breast cancer metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This SNP, rs1071738, was found to be located in a target site for miR-96 and miR-182 on the 3-UTR of the PALLD gene, which encodes the Palladin actin-associated protein, a documented player in breast cancer motility11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro experiments revealed a functional downregulation of Palladin levels by miR-96 and miR-182, which subsequently reduces migration and invasion abilities of breast cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the miRNAs regulate Palladin in a SNP-genotype dependent manner, that is, Palladin regulations is disrupted by the SNP allele that abolish the binding of the miRNA to its target mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying complimentary engineered miR-96 or miR-182 enables restoration of Palladin regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An in vivo experiment showed that the use of nanoparticles embedded in a hydrogel scaffold as a miRNA delivery vehicle enables an efficient and specific delivery of miR-96/miR-182 to breast tumours, which results in marked reduction of breast cancer metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, intercalation of a chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, to the miR-conjugated nanoparticles further improves the effect, leading to significant reduction in both primary tumour growth and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study highlights the therapeutic potential of miRNAs, and specifically miR-96 and miR-182, and support the importance of Palladin regulation in breast cancer metastasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'PALLD SNP as breast cancer metastasis functional variant', "To determine the potential effect of SNPs within miRNA-binding sites on metastatic breast cancer progression, we initially generated a cross section list of such potentially functional variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We utilized a stepwise omic-data integration approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In step I, we intersected a list of breast cancer genes (based on PubMed, see Methods section) with two additional data sets: TargetScan, a database of conserved miRNA target sites, and dbSNP, a database of known SNPs (Fig 2a, Supplementary Dataset 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In step II, we further restricted the list of genes to genes that were classified by the Gene Ontology (GO) term 'cytoskeleton organization' since one of the most critical steps in tumour progression and metastasis is the acquisition of migration and invasion capabilities3,5 by reassembly of actin-cytoskeletal structures in the cell14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we identified 20 SNPs that are located in 3-UTR miRNA-binding sites of 19 breast cancer genes known to be involved in cytoskeleton organization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, six of these genes ( greater than 30%) were previously identified as contributors to tumour metastasis (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", "Figure 2: miR-96 and miR-182 regulate the Palladin metastasis promoting protein.

organization' genes, we focused on the SNP with the highest ( greater than 43%) minor allele frequency and thus largest population effect: the rs1071738 SNP in the PALLD gene (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We speculate that this type of functional variant is not under strong negative selection as its effect is exerted after the reproduction period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'The ancestral C allele of rs1071738 is the minor allele in dbSNP and in European populations, whereas the alternate G allele is much more common.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, allelic frequencies of the two alleles vary greatly between diverse populations (2090%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The PALLD gene encodes multiple isoforms of the Palladin actin-associated protein, resulting from multiple start sites and alternative splicing of the gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the Universal Protein Database lists nine distinct Palladin isoforms15; however, differential expression of palladin isoforms is largely cell-type specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three isoforms most commonly studied are: isoform 4, with an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa, highly expressed in vertebrates, and the most ubiquitous isoform in both embryonic and adult mouse tissues; isoform 3, 140 kDa, widely expressed and particularly abundant in the brain and in epithelial-derived cell lines; isoform 1, 200 kDa with limited expression in heart, skeletal muscle, testis and bone16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Palladin isoform 4, and to some extent also Palladin isoform 3, were recently shown to be involved in the invasive behaviour of metastatic cells, specifically breast cancer cells, by increasing migration and invasive motility through several mechanisms such as linking extracellular matrix degradation to cell cytoskeleton11 and regulating podosome and invadopodia protrusions formation12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, recent studies suggest that Palladin also plays a role in gene expression regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, genes involved in biosynthesis and assembly of collagen as well as organization of the extracellular matrix (in cancer-associated fibroblasts)15, in addition to differentiation marker genes (in smooth muscle cells)19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, Palladin expression regulation might influence multiple cellular pathways involved in cell motility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'miR-96/-182 regulate Palladin in a genotype-dependent manner', "The PALLD rs1071738 SNP is located within a predicted binding site for miR-96 and miR-182.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The seed' regions of miR-96 and miR-182 are fully complimentary to the PALLD gene when the ancestral C allele is present at their binding sites, and harbor one mismatch when the alternate G allele is present (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate the regulation of Palladin expression by miR-96 and miR-182, we initially performed a luciferase reporter assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant direct downregulation of Palladin by miR-96 (30% reduction) and miR-182 (70% reduction) was observed in the presence of the complementary C allele in both HeLa and HEK-293 T cell lines (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the presence of the alternate G allele, Palladin regulation by miR-96/182 was abolished.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we examined Palladin and miRNA expression in vitro in two human breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7, a non-invasive breast cancer cell line, and Hs578, a highly invasive breast cancer cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both cell lines are heterozygous for rs1071738 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palladin mRNA expression was assayed by RT-PCR analysis using one set of primers which amplify Palladin isoforms 1, 3 and 4 (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palladin protein was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Palladin antibody, which reacts with all three of the aforementioned isoforms (see methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these cell-lines showed opposite expression profiles of Palladin and the miRNAs; in the invasive cell-line, Hs578, the expression of Palladin was relatively high and miR-96 and miR-182 low, and in the non-invasive MCF-7 cell-line, the opposite trend was observed (Supplementary Fig 2), further supporting that downregulation of Palladin expression is controlled by miR-96/182.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", "In accordance with our notion, Palladin expression levels were suppressed by overexpression of miR-96 or miR-182 in Hs578 cells (mRNA and protein in Fig 2d,e, respectively), and increased following miR-96/182 downregulation in MCF-7 cells (Fig 2f) (for miRNA over/underexpression see Supplementary Fig 3A and B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further examine the mechanism of this effect in vitro, we utilized the highly aggressive mouse breast cancer cell line, 4T1, which is homozygous for the ancestral C allele of rs1071738 (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The binding-site of miR-96 and miR-182 at the region complementary to the seed' is identical and evolutionarily conserved between the human and mouse Palladin orthologs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The murine miR-96 sequence is completely identical to the human ortholog, and the miR-182 sequence differs in two nucleotides at the 3' end of the miRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the human results, inducing stable expression of mouse miR-96 or miR-182 (Supplementary Fig 3C) reduced Palladin isoform 4 levels dramatically in 4T1 cells (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palladin isoform 3 was undetectable in these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prominent reduction in Palladin isoform 4 levels following overexpression of miR-96 or miR-182 may be explained by stronger binding to the C alleles at the binding site, and/or by stable expression of the miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", "We hypothesized that the genotype-dependent deregulation can be repaired' by applying a complimentary engineered miRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the T47D human breast cancer cell line, which is homozygous for the alternate G allele, we observed that overexpression of WT miR-96 or miR-182 did not influence Palladin isoform 4 levels, whereas overexpression of engineered miR-96 or miR-182, in which the G nucleotide on the opposed position of the SNP was replaced by a C nucleotide thereby allowing full complementation with the binding site (Fig 2h), repaired binding and reduced Palladin isoform 4 levels (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palladin isoform 3 levels show the same trend, however the results did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to low quantification accuracy considering the very low expression levels of this isoform in T47D cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly demonstrate a functional regulatory effect for the rs1071738 SNP, in which the ancestral C allele permits miRNA:mRNA binding and the alternate G allele disrupts binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Palladin downregulation by miR-96/-182 reduces cell motility', 'Growing evidence highlights the role of Palladin in cell motility, however, studies investigating the role miR-96 and miR-182 take in regulating cancer cells migration and invasion processes (as well as proliferation or cell death) are in dispute.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some studies indicate an anti-invasion/migration or anti-proliferation role for miR-96 and/or miR-182 (refs 20, 21, 22, 23, 24), other studies, including studies addressing breast cancer, support the opposite25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the effect of miR-96 and miR-182 on the invasive behaviour of the cells was determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overexpression of miR-182 inhibits wound closure (by 53% after 20 h, Fig 3a), and overexpression of both miR-96 and miR-182 inhibit invasion in transwell invasion assays (by 14% and 25%, respectively, Fig 3b) of Hs578 human invasive breast cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, stable overexpression of both miR-96 and miR-182 in mouse 4T1 invasive breast cancer cells inhibit migration in transwell migration assays (by 59% and 19.5%, respectively, Fig 3c) as well as invasion in transwell invasion assays (by 70% and 41%, respectively, Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, downregulation of both miR-96 and miR-182 in MCF-7 human non-invasive breast cancer cells enhanced wound closure (by 21% and 34%, respectively, Fig 3e) and in 4T1 cells enhanced migration (by 40% and 30%, respectively, Fig 3f) and invasion (by 39% and 65%, respectively Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated suppression of Palladin in 4T1 cells (Fig 4a,b) significantly reduced migration and invasion abilities (by 27% and 22%, respectively) (Fig 4c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, Palladin suppression specifically blocked the inhibiting effects of miR-96 and miR-182 overexpression on migration and invasion abilities of 4T1 cells (Fig 4c,d), thereby functionally linking the miRNAs expression, Palladin expression, and cell motility (for miRNA over/underexpression see Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data strongly suggest an anti-migration and anti-invasion role for miR-96 and miR-182 in breast cancer, mediated by Palladin downregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: miR-96 and miR-182 reduce migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro.Migration and invasion abilities were evaluated using wound

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study we initially identified a common functional variant, rs1071738, at the miR-96 and miR-182 target site on the PALLD 3-UTR, that we thought may potentially influence breast cancer metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, we showed for the first time that Palladin expression is specifically regulated by miR-96 and miR-182, and demonstrated that the PALLD SNP is indeed a functional variant, in which the alternate allele abolishes miRNA:mRNA binding leading to uncontrolled regulation of Palladin expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we were able to restore this abnormal regulation by the administration of engineered, fully complimentary, miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo delivery of miR-96 or miR-182 carried on nanoparticles which are embedded in a hydrogel scaffold patch and implanted adjacent to the tumour, allowed local and sustained release of the miRNAs and efficiently blocked breast cancer from spreading to lungs, liver and brain in an orthotopic mouse model, with no systemic side effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, by intercalating cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug, within the miR-conjugated nanoparticles, we were able to achieve a local and specific delivery of the chemotherapy drug to the tumour, with a sustained release over time (as opposed to the intravenous standard of care).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This delivery of the combined therapy (cisplatin and each of the miRNAs) further improved preclinical outcomes, leading to substantial reduction in both primary tumour growth and metastasis, thereby plausibly introducing our miRNA therapy as an add-on to conventional chemotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The statistically significant inverse relationship between Palladin and miR-96/182 expression, as well as the positive relationship between Palladin expression and lymph node metastases in invasive breast carcinoma cells of the TCGA study samples, further support our in vitro and in vivo findings, and highlight their relevancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TCGA BRCA study size was insufficiently powered to detect small allelic effects ( less_than 30% for rs1071738 minor allele frequency).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, genetic association in tumours pose additional challenges and confounding effects, such as copy number variation and within and between heterogeneity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, determining the effect of rs1071738 SNP on miR-96/182 regulation of Palladin expression and breast cancer metastasis, warrants investigation of large primary and metastatic breast cancer cohorts, to promote the development of a more effective, individualized, anti-metastatic therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The therapeutic anti-metastatic potential of Palladin modulation by administrating miR-96 or miR-182 may extend to other types of cancer47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In renal cell carcinoma, for example, elevated Palladin levels in the stroma were correlated with poor clinical outcome49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another study15 showed that Palladin is highly expressed in the stroma of multiple tumour types including lung, stomach, colon and pancreas cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies have indicated a role for Palladin in pancreatic cancer48,50;
