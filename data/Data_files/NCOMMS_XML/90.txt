Nitric oxide mediates glial-induced neurodegeneration in Alexander disease  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Glia play critical roles in maintaining the structure and function of the nervous system; however, the specific contribution that astroglia make to neurodegeneration in human disease states remains largely undefined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use Alexander disease, a serious degenerative neurological disorder caused by astrocyte dysfunction, to identify glial-derived NO as a signalling molecule triggering astrocyte-mediated neuronal degeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further find that NO acts through cGMP signalling in neurons to promote cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glial cells themselves also degenerate, via the DNA damage response and p53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings thus define a specific mechanism for glial-induced non-cell autonomous neuronal cell death, and identify a potential therapeutic target for reducing cellular toxicity in Alexander disease, and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders with glial dysfunction.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Astrocytes are now known to influence a variety of complex nervous processes including sleep, learning and memory, and breathing1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the molecular and cell biological levels, astrocytes play a critical role in regulating the permeability of the bloodbrain barrier, responding to oxidative stress, modulating synaptic transmission and controlling synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the plausible role many of these processes play in neuronal dysfunction and death during neurodegeneration, astrocytes seem poised to be critical players in neurodegenerative disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, morphological changes in astrocytes are prominent in all neurological disorders characterized neuropathologically by significant cell loss or tissue damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, rigorously defining a role for astrocytes in neurodegenerative disorders has been challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in most disorders, neuronal pathology is quite prominent, raising the possibility that changes in glial cells are secondary phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, it has been challenging to identify the molecular underpinnings of glial-induced neuronal death and test cell-type-specific mechanisms in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To address these limitations, we have developed a model of a glial-based neurodegenerative disorder, Alexander disease, in the genetically accessible model organism Drosophila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alexander disease offers a unique opportunity to study glial-mediated neurodegeneration, because the primary abnormality in patients is glial: dominant missense mutations in the gene encoding glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the intermediate filament of astrocytes3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clinical presentations of this rare, but informative, disorder range from infants with prominent leukodystrophy and seizures to adults with relative preservation of myelin and a movement disorder4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases, the specific neuropathological manifestation of Alexander disease is the formation of eosinophilic, beaded inclusions termed Rosenthal fibres within astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given evidence from patients and mouse models3,6,7 for a toxic dominant gain-of-function mechanism related to abnormal aggregation and toxicity of GFAP in Alexander disease, we have modelled the disorder by expressing disease-linked forms of human GFAP in fly glia8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Drosophila model replicates key features of the human disorder, including formation of Rosenthal fibre-like inclusions, seizures and non-cell autonomous neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the molecular level, protein misfolding, oxidative stress and dysregulated glutamate transport are critical mediators of disease pathogenesis in our fly model, correlating well with results from mice and analysis of human tissue7,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An important, perhaps the most important, strength of studying human disease in Drosophila is the ability to perform unbiased forward genetic screens, which have the potential to provide hypothesis-independent insights into disease pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we have performed genetic screening in our fly model of Alexander disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through our screen, we identify nitric oxide (NO) as a critical mediator of non-cell autonomous neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, to dissect the cell-type specificity of the effect, we develop a system to manipulate gene expression independently in neurons and glia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a newly developed dual-expression system, we demonstrate a key role for NO synthesized and released in glia acting through neuronal NO targets to promote neuronal cell death.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'NO signalling is upregulated in Drosophila Alexander disease', 'Our Drosophila model of Alexander disease is based on expression of human disease-associated mutant GFAPR79H in fly glia using the standard GAL4/UAS bipartite expression system12 and the glial-specific driver repo-GAL4 (refs 8, 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model recapitulates multiple aspects of authentic Alexander disease, including glial toxicity and secondary non-cell autonomous neurodegeneration8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify genetic modifiers of GFAP toxicity in an unbiased pattern, we performed an unbiased forward genetic screen using a collection of 2,239 transgenic RNA interference (RNAi) lines14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To monitor toxicity of GFAP to glia under screening conditions, we used the transgenic caspase reporter developed by Williams et al.15 By monitoring caspase activation in 10-day-old adult flies expressing GFAPR79H and RNAi targeting individual genes in glial cells, we recovered a number of candidate suppressors and enhancers of GFAP toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of these candidate suppressors was nitric oxide synthase (Nos).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because NO represents a novel, but plausible, glial-derived neuronal cell death signalling molecule in Alexander disease, we explored NO signalling further in our Alexander disease model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first examined levels of Nos protein (encoded by a single Nos gene in flies16) in control and GFAPR79H transgenic animals using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to Drosophila Nos17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant increase in Nos in GFAPR79H flies compared with controls was detected by western blot analysis (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Double-label immunofluorescence using neuronal- and glial-specific markers confirmed the presence of Nos in glial cells (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The specificity of the antiserum was confirmed on both western blot and immunostaining using the Nos15 allele, a deletion mutant of Nos removing the entire oxygenase domain17 (Supplementary Figs 1a and 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To probe Nos activity in our GFAPR79H transgenic flies, we performed nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase histochemistry18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with Nos protein upregulation, significantly increased NADPH-diaphorase staining was present in GFAPR79H transgenic flies (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, with a sensitive and specific NO sensor, Cu2(FL2E)19, we observed significantly increased in vivo NO production in the brains of GFAPR79H transgenic flies compared with controls (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore potential mechanisms responsible for upregulation of Nos in our transgenic animals, we evaluated the activity of a well-characterized reporter of STAT expression, 10XSTAT-GFP20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed upregulation of STAT expression specifically in GFAPR79H transgenic flies (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: NO signalling is upregulated in GFAPR79H transgenic flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Western blot shows increased expression of Nos in GFAPR79H transgenic flies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blot was reprobed for actin to illustrate equivalent loading.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quantification of Nos protein levels in control and GFAPR79H transgenic flies is shown in the graph at the right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P=0.0078, t=6.371, df=3;

these modified proteins represent an important indicator of nitrosative stress21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis performed with a previously characterized polyclonal anti-nitrotyrosine antibody22,23,24 demonstrated increased levels of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins in GFAPR79H transgenic flies compared with controls (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is an important specific target of NO-mediated nitrosylation25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nitrosylation of sGC activates the enzyme and increases cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cGMP, in turn, is an important second messenger for a number of downstream targets, including cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGs25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a sensitive chemiluminescent immunoassay, we found significantly increased levels of cGMP in brains of GFAPR79H flies compared with controls (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also investigated levels of Nos protein, nitrotyrosine-containing proteins and cGMP in transgenic flies that express wild-type human GFAP (GFAPWT) at levels equivalent to GFAPR79H, and show no evidence of toxicity or inclusion formation (Supplementary Fig 1f, GFAPWT)8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected no significant difference in Nos protein levels, nitrotyrosine-containing proteins or cGMP levels between GFAPWT transgenic flies and control flies (Supplementary Fig 1ce), demonstrating specificity for disease-associated mutant GFAPR79H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as seen in murine models, increased expression of wild-type human GFAP does result in the formation of Rosenthal fibre-like inclusions (Supplementary Fig 1f, 2 × GFAPWT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further investigated three additional Alexander disease-associated mutant forms of GFAP, GFAPR239H, GFAPL352P and GFAPA364P.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these mutant forms of GFAP formed Rosenthal fibre-like inclusions in Drosophila glia (repo-GAL4 driver; Supplementary Fig 1g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed inclusion formation when human mutant GFAP was expressed in specific glial subtypes (Supplementary Fig 1i,j), including astrocyte-like glia (alrm-GAL4 driver) and ensheathing glia (mz0709-GAL4 driver)26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not observe significant cellular toxicity with expression in either of these glial subtypes, most likely due to lower levels of transgene expression mediated by these drivers, as demonstrated by reduced -galactosidase (-gal) expression mediated by alrm-GAL4 compared with repo-GAL4 (Supplementary Fig 1k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Modulation of Nos signalling alters GFAP toxicity in vivo', 'To determine whether GFAP toxicity is influenced by Nos activity, we first manipulated the single Drosophila Nos gene genetically.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpressing Nos in glia using a UAS-Nos transgene and the glial driver repo-GAL4 markedly increased the number of TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL)-positive cells, while reducing Nos with either of the two independent transgenic RNAi lines significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the brains of GFAPR79H flies (Fig 2a,e; Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing Nos in the absence of transgenic human GFAPR79H did not produce toxicity (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis demonstrated marked reduction in Nos levels following RNAi-mediated gene knockdown (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that modulation of GFAP toxicity was not simply due to alterations in GFAP protein levels, we examined GFAP expression in genetically modified backgrounds and observed equivalent GFAP protein levels (Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with positive TUNEL staining, the nuclei of dying cells were often condensed (43.36±2.06%) and fragmented (32.82±1.64%) in GFAP transgenic flies (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant numbers of cells with cleaved caspase (Dcp-1) were present, and activation of hid and th (also known as Diap1), key regulators of apoptosis, was observed using transgenic reporter lines27,28 (Supplementary Fig 2eg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore the specificity of our findings, we altered activity of the Nos pathway in flies expressing mutant human ataxin 3, the aggregation-prone polyglutamine expanded protein expressed in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, in glia29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nos pathway modifiers, including Nos overexpression and knockdown, did not alter the toxicity of mutant ataxin 3 as monitored by vacuolation in the brains of transgenic animals (Supplementary Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Genetic and pharmacological modulation of Nos activity alters GFAPR79H toxicity.Nos was overexpressed with a UAS-Nos transgene (Nos OE) and reduced with UAS-Nos RNAi lines (Nos RNAi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFAP represents UAS-GFAPR79H.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The number of TUNEL-positive cells is increased in GFAPR79H transgenic flies with overexpression of Nos (Nos OE) and decreased with reduced expression of Nos (Nos RNAi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  **P less_than 0.0001, F=72.53, df=29;

Supplementary Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L-NAME had no effect on the levels of GFAP protein (Supplementary Fig 2j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our fly model of Alexander disease, expression of GFAPR79H specifically in glia triggers non-cell autonomous neurodegeneration8, as also occurs in human patients5,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since NO is a diffusible signalling molecule, we hypothesized that NO released from glia triggers neuronal cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To begin to test our hypothesis, we examined glial and neuronal cell death in GFAPR79H flies with altered levels of Nos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We and others have previously observed loss of endogenous cell-type-specific markers in apoptotic cells8,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore introduced -gal, expressed using UAS-lacZ and repo-GAL4, as a transgenic marker and performed double labelling with TUNEL to identify dying glia specifically and distinguish neuronal from glial cell death (Supplementary Fig 2k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With our cell-type-specific labelling of apoptotic cells, we observed that overexpression of Nos in glia significantly promoted neuronal cell death, consistent with a non-cell autonomous effect of glial NO release (Fig 2e, middle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, we also observed modestly increased glial cell death with Nos overexpression, as well as reduction in both neuronal and glial cell death with Nos knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are consistent with effects of Nos on toxicity in both cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to test the specific role of NO in neurons we wanted to block the effects of glial-derived NO in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our evidence for increased cGMP in GFAPR79H transgenic flies (Fig 1e), we decided to focus on the NO target sGC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Drosophila, genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits of sGC, Gyc99B and Gyc100B, have been identified and functionally characterized33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To independently and simultaneously manipulate gene expression in neurons and glia, we constructed a dual-glialneuronal expression system by combining the GAL4/UAS system and the Q system12,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Q system is a bipartite expression system, which is conceptually similar to the GAL4/UAS system but instead relies on the regulatory genes from the Neurospora qa gene cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GAL4/UAS and Q systems do not interact and can thus be used for independent simultaneous manipulation of gene expression34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our strategy for independent manipulation of glial and neuronal gene expression is illustrated in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFAPR79H (QUAS-GFAPR79H) was expressed in glia using the Q system glial driver ET31-QF34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These transgenic flies have frequent Rosenthal fibre-like inclusions and increased seizure frequency (Supplementary Fig 3ac), recapitulating the phenotypes observed when GFAPR79H is expressed in glia with repo-GAL4 driver8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transgenic RNAi targeted to Gyc99B and Gyc100B was then expressed in neurons using the elav-GAL4 driver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Galactosidase was expressed in neurons via UAS-lacZ and elav-GAL4 as a control for expression of an unrelated protein in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the dual-expression system, we found that GFAP toxicity was markedly reduced when sGC expression was reduced specifically in neurons using either of the two independent RNAi lines targeting Gyc99B or Gyc100B (Fig 3b; Supplementary Fig 3g, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduction in GFAP toxicity was not due to alterations in GFAP protein levels, as determined by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified significant reductions in messenger RNA for Gyc99B and Gyc100B with expression of transgenic RNAi targeting these loci using RTPCR (Supplementary Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data support our hypothesis that glial-derived NO activates neuronal sGC to mediate glia-induced non-cell autonomous neuronal cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with manipulation of Nos in glia, sGC knockdown in neurons rescued both neuronal and glial cell death (Fig 3b; Supplementary Fig 3g, middle and right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of TUNEL-positive cells as neurons or glia in Fig 3b was based on morphology, as informed by cell-type-specific labelling experiments (Fig 2e), given difficulties encountered in introducing an additional transgene into the complex genotypes illustrated in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Knockdown of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) in neurons reduces GFAP toxicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic diagram of the dual-transcriptional system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To independently manipulate gene expression in glia and neurons, the GAL4/UAS system and the Q system are used together.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GFAPR79H (QUAS-GFAPR79H) is expressed in glia with the Q system glial-specific driver ET31-QF (green box) and RNAi lines (UAS-RNAi) targeting sGC are expressed in neurons with the GAL4/UAS system neuronal-specific driver elav-GAL4 (pink box).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nitric oxide synthase (Nos) produces NO in glia from L-arginine and O2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO diffuses to neighbouring neurons and activates sGC, which converts GTP to cGMP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By expressing RNAi directed to sGC in neurons, NO signalling is blocked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Knockdown of two Drosophila sGC subunits, Gyc99B and Gyc100B, with independent RNAi lines, markedly reduces the number of TUNEL-positive cells in GFAPR79H transgenic flies (total, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both neuronal (middle) and glial (right) cell death are rescued by reducing expression Gyc99B and Gyc100B in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  **P less_than 0.0001, compared with UAS-lacZ control, F=15.32;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although morphological alterations are characteristic of astrocytes (so-called reactive gliosis) in any brain condition with major parenchymal injury, defining the specific role astrocytes play in promoting neuronal pathology has been difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant neuronal pathology is present in many serious neurological disorders, including neurodegenerative disease, stroke, epilepsy and other brain syndromes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, distinguishing between a primary causal or secondary reactive role for glia in these pathologies has been difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To define a primary role of astrocytes in neurodegeneration, we focused here on Alexander disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alexander disease is caused by dominant mutations in GFAP, an intermediate filament protein of astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in Alexander disease neurodegeneration is linked directly to astrocyte dysfunction5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identifying the signalling molecule(s) and pathways that mediate toxic effects of astrocytes on neurons has been a second major challenge in understanding the role astrocytes play in neuronal dysfunction and death43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have used a fly model of Alexander disease, which replicates major features of the human disorder8, to perform a forward genetic screen aimed at identification of secreted signalling molecules that promote neuronal death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our screen recovered Nos, the single fly Nos16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provided strong evidence that NO signalling through cGMP is activated in our fly model, and using both genetics and pharmacology we demonstrated that NO signalling is critical for neuronal death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we also showed activation of the same NO signalling pathway in astrocytes of well-characterized mouse models of Alexander disease, as well as upregulation of iNOS in post-mortem brain samples from patients with Alexander disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous experiments have demonstrated that STAT3 can bind to the iNOS promoter and stimulate transcription44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a well-characterized STAT reporter20, we observed upregulation of STAT in GFAP transgenic flies, suggesting that activation of the JAK/STAT pathway could contribute to upregulation of Nos in Alexander disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Defining the cell-type-specific effects of soluble signalling molecules in vivo has represented a further barrier in understanding the molecular mechanisms of glial-based neurodegeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address cell-type specificity, we have developed a system to independently manipulate gene expression in glia and in neurons in our Alexander disease Drosophila model (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the dual-expression system, we provided strong evidence that glial-derived NO activates cGMP signalling in neurons to promote neuronal cell death by reducing the NO receptor, sGC, specifically in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, however, we also found that knockdown of sGC in neurons reduces glial cell death as well as neuronal cell death (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are consistent with signalling, perhaps via NO, from neurons back to glia in our system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar amplification process based on release of neuronal NO has been reported in a cell culture model related to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings raise the possibility that non-cell autonomous nervous system injury in other gliopathic disorders might also be driven by glial-derived NO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, NO has been implicated in a variety of neurological diseases with prominent astrocytic pathology, including Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic deletion of iNOS is neuroprotective in experimental models of these disorders47,48, supporting a functional role for the NO pathway in mediating neuronal pathology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current work, we have documented activation of the DNA damage response downstream of NO production in fly and mouse models of Alexander disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glia in both Drosophila and mouse models showed nuclear accumulation of p53 and evidence of DNA damage, as assayed by development of pH2AX/v-positive foci (Figs 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found increased levels of p53 in brains from patients with Alexander disease, supporting the relevance of our findings in experimental models to the human disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, astrocytes from patients with Alzheimers disease also show nuclear accumulation of p53 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  49) and pH2AX50, raising the possibility of similar pathways of glial pathogenesis in the most common human neurodegenerative disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, here we have used Drosophila genetics, supported by analysis of murine models, to implicate NO as a critical astrocyte-derived neuronal cell death signalling molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have further provided evidence that NO promotes glial dysfunction and death through oxidative stress, DNA damage and p53 activation, well-documented target pathways in astrocytes and other cell types41,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we used pharmacological inhibition of NO production to support NO signalling as a potential therapeutic target in Alexander disease, and possibly in other gliopathies as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, abnormal astrocytes in our Alexander disease models share similarities with astrocytes in Alzheimers disease and pharmacological inhibition of iNOS with L-NIL provides benefit in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease52,53.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
