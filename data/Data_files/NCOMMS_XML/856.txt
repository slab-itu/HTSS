Quantifying cerebral contributions to pain beyond nociception  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cerebral processes contribute to pain beyond the level of nociceptive input and mediate psychological and behavioural influences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cerebral contributions beyond nociception are not yet well characterized, leading to a predominant focus on nociception when studying pain and developing interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging combined with machine learning to develop a multivariate pattern signaturetermed the stimulus intensity independent pain signature-1 (SIIPS1)that predicts pain above and beyond nociceptive input in four training data sets (Studies 14, N=137).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SIIPS1 includes patterns of activity in nucleus accumbens, lateral prefrontal and parahippocampal cortices, and other regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cross-validated analyses of Studies 14 and in two independent test data sets (Studies 56, N=46), SIIPS1 responses explain variation in trial-by-trial pain ratings not captured by a previous fMRI-based marker for nociceptive pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, SIIPS1 responses mediate the pain-modulating effects of three psychological manipulations of expectations and perceived control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SIIPS1 provides an extensible characterization of cerebral contributions to pain and specific brain targets for interventions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Pain is widely thought to emerge from distributed brain networks whose inputs include sensory, affective and evaluative processes1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although Melzacks1 influential body-self neuromatrix framework for pain emphasized many processes beyond nociceptionincluding expectancy, attention, anxiety, and personalitythe neuromatrix came to be increasingly identified with a set of regions that encode the intensity of nociceptive input2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there has been sustained interest in the roles of other brain regions that have been commonly considered to be non-nociceptive, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)3,4, hippocampus5,6, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)7,8,9, nucleus accumbens (NAc)10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These regions are often thought to play support roles, influencing pain by modulating activity in nociceptive circuits10,13, but they may also play a central role in pain construction independent of nociceptive circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several recent studies of chronic pain in animal models suggest that this is the case14,15,16 and implicate the vmPFC, NAc and other regions in mediating pain-related behaviours independent of classic probes of nociceptive pain17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic pain appears to involve a shift away from classic nociceptive regions and towards a type of pain directly maintained in frontal-limbic networks8,18,19,20, and new theories describe pain as an emergent phenomenon related to activity in large-scale networks that include non-nociceptive regions21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore vital to gain an increasingly precise understanding of the roles of non-nociceptive brain regions in human pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Human neuroimaging approaches to understanding pain have been hampered by two important, but addressable, limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, they have typically not specified hypotheses with sufficient precision, limiting direct replications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, although the dlPFC has been implicated in pain, findings vary widely in their location and topography from study to study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results are aggregated in meta-analyses23,24, but there is no consensus on how close findings should be to be considered replications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regions of interest used in a priori analyses are typically large, encompassing heterogeneous groups of neurons with different functions without specifying any particular topography, which dilutes signal and reduces their functional specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, multivariate pattern signatures can specify a precise set of voxels and the topography of the relative expected activity levels across voxels, providing a basis for exact replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysing pattern information is analogous to analysing neural population codes25 and a number of studies show convincingly that they can capture fine-grained functional organization (for example, ocular dominance columns26) and can more accurately predict perceptions and behaviours than standard brain maps27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, it is now clear that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses in imprecisely defined gross anatomical regions (for example, the anterior cingulate) are not specific to pain, but that precisely defined multivariate patterns can have much greater sensitivity and specificity28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For these reasons, a number of groups have turned to multivariate pattern analysis to identify precisely defined patterns that predict pain intensity30,31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One recent example is the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS)32, a multivariate pattern whose weights, which specify relative activity levels, are optimized to be maximally predictive of pain based on fMRI signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NPS is precisely specified so that it can be applied to new data from 7new individuals by taking a weighted average over a test brain image (the NPS supplies the weights), yielding a single predicted pain value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature permits detailed characterization of its measurement properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NPS accurately predicts pain experience in response to noxious thermal32,34, mechanical35 and electrical stimuli35,36, but does not respond to non-noxious warm stimuli32, threat cues32,35,36, social rejection-related stimuli32, observed pain35, or aversive images37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, similar to other pain-predictive patterns, the NPS was developed to predict pain experience driven largely, although not entirely, by noxious stimuli based on fMRI activity mostly within noxious stimulus intensity-encoding regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It reflects only a subset of the various brain processes that contribute to pain and does not explain much of the variation in pain experience that is found even when the stimulus intensity is held constant (for an example case, see Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, recent studies have shown that the NPS does not explain the pain-modulating effects of several psychological interventions, including placebo treatment32, cognitive self-regulation17 and perceived control34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Identifying cerebral contributions to pain beyond nociception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The left panel provides an example of pain ratings for different levels of noxious stimuli and the right panel shows that there still remain large variation in pain ratings even after controlling for noxious stimulus intensity and the neurologic pain signature (NPS) response32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The main goal of the current study is to develop a multivariate model of endogenous cerebral contributions to pain beyond nociception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the cerebral contributions may interact with nociceptive brain systems (red nodes), whereas others contribute to pain independent of nociceptive processing (green nodes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The multivariate pattern of fMRI activity predictive of residual pain ratings after removing the effects of the stimulus intensity and NPS response, termed the stimulus intensity independent pain signature-1 (SIIPS1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The map shows thresholded voxel weights (at q less_than 0.05 false discovery rate (FDR), equivalent to uncorrected voxel-wise P less_than 0.0025) based on weighted t-tests across maps for 137 subjects in the training data sets (Studies 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thresholding was performed for display only; all weights were used in the subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some examples of unthresholded patterns are presented in the insets; small squares indicate individual voxel weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  aINS, anterior insula; CB, cerebellum;

regression analyses for the predictionoutcome relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants except for two individuals (98.5%) showed positive predictionoutcome relationships.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each coloured dot represents an individuals slope.Full size image', 'Combining the precision of multivariate pattern approaches with the study of regions outside classic nociceptive pain-related brain regions could help provide a more precise understanding of the roles of the vmPFC, NAc, dlPFC, hippocampus and others in pain processing in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, if it is possible to identify pain-predictive patterns that are independent of noxious stimulus intensity and nociceptive brain targets, this could point to a direct role for these regions in constructing pain rather than simply modulating ongoing pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in this study, we asked: (1) can we identify a multivariate pattern of fMRI activity that predicts pain experience after removing the effects of noxious stimulus intensity and the NPS (Fig 1b)?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) If so, which brain regions are involved?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (3) Does a model that includes independent contributions from non-nociceptive brain regions predict pain better than using classic noxious stimulus-encoding regions alone?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, (4) does a model that includes stimulus-independent brain regions better explain the effects of psychological interventions on pain, including expectancy and perceived control?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To address these questions in a way that is replicable and generalizable beyond a single study, we combined a mega-analytic approach with machine learning techniques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data set included 11,000 single-trial images of fMRI activity associated with multiple levels of noxious heat and pain ratings, across 183 participants from 6 independent studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first developed a new multivariate fMRI signature, termed the stimulus intensity independent pain signature-1 (SIIPS1), which is predictive of variation in pain above and beyond noxious stimulus intensity (for example, heat temperature) and nociceptive brain processes estimated by the NPS, using Studies 14 (N=137; Supplementary Table 1) as training data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We named this signature because our approach relies on precisely specifying patterns and testing them across studies, and having a name is essential to communicate that it is this precise pattern that can be used in future studies (for example, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluated the performance of the SIIPS1 in cross-validated analyses of Studies 14 and in two independent test data sets (Studies 56, N=46) using it to answer the four questions above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Results show that the SIIPS1 explains a substantial amount of the variation in trial-by-trial pain ratings not captured by the NPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SIIPS1 was a significant and consistent mediator of the effects of psychological interventions, including manipulations of expectancy and perceived control, whereas the NPS was not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the current study provides a viable new signature that can quantify cerebral contributions to pain beyond nociception.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Signature development', 'To develop the SIIPS1 pattern, we employed a multi-level approach (for details, see Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We began with single-trial estimates of brain responses during individual epochs of noxious heat from 137 participants in Studies 14 (6,740 images total, 50 trial-level images per person on average).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we removed the effects of stimulus intensity and the NPS response (a proxy for already modelled nociceptive neural processes) from each participants single trial-level brain images using a set of regressors modeling all possible differences among intensities (for details, see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we used principal component regression (PCR) to estimate a multivariate fMRI pattern that predicted residual pain ratings for each individual; this method works well with high-dimensional, multi-collinear predictors39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten-fold cross-validation was used to estimate each individuals predictionoutcome correlation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we constructed a population-level pattern map using a weighted average of the predictive maps for the 137 participants using predictionoutcome correlations as a weight (all predictionoutcome correlations were positive).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Weighted t-tests identified which brain areas made consistent contributions to prediction across participants and studies, treating participant as a random effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As shown in Fig 1c and Supplementary Fig 2, the resulting signature pattern was consistent in many brain areas across participants and studies, indicating that there are brain systems for cerebral contributions to pain beyond nociception that are conserved across individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These regions fell into three classes, based on their relationships with pain and noxious stimulus intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The first class of regions included established targets of nociceptive afferents, such as the insula, cingulate cortex and thalamus, and overlapped spatially with regions included in the NPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These regions showed positive weights in the SIIPS1, indicating that their activation predicted increased pain even when the noxious stimulus intensity is constant and NPS responses are controlled for.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analyses showed that brain activity in these regions was indeed correlated with noxious input intensity (Fig 2a,b and Supplementary Table 4); thus, these regions are not truly nociception independent, even though we regressed out stimulus intensity and the NPS response from the training data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding is sensible if endogenous variation in these nociceptive regions contributes to pain experience beyond simply encoding input intensity40,41 or the NPS is an imperfect proxy for nociception-induced pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that local pattern similarity analyses showed that the SIIPS1 and NPS weight patterns within these regions are not correlated (Supplementary Fig 3), indicating that the SIIPS1 is capturing pain-related brain activity that the NPS does not capture, even within the overlapping brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Deconstructing the SIIPS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Each dot of the scatter plots represents a contiguous brain region from the SIIPS1 thresholded at q less_than 0.05, FDR corrected (see Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red dots represent regions with positive predictive weights, and blue dots represent regions with negative predictive weights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The y axis of the scatter plots shows the mean correlations between the local pattern expression (with absolute pattern weights) and trial-by-trial noxious stimulus intensity across 183 participants from Studies 16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The x axis of the scatter plots shows the mean pattern weights of contiguous regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dashed gray lines indicate one-sample t-test results that are corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error rate less_than 0.05 (Bonferroni methods; equivalent to uncorrected P less_than 0.0011).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, dots above the dashed lines indicate regions significantly correlated with noxious input intensity (temperature) and dots below the dashed line indicate regions independent of noxious input intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Brain region maps for (b) regions that showed significant non-zero correlations with noxious input intensity and for (c) regions that showed no correlations with noxious input intensity, but still contributed to the prediction of single-trial level pain ratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Region labels, mean weight values and mean correlation values with noxious stimulus intensity (and their t- and p-values) can be found in Supplementary Table 4. aINS, anterior insula; Caud, caudate; CB, cerebellum; dmPFC, dorsomedial PFC; dlPFC, dorso-lateral PFC; dpINS, dorsal posterior insula; HC, hippocampal

they are likely to make extra-nociceptive contributions to pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These included dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), middle temporal gyrus, caudate and ventrolateral PFC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These regions showed minimal correlations with noxious stimulus intensity (Fig 2 and Supplementary Table 4): the caudate and ventrolateral PFC showed significant, but low, correlations with stimulus intensity (r=0.08, P less_than 0.001 and r=0.13, P less_than 0.001, respectively, one sample t-test on within-subject correlations after Fishers r-to-z transformation, N=183).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other regions including dmPFC and middle temporal gyrus showed no relationship with noxious input intensity (r=0.003, P=0.77 and r=0.017, P=0.18, respectively, one sample t-test, N=183).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such regions could be involved in constructing value and motivation related to pain or in mediating internal thought processes that increase pain independent of nociception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The third class of regions had negative predictive weights, indicating that increased brain activity was associated with decreased pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such regions included vmPFC, NAc, parahippocampal cortex, posterior dlPFC and others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of these regions were uncorrelated with noxious input intensity (Fig 2a,c and Supplementary Table 4), suggesting that these regions make extra-nociceptive contributions to pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Growing evidence suggests that these regions contribute to cognitive, evaluative or motivational aspects of pain instead of sensory ones14,15,42 and that they play critical roles in chronic pain4,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The signature pattern we identified here can be prospectively applied to individual trial images or other images (for example, condition averages) to make quantitative predictions about pain in out-of-sample individual participants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current training data, the cross-validated SIIPS1 response (deriving pattern maps from training data, except for one out-of-sample participant, and calculating the signature response for the out-of-sample participant) predicted residual pain ratings with mean r=0.68 when grouping trials into quartiles based on residual pain ratings (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Characterization of local pattern topography', 'The SIIPS1 also revealed finer-grained structure captured in local pattern weights within anatomical regions (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relatively large sample size combined with multivariate methods here affords increased reliability of these pattern weights, which can reveal structure not often apparent in smaller samples or univariate approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the SIIPS1 includes a region possibly corresponding to the NAc shell that predicted increased pain, whereas a region that may correspond to the NAc core negatively predicted pain, corroborating similar earlier human44,45 and animal studies15,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, an area covering the superficial and central subdivisions of the amygdala47, in particular the right one48, predicted increased pain, whereas activity in the basolateral subdivision47 predicted reduced pain, paralleling animal literature7,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, a part corresponding to the caudate tail associated with stable, learned values in animals49 and sensorimotor associations in meta-analysis50 show positive weights for pain, whereas a more anterior part of the caudate (that is, caudate head) associated with more context-dependent, flexible stimulus values49,50 show mixed, but largely negative, weights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SIIPS1 also showed fine-grained patterns of differential contributions in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and hippocampus (Fig 3bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Unthresholded patterns of SIIPS1 predictive weights for some regions-of-interest (ROIs).The ROIs include the nucleus accumbens (NAc), hippocampus, amygdala, PHG and caudate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unthresholded pattern map used to make predictions included both positive and negative weights in each region, suggesting more complex, fine-grained mapping between these regions and pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Serial coronal views of the predictive weights within the NAc, showing positive predictive weights in a shell-like region and negative weights in a core-like region, as identified in a previous fMRI-based parcellation study44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Differential roles of the NAc shell (pro-pain) versus core (anti-pain) subdivisions have been shown in animal literature15,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Serial coronal views of the hippocampus and amygdala ROIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positive weights are apparent in the superficial and central subdivisions in the amygdala (as defined by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47), and negative weights is the laterobasal group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent meta-analysis found that the superficial sub-region is often reported in experimental pain studies51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the hippocampus, positive weights were found in some areas covering cornu ammonis and dentate gyrus47, and also near caudate tail.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Serial axial views of the PHG ROI show positive weights in the entorhinal cortex (as defined by ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  47) and a peri-amydaloid areas, and negative weights in other parahippocampal areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) three-dimensional surface map of the un-thresholded SIIPS1 pattern for the ROIs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pattern showed differential roles of caudate tail (positive) versus head (largely negative, but mixed), as suggested in animal49 and metaanalysis studies50, which associate caudate tail with stable, learned stimulus value and sensorimotor functions, and caudate head with more flexible, context-dependent stimulus value.Full size image', 'These patterns of predictive weights are consistent with recent findings in animal literature7,15,46,48,49, suggesting that the topography we identified here could inform reverse translational approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the patterns within the amygdala, caudate and other regions build on recent meta-analyses that found, for example, superficial amygdala activation in experimental pain but implicated basolateral amygdala in chronic pain51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, these topographical distinctions within brain regions are not at all apparent in univariate analyses (Supplementary Figs 4 and 5), suggesting that the multivariate approach provides finer-grained and more sensible patterns related to pro- and anti-pain subregions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high sensitivity of the multivariate pattern maps could be particularly useful for bridging the gap between the study of pain in humans and non-human animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Joint predictive performance of the SIIPS1 and NPS', 'To evaluate SIIPS1s predictive performance, we quantified the joint contributions of the SIIPS1 and the NPS in predicting trial-by-trial pain ratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a multilevel general linear model to assess the unique and shared contributions of the SIIPS1 and the NPS to pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first conducted the analyses on the training data sets (Studies 14) using leave-one-participant-out cross-validation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cross-validation procedure derives a pattern map from all training participants, except one out-of-sample participant, which is used to test the variance in pain explained by the brain pattern responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The training and testing process is iterated until each participant is tested exactly once.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then conducted the same analyses on testing data sets (Studies 56) that were not included in the SIIPS1 pattern training.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses provide an unbiased test of how well the SIIPS1 captured fluctuations in pain above and beyond the NPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, to provide a preliminary examination of the SIIPS1s specificity to pain, we also tested the SIIPS1 and the NPS on a negative control data set, a vicarious pain task performed by participants in Study 2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As shown in Fig 4, both in training (Studies 14) and testing data sets (Studies 56), the SIIPS1 and the NPS each made unique, significant contributions to predicting pain on individual trials, but no significant contributions to non-painful, aversive experience (vicarious pain induced by pictures35; for details, see Methods), demonstrating the SIIPS1s sensitivity and specificity for pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variance explained was comparable in magnitude for the SIIPS1 and the NPS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the training data sets, the mean

by the SIIPS1 was significant across each of the six studies individually (all P less_than 0.001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total variance in single-trial pain ratings explained by the two fMRI signatures ranged from 22.1% to 29.7% across studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This yielded 80% classification accuracy in discriminating high versus low pain for single trials (top 30% versus bottom 30% of trials) and

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we developed a multivariate fMRI signature, SIIPS1, predictive of variations in pain ratings after removing effects of stimulus intensity and nociceptive pain-related brain activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SIIPS1 was predictive of trial-by-trial pain ratings above and beyond variations in noxious stimulus intensity, suggesting that SIIPS1 reflects endogenous cerebral contributions to pain independent of nociceptive input to the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signature included weight patterns that were consistent across individuals in a number of brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It includes negative weights (anti-pain effects) in several regions related in previous studies to motivational value (vmPFC and NAc)14,56, context and memory (for example, hippocampus and para-hippocampus)57, and cognitive context (dlPFC)58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SIIPS1 also included positive weights (pro-pain effects) in regions that receive nociceptive input (including the operculum, insula and cingulate cortex)23 and frontal regions associated with higher-level cognitive processes (for example, dmPFC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, the relatively large sample combined with the multivariate analysis technique revealed fine-grained mapping of pro-pain (positive weights) and anti-pain (negative) sub-regions within pain modulatory regions, providing a more detailed characterization of pain-associated processes than has previously been available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the unthresholded pattern of predictive weights within the SIIPS1 revealed that activity in a NAc shell-like region predicted increased pain and a core-like region predicted reduced pain, paralleling findings in human44,45 and animal studies that have associated the shell with increased pain46 and core with reduced pain15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the amygdala, the activity in superficial and the central nuclei of the amygdala showed positive weights, whereas the basolateral subdivision of the amygdala showed negative weights, consistent with animal findings7,48 and human neuroimaging literature51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SIIPS1 mediated the effects of three psychological manipulations of pain from two independent studies, including two different expectancy manipulations and one perceived control manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An important contribution of the current study is in characterizing the relationship of nociception-independent regions in the prefrontal cortex and striatum with pain on one hand and with psychological interventions on the other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies suggest that they may play important roles in both acute and chronic pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, although the NAc has not often been reported as being related to pain or regarded as a core pain system in the brain23, emerging evidence from both human and animal studies suggests that the NAc plays critical roles in shaping affective and motivational value of pain10,11,14, pain relief59, pain-related behaviours14,59 and chronic pain conditions8,16,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the SIIPS1 includes other brain regions such as PHG and vmPFC, which are not often regarded as core pain processing regions and are not implicated in sensory aspects of pain, but have been implicated in different aspects of pain including chronic pain5,6,9,15 and pain modulation60,61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Unlike previous studies, the current study provides a precise specification of the joint contributions of these nociception-independent regions, which can serve as an assay that can be easily shared and tested across different studies and laboratories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although many of the brain regions we identified in this study have been previously reported, the previous studies are not consistent in their precise locations and in the direction of the effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, studies usually consider one brain region (or voxel) at a time or, in some cases, consider isolated pairs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This practice does not tell us what each brain region really does, because its functional roles may depend on activity in other regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, some brain regions may play a secondary role that is indirect and mediated by other regions, and others may play a role that is masked by opposing effects of other, correlated regions and emerges only when controlling for it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, we provide a predictive map that specifies a precise set of locations and their relative contributions to pain controlling for other brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This multivariate model reveals a fine-grained brain-pain mapping that is not redundant with previous univariate results (Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig 4), is substantially more predictive (Fig 4b) and, unlike most previous neuroimaging findings, can be used prospectively to test interventions and patient populations in new studies (Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, dlPFC, vmPFC, NAc, amygdala, PHG and hippocampus were largely associated with less pain on average in the studies tested here, which may indicate a regulatory role based on contextualization of pain, as suggested by previous work3,15,17,60,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these regions may play variable roles in pain modulation depending on individual differences and the cognitive context; for example, parahippocampal regions have been associated with anxiety-related pain increases in some studies6,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, vmPFC activation is often associated with reduced pain in healthy controls11,41, but it has also been associated with pain catastrophizing63 and increased pain in chronic pain patients43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses also revealed some variation across studies (Supplementary Fig 2) and individual differences in the relationship between increase or reduction in pain and the SIIPS1 (for example, nonsignificant Paths a and/or b, but significant Path a × b in the mediation of the expectancy effects; Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a close examination of the SIIPS1 pattern revealed differences in the local pattern of effects across sub-regions (for example, across NAc shell-like versus core-like regions, superficial and central versus basolateral amygdala, and differences across portions of the PHG and hippocampus; Fig 3), suggesting fine-grained structure of differential contributions (anti-pain or pro-pain).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A full analysis of how these regions and their sub-regions may contribute differentially to pain in different experimental contexts, populations (for examples, patient groups) and individuals is beyond the scope of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study does, however, lay a foundation for the future characterization of these effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this regard, there are several concrete benefits to the signature pattern (or patterns if constituent local patterns are considered) we reported here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, they identify multivariate patterns that have been optimized to explain pain more strongly than region-of-interest averages or univariate maps, and do so while controlling for the influences of other brain regions (due to the multivariate nature of the analysis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is important because all the brain regions discussed contain neurons that participate in multiple, distinct functional circuits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, identifying pain-predictive patterns provides measures of activity in representations more strongly linked to pain-relevant circuits than using region-of-interest averages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, because it was constructed to generalize across participants, the SIIPS1 (and its constituent local patterns) can be tested prospectively in future studies to further characterize its performance across experimental contexts and populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, in conjunction with the NPS, SIIPS1 provides quantitative estimates of the activation intensity of at least two neurophysiological processes linked to pain, one peripheral stimulus-intensity dependent and the other endogenous and stimulus-intensity independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, both the NPS and SIIPS1 provide quantitative, physiological targets for pain interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying neurophysiological targets for interventions is a major strategy for both validating the interventions and providing mechanistic insights into how they work64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in neurological diseases such as Alzheimers, researchers have developed named, diagnostic brain signatures that provide indicators of central pathology (for example, SPARE-AD for Alzheimers38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These signatures do not replace clinicians assessments, but inform clinical assessments by providing objective evidence for pathology and brain targets for interventions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, treatment development efforts have mainly focused on interventions for peripheral or central nociceptive processesbut the success or failure of such interventions may also depend on their effects on the non-nociceptive brain systems we identified here62,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the brain signature we developed here could help provide new brain targets for pain evaluation and treatment', 'There are some issues that could benefit from further discussion here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in addition to different psychological manipulations having different effects (which remains to be more fully characterized in future studies), even the same psychological treatments may have variable effects depending on details of the manipulation and population studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, expectancy manipulations in Studies 5 and 6 were mediated by the SIIPS1, even though the SIIPS1 did not always increase with high-pain versus low-pain cues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, expectancy effects were partially mediated by the NPS in Study 6 but not Study 5, in spite of significant Paths a and b (cues to pattern responses and pattern response to pain, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such differences may be related to the strength and durability of conditioning or the depth of expectation, which may affect brain processes differentially even when they have similar effects on pain reports.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This presents a challenge for future work, but also points to an opportunity to use these brain signatures to differentiate psychological treatments at a brain level even when they look similar at a behavioural level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, for the same reason, we do not expect the SIIPS1 to be the one common mediator of all different types of topdown pain regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the SIIPS1 should be considered as one candidate signature (thus, the 1 in the name); other brain patterns may mediate other types of topdown pain regulation effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, as shown in Fig 4, the two fMRI signatures that we tested (that is, the SIIPS1 and the NPS) together explained around a quarter (25.7%) of the total variance in single trial-level pain ratings, which can achieve 80.3% classification accuracy in discriminating high pain from low pain trials (top 30% versus bottom 30% of trials; Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the single-trial level, this is a modest proportion of variance explained, but the single trial-level data are very noisy and contain many sources of unexplained variance, such as inter-individual, inter-study variations and measurement errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Supplementary Fig 6 shows, if we average over several trials, the relationships between average signature responses and average pain increase dramatically; for example, averaging over 25 trials, the signatures explain 89.4% of the variance in reported pain experience, with near-perfect classification accuracy for high versus low pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Supplementary Fig 6, we grouped trials with similar pain ratings, which still provides an unbiased measure of accuracy, because the model has no prior information about which groups of trials are more painful than others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same principle applies to any a priori grouping of trials; for example, groups of trials tested under different treatments or groups of trials administered to normal versus hypersensitive skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Third, even though we trained the signature to be predictive of variation in pain after removing the effects of nociceptive input and related brain processes, the SIIPS1 still contains brain regions that respond to nociceptive input (for example, parts of insula and cingulate cortex).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As explained above, this is sensible if endogenous variations in these nociceptive regions contribute to pain beyond encoding noxious input intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it might still be interesting to develop a brain signature that is purely non-nociceptivethat is, shows no response to nociceptive input at allbut is still predictive of pain experience.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2c provides promising candidate brain regions, including NAc, dm/vmPFC, hippocampus, temporal pole and precuneus, which are unresponsive to nociceptive input and predictive of residual pain ratings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further examination of their roles in pain and the development of pain signatures based on those brain regions could be an interesting future direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fourth, although we aimed to identify a signature that can be applied to new data from new individuals (that is, population-level model) in this study, idiographic models could also be useful for pain prediction66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Idiographic modelling approaches might be able to model the effects of individual differences on pain (for example, personal history and memories related to pain), revealing individualized neural bases for pain perception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we modelled the SIIPS1 using only spatial pattern information, yielding a static template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, dynamic modelling approaches can also be used to take into account the temporal dynamics and information flow among brain regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, our study and SIIPS1, together with the NPS, provide new ways of understanding and evaluating the neurobiological components of pain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These a priori brain signatures can be prospectively used to assess pain contributions that are nociceptive and beyond nociceptive in new individuals, and therefore provide a step towards a quantitative assessment of the multiple components of pain.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

condition across two runs) to see if the participants successfully learned the cueoutcome association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants correctly chose the cue associated with low pain in 84% of trials and the cue associated with high pain in 46% of trials, demonstrating probability matching to the frequencies of outcomes and indicating that participants successfully learned the cuepain

actual pain ratings (after pain stimulation) on a 100-point VAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thermal stimulation', 'In each study we delivered thermal stimulation to multiple skin sites using a TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer or Pathways system (Medoc Ltd, Chapel Hill, NC) with a 16 mm Peltier thermode endplate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On every trial, after the offset of stimulation, participants rated the magnitude of the warmth or pain they had felt during the trial on a VAS or labelled magnitude scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other thermal stimulation parameters varied across studies, with stimulation temperatures ranging from 40.8 to 49.3 °C and stimulation durations from 10 to 12.5 s.
