Haem-activated promiscuous targeting of artemisinin in Plasmodium falciparum  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The mechanism of action of artemisinin and its derivatives, the most potent of the anti-malarial drugs, is not completely understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present an unbiased chemical proteomics analysis to directly explore this mechanism in Plasmodium falciparum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use an alkyne-tagged artemisinin analogue coupled with biotin to identify 124 artemisinin covalent binding protein targets, many of which are involved in the essential biological processes of the parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a broad targeting spectrum disrupts the biochemical landscape of the parasite and causes its death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, using alkyne-tagged artemisinin coupled with a fluorescent dye to monitor protein binding, we show that haem, rather than free ferrous iron, is predominantly responsible for artemisinin activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The haem derives primarily from the parasites haem biosynthesis pathway at the early ring stage and from haemoglobin digestion at the latter stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results support a unifying model to explain the action and specificity of artemisinin in parasite killing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Plasmodium falciparum, the most pathogenic human malaria parasite, infects millions of human beings and poses a serious public health threat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the most potent anti-malarial drugs are artemisinin and its derivatives1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone with an endoperoxide bridge3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hallmark of artemisinin activation is the generation of highly reactive carbon-centred radicals via endoperoxide cleavage4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even after several decades of intensive studies on the mechanism of action of artemisinin7,8, two critical yet unresolved long-standing questions remain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first concerns the origin of iron sources required for artemisinin activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both free ferrous iron9,10 and haem11 have been proposed to be the predominant iron sources for its activation, but the results of relevant research are controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second question concerns the exact targets of activated artemisinin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although several proteins have been reported to be the drug targets8,9,12, none of them could satisfactorily account for the quick and highly potent killing effect of artemisinin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that activated artemisinin might have many other direct targets due to the promiscuous nature of the radicals3,6,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address these questions, it is critical to develop an approach to directly study the artemisininprotein interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we have developed an unbiased chemical proteomics approach and systematically identified 124 artemisinin covalent binding targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the identified targets are involved in essential biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have validated several artemisininprotein interactions through in vitro binding assays and orthogonal confirmatory experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, targeted enzyme activity was impaired on artemisinin binding in the tested proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data support the hypothesis that activated artemisinin may kill the malaria parasite through a promiscuous targeting mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we use in vitro binding analyses to show that haem, rather than free ferrous iron, is predominantly responsible for artemisinin activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are also supported by an ex vivo cancer cell model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source of haem required for artemisinin is derived from the parasites haem biosynthesis pathway at the early ring stage and from haemoglobin digestion at latter stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the blood-eating nature of the parasite with the release of extremely high levels of haem confers the high efficacy of artemisinin against the parasites, with minimum side effects towards healthy red blood cells (RBCs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results support a unifying model to explain the action and specificity of artemisinin in parasite killing and could facilitate the development of better strategies to treat malaria in times of emerging artemisinin resistance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Synthesis of an artemisinin-based activity probe (AP1)', 'To profile and identify the targets of artemisinin, AP1, a chemically engineered artemisinin with a clickable alkyne tag attached13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22, was designed and synthesized (Fig 1a, probe synthesis scheme is shown in Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The alkyne tag can be further appended with a fluorescent dye or a biotin moiety through click chemistry, allowing the AP1 covalent binding targets to be visualized on SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) or affinity purified for mass spectrometric identification (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The chemical proteomics approach to study artemisinins mechanism of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Chemical structures of artemisinin (Art), artesunate (Arts) and the alkyne-tagged-clickable probe (AP1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) General workflow of the chemical proteomics approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence labelling was used to study the activation mechanism of artemisinin, while biotin pull-downs coupled with LCMS/MS were used to identify protein targets of artemisinin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The killing effect of AP1 is comparable to that of artemisinin and artesunate on P. falciparum 3D7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) In situ parasite labelling with AP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The labelling was dose dependent and specific to parasite proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Healthy RBC cytosolic proteins were not labelled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) The AP1 in situ parasite labelling was artemisinin specific as the excess Arts can largely compete with AP1-target labelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Free-radical scavenger (Tiron, 1 mM; Trolox, 400 M; TEMPO, 1 mM) co-treatment reduces the level of parasite protein alkylation by AP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluo, fluorescence scanning; Coo, Coomassie staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars represent s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in three independent replicates in c. Full-gel images for panels d and f are shown in Supplementary Fig 13.Full size image', 'Fluorescence labelling of artemisinin targets in parasites', 'First, we tested the anti-malarial activity of AP1 on two different parasite strains, the laboratory line P. falciparum 3D7 and the field isolate ARS270.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AP1 was as potent as the unmodified artemisinin, suggesting that the addition of the clickable alkyne tag does not interfere with drug activity (Fig 1c and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crude protein extracts were prepared from AP1-treated live parasites, clicked with a fluorescent dye and resolved by SDSPAGE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only AP1 covalent binding targets can be labelled and visualized with fluorescence scanning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many parasite proteins were fluorescently labelled in an AP1 dose-dependent manner, whereas AP1 failed to react with proteins from healthy RBCs under the same conditions (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that AP1 can only be activated inside the parasite but not in the uninfected RBC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further examined the AP1 labelling of the infected RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results showed that some of the host cell proteins were also labelled when the RBCs were infected with parasites, although the labelling level was low (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might have been due to the release of parasite-activated drug into the cytosol of infected RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this will not cause significant side effects, as the majority of the activated drug is confined within the infected RBCs, as evidenced by the observation that the drug failed to label the uninfected RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results ascertained that artemisinin has high specificity towards the malaria parasite and infected RBCs, with minimum side effects towards healthy RBCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, AP1 labelling was markedly decreased with preincubation of excess artesunate (a water-soluble artemisinin analogue) (Fig 1e), suggesting that AP1 binds to the same protein targets as artemisinin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, co-incubation with free-radical scavengers (Tiron, Trolox and TEMPO) also reduced the binding activity of AP1 (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results indicate that the engineered AP1 is pharmacologically similar to artemisinin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence intensity of AP1-labelled proteins on SDSPAGE serves as a convenient read-out for AP1 binding activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identification of artemisinin targets', 'Next, we went on to identify the covalent binding targets of AP1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do so, live parasites (unsynchronized) were incubated for 4 h with 500 nM AP1, a clinically achievable artemisinin dose2,23, and subjected to crude protein extract preparation, followed by biotin labelling of the alkyne tag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AP1 targets were affinity purified by streptavidin beads and identified with tandem mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 124 parasite proteins were identified as direct targets of artemisinin in three independent experiments and documented in Supplementary Table 1, while the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated control pull-down did not identify any parasite proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical analysis and detailed information on the targets are shown in Supplementary Fig 4 and Supplementary Data 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Information about the relative abundance of artemisinin targets is shown in Supplementary Fig 5 and Supplementary Data 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the proteins in our target list, 33 proteins have previously been developed or proposed as anti-malarial drug targets (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These include SERCA/PfATP6, a previously known artemisinin target9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We further used pull-downs followed by immunoblotting to validate several selected artemisinin targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results confirmed that AP1 could successfully pull-down plasmepsinl (PM I), plasmepsin II (PM II), merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) and actin (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the AP1 targets were involved in many essential biological processes of the parasite, including the carboxylic acid metabolic process, cellular biogenic amine metabolic process, nucleoside metabolic process and ribonucleoside biosynthetic process (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cellular localization analysis identified several enriched compartments, such as cytosol, vacuolar membrane and notably food vacuoles (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of interest, erythrocyte haemoglobin digestion occurs in the food vacuole24 and provides the source of amino acids required to maintain intracellular osmolarity during rapid parasite growth25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Artemisinin targets are involved in multiple biological processes essential for parasite survival.GO analysis conducted using Cytoscape with Cluego plugin revealed that the AP1 targets are involved in many essential biological processes of the parasite, including the metabolism of carboxylic acids, cellular biogenic amines and nucleosides, as well as ribonucleoside biosynthesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the multi-targeting ability of artemisinin, which exerts numerous effects on the physiological state of the malaria parasite.Full size image', 'Several enzymes involved in the key metabolic pathways of the parasite, as revealed in our GO analysis, including ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), pyruvate kinase (PyrK), L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), spermidine synthase (SpdSyn) and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (SAMS), were selected to validate their interaction with AP1 in vitro (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and incubated with AP1 in the absence or presence of haem (haemin reduced by L-ascorbic acid (Vc))26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct interactions between AP1 and these five enzymes were detected, which were completely thwarted in the presence of excessive amounts of artesunate (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With OAT as an example, we showed dose- and time-dependent AP1OAT binding (Fig 3b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The AP1 binding was also protein conformation dependent, as the heat-denatured OAT could not be labelled by AP1 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, OAT has been proposed to be a promising anti-malarial target whose inhibitor has a killing effect at the nano-molar range27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, PyrK and LDH are involved in the parasites glycolytic pathway and are responsible for ATP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional assays showed that artesunate inhibits their enzymatic activities in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP), a previously identified artemisinin target12, was not in our target list.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was likely because TCTP contains many lysine and arginine residues, which resulted in extensive trypsin digestion, making it difficult to identify from the artemisinin target mixture (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, the AP1TCTP interaction was also detected by our in vitro assay (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, artemisinin may bind to residues, such as cysteine and lysine, as pretreatment of TCTP with iodoacetamide (IAA) and N-ethylmaleimide reduced AP1 labelling (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Validated artemisinin targets and their functions.Full size table',

at the latter stages, both pathways co-existed, with haem derived from haemoglobin digestion playing the major role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  COPROGEN, coproporphyrinogen III; CRT, chloroquine resistance transporter;

however, the level of activation is rather low due to the low level of haem production by the parasite at this stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the latter stages, both of these two pathways may activate artemisinin, but haem released from the digested haemoglobin plays a major role in drug activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher drug activity corresponds to the extremely high haem level at the latter stages (Fig 5c), which makes artemisinin exceptionally potent against the parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unique mode of artemisinin activation also accounts for the selective toxicity of the drug towards the parasite, as the activated drug is largely confined within the parasites and infected RBCs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results on the mechanisms of artemisinin activation at different parasite stages and the drugs promiscuous targeting are consistent with recent reports of artemisinin resistance46,47 due to the PfKelch13 mutation, which results in a prolonged ring stage with an enhanced stress response23,48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The level of drug activation is low at the ring stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parasites with PfKelch13 mutations are able to overcome protein damage due to the drug modifications by activating the stress response; thus, they are selected as they have a higher capability to survive the drug treatment at the ring stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the much higher level of drug activation at the latter stages triggers extensive protein modifications that act like an exploding bomb, inhibiting multiple key biological processes and eventually resulting in parasite death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is less likely that the parasite develops resistance at the latter stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, artemisinin resistance due to the PfKelch13 mutation is different from typical drug resistance caused by mutations in drug targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multi-targeting nature of artemisinin makes it difficult for P. falciparum to acquire resistance due to the need for mutations of multiple targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is not surprising that previous studies could not find the association of PfATP6 and TCTP (known targets) mutations with the emerging drug resistance50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rather, PfKelch13 mutations enhance the parasites capability to cope with the stress induced by artemisinin multi-targeting at the ring stage, at which point drug activation and drug pressure are relatively low; thus, these mutations can be selected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To cope with artemisinin resistance due to a prolonged ring stage, we can either extend the length of drug treatment, as suggested by Tilley and co-workers51, or increase the drugs activation level at the ring stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we have shown, pretreatment with ALA enhances artemisinin activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALA has been widely used in photodynamic therapy, such as the treatment of skin cancer, for many years52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, co-treating patients with both ALA and artemisinin might improve the drugs efficacy towards ring-stage parasites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results indicate that the clickable artemisinin probe is useful for the identification of protein targets of the drug and the visualization of drug activation levels both in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our experimental conditions are not useful for identifying non-covalent targets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, a reversible artemisinin target, PfPI3K, was reported to be related to drug resistance in the ring stage53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of non-covalent artemisinin targets, possibly with many others yet to be identified, further supports the notion that artemisinin acts via a promiscuous targeting mechanism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will be interesting to develop new artemisinin probes that can be used to capture transient artemisininprotein interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It will also be interesting to determine the roles of each covalent and non-covalent binding target in artemisinin-mediated parasite killing in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have demonstrated here that artemisinin activation is mainly haem dependent, which we believe resolves previous arguments regarding the source of iron required for the drug activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Artemisinin activation at the early ring stage seems to rely on the parasites haem biosynthesis, whereas drug activation depends on haemoglobin digestion as the main haem source at the latter parasite stages, which determines the high specificity of the drug towards the parasite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of artemisinin, which may facilitate the development of better strategies to fight malaria and its emerging drug resistance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
