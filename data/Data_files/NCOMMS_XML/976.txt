Automated multiplex genome-scale engineering in yeast  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome-scale engineering is indispensable in understanding and engineering microorganisms, but the current tools are mainly limited to bacterial systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report an automated platform for multiplex genome-scale engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an important eukaryotic model and widely used microbial cell factory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Standardized genetic parts encoding overexpression and knockdown mutations of 90% yeast genes are created in a single step from a full-length cDNA library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the aid of CRISPR-Cas, these genetic parts are iteratively integrated into the repetitive genomic sequences in a modular manner using robotic automation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system allows functional mapping and multiplex optimization on a genome scale for diverse phenotypes including cellulase expression, isobutanol production, glycerol utilization and acetic acid tolerance, and may greatly accelerate future genome-scale engineering endeavours in yeast.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Microbial genome-scale engineering creates strain libraries for large-scale genotypephenotype mapping1, enabling important applications in fundamental biology2, human diseases3 and industrial biotechnology4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given our limited understanding of complex cellular networks, it often requires both identification of genetic determinants and optimization of their expression in a concerted manner to improve target traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most existing genome engineering methods perform these two tasks separately, by either modifying individual genes on a genome scale2,4,5, or creating combinatorial diversity among pre-defined targets6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main technical hurdle is the lack of a modular and expandable scheme to introduce genome-wide mutations in multiplex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, multiplex genome-scale modifications will result in enormous diversity, which requires robotic automation to facilitate creation and screening of genomic libraries, but very few examples have been reported to automate such efforts6, and there is a general lack of standardized procedures of microbial genome-scale engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To address these limitations, we sought to devise an automated system to integrate genome-wide screening and multiplex optimization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first applied this system to S. cerevisiae, a well-established eukaryotic model with wide uses in fundamental research and industrial applications7,8, as the current ability to reprogram the yeast genome is far behind bacterial hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In bacteria, efficient allelic replacement can be achieved using single-stranded DNAs with the help of bacteriophage proteins9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The so-called recombineering (recombination-based genetic engineering) technology enables genome-wide identification of genetic determinants using trackable multiplex recombineering (TRMR)4 or combinatorial optimization using multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE)6 for a certain trait in Escherichia coli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recombineering only achieves an editing efficiency of 1% in S. cerevisiae10 (compared with 30% in E. coli6), which is not sufficient to achieve genome-wide coverage or multiplex modifications when creating yeast libraries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, only short DNA oligonucleotides (90 nt) can be used in recombineering to introduce mutations efficiently without antibiotic selection6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When longer DNA cassettes were used, antibiotic selection became necessary4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This limitation on the editing scale is problematic in yeast in two ways: (1) genetic regulation is more complicated in eukaryotes, and small-nucleotide changes may be inefficient to modulate gene expression in yeast11; (2) for modifications on a larger scale, the use of antibiotic selection renders multiplex modifications difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, new methods other than recombineering must be developed for multiplex genome-scale engineering in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our system integrated three major designs for automated yeast engineering: (1) To achieve genome-wide coverage, a normalized full-length-enriched complementary DNA (cDNA) library was used to construct genetic modulation parts encoding both overexpression and knockdown mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (2) Genetic modulation parts were constructed as donors for  integration, an established method for multiplex integration into repetitive retrotransposon sequences in yeast12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (3) Integration efficiency was substantially improved via introduction of double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in the  sequences, increasing the percentile of modified cells without the need for selection markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these designs, multiplex genome-wide mutations can be accumulated in a scalable manner using a standardized workflow, enabling automated genome-scale engineering in S. cerevisiae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this system, we not only performed genotypephenotype mapping of both gain- and reduction-of-function mutations for 92% yeast genes but also successfully created multiplex diversity on a genome scale in a fully automated manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A variety of industrially relevant traits were successfully improved in S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cerevisiae.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome-wide overexpression and knockdown modulation parts', 'We first sought to construct a collection of genetic modulation parts as a standardized method to create genome-scale mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broadly, there are two main strategies to enable genome-wide perturbation, by directly editing the genome or introducing trans-acting regulatory elements15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we chose the latter for better scalability, as the same strategy (Fig 1a) can be used to deliver a genome-scale library of regulatory elements to a cell population, and to deliver multiple regulatory elements targeting different genes in a single cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, based on the SMART (Switching Mechanism At 5-end of RNA Template) mechanism16, we constructed a full-length-enriched cDNA library, which was further normalized via selective degradation of abundant cDNAs17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two adaptor sequences were attached to the cDNA ends, facilitating directional insertion after a strong constitutive promoter PTEF1 (Fig 1b) on an episomal plasmid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas genetic overexpression is achieved when full-length cDNA molecules are transcribed in the sense direction, genetic silencing is enabled via transcription of full-length anti-sense RNAs in a yeast strain integrated with a heterologous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway (the CAD strain)5 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis indicated that 92.3% of all endogenous yeast genes were included in the library (Supplementary Data 1), and 19 out of 20 randomly picked plasmids contained full-length open reading frames for either overexpression or knockdown configurations (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Scheme of automated genome-scale engineering in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Design of a general method to create multiplex genomic mutations in yeast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene modulation parts encoding various genetic modifications were flanked by homologous  sequences for iterative and multiplex integration into repetitive genomic sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enable CRISPR-Cas for efficient and selection-free  integration, a PADH2-Cas9 expression cassette was integrated into the CAD strain (a S. cerevisiae strain with a constitutive RNAi pathway5) to create the CAD-Cas9 strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Construction of a genome-wide modulation part library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Full-length-enriched cDNA library was directionally cloned after a constitutive promoter PTEF1, and resulted in genetic overexpression or knockdown for sense and anti-sense configurations, respectively, when transformed into the CAD strain.Full size image', 'Genome-wide screening and functional profiling', 'We applied this collection for genome-wide screening to engineer a range of industrially relevant phenotypes, including protein secretion, chemical tolerance/production and substrate utilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure adequate coverage, 106 independent clones were obtained for each strain library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Retransformation into a fresh strain background was performed for isolated genetic parts to confirm their impact on a target trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first tried to improve cell surface display of a cellulase (Fig 2a), a highly desirable trait for lignocellulosic biofuel production18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A His-tag was attached to the N-terminus of the cellulase to allow display-level quantification using immunostaining20 (Fig 2a), and both up- and downregulation mutations were identified to enhance cellulase-displaying levels (Fig 2b) and hydrolysis rates of a cellulose substrate (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we screened for improved production of isobutanol as a second-generation biofuel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhanced resistance to norvaline, a toxic analogue of valine as a precursor for isobutanol, has been linked to isobutanol overproduction21 (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following serial transfer in norvaline-containing media (Supplementary Table 2), a knockdown mutation conferring improved isobutanol titres was identified (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

promising renewable feedstock for microbial fermentation22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plasmid DNA was isolated from yeast libraries before and after serial transfer in glycerol media (Supplementary Table 2), and NGS analysis was used to track frequency changes of individual genetic part (Fig 2e; Supplementary Data 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous findings23, functional clustering of genes targeted by enriched parts indicated the important roles of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathway and electron transport in aerobic respiration to glycerol utilization (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two knockdown parts with substantially elevated frequencies (fitness) were also isolated by streaking individual clones from the enriched library (Fig 2e), and improved cell growth on glycerol was confirmed after retransformation (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For all three phenotypes, gene silencing of the isolated knockdown mutations was confirmed using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR; Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For identified genetic mutations, it is possible to speculate the mechanisms underlying the improved phenotypes from known gene functions (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the SED1 gene (Fig 2b) encodes a stress-induced structural cell wall protein Sed1p with high display levels24, and has been isolated previously from genome-wide screening to increase cell surface display of heterologous proteins in S. cerevisiae25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that suppressed expression of Sed1p can help to accommodate heterologous proteins that compete for display capacity of the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, increased isobutanol titres have been observed with reduced expression of the general amino-acid permease Gap1p (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26), whose intracellular trafficking is regulated by Bul1p (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the knockdown cassette of CIT1 (Fig 2f) targets citrate synthase as a rate-limiting enzyme of the TCA cycle, and reduced TCA activity has been observed in fast glycerol-metabolizing E. coli28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While identification of known genetic targets for relevant phenotypes suggests that the part collection is effective for genome-wide profiling, further research is needed for functional elucidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Highly efficient multiplex integration enabled by CRISPR', 'Next, we tried to establish a standard workflow to incorporate genetic modulation parts in the yeast genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We sought to improve  integration efficiency by creating DSBs in the genomic  sequences using the CRISPR-Cas system29 (Figs 1a and 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modified from our previous design30,31, CRISPR-component configuration (Fig 3b) and process parameters (Fig 3a) were optimized to increase the percentile of integrated cells in a single round of transformation (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the type II Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 gene was integrated into the yeast genome (the CAD-Cas9 strain), and a glucose-repressed promoter PADH2 was used to drive inducible expression of Cas9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To improve recombination rates, the integration cassette flanked by homologous  sequences was cloned in a high-copy donor plasmid, which also contained the targeting CRISPR RNA and trans-activating CRISPR RNA cassettes to direct Cas9 to the  sites (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integration workflow included three steps: transformation of the yeast cells with the donor library, induction of Cas9 expression to stimulate integration and plasmid curation by counter-selection (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After plasmid curation, cells were ready for screening or the next round of integration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following the optimized workflow (Fig 3a), when a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression cassette was used as the integration donor, 70 and 90% of the cell population exhibited GFP fluorescence after the first and second rounds of integration (Fig 3c; Supplementary Fig 3h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only 0.1% GFP-positive cells observed following the same workflow without Cas9 (Fig 3c; Supplementary Fig 3j), indicating the necessity for DSB generation for stimulating integration and effective curation of donor plasmids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the first round of integration, 13 out of 20 (65%) randomly isolated individual clones showed GFP fluorescence (Supplementary Fig 4a), consistent with the percentile (70%) of GFP-positive cells observed on the population level (Supplementary Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the top three brightest clones isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), the 23 clones exhibited a 20-fold variation of mean GFP fluorescence intensities (Supplementary Fig 4ac), and the phenotypic diversity may be resulted from differences in copy numbers (Supplementary Fig 4a) and genomic loci of integration among engineered strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, as 30% of the cells remained unmodified after one round of integration, these cells can serve as built-in controls for the wild-type parent and spontaneous adaptive mutants during screening.

manually tested the feasibility of multiplex genome-scale engineering scheme (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using genome-wide modulation collection as integration donors, genetic parts targeting 5,051 yeast genes were incorporated in the genomes of a strain library after one round of integration (80.6% genomic coverage, Supplementary Data 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We randomly isolated five yeast colonies streaked from the integration library, and observed that 310 different integrated parts were recovered from each genome (Supplementary Data 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that our method is effective in both creating genome-wide mutations in a cell population and introducing multiplex modifications in a single cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then performed three iterative rounds of integration (Fig 3a), and spread the resultant cell culture on agar plates containing glycerol as the sole carbon source.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two mutants (G1* and G6) were isolated with improved cell growth on glycerol (Supplementary Fig 5), and genomic sequencing results indicated there were 44 and 19 different modulation parts integrated in the G1* and G6 mutants, respectively (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result indicates our genome-scale engineering workflow is able to create phenotypic diversities via multiplex integration of genetic modulation parts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

Bioengineering (iBioFAB, Fig 4a), which is an integrated platform for automated biomanufacturing consisting of component instruments, a central robotic platform and a modular computational

included in the integration workflow (Fig 4c), where the strain library after each round of integration was selected in synthetic media with a gradient of HAc stresses ranging from 0.8 to 1.1% (v/v; Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first round (R1), we observed substantial improvement in HAc tolerance of the strain library relative to a wild-type control strain harbouring an empty donor plasmid lacking CRISPR RNAs (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first, second and third rounds (R1, R2 and R3), cells were selected from 0.9, 1.0 and 1.1% HAc media, respectively (Supplementary Fig 6a) for further rounds of engineering, and a general trend of R3R2R1C was observed for biomass accumulation under different HAc concentrations (Supplementary Fig 6bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the parent strain (CAD-Cas9), on the contrary, we observed no substantial biomass accumulation in 1.0 and 1.1% HAc media during three rounds of serial transfer under the same selective pressures, although cell growth was improved in the presence of 0.8 and 0.9% HAc (Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that the occurrence of HAc resistance is greatly accelerated using our workflow relative to traditional evolutionary engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NGS analysis of integrated parts in the genomes of selected populations indicated dynamic inclusion and elimination of the modulation parts (Supplementary Fig 6e; Supplementary Data 3a), which may be resulted from genomic introduction of part donors in the integration step and counter-selection of less resistant cells with increasing HAc stresses, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the integrated parts, targeted genes were enriched in functional classes that are known to be related to HAc resistance (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, 86 targeted genes were previously identified as genetic determinants of HAc tolerance (Supplementary Data 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: Screening of

isolated five individual clones (H1H5) from the selected population after streaking on agar plates, and compared their HAc resistance with the parent strain (CAD-Cas) before and after traditional adaptive evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of biomass accumulation, HAc resistance levels were in the order of engineered mutantsadaptive populationparent in 0.9% HAc media (Supplementary Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of 1.1% HAc, a condition that completely inhibited cell growth for the parent strain and adaptive population, four engineered mutants acquired the capability to grow

strains showed no substantial differences in biomass accumulation in 0.9 and 1.1% HAc media (Supplementary Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, H3 lost the capability to grow in 1.1% HAc media after long-term cultivation (Supplementary Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with previous reports on the general stability and possibility of genetic instability of -integration strains13,35, and the instability may be resulted from homologous recombination among the same promoter and terminator sequences in multiple integrated cassettes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we performed flask fermentation using the H5 mutant, which showed the highest HAc resistance among isolated strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While H5 converted 20 g l1 glucose into 5.9 g l1 ethanol in 4 days in the presence of 1.1% HAc, the parent strain exhibited no glucose consumption or ethanol production (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, such HAc resistance is the highest level reported in the literature (Supplementary Data 3c), which was achieved within 1 month (Fig 3a) instead of much longer time periods for adaptive evolution or rational engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This achievement indicates our method greatly accelerates the emergence of desirable phenotypes, via more effective creation and screening of the genomic diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genome sequencing revealed that at least 26 different modulation parts were integrated in the H5 genome (Supplementary Table 4), suggesting that this strategy is effective in creating multiplex diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of the resistance phenotype.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we developed a framework for modular introduction of multiplex genome-wide modifications in yeast, which presents three major advances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, simply cloning from cDNA libraries, both overexpression and knockdown mutations can be created on a genome scale, which is proved effective in studying various traits including protein and chemical production, substrate utilization and inhibitor tolerance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with existing yeast genome-scale tools that only permit a single modulation mode (upregulation36, downregulation5,37 or knockout2), the current method creates a more comprehensive diversity space by allowing genetic overexpression and silencing in a single library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, as gene deletion30 and large pathway integration31 can also be generated using episomal vectors harbouring CRISPR components and homologous recombination donors, it is potentially possible to include these mutation types in the current system as well by modifying the donor plasmid configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In E. coli, recombineering enables insertion of synthetic DNA cassettes upstream of 95% genes to achieve both up- and downregulation (the TRMR method4) with antibiotic selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strategy4, however, cannot be readily used in S. cerevisiae, mainly due to the low efficiency of recombineering (1% recombination efficiency in yeast using YOGE10, compared with 30% in E. coli using MAGE6, and 70% using our method).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, genetic regulation in eukaryotes is more complicated than that in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, to create a variant library with 8120% transcription activities compared to the wild-type yeast PTEF1 promoter, introduction of 471 mutations randomly distributed in the 401 bp of promoter sequence was needed11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is difficult to generate well-defined overexpression or knockdown mutations by inserting short DNA sequences in the yeast promoter regions as achieved in bacteria using TRMR4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, TRMR requires a sophisticated protocol to generate the barcoded pools of synthetic cassettes from microarray oligonucleotides4, while our method uses routine DNA cloning techniques to prepare the library, and gene targets can be readily identified from part sequences using NGS analysis without barcodes (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, although our library covers 92% yeast genes, cDNA-derived libraries may suffer from poor representativeness, due to no or low expression of certain genes under a given condition, as well as incomplete cDNA sequences (critical for genetic overexpression).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is essential to obtain high-quality cDNA library (full-length enriched, normalized and combined from different culture conditions and so on).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, gene expression modulation is achieved without modifying target genomic sequences, so that diverse mutations can be introduced in a modular and scalable manner as standardized integration donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In E. coli, recombineering enables combinatorial optimization of 24 pre-defined gene targets using the MAGE method6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When creating a genome-scale library using recombineering, however, it still requires antibiotic selection to enrich modified cells (TRMR4), which renders creation of multiplex mutations difficult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve multiplex genome-scale engineering in E. coli, a two-step strategy has been developed, whereby a pool of genetic determinants of a target trait was first identified from genome-wide screening using TRMR, and then combinatorial optimization within this gene pool is performed using MAGE38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, individual beneficial mutations are not necessarily addictive for a given trait5,38, and genome-wide search may be essential to identify genetic interactions for synergistic beneficial mutations5,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we argue that it is necessary to integrate the genome-wide screening and multiplex optimization in a single method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, TRMR4 and MAGE6 apply different strategies to modulate gene expressionTRMR inserts synthetic modulation cassettes in the promoter regions, while MAGE introduces nucleotide-level mutations in the RBSs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, these two methods cannot be seamlessly integrated38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, using trans-acting modulation cassettes and modular  integration, our system allows continuous introduction of diverse genetic mutations in multiplex following the same procedure, which is critical to achieve automated yeast engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Broadly, genome editing2,4,6,10,30,40 and trans-acting regulatory elements5,41 are two very important strategies for genome-scale engineering and combinatorial optimization in microorganisms15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that few genome-editing tools have demonstrated the capacity for combinatorial genome-scale engineering in yeast, here we chose to use trans-acting genetic modulation parts, as it is highly efficient to deliver a large number of parts for genomic coverage, and to introduce many parts in a single cell for multiplex mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the future, CRISPR may have the potential considering the high editing efficiency, the use for multiplex editing30 and diverse modulation modes42 in yeast, and the application in genome-wide screening in human cells43,44, but further development is still needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Third, a defined process was designed for iterative execution by automated robotic systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Automation is essential as combinatorial genome-scale engineering often generates huge diversities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretically, multiplex (N) integration of genome-wide modulation parts (104 modifications covering overexpression and knockdown of 6,000 yeast genes) can potentially create a gigantic number of mutants (104N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this diversity far exceeds the actual sizes of cell populations at any given time and therefore cannot be comprehensively screened, it can be collectively created through successive mutagenesis cycles, as demonstrated in this study and elsewhere previously6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, even such enormous diversity represents only a subset of all possible genomic variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, automation is critical to accelerate and scale up creation and screening of strain libraries6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work also demonstrates the importance of synthetic biology principles in achieving automation, including standardization and modularization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the other hand, further improvement is possible to address certain limitations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is inherently challenging to speculate the mechanisms conferring improved phenotypes with multiple mutations in a single cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While many approaches are developed to study mutants with many modifications (for example, mutants isolated from adaptive evolution experiments45), here we propose three solutions based on our design: (1) integrated genetic parts can be recovered using PCR and sub-cloned into a plasmid, and the impact of individual mutations on a target trait can be examined; (2) the recovered parts from an isolated mutant can be used as integration donors to a fresh cell population, so that combinations of the recovered parts can be generated to differentiate beneficial mutations from neutral or deleterious hitchhikers, and to identify synergistic mutations; (3) here we purposely maximized integration efficiency to explore the potential of creating combinatorial diversity, but it is possible to reduce integration copies by targeting less abundant repetitive genomic elements, or fine-tuning expression of CRISPR components (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third practice may also help to address some potential complications, including chromosomal rearrangement due to massive cleavage at the repetitive genomic sequences (Supplementary Fig 10), as well as saturation of the RNAi machinery in the presence of many knockdown parts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, although mutant strains with improved traits can be quickly isolated, they are not considered ideal for industrial applications due to deleterious hitchhiker mutations, a limited modulation range on gene expression (with no gene deletion) and possible genetic instability as observed for H3 (Supplementary Fig 7d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we consider our method primarily as a genome-scale discovery tool to search and understand genetic basis, especially multiplex mutations, for obtaining desirable phenotypes.

genotypephenotype mapping, it is desirable to incorporate both types of genetic modifications simultaneously to accelerate the screen process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inspired by our previous observation that full-length anti-sense RNAs can efficiently knockdown a target gene through RNAi in yeast5, we devised a method for one-step construction of a comprehensive genome-wide library through directional cloning of full-length cDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a full-length cDNA molecule is inserted in the sense direction under the control of a constitutive promoter, the resultant construct will lead to gene overexpression of the contained open reading frame (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When inserted in the reversed direction, on the other hand, the resultant construct will transcribe an anti-sense RNA of the target gene, and elicit gene silencing in the presence of RNAi machinery5 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Directional cloning can be achieved by adding two different adaptor sequences to the ends of a cDNA molecule, and thus insertion directions can be controlled by arranging the homologous adaptor sequences in a desired order in an expression cassette (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first synthesized a normalized full-length cDNA library, whereby two 15 bp adaptor sequences, 5-AAGCAGTGGTATCAA-3 and 5-CGGGGTACGATGAGA-3, were incorporated at the 5 and 3 ends of the cDNA molecules,

using trimmomatic (version 0.32) program51 in single-end mode to trim adaptor sequences and low-quality bases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the trimming of reads FastQC (version 0.11.2)52 was run to check quality scores, and all the trimmed reads contained only bases with quality scores 30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Trimmed reads were aligned against the reference genome of CEN.PK113-7D (Saccharomyces Genome

genome (Saccharomyces Genome Database, http://downloads.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/genome_releases/S288C_reference_genome_R64-2-1_20150113.tgz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The S288C genome contains 16 complete chromosomal contigs, whereas CEN.PK113-7D genome contains 389 contigs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is more convenient to note large-scale variations of coverage using the S288C reference when visualized in Integrative Genomics Viewer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing read coverage of mutant and wild-type strains, it was found that there are three large-scale genomic rearrangements in chromosome VI, VII and X of the H5 strain (Supplementary Fig 10), while no large-scale rearrangements were observed with the G1* and G6 strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To examine which modulation parts were contained in a DNA sample, we PCR-amplified the modulation parts and performed NGS analysis of the resultant PCR products.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two key features are required to identify a specific modulation part: the modulation mode (overexpression or knockdown) and the target gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The modulation mode can be determined via the presence of one of the four combinations of the promoter or terminator sequence and a 15 bp handle sequence (Supplementary Table 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The target gene can be deduced from a cDNA fragment that is long enough for unambiguous alignment to the yeast genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, instead of a complete modulation part, junction fragments containing promoter15 bp handlecDNA head or cDNA tail15 bp handleterminator were sequenced as they can provide enough information to identify a modulation part.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To enrich those junction fragments, we used the TruSeq workflow with the following modifications: (1) during PCR amplification of modulation parts, a custom sequence (M13F, 5-CCAGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3, indigo in Supplementary Fig 9) was incorporated to one end of the PCR products, and a 12 bp barcode was included in this step to allow sample pooling in NGS (Supplementary Table 5); (2) the PCR primers annealed to immediate upstream sequences of the junctions (primer-binding site in Supplementary Table 5); (3) after sonication and adaptor ligation using a TruSeq kit, PCR Primer 1.0 custom1 was used instead of the original PCR Primer 1.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas the original PCR Primer 1.0 primer would amplify all DNA fragments by annealing to the universal adaptor sequence (brown in Supplementary Table 5), PCR Primer 1.0 custom1 would only amplify junction fragments by annealing to the custom M13F sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCR Primer 1.0 custom1 also contained other necessary sequences to be compatible with the TruSeq protocols (to bind flow cells, to anneal to the sequencing primer and so on).

aligned to the reference genome to determine the target genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Modulation modes (overexpression or knockdown) were judged by the type of combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At least two alignments to the same gene were required for a gene to be considered a real target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A false positive list was generated using the genome sequencing results of the wild-type strain following the above analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes in the false positive list were removed from the results of the G1*, G6 and H5 strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Computational analysis of nearly 20 million PCR reads can be described as a de-multiplexing operation followed by read counts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Raw reads were first processed in a quality control step to remove reads with poor base quality or adaptor artifacts using Trimmomatic/0.32 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51) and Cutadapt/1.8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pooled PCR reads were first demultiplexed into different collections based on 12 bp barcodes (Supplementary Table 5) using Flexbar/2.5-beta59, and then further demultiplexed according to four different combinations of promoter/terminator sequences and 15 bp handles (Supplementary Table 5) using Flexbar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All the sequences used in de-multiplexing were removed from reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining sequences were aligned against the reference genome of CEN.PK113-7D using Bwa mem (version 0.7.12)53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aligned reads were counted depending on their location relative to gene annotations of the reference genome using the closetBed bedtools/2.24.0 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  56), and divided into five different categories: downstream of a gene, upstream of a gene, start (when read and start codon intersect), middle (when read does not intersect with either codons) and end (when read and stop codon intersect).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These categories are helpful to determine whether cDNA insets in the modulation parts are in full lengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine coverage of the plasmid library and integrated library, a gene was considered present if at least one read was aligned.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate integrated modulation parts in selected cell populations from different rounds of HAc tolerance engineering, at least five reads must be found for a gene to be considered covered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In
