Plastic roles of pericytes in the bloodretinal barrier  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The bloodretinal barrier (BRB) consists of tightly interconnected capillary endothelial cells covered with pericytes and glia, but the role of the pericytes in BRB regulation is not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B/PDGF receptor beta (PDGFR) signalling is critical in formation and maturation of BRB through active recruitment of pericytes onto growing retinal vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impaired pericyte recruitment to the vessels shows multiple vascular hallmarks of diabetic retinopathy (DR) due to BRB disruption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PDGF-B/PDGFR signalling is expendable for maintaining BRB integrity in adult mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although selective pericyte loss in stable adult retinal vessels surprisingly does not cause BRB disintegration, it sensitizes retinal vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to VEGF-A, leading to upregulation of angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) in ECs through FOXO1 activation and triggering a positive feedback that resembles the pathogenesis of DR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, either blocking Ang2 or activating Tie2 greatly attenuates BRB breakdown, suggesting potential therapeutic approaches to reduce retinal damages upon DR progression.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The bloodretinal barrier (BRB) is divided into inner and outer parts1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inner part consists of tightly connected capillary endothelial cells (ECs) covered with pericytes and Müller glial cells, whose function is to nourish the inner two thirds of the retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outer part of the BRB consists of tightly connected pigment epithelial cells that maintain the integrity of the outer third of the retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pericytes differ in origin, morphology, and function depending on different organs vascular beds and are located between ECs and surrounding parenchymal cells, sharing a basement membrane with the endothelium3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They play important roles in a range of functions, including angiogenesis, vascular remodelling, regression and stabilization, and generation and maintenance of the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) and BRB5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies8,9,10,11,12,13,14 revealed that proper pericyte recruitment to growing retinal and brain vessels through controlled platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B/PDGF receptor beta (PDGFR) signalling is critical for adequate formation of the BRB and BBB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic deletion of PDGF-B in ECs or its retention motif that is responsible for the retention of PDGF-B within the pericellular space in the growing retinal vessels exhibited severe vascular impairments including vascular engorgement and leakage together with improper pericyte recruitment and organization during the retinal vascular development9,12, which are similar to the events induced by a PDGFR blocking antibody11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies indicated that PDGF-B secreted from and properly retained in retinal vascular ECs recruits PDGFR+ pericytes to facilitate vascular growth and stabilization during vascular development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether PDGF-B/PDGFR signalling is continuously required for adequate pericyte attachment to stable adult retinal vessels remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, why adequate pericyte attachment is critical for maintenance of BRB integrity in adult retinal vessels is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pericyte dropout or loss is one of the hallmarks of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and it has been postulated to initiate or trigger several pathologic features including microaneurysm formation, abnormal leakage, edema and ischemia, provoking proliferative neovascularization in the retina15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disturbance of the angiopoietinTie2 system is closely linked with DR pathogenesis18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pericyte-derived angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) is known to stimulate Tie2 signalling in ECs, which may be substantial contributing factor for a stable interaction between ECs and pericytes in adult19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a concreate evidence to support this concept is not yet available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Ang2 secreted from activated or inflamed ECs destabilizes ECpericyte interaction by inhibiting Ang1Tie2 signalling as a partial antagonist19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, increased Ang2 in pathologic conditions, including DR, is thought to be one of the major factors causing pericyte dropout, and antagonizing Ang1Tie2 signalling23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, endogenous resources and the exact roles of Ang1, Ang2 and Tie2 in building up BRB during development and in the disintegrating BRB during pathologic conditions need to be better defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we show that PDGF-B/PDGFR signalling, which is critical for BRB buildup in growing retinal vessels, is dispensable for BRB integrity maintenance in adult mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective pericyte loss in adult stable retinal vessels surprisingly did not result in phenotypes of BRB disintegration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vessels did, however, show susceptibility to leakage upon external VEGF-A stimulus, which could be mediated by the elevated vascular destabilizing factors including Ang2 and VEGFR2 through transcriptional activation of FOXO1 in unstable endothelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process was inhibited by Ang2 blockade or Tie2 activation, reducing retinal damages during DR progression by inhibiting BRB disintegration.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Pericyte coverage is critical for BRB maturation', 'To gain an insight into the role of PDGF-B/PDGFR signalling in BRB formation, we first examined their expression in growing retinal vessels at postnatal day 5 (P5) in the normal C57BL/J mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PDGF-B was abundantly and selectively expressed in ECs with the highest expression in the vascular front region, while PDGFR was selectively expressed in pericytes that covered most ECs except the tip ECs (Fig 1a,b), consistent with previous findings12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, to deplete PDGF-B in retinal vessels in tamoxifen-inducible manner, we crossed the Pdgfbflox/flox mouse9 with the VE-cadherin-Cre-ERT2 mouse24 and produced a PdgfbiEC mouse (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cre-ERT2 positive but flox/flox negative littermates were defined as wild-type (WT) mice in each experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When PDGF-B was specifically depleted in ECs of PdgfbiEC mice from P5, at P12 the mice had severe hemorrhage at both the inner and outer surfaces of the retinal cup, profound accumulation of whitish inflammatory cells, retinal detachment (50%), enlarged but well-perfused vessels, severely impaired pericyte coverage of the vessels, microaneurysm formation, reduced ZO-1 and disarranged VE-cadherin, red blood cell (RBC) leakage, profound macrophage infiltration, little or no deep vascular plexus formation, extreme hypoxia with increased VEGF-A, and upregulation of the genes (CCL-2, CCL-3, TNF- and VEGF-A) involved in inflammation and hypoxia in retinas compared with those of WT mice (Fig 1ch; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that EC-derived PDGF-B plays indispensable roles in vascular remodelling and BRB maturation through active recruitment of pericytes onto growing retinal vessels, and that impairment of PDGF-B/PDGFR signalling during this period exhibits multiple hallmarks of DR.', 'Figure 1: Pericyte coverage is critical for formation and maturation of BRB.

features can be normalized or sustained as the mice mature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To answer this question, PDGF-B was depleted from P5 in the PdgfbiEC mice, and the retinas were examined at P30 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Severe hemorrhage and RBC leakage, disrupted vascular plexus formations in all three layers with poor pericyte coverage, profound macrophage infiltration, detachment of smooth muscle actin+ (SMA+) cells from retinal artery, highly increased EC apoptosis, and extreme hypoxia were still detected in the retina together with impaired vision in the PdgfbiEC mice (Fig 2bh).

the impaired vascular features might be a major driving factor in this irreversible change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this hypothesis, we generated an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model in the PdgfbiEC mice (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OIR caused more severe hemorrhage, RBC leakage, hypoxia and macrophage infiltration together with a larger avascular area but smaller neovascular tuft area in PdgfbiEC mice compared with WT mice (Supplementary Fig 2bf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, adequate pericyte coverage is required to prevent BRB impairment against further vascular impairments, including severe ischemia, inflammation and oxidative stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Inadequate pericyte upregulates FOXO1 and Ang2 in ECs', 'We then asked how inadequate pericyte coverage affects the impairments of retinal vessels and BRB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We focused on analysing the expression and roles of Ang2 and Tie2, given that these are critical factors regulating vascular stabilization and integrity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous reports25,26,27, Ang2 was high in the pericyte-free tip ECs but low in ECs of the phalanx and plexus, while Tie2 expression showed the opposite pattern in the normally growing retinal vessels (Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding led us to hypothesize that pericyte coverage per se might regulate the expression of Ang2 or Tie2 in the adjacent ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the inadequate pericyte attachment markedly increased Ang2 but reduced Tie2 in the ECs of retinal vessels (Fig 3ce; Supplementary Fig 3a,b), which is similar to the findings in advanced cancers28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the ECs of micro-aneurysms in the pericyte-detached vessels of PdgfbiEC mice or those of OIR mice had relatively higher Ang2

in vivo and in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar upregulation in the expressions of ESM1 and VEGFR2, which are highly enriched in the pericyte-uncovered tip ECs25,32, and distinct nuclear localization of FOXO1 were found in the ECs of pericyte-uncovered retinal vessels (Fig 3fi; Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, mRNA levels of Ang2 and ESM1 were increased upon Tie2 silencing in primary cultured HUVECs, and these changes were FOXO1 dependent (Supplementary Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Tie1 was reduced in the ECs of pericyte-detached retinal vessels, while soluble Tie1 (cleaved ecto-domain) was increased in the vitreous fluid of PdgfbiEC mice (Fig 3h,i); these are similar to those which occur to ECs upon acute inflammation33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggested that the ECs became unstable due to inadequate pericyte coverage, and that cleavage of Tie1 led to the suppression of Tie2 availability, which is required to inhibit Ang2 transcription by FOXO1 (refs 33, 34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, to reveal whether and how pericyte coverage regulates FOXO1 and Ang2, we employed an ex vivo aortic ring assay35 using the aortas of WT and PdgfbiEC mice, where the mice were pre-administrated with tamoxifen before aorta harvest (Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During ex vivo culture, the PDGFR+ pericytes were detached from the sprouts, which were reduced in number and length themselves, of the aorta of PdgfbiEC mice, and the pericyte-detached ECs had higher levels of Ang2 and FOXO1 as well as nuclear localization of FOXO1 (Supplementary Fig 5be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, no major changes in FOXO1 or Ang2 were detected in the ECs of sprouts with intact pericytes in the aorta of WT mice (Supplementary Fig 5d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, pericyte detachment appears to directly upregulate and activate FOXO1 in ECs, which leads to stimulation of Ang2 expression in ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, Chip-PCR sequencing analysis revealed that FOXO1 binding was enriched in the promoter and enhancer regions of Ang2 (Supplementary Fig 6), indicating that FOXO1 directly regulates Ang2 expression in the destabilized ECs caused by inadequate pericyte coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pericytes of retinal vessels are not the main source of Ang1', 'Because pericyte-derived Ang1 contributes to vascular stabilization19,20,21,22, we investigated the expression and role of Ang1 using Ang1-GFP knock-in36 and Ang1flox/flox (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37) mice in the growing retinal vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unexpectedly, however, pericytes covering retinal vessels did not express Ang1, but those along choroidal vessels and neuronal cells in the ganglion cell and inner nuclear layers of the retina did (Fig 4ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm this unexpected finding, we generated Ang1iPC mice by crossing Ang1flox/flox mice37 with PDGFR-Cre-ERT2 mice38 (Supplementary Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High efficiency was shown for targeting PDGFR+ pericytes in retinal vessels by tamoxifen-induced Cre-mediated recombination using the PDGFR-Cre-ERT2 mice (Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selective depletion of Ang1 in PDGFR+ pericytes from birth did not yield any apparent differences in gross features, growth, network, EC proliferation, RBC localization, pericyte coverage, or expression of Tie2 and Ang2 in the retinal vessels at P5 compared with those of WT mice (Supplementary Fig 7bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly indicate that retinal pericytes do not produce Ang1 to regulate vascular growth and BRB maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Pericyte is not a source of Ang1 in the retinal vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Cross-sectional images of retina of Ang1-GFP knock-in

ECs by crossing Tie2flox/flox mice27 with VE-Cadherin-Cre-ERT2 mice (Tie2iEC mice) (Fig 5a), the retinal vessels showed moderate hemorrhage in the inner surface of the retinal cup, severely disrupted vascular network formation, enlarged diameter but short radial length, less density and branching, lack of deep vascular plexus, and profound RBC leakage and macrophage infiltration without a significant difference in pericyte coverage at P15 compared with those of WT mice (Fig 5bg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No normalization was observed until P30 in the retinas of Tie2iEC mice, which showed

retinal vessels (Fig 5f,g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when Tie2 was specifically depleted in the ECs at adulthood, no noticeable changes including vascular leakage were detected in the retinal vessels

dispensable for the maintenance of BRB integrity during adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, lung vessels continue to require Tie2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39), while the retinal vessels no longer require

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we demonstrate that the PDGF-B/PDGFR signalling is not required to maintain ECpericyte interaction for BRB integrity during adulthood, although it is indispensable in formation and maturation of BRB through active recruitment of pericytes onto the growing retinal vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, strikingly, a sudden pericyte loss did not significantly disturb the stabilized, quiescent adult retinal vessels and BRB for some time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the pericyte-free retinal vessels were resistant to vascular leakage/hemorrhage and disruption unless the ECs were damaged by noxious stimulus, such as excess of VEGF-A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pericyte dropout is one of the major hallmarks of DR15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A long-standing question has been whether pericyte dropout is a primary causative factor, a secondary consequence of micro-vessel abnormality, or both in the pathogenesis of DR. Our findings clearly demonstrate that pericyte dropout is not a direct causative factor for DR pathogenesis but rather is an essential factor that accelerate DR progression, further destabilizing retinal vascular ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, either preventing pericyte detachment or enhancing ECpericyte interaction could be a potential therapeutic approach for ameliorating DR progression by maintaining BRB integrity and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast to the prevailing concept6,19,20,21, we provide compelling evidence that pericytes that surround retinal vessels do not express Ang1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the lack of Ang1 expression by pericytes, globally Ang1-depleted neonatal mice show reduced vascular growth and pericyte coverage in the retina37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of Tie2, we showed that endothelial Tie2 plays an indispensable role in vascular development and BRB maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well-known that Ang1-induced Tie2 clustering is critical for its activation19,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the activation of Tie2 can also be strongly induced by shear stress48, which is an independent mode of action to Ang1-induced activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These collectively imply that Ang1 may have derived from adjacent neurons or hematopoietic cells including platelets, which subsequently activate Tie2 or integrins for its roles in formation and maturation of the inner part of the BRB, or the abnormal vascular phenotypes after endothelial Tie2 deletion can be due to the absence of Tie2 activation induced by a blood flow-mediated shear stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, the gate-keeping role of intact pericyte-Tie2/Akt signalling, which suppresses FOXO1-mediated transcriptional activation of vascular destabilizing factors including Ang2 in ECs, seems central for the maintenance and protection of BRB integrity against injuries (Fig 10d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism by which pericyte coverage regulates Tie2 can be explained in two ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, Tie2 shedding (cleavage of Tie2 extracellular domain) in ECs could have occurred immediately after pericyte loss, because ECs are directly exposed to a bunch of activated proteases and growth factors such as VEGF-A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, VEGF-A is known to induce Tie2 shedding via a phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase/Akt-dependent pathway to modulate Tie2 signalling49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, recent elegant studies33,34,50 have revealed that inflammation-induced cleavage of the Tie1 extracellular domain leads to reduced availability and signalling of Tie2, which in turn further degrades vascular stability through FOXO1-mediated upregulation of Ang2 in the ECs of tracheal vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in agreement with these studies, inflammation induced by the BRB disruption after pericyte loss could also reduce functional Tie2 level and stimulate FOXO1 activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, unlike FOXO1 and Ang2, the change in Tie2 upon pericyte depletion was different between growing retinal vessels and stable adult retinal vessels, implying that regulation of Tie2 by pericytes could also be dependent on vessel stability as well as its microenvironment, such as inflammation and hypoxia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PI3 kinase/Akt intracellular signalling is the main downstream pathway for Tie2 activation in ECs19,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While PI3 kinases play key roles in the maintenance of vascular integrity and barrier function51,52, Akt also plays a vital role in maintaining vascular integrity against VEGF-induced impairments and increased permeability in blood vessels53,54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, Akt acts as a negative regulator of FOXO1 by promoting its phosphorylation and degradation19,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, a previous study has shown that FOXO1 activity is induced together with Akt inactivation in primary cultured ECs of microvasculature under diabetic conditions56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, pericyte loss-induced FOXO1 activation could be due to the reduced Tie2-mediated PI3 kinase/Akt signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Upregulation of Ang2 expression and enhanced secretion of Ang2 in ECs are highly reactive processes that occur in any unstable and stimulatory conditions, including acute inflammation, chronic hyperglycemia, cerebral cavernous malformation and excess of vascular stimulating factors and cytokines, which definitively contribute to further exacerbation of vascular destabilization in a positive feedback manner57,58,59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, our findings clearly show that pericyte loss induces FOXO1-mediated transcriptional activation of the genes related to vascular destabilization such as Ang2, ESM1 and VEGFR2 (refs 25, 27, 29, 32), which sensitizes ECs to VEGF-A and further disintegrates BRB by a positive feedback system in retinal vessels (Fig 10d)25,29,61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, Ang2 per se is a positive factor for pericyte dropout in animal models of DR23,63, although its role in pericyte dropout could be overridden in a context-dependent manner as was the case in the Tie2iEC mice in this study (Fig 5f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ang2 is also detected in high levels in the vitreous fluid of patients with DR64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, a recent study60 revealed that cerebral cavernous malformation 3 deficiency in brain ECs enhances the exocytosis and secretion of Ang2, which leads to destabilization of BBB and BRB together with pericyte dropout.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, our approaches with genetic deletion of Ang2 or FOXO1, or administration of Ang2 blocking antibody highlight the critical roles of both Ang2 and FOXO1 as negative regulators of EC stability in the absence of pericytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, neither genetic deletion nor antibody administration fully mitigated the vascular leakage caused by inadequate pericyte coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There could be several reasons for this partial rescue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, there could be unidentified molecular actions or pathways that are responsible for the pericyte depletion-induced vascular leakage but independent of the action of FOXO1 or Ang2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the deletion efficiency may not have been 100% to fully inactivate the actions of FOXO1 or Ang2; similarly, Ang2 blocking antibody would not have perfectly acted on all existing Ang2 due to issues with drug delivery and binding efficiencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, as we and others have demonstrated65,66,67, blockade of Ang2 and VEGF-A along with Tie2 activation could be beneficial in ameliorating BRB breakdown and DR progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, this study delineates the plastic roles of PDGF-B/PDGFR signalling in ECpericyte interaction depending on vessel status and identifies the critical role of the Tie2FOXO1Ang2 loop in pericyte dropout during BRB breakdown in the context of DR, providing clues regarding its pathogenesis and treatment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
