ESRP2 controls an adult splicing programme in hepatocytes to support postnatal liver maturation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although major genetic networks controlling early liver specification and morphogenesis are known, the mechanisms responsible for postnatal hepatic maturation are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we employ global analyses of the mouse liver transcriptome to demonstrate that postnatal remodelling of the liver is accompanied by large-scale transcriptional and post-transcriptional transitions that are cell-type-specific and temporally coordinated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining detailed expression analyses with gain- and loss-of-function studies, we identify epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 (ESRP2) as a conserved regulatory factor that controls the neonatal-to-adult switch of 20% of splice isoforms in mouse and human hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The normal shift in splicing coincides tightly with dramatic postnatal induction of ESRP2 in hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrate that forced expression of ESRP2 in immature mouse and human hepatocytes is sufficient to drive a reciprocal shift in splicing and causes various physiological abnormalities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings define a direct role for ESRP2 in the generation of conserved repertoires of adult splice isoforms that facilitate terminal differentiation and maturation of hepatocytes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mammalian tissues initially form and begin functioning in the embryo but are extensively remodelled after birth to rapidly adapt and perform adult functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process is especially true for the liver, which is haematopoietic in the embryo but converts into a major metabolic tissue in the adult1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hepatocytes, which are highly proliferative in the fetus, become quiescent, undergo hypertrophic growth and mature via large-scale changes in gene expression to maintain metabolic homoeostasis during the dramatic transitions that occur during and after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diverse genetic mechanisms ensure that these changes occur precisely and coordinately to initiate proper lineage specification, cell growth and differentiation2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most gene regulation studies in the liver have focused on transcriptional control3,4; however, it is becoming clear that post-transcriptional mechanisms such as alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) have essential roles in sequential replacement of fetal-to-adult protein isoforms5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'AS allows multiple mRNAs with potentially different functions to be produced from a single gene10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several estimates indicate that  greater than 95% of human multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced12,13, and that most are extensively regulated in response to physiological needs14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such exquisite control is exerted through multiple RNA-binding proteins that bind to core and auxiliary elements on pre-mRNAs to influence assembly of the basal splicing machinery near the 5 and 3 splice sites15,16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The key splicing regulators that orchestrate tissue-specific AS programmes in brain20,21,22,23,24,25, heart26,27,28,29,30,31,32, skeletal muscle development33,34,35,36,37 or T-cell activation38,39,40 are well characterized; however, neither the full extent of transcript diversity nor the regulatory factors that drive isoform transitions in liver development are known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we take a systematic approach to identify a highly conserved and temporally coordinated cell-type-specific splicing programme, which is activated in part by epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 (ESRP2) during postnatal period of liver development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the failure of many neonatal-to-adult splicing transitions, Esrp2 null mice exhibit persistent expression of fetal markers and diminished mature hepatocyte characteristics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, ectopic expression of ESRP2 in immature mouse and human hepatocytes results in a reciprocal switch in splicing of genes involved in cell proliferation, adhesion and differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotypic characterization of Esrp2 null livers reveals defects in hepatocyte proliferation, hepatic zonation abnormalities and reduction in albumin production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our results define a conserved ESRP2 splicing regulatory network that supports terminal differentiation and postnatal maturation of hepatocytes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Extensive transcriptome remodelling during liver maturation', 'To identify global changes in the liver transcriptome during postnatal development, we performed a high-resolution RNA-seq analysis on poly (A)-selected RNA in biological duplicates from four developmental time points in the mouse liver: embryonic day (E)18, postnatal day (P)14, P28, and adult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained an average of 200 million paired-end 100 base pair (bp) reads, with at least 88% mapped to the mouse genome (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of the transcriptome changes were in mRNA abundance, as we identified 4,882 differentially expressed genes between E18 and adult ( greater than 3.0 fold, Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparative analysis of mRNA isoforms identified 529 AS events across 487 unique genes whose percent spliced in (PSI) values changed  greater than 20% (PSI greater than 20%), whereas 214 genes exhibited a  greater than 20% change in alternative polyadenylation (APA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A pie chart distribution of different types of AS is shown in the Supplementary Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We tested 179 developmentally regulated AS events from RNA-seq using reverse transcription PCR (RTPCR) and validated 151 (84%) of them (Supplementary Fig 1bd; Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most AS events (58%) were multiples of three nucleotides, indicating variably spliced regions in the liver tend to preserve the reading frame.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Remodelling of the liver transcriptome during postnatal development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Venn

splicing, 55 genes (26% of 3 untranslated region (UTR) changes) changed at both mRNA levels and 3UTR length, and eight genes changed in AS and in 3UTR length (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 5,583 total events, only two changed significantly in mRNA levels, AS and 3UTR length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, gene ontology analyses of the transcripts undergoing changes in mRNA abundance, AS or 3UTR length revealed enrichment in unique functional categories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the up- or downregulated genes showed strong enrichment for metabolic or cell cycle related gene ontology functions whereas the alternatively spliced genes with increased or decreased PSI values showed enrichment for actin processes or chromatin modification, respectively (Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The class of genes with changes in APA showed particular over-representation for protein transport and localization functions amongst enrichment for lysosomal and mitochondrial processes (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-seq analysis also showed that nearly three times as many genes decreased in abundance than increased during development (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While some genes changed significantly at either an early, middle or late stage, most genes fell into a distinct category of either continual increase or decrease from E18 to adult.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AS transitions also showed similar temporal clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that nearly twice as many variably spliced regions showed increased inclusion than decreased over the postnatal period (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strongest directional pattern of change, however, was in the 3UTR length through APA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 214 affected genes, 145 (68%) showed preferential usage of distal poly (A) sites, thereby generating isoforms with longer 3UTRs (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Conservation of AS transitions in murine and human livers', 'To determine if the developmental AS transitions identified in mouse liver were conserved in humans, we directly assessed splicing of 126 homologous regions in fetal and adult human liver samples (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bulk (55, 44%) of the AS events tested were found to be similarly regulated in both species (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another 33 (26%) events were regulated in mouse, but did not show a developmental change in humans, while 38 (30%) events that were alternatively spliced and regulated in mouse were either constitutively included or skipped in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regulated exons in both species showed higher nucleotide level conservation on average than exons that were constitutive in humans (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As was witnessed in the mouse liver, the majority (78%) of AS changes in humans showed increased inclusion across time (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results not only demonstrate a strong correlative directionality in developmental regulation of AS events but also prelude a functional significance for regulated splicing transitions in hepatic maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Conservation of developmentally regulated AS in mouse

for  greater than 75% of the adult liver volume1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hepatocytes are epithelial in nature and form branching plates of cells between capillary sinusoids that connect the portal tracts to the central vein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-parenchymal cells (NPC) include cholangiocytes, hepatic stellate cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the fetal liver functions as a hematopoietic organ in mammals; however, by the end of gestation the haematopoietic progenitors exit the liver and migrate to the bone marrow1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we asked whether the transcriptome changes identified were exclusive to the maturing parenchyma of the liver or were arising due to varying cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To distinguish between the two scenarios, we isolated hepatocytes and NPC fractions from livers of P0 and adult Friend Virub B NIH Jackson (FVB/NJ) mice by enzymatic digestion and differential centrifugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Total RNAs were extracted from the two liver cell fractions within 1 h of animal sacrifice to minimize the effects of post-mortem changes and cell manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative purity of the fractions was determined by RTPCR analysis of cell-type-specific markers (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons of 132 AS events from purified hepatocytes, NPC and whole liver across two developmental stages revealed that the vast majority (88%) of changes are detected in hepatocytes (Fig 3b,c; Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We extended our AS analysis to further determine the cell-type-specificity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that while a substantial number of events (45, 34%) undergo similar postnatal transitions in hepatocyte and NPC fractions, a much larger set of events (87, 66%) undergo transitions that are cell type specific (Fig 3b,c; Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further classified the AS events on the basis of whether the postnatal splicing change occurred in hepatocyte only, NPC only or opposite in NPC and hepatocyte fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Individual examples representing each of these categories are shown in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although more than half of the cell-type-specific transitions (53%) were exclusive to hepatocytes, a significant number of events changed specifically in NPC (18%) or reciprocally in NPC and hepatocyte fractions (29%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that postnatal transitions in the liver are primarily represented by regulation within hepatocytes and are not a consequence of change in cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Cell-type-specificity of AS programme during postnatal liver maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) RTPCR assays of cell-type-specific markers Afp (neonatal stage),

opposite in NPC and hepatocyte AS transitions, we noticed that 21 of 25 events displayed a crossover pattern (Fig 3d; Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, if the hepatocyte fraction showed a decrease in PSI of a variable region between P0 and adult, the NPC fraction showed an increase and vice versa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, 2 of 25 events exhibited a convergent pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, while the PSI value of the variable regions at P0 stage was different between the hepatocyte and NPC fractions; their adult PSI values became indistinguishable (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two of 25 events showed a strong divergent pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That is, the PSI value of the variable region at P0 stage was comparable in hepatocyte and NPC fractions but their adult PSI value diverged in reciprocal directions (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we determined the temporal dynamics of cell-type-specific splicing differences (Fig 3e; Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that most AS transitions, especially the hepatocyte-specific events, happen early (maximal change occurs between E18 and P14) and that few events follow the middle (maximal change between P14 and P28) and late patterns (maximal change between P28 and adult) of splicing change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results highlight the remarkable complexity of the transcriptome that arises in functionally distinct nonetheless highly interacting liver cell populations through postnatal development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ESRP2 is upregulated in hepatocytes during liver maturation', 'Our next goal was to identify the regulatory factor(s) that drive postnatal AS transitions in the liver.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole liver RNA-seq analyses revealed strong enrichment of ribonucleoprotein complex and RNA processing functions in the downregulated gene set (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genes were cross-referenced to the RNA-seq data to identify DNA- and RNA-binding proteins that change  greater than 3-fold in expression during postnatal liver maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct comparison revealed that an overwhelming majority of RNA-binding proteins (96%) decreased postnatally (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, sequence-specific DNA binding proteins showed a similar overall pattern as All genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  qRTPCR analysis of select RNA-binding proteins

splicing regulators that display an overlapping expression pattern in epithelial cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They drive mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition by coordinating splicing of genes involved in cellcell adhesion, cytoskeleton rearrangement and intracellular signalling41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that in comparison to Esrp1, Esrp2 is the primary paralogue expressed in both mouse and human livers (Fig 4c; Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is different from most other epithelial tissues where ESRP1 is more abundant43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the developmental time course revealed a reciprocal expression pattern: Esrp2 mRNA levels increased while Esrp1 levels declined postnatally (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Parallel analysis of protein levels revealed a striking increase in ESRP2 during the first 4 weeks after birth (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ESRP2 protein levels in the adult mouse liver are 16-fold higher in comparison to the E18 stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite a modest increase in transcript levels (Fig 4b), MBNL2 protein levels actually declined by approximately 3-fold in the adult liver (Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As with mRNA expression, ESRP1 protein is undetectable in the adult human and mouse livers (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether the increase in Esrp2 expression is cell-type-specific, we assayed its relative mRNA and protein levels in purified hepatocyte and NPC fractions isolated from pooled P0 and adult mouse livers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Esrp2 transcript levels increased 4-fold in adult hepatocytes versus the P0 stage (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Western blot analysis demonstrated a corresponding increase in ESRP2 protein levels, specifically in adult hepatocytes (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results illustrate that Esrp2 expression is specifically induced in the maturing hepatocytes, and that the timing of induction coincides with the developmental period (E18P14)

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Collectively, our results reflect that postnatal liver maturation is highly organized and is accomplished through at least three separate modes of transcriptome-remodelling events, namely mRNA abundance, AS and APA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find different regulatory events target genes that function in more distinct than overlapping pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signifies the discrete requirement of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory modules in facilitating hepatic growth and development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies proposed that programmed changes in 3UTR length by APA may affect mRNA stability of transcripts by changing the landscape of RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs available in a cell45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that mRNAs with altered 3UTR isoform ratios are largely unaffected at steady-state levels and therefore argue against a major role for APA in determining mRNA abundance during liver maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with a recent study that found genes changing in mRNA expression during biological transitions tend to have single 3UTRs46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the multi-UTR genes during such transitions predominantly change their 3UTR ratios to achieve tissue specificity46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also identified a conserved set of splice isoform transitions that switch from neonatal-to-adult pattern within the first two weeks after birth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While most of these AS transitions reflect changes in maturing hepatocytes, we discovered many are strictly NPC-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular interest are the developmental transitions that when sampled in whole livers show no change in isoforms; however, when interrogated in purified hepatocytes versus NPC exhibit dramatic changes in isoforms but in opposite directions, which at the whole tissue level are diluted out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, majority of the hepatocyte-specific splicing switches happen during the period when the liver encounters extensive physiological changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in rodents, the first few weeks of postnatal development are associated with terminal differentiation of hepatocytes and pronounced increase in binucleation and tetraploidy47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice undergo significant dietary changes at this time as they transition from milk to chow44,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering this, it is tempting to speculate that nutritional and hormonal variations between birth and weaning may serve as natural signals to initiate the postnatal splicing shift by modulating expression/activity of specific-splicing factors9,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results establish ESRP2 as a key hepatocyte factor, which controls up to 20% of splice isoform transitions occurring naturally during the postnatal period of liver development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ESRPs are epithelial-specific regulatory factors that bind to GU-rich motifs on pre-mRNAs and modulate splicing of alternative exons in a position-dependent manner41,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While previous studies have focused on ESRP1, we demonstrate that ESRP2 is the sole paralogue expressed in human and mouse livers and that it controls a highly conserved splicing regulatory network to facilitate terminal differentiation and postnatal maturation of hepatocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gain- and loss-of-function studies reveal that not only is ESRP2 necessary and sufficient for these AS transitions, but that there are detrimental functional consequences to the liver in its absence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, characterization of Esrp2 KO mice revealed defects in cell proliferation, hepatic zonation and albumin production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these phenotypes, we find that many of the ESRP2 target exons are encoded in genes that control cell growth and proliferation, cellcell adhesion and cell differentiation (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amongst these are major components of Hippo (Nf2, Csnk1d, Yap1) and Rho/Ras GTPase (Arhgef10l, Arhgef11, Plekhg3, Kras, Sgsm1) signalling pathways as well as gene products involved in PI3K/AKT (Pdgfa, Vegfa, Usp4, Kras) and MAPK/ERK (Slk, Camkk2, Scrib, Cask) signalling pathways50,51,52,53 (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will examine the functional roles of individual ESRP2 target transcripts and how their splice isoform switching affects hepatocyte proliferation, differentiation, and maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: ESRP2 controls AS of cell proliferation and differentiation-related genes.Schematic diagram illustrating the network of proteins containing ESRP2-regulated alternative exons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ESRP2 targets in yellow bubbles are known to play roles in cell growth and proliferation by interacting with other cellular proteins (white bubbles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ESRP2 targets in grey bubbles play roles in other cellular functions including cell differentiation and adhesion.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Animal models and human samples', 'Livers, non-parenchymal cells and hepatocytes at specified time points were isolated from FVB/NJ wild-type mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We followed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for use and care of laboratory animals and all experimental protocols were approved by IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and University of Pennsylvania).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole liver tissues, hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells were isolated from FVB/NJ mice postnatal day 0 (P0) and adult stage (3 months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  male) for protein and RNA isolation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whole liver tissues were isolated from 4-month old adult Esrp2 KO and wild-type mice (males and females) for protein and RNA isolation as well as histological studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All animals used in this study, except P0 pups, were ear tagged and given specific identification numbers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only ear tag numbers were used to identify the individual animals at the time of performing histological studies, serum biochemistry and liver function tests to keep the study double blinded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The animals were grouped as wild-type or Esrp2 KO, without randomization, as per their genotyping information when analysing the data from the above mentioned tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study is not gender specific and includes both male and female mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human fetal (22-week old) and adult (51-year-old Caucasian male) liver RNAs were purchased from Clonetech Laboratories, Inc.',

introns were aligned to seven other mammalian genomes that have at least five sequence coverage in the UCSC 28-way multigenome alignment58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each pentamer in each region, a conservation rate was calculated as the fraction of aligned and conserved occurrences among total occurrences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The significance of conservation rate of each pentamer is evaluated by comparing ten other pentamers with similar expected conservation rate calculated using the first-order Markov model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure essentially controls for possible sequence bias in the dataset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P value was calculated by using the binomial distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For motif enrichment, in order to account for background sequence biases, the introns corresponding to each region were binned according to their GC frequency into ten groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expected pentamer frequency was calculated for each pentamer by using the first-order Markov model in introns of each GC group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pentamer enrichment was then evaluated by comparing the occurrence frequency of each pentamer to the overall expected frequency calculated by summing up the expected counts of all GC groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P value was calculated by using the binomial distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Gene ontology and pathway analysis', 'Gene ontology analysis was
