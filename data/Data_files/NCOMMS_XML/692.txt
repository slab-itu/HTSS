Confirmation of the topology of the Wendelstein 7-X magnetic field to better than 1:100,000  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fusion energy research has in the past 40 years focused primarily on the tokamak concept, but recent advances in plasma theory and computational power have led to renewed interest in stellarators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest and most sophisticated stellarator in the world, Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), has just started operation, with the aim to show that the earlier weaknesses of this concept have been addressed successfully, and that the intrinsic advantages of the concept persist, also at plasma parameters approaching those of a future fusion power plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show the first physics results, obtained before plasma operation: that the carefully tailored topology of nested magnetic surfaces needed for good confinement is realized, and that the measured deviations are smaller than one part in 100,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a significant step forward in stellarator research, since it shows that the complicated and delicate magnetic topology can be created and verified with the required accuracy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Fusion has the potential to cover the energy needs of the worlds population into the distant future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lawson showed in 1957 that magnetic confinement fusion based on deuteriumtritium fusion can work as a net energy source if one achieves a sufficiently high triple product,  keV m3 s for the plasma, approximately valid for ion temperatures Ti in the range 1040 keV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here ni is the ion density, and  is the energy confinement time, which for a typical operating point in magnetic fusion reactor studies is a few seconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A promising approach to meeting this challenge is the use of a magnetic field that creates toroidal magnetic surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Of these concepts, the tokamak has so far shown the best confinement properties, but the stellarator is not far behind, and there is reason to believe that it can catch up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a stellarator, nested toroidal magnetic surfaces are created from external magnetic coils, see Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each magnetic field line meanders around on its magnetic surface; it never leaves it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, if one follows a field line from one point on a magnetic surface, one never comes back to the same exact location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, one covers the surface, coming infinitely close to any point of the surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Layout of W7-X.Some representative nested magnetic surfaces are shown in different colours in this computer-aided design (CAD) rendering, together with a magnetic field line that lies on the green surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coil sets that create the magnetic surfaces are also shown, planar coils in brown, non-planar coils in grey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some coils are left out of the rendering, allowing for a view of the nested surfaces (left) and a Poincaré section of the shown surfaces (right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Four out of the five external trim coils are shown in yellow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fifth coil, which is not shown, would appear at the front of the rendering.Full size image', 'The stellarator is different from the other toroidal magnetic surface concepts in that both the toroidal and the poloidal field componentswhich together create the magnetic surface topologyare created from currents in external coils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the tokamak and the reversed-field pinch2, a strong toroidal current driven within the plasma is needed to generate the poloidal magnetic-field component.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stellarators lack of a strong current parallel to the magnetic field greatly reduces macroscopic plasma instabilities, and it eliminates the need for steady-state current drive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes it a more stable configuration, capable of steady-state operation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are important advantages for a power plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The stellarator was invented by Lyman Spitzer in the 1950s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So why did it fall behind?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  And why do some believe that it is about to have a comeback?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Plasma confinement in early stellarators was disappointing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was due to poorly confined particle orbitsmany of the particle trajectories were not fully confined, even though the magnetic field lines were.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If each guiding centre (the point around which the particle performs its rapid gyration) were to stay exactly on the magnetic field line it starts out on, the magnetic surfaces would guarantee good confinement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But for all toroidal magnetic systems, the orbits deviate from the field lines, since the guiding centres drift perpendicular to the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to the field-line curvature and magnetic field strength inhomogeneities inherent to the toroidal magnetic topology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a magnetically confined fusion plasma, the drift is on the order of 10,000 times slower than the particle velocity, but, at 100 ms1, it will lead to particle losses in less than 1/10 of a second, if the drifts do not average out or stay within the magnetic surface, but instead carry the particle from the inner to the outer magnetic surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was the case in early stellarator experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tokamak and the reversed-field pinch do not suffer from this problem since their toroidal symmetry makes the particle drifts average out for all the particles and therefore only cause minor excursions from the magnetic surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Advances in plasma theory, in particular in the 1980s and 1990s, allowed the development of stellarator magnetic field configurations that display greatly improved confinement (see refs 4, 5), reducing the drift orbit losses to a level sufficiently small so that it is predicted to be compatible with an economically feasible fusion power plant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimization itself, as well as the associated design of coils that realize the optimized magnetic fields, requires computer power that only became available in the 1980s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first generation of optimized stellarators started operation in the 1990s, and confirmed many of the expected improvements6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These devices were, however, too small to reach the high ion temperatures where the optimization really comes to its test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, they were built with copper coils, which are adequate for proof-of-principle studies but incompatible with steady-state operation at high magnetic field strengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator experiment is the first representative of the new generation of optimized stellarators, and aims to show with its superconducting coil system and relatively large size (major radius 5.5 m), quasi-steady state operation with plasma parameters, including ion temperatures, close to those of a future fusion power plant8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sophisticated computer optimization of W7-X came at a price, however: the coils have complicated three-dimensional (3D) shapes, reminiscent of sculptures, Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With todays 3D design and manufacturing techniques, complex 3D engineering has become feasible, albeit still challenging10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strict requirements for the manufacturing and assembly accuracy of the coils add to the engineering challenge, which was in fact viewed by some as unrealistic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High engineering accuracy is needed because small magnetic field errors can have a large effect on the magnetic surfaces and the confinement of the plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The measurements that are presented in the following sections confirm that the engineering challenges of building and assembling the device, in particular its coils, with the required accuracy, are met successfully.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explain how this was done, we first describe a few key concepts.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hamiltonians and magnetic surfaces', 'The equations governing magnetic field lines can be written in Hamiltonian form.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is curious that this simple, but little-known, fact was discovered only half a century ago11, but thanks to it, the entire arsenal of Hamiltonian chaos theory can be applied to magnetic fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the celebrated KolmogorovArnoldMoser (KAM) theorem12,13,14 guarantees that small perturbations to an otherwise integrable magnetic field preserve the topology of most field lines, and break it by generating so-called magnetic islands only at well-defined locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we shall see, these islands can be measured and visualized directly in W7-X and offer the opportunity to detect field perturbations smaller than B/B105.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, it is the first time that the topology of a magnetic field has been measured so accurately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For more information on the theory of shaped magnetic fields and their role in plasma confinement, we refer to two recent reviews15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A magnetic surface is not only characterized by its shape and enclosed volume, but also by its rotational transform, .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a measure of the poloidal rotation (twist) of the field lines as one follows them around the magnetic surface; =1/2 indicates that the field line moves halfway around a magnetic surfaces in the poloidal direction for each toroidal turn it makes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for =1/2, the field line bites itself in the tail after two toroidal transits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since there are many more irrational than rational numbers,  is typically irrational, and a magnetic field line generally does not close on itself, it densely traces out a two-dimensional surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Measuring the magnetic topology', 'Since the magnetic surface topology in a stellarator is created entirely from external coils, it can be measured in the absence of a plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is done using an electron beam injected along the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It follows and therefore maps out the magnetic field lines, and thus allows confirmation of the magnetic surface topology, providing a flux surface map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As mentioned earlier, the motion along the field is much faster than the guiding-centre drifts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is even more so for the relatively low-energy electrons used in magnetic-surface mapping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the launch of the electrons parallel to the magnetic field, and the much smaller mass of electrons relative to any ion, its ratio of parallel velocity to guiding centre drift velocity is of order 1 million.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the beam follows the magnetic field lines to a very high accuracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source of the electron beam is an electron gun, a small negatively biased and heated thermionic electron emitter surrounded by a small electrically grounded cylindrical structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This electron beam alone can visualize the magnetic field line on which it is placed, through collisional excitation of a dilute background gas inside the vacuum chamber.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, striking images can be made of the 3D structure of the magnetic surfaces; see Fig 2 and refs 17, 18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

and nitrogen (pn106 mbar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three bright light spots are overexposed point-like light sources used to calibrate the camera viewing geometry.Full size image', 'A two-dimensional cross-sectional image generally provides clearer information though, just as Poincaré phase-space maps do for other Hamiltonian systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a Poincaré plot of the magnetic surface is realized experimentally by intersecting the electron beam with a rod covered with a fluorescent, here a special zinc oxide powder (ZnO:Zn).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the rod intersects the magnetic surface on which the electron beam circulates, it fluoresces at the one or usually two locations where the rod intersects the magnetic surface and therefore collides with the electron beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the rod moves through the surface, all points on the latter will eventually light up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a long camera exposure of this sweep motion, the entire cross-section of the magnetic surface appears, as shown in Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The motion of the rod itself is often invisible on such an image, since the light sources (other than the fluorescence) are kept as weak as possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After an exposure, one can move the electron gun to another field line that defines another magnetic surface, and repeat the process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way, the nested, closed magnetic surface topology, which is illustrated in Fig 1, can be experimentally verified19,20,21,22, and if any magnetic island chains exist, they will show up in the Poincaré plot, as explained in the following.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Poincaré section of a magnetic surface.The Poincaré section of a closed magnetic surface is measured using the fluorescent rod technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

rational value of : a direct confirmation of the small-denominator problem in KAM theory12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In practice, island chains with a detectable and operation-relevant size only appear for low-order rational values of , and only if there is a Fourier component of the magnetic field that has matching (that is, resonant) toroidal and poloidal mode numbers, n and m, so that =n/m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'W7-X is designed to reach =1 at the outermost flux surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is a fivefold periodic device, with a pentagon-like shape, and thus has an n=5 Fourier component to its magnetic field, so that an n=m=5 island chain appears at the plasma edge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We denote unwanted field components error fields, and describe them in relative terms, bmn=Bmn/B0, where B0 is the average magnetic field strength in the confinement region, and Bmn is the amplitude of the Fourier component of the error field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the search for error fields, we focus on the toroidal n numbers since only n=5 and multiples thereof should be present, whereas a broad spectrum of poloidal m numbers is present in W7-X.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The n=1 through 4 components are to be avoided as much as possible, to ensure symmetric heat load distributions onto the 2 × 5=10 divertor units to be installed at the vessel wall in future operation phases23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the symmetry-breaking n=1 through 4 error fields, deformations due to electromagnetic forces do not play a major role and the bmns are largely independent of the magnitude of B0, in contrast to the effects discussed in the Discussion section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular concern is the n=1 component, which would create an n/m=1/1 island chain, and would result from, for example, a slightly misplaced coil module.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'When minimizing the error fields, the main engineering challenge is the geometrical precision during coil manufacturing and coil assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 3.5 × 2.5 × 1.5 m-size non-planar coil winding packs with their five different geometries (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1) are particularly critical24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The construction of W7-X required, for the first time, industry to manufacture superconducting coils with a highly complex shapes, with tolerances in the ±1 mm regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was accomplished by using specialized winding devices combined with precision metrology25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It was even more challenging to maintain the precision, and keep track of it, during installation of the coils: Positioning of the coils, machining of the contact elements, welding of mechanical supports and bolting to the massive central support ring, all sums up to create an additional contribution to the error field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was only possible to keep deviations during installation and assembly into coil groups under control by intensive use of laser-based metrology tools, systematic adjustment procedures, as well as advanced welding and machining technologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest coil placement errors were less than 4.4 mm, resulting in an expected largest Fourier

island chain will result from even a very small resonant error field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With field-line mapping, island chains can be detected, and thus,  can be determined at a specific radial location, and resonant error fields, if present, can be measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We show in the following that effects due to slight deformations of the magnetic coils are clearly visible, and

engineering of a fusion device, as well as in the measurement of magnetic topology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Adjustment of ', 'The magnetic topology used for initial plasma experiments in W7-X was chosen

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The now experimentally validated numerical model of the coil system allows us to identify the primary source of the measured error field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured field error is caused primarily by imperfections in the placement and shapes of the planar coils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the special magnetic configuration chosen here, the planar coils produce a much larger fraction of the magnetic field than they do in configurations used for plasma operation; in fact the one major configuration that has =1 at the plasma edge has no planar coil current.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we plan to measure the B11 error field in a configuration whose magnetic field is overwhelmingly dominated by the non-planar coils with 1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the B11 and the B21 components should be roughly of the same order of magnitude, and since the B21 error is reproduced by our numerical models, the b11 error is also expected to be small, likely close to or somewhat below the aforementioned estimate of 1.1 × 104, thus well within the correction capabilities of the W7-X coil set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The need for complex 3D shaping and high-accuracy requirements have been viewed as major problems for optimized stellarators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wendelstein 7-X demonstrates that a large, optimized, superconducting stellarator can be built with an accuracy sufficient to generate good magnetic surfaces with the required topology, and that experimental tools exist to verify the magnetic topology down to and below errors as small as 1:100,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results were obtained using magnetic field-line mapping, a sensitive technique to measure the detailed topology of the magnetic surfaces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To reach the other goals of the device, and provide an answer to the question is the stellarator the right concept for fusion energy?, years of plasma physics research is needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That task has just started.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The data sets generated and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
