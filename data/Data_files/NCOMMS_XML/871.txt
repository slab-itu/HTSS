Climate change reduces extent of temperate drylands and intensifies drought in deep soils  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Drylands cover 40% of the global terrestrial surface and provide important ecosystem services.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While drylands as a whole are expected to increase in extent and aridity in coming decades, temperature and precipitation forecasts vary by latitude and geographic region suggesting different trajectories for tropical, subtropical, and temperate drylands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncertainty in the future of tropical and subtropical drylands is well constrained, whereas soil moisture and ecological droughts, which drive vegetation productivity and composition, remain poorly understood in temperate drylands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that, over the twenty first century, temperate drylands may contract by a third, primarily converting to subtropical drylands, and that deep soil layers could be increasingly dry during the growing season.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes imply major shifts in vegetation and ecosystem service delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results illustrate the importance of appropriate drought measures and, as a global study that focuses on temperate drylands, highlight a distinct fate for these highly populated areas.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Global climate models (GCMs) project consistent increases of climatological aridity for the twenty first century1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, GCM projections of meteorological droughts are uncertain and suggest robust increases in some but not all regions6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This uncertainty could have particularly strong consequences for dryland regions5,8, which are already limited by water9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Drylands may respond to climate change in their distribution, driven by aridity, or in ecosystem structure, function, and composition, driven by ecohydrological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global drylands expanded over the twentieth century by 48%2,3 and represent currently c. 40% of the global terrestrial surface (refs 2, 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite observations of increasing overall aridity, forecasts of extreme drought events in the second half of the twentieth century remain uncertain1,4,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Model projections largely agree, however, that drylands will likely continue to expand during the twenty first century1,2,3,5,10 due to increases in evaporative demand and a global hydrological cycle with longer and more severe dry periods10,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A net expansion of drylands may reduce ecosystem services and impact human livelihoods14 through water scarcity15,16, vegetation die-offs17 and land degradation18 all of which are exacerbated by human land use19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The projected global trend towards increased aridity is largely robust to variation among models and data sources, even though potential evapotranspiration by itself is unsuitable for understanding drying trends11,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, global temperature and precipitation projections vary geographically and latitudinally1,10 suggesting different outcomes for tropical and subtropical (hereafter subtropical) drylands versus temperate drylands at mid-latitudes5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of particular concern for dryland ecosystems, trends in meteorological drought and soil moisture are highly uncertain and generally model dependent6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This uncertainty is especially complicated for soil moisture availability, which is dictated by the combination of weather, vegetation, soil and landscape attributes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In dryland ecosystems, soil moisture controls most ecosystem processes8,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced primary productivity occurs primarily during periods of reduced soil moisture and not directly to an absence of precipitation8,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditions that diminish harvest yields due to below-normal levels of soil moisture, particularly during the growing period, have traditionally been called agricultural drought (in contrast, for example, to meteorological drought which is a period of below-normal precipitation8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The notion of reduced soil moisture has been extended to ecosystems and is referred to as ecological drought8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ecological drought is commonly described as a prolonged and widespread deficit in naturally available water supplies  that create multiple stresses across ecosystems (US Geological Survey, US Climate Science Centers and the Science for Nature and People Partnership) and has recently garnered widespread attention as one of the topics defining twenty first century climate change14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the complexity of the water cycle, soil moisture and ecological drought projections show large uncertainties among GCMs1,3,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Soil moisture projections and drying trends are better constrained in subtropical drylands because these are closely linked to the well-represented Hadley Circulation1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of the existing research on climate change impacts to drylands has focused on climatic aridity and meteorological droughts, or has been restricted to subtropical drylands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, much less is known about impacts of climate change on soil moisture and ecological droughts, and in particular in temperate drylands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Vegetation responds to and influences soil moisture through transpiration, interception, shading, and hydraulic redistribution8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite adaptations of dryland vegetation to ambient aridity levels8,24, responses to increased droughts and warming under climate change remain difficult to constrain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Potential outcomes include plant functional type shifts18,25, woody plant mortality17 and encroachment26, and resistance of some vegetation types24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These vegetation responses vary among plant functional types and depend on seasonal and soil depth dynamics of soil moisture in addition to climate8,22,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three plant functional typesshrubs, C3 grasses and C4 grassesmost frequently dominate temperate dryland vegetation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While all types use shallow soil moisture, shrubs can use water from greater depths8,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shifts in the relative dominance of plant functional types, particularly those involving woody species, can impact ecosystem water balance by altering water uptake and evapotranspiration26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Woody plant encroachment has been a concern in grass-dominated drylands worldwide during the twentieth century and is projected to increase under climate change26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in vegetation in response to changes in soil moisture may impact ecosystem services in temperate dryland ecosystems globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We applied a two-tiered approach to assess consequences of climate change for global temperate, arid and semiarid drylands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we quantified zones of contraction, expansion and stability of the distribution of five temperate dryland regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, we estimated impacts of climate change on seasonal and depth patterns of ecological drought, and their consequences for plant water uptake using SOILWAT28,29, an ecosystem water balance simulation model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SOILWAT utilizes site-specific soils and weather data (here we evaluated spatially and temporally downscaled output from 16 GCMs driven by an intermediate and a high emissions scenario), and SOILWAT soil moisture outputs compare very favourably with GCM estimates (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, SOILWAT provides high temporal resolution (daily) information about ecosystem water balance and plant available moisture that reflects the influence of site-specific soil conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we illustrate that GCMs for the late twenty first century project a net loss of c. 15% (following the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1)) to 30% (following RCP8.5) of current temperate dryland extent due to climatic changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the duration of ecological droughts during growing periods may substantially increase, especially in deeper ( greater than 20 cm) soils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Water uptake by vegetation under future climate could be increasingly reliant on surface soil moisture, favouring shallow-rooted over deep-rooted vegetation, which contrasts with previous projections of increasing dryland woody encroachment26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Plant water uptake patterns within and among regions are projected to become more similar, suggesting a homogenization of niche spaces and vegetation composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings emphasize contrasting spatial trajectories between subtropical and temperate drylands and highlight the need to assess seasonal as well as spatial patterns of soil moisture dynamics to understand factors that shape the future of temperate drylands and the services they provide.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Spatial response of temperate drylands to climate change', 'The extent of temperate drylands under current climate is 8.3 × 106 km2 based on aridity, climate zone, and mean annual temperature (MAT) (Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This corresponds to c. 5.6% of the global terrestrial surface and to 2030%, varying by published estimates2,5, of all arid and semiarid areas globally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in aridity, climate zone, and mean annual temperature projected by GCMs will alter the future distribution of temperate drylands, which we defined here climatologically2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By the end of this century, climate change could lead to a net contraction of temperate drylands of up to 2.4 × 106 km2 (1.23.3 × 106 km2 among 16 GCMs following RCP8.5) with considerable variation among regions (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RCP8.5 represents a business as usual scenario, that is, no mitigation to curb climate change, which will not occur if the Paris agreement30 to keep the global mean temperature well below 2 ° C above pre-industrial levels is implemented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All results for the intermediate emissions scenario RCP4.5, which assumes a stabilization of emissions without overshoot, are given in Supplementary Figs 110 and Supplementary Tables 13, 5, 7, and 10, but are qualitatively similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While other studies indicate that drylands in total may increase by 523% globally2,5, that general statement masks our result that temperate drylands may contract while subtropical drylands expand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a median of 36% (2451% among GCMs) of current temperate drylands would be converted under the considered scenario mainly to warmer subtropical drylands (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An area equal to 9% (620%) of the current extent would be added in the future as temperate drylands, primarily because of increased aridity in currently sub-humid areas (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our assessment of contracting, stable, and expanding zones among GCMs showed consistency in four regions (3280% agreement), but not in North America (19%;

+2.6 days, 7 to 17 days) particularly for contracting and expanding zones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was surprising since increased cold-season precipitation might be expected to enhance available soil moisture at depth due to reduced evaporative competition for percolating soil moisture8,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of differential drying of deep versus surface soil layers, future vegetation was projected to extract more water from shallow rather than deeper layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations suggest that overall the importance of transpiration from shallow layers increases under climate change, that is, the proportion of total transpiration that derives from deep layers decreases (Fig 3 and Supplementary Tables 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the proportion of transpired water derived from deep soil layers to decrease by a median of 8% (412%) for South America, 2% (2 to 7%) for Central and Western Asia, 11% (715%) for the Western Mediterranean basin, and 5% (1 to 9%) for North America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exception was again East Asia where we estimated increased water uptake (2%, 2 to 5%) from deep soil layers (Supplementary Fig 7 and Supplementary Tables 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulation results suggest also that transpiration from shallow layers may increase in the median case in most regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Median decreases occur in the Western Mediterranean basin and the expanding zone of South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our results also indicate a heterogeneous pattern where the overall regional trends are interrupted at smaller spatial scales (Supplementary Fig 8 and Supplementary Tables 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This heterogeneous pattern of the geographic distribution of increases and decreases is more prominent for transpiration derived from soil moisture at deep soil layers (Supplementary Fig 9 and Supplementary Tables 45).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among regions and within some regions (specifically East Asia, South America and the Western Mediterranean), we found a negative relationship between the projected change in the proportion of transpiration derived from deep soil moisture and the current value (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This negative relationship indicates a homogenization of plant water uptake among soil layers implying a reduction of niche spaces, associated plant functional types, and biodiversity8,22 within temperate drylands as a whole and within those regions that display the negative relationship (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Climate-driven changes in the proportion of transpiration derived from deep soil moisture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Current values;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Net reductions in the area of temperate drylands occurred in our projections following an intermediate and a high-emission scenario across all five temperate dryland regions and illustrate the different impact of climate change on the distribution of temperate versus subtropical drylands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter are projected to expand due to conversions from temperate to subtropical climate in addition to increased aridity in currently sub-humid subtropical regions1,3,5,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequences for vegetation of a shift from temperate to subtropical drylands include loss of temperature-controlled seasonal cycle, phenological shifts, increases in frost-intolerant species and dominance of C4 over C3 grasses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, impacts on ecosystem services could have large consequences for human well-being: aggressive human diseases, including dengue and schistosomiasis31, as well as mound-building termites32, occur in subtropical climates and could expand as temperate drylands warm, whereas cool season crops such as wheat and potato would no longer be economically viable33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings suggest large and regionally variable shifts in the distribution of temperate drylands under a changing climate, and highlight the complex interplay between seasonal soil water resources and intensified ecological droughts during the growing season that differ with soil depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While increased water availability at depth would be expected with more cold-season precipitation (favouring woody and deep-rooted species8,22), our results suggest instead a soil moisture regime that is increasingly dominated by longer ecological droughts particularly at depth and by available water restricted to surface soils (favouring shallow-rooted herbaceous species8,22) and the cool season (favouring winter annuals, including invasive grasses34).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing water scarcity in deep soils is relevant for ecosystem function because soil moisture at depth is an important resource for deep-rooted woody species as drought proceeds27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates, for instance, that expected future increases of woody plant encroachment26 may not be generalizable across all drylands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study emphasizes the need to differentiate among drylands and describes intensifications of seasonal and soil depth patterns of drought that could affect temperate dryland plant communities and the services they provide, including water resources, wildlife habitat, soil conservation, agriculture and carbon storage.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Study area', 'We identified temperate drylands using three criteria: mean annual temperature (MAT), the Trewartha climate classification scheme35, and the FAO/UNEP aridity index (AI) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we restricted the analysis to areas with soils of less than 90% sand content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We classified temperate areas if MAT greater than 0 ° C and Trewartha climate group was category D, that is, the number of months with mean temperatures 10 ° C is 4 but  less_than 8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We included areas as drylands if 0.05AI less_than 0.5, that is, arid and semiarid types excluding hyper-arid37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AI was calculated as MAP/PET, where PET is potential evapotranspiration and MAP is the mean annual precipitation37, particularly, this index is equivalent to the inverse aridity index of the Budyko framework20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our classification is climate dependent, we determined the study area under current climate and for each future climate scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We applied a geographic raster with 0.3125° square cells, so that exactly one cell centre of the NCEP/CFSR T382 Gaussian grid38 fell in each of our cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our raster contained 1,152 × 576 cells and had its origin at 90° S and 179.84375° W.

data set62 using equations by Jackson et al.63 for our study area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our simulation model made the simplifying assumption that net, ecosystem-scale water-use efficiency and net primary productivity do not respond to increasing atmospheric CO2-concentration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assumption may under-estimate the effects on soil drying11,15,21; yet several studies find a negative net effect of elevated CO2 on soil moisture in dry ecosystems64,65 and in combination with nutrient limitation66,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increases in leaf-level water-use efficiency may lead to a positive response in biomass and transpiration in water-limited systems (as opposed to energy-limited systems) and thus, potentially, to a decrease in soil moisture over the long run64,65,68.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several major issues remain to be addressed for an accurate representation of responses and their interactions to increasing CO2-concentration at ecosystem scales in models69,70,71 before these simulation models will be able to represent the full range of experimental and historical observations68,72,73,74,75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of these uncertainties is illustrated by the large range of reported values from observations and experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These indicate that responses to elevated CO2-concentration of ecosystem water-use efficiency may range from 0 to +120%, of transpiration from 14 to +11%, of productivity from 0 to 40%, and of soil moisture from 20 to +10%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the physiological response to CO2-concentration of photosynthesis and leave-level water-use efficiency are reasonably understood67,76, our ability to predict net impacts at the ecosystem-scale has been described as very low76.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Analysis of response variables', 'Each SOILWAT simulation run produced daily output for each process and water compartment for the 31-year simulation period discarding the first year as spin-up (see Simulation framework).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of the daily data, we calculated derived response variables (see next paragraph) and then aggregated temporally across 31 years by mean and standard deviation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated these derived and aggregated variables for the current climate condition and for 16 GCMs under two RCPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We captured the variation among GCMs for each RCP by agreement level of temperate dryland classification and by the selection of study area cells for the aggregation of response variable values (details in Variation of response variables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because our simulation experiment was deterministic, we estimated effect sizes and performed an evaluation of simulation results, but no statistical hypothesis testing77.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used R version 3.1.2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  78) for all analyses and for creating figures; we used the R package maps version 3.0.2 to add country borders to figures of geographic data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We chose two derived response variables to capture ecohydrological constraints on potential vegetation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated the mean annual duration of continuous ecological droughts during growing periods for surface soil layers of 020 cm depth (DDGP0) and for deep soil layers greater than 20 cm depth (DDGP20) as the longest snow-free, frost-free period when soil water potential (SWP) less_than 3.0 MPa continuously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated mean annual proportion of transpiration derived from deep soil moisture ( greater than 20 cm depth; T20/T) as the ratio of transpiration resulting from water uptake from deep soil layers (T20) to transpiration resulting from water uptake from all soil layers (T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Variation of response variables', 'We allowed for variation among raster cells within regions, variation among regions, variation among RCPs, and variation among GCMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we reported results under RCP8.5, which is closely tracked by recent greenhouse gas emissions79.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, RCP8.5 represents a business as usual scenario without mitigation; if the Paris agreement30 to keep the global mean temperature well below 2 ° C above pre-industrial levels is implemented, results under RCP4.5 (Supplementary Information) or RCP2.6 (not simulated) could be more realistic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the article, we focus on variation among regions and among GCMs (note: overall variation among RCP was for precipitation-related variables as large as variation among GCMs, Supplementary Table 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation among GCMs arose due to spatial variation of extent and location of our study area (temperate drylands are defined as a function of climate) and due to within-cell variation in forcing from the 16 GCMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We estimated level of spatial agreement by counting GCMs that classified a cell as temperate dryland.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified three shifting zones for each GCM: the contracting zone comprises cells with a temperate dryland under current, but not under future climate condition; the stable zone comprises cells with a temperate dryland under current and future conditions; the expanding zone comprises cells with a temperate dryland under future, but not current conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated summaries by region and shifting zone in two steps to simultaneously account for both aspects of variation among GCMs, that is, the within-cell and the spatial components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first calculated for each GCM the target summary statistic among those cells that are part of a zone and region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a second step, we calculated the median value among the 16 GCM summary values and used the minimummaximum GCM range as indicator of among GCM variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We determined for each shift the contribution of each defining factor and determined whether a cell changed the climate classification between temperate and boreal35 (13 months with mean temperature10 ° C), subtropical35 (8 months with mean temperature 10 ° C) or tropical35 (12 months with mean temperature18 ° C), and whether a cell changed the aridity classification36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We estimated the relative contributions of cells, regions, shifting zones, GCMs, and RCPs to the variation of two groups of variables: climate inputs/drivers (MAT, MAP, AI, PET, wet/warm-season overlap) and the derived ecohydrological response variables.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated the uniquely attributable variation based on additive elements by Whittaker80,81 as percentage of the total variation for each variable for the extent of the study area for each climate condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We partitioned the variation for the absolute variable values under each climate condition and as difference between future and current conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Absolute values indicated that most of the variation was attributable to among-cell variation (mean±1 s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  are 68±30% for climate drivers, and 63±19% for response variables) and most of the rest to among-region variation (Supplementary Table 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variation attributable to among-GCM and among-RCP variation were of similar size, but only relevant for differences between future and current conditions (20±11% and 22±27% for climate drivers, and 9±5% and 7±12% for response variables).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large variation among climate drivers for the attribution of RCP arose because MAT and PET were primarily driven by variation in RCP whereas other drivers (MAP, AI, wet/warm-season overlap) showed larger variation among GCMs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Comparison of SOILWAT results with other approaches', 'We compared projections of GCMs against SOILWAT output of mean monthly soil moisture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variable mrso (total soil moisture content) was extracted for seven GCMs under historical and future (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios from non-downscaled data from the ESGF node https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We calculated normalized mean monthly values for the periods of 19802005 and 20702099 for each of our simulated raster cells and compared agreement with equivalent soil moisture values from SOILWAT output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated agreement between models with Duveillers , which is the best performing symmetric agreement index82.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ranges between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates no agreement and 1 is perfect agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is proportional to Pearsons correlation index and accounts for systematic and unsystematic bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The comparison is favourable with an overall agreement level for the historical time period of 0.89±0.07 (mean±s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  among 7 GCM-SOILWAT comparisons) as well as for the future time period under RCP8.5 of 0.92±0.04 (Supplementary Fig 10 and Supplementary Table 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional agreement is mostly similarly high.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GCM-SOILWAT agreement, however, was low for Eastern Asia in the historic time period with 0.37±0.21, which increased to 0.67±0.09 for the future period under the RCP8.5 scenario.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our simulations for the historic time period were run with observation-based weather data, whereas the GCM output represents hindcasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the future time periods, the representation of climate conditions for our simulations were based on GCM output.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we expected a higher agreement between our simulation results and those from GCMs for the future time periods than for the historic period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Freedman et al.83 compared GRACE satellite observations of terrestrial water storage with GCM predictions for 20032012 for the Mississippi River Basin and found good agreement in overall aggregated values, but considerable GCM deviations spatially and in water flux partitioning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a similar exercise, Wu et al.13 compared GRACE data to GCM predictions to select GCMs for a hydrological impact assessment and found noticeable variation among GCM soil moisture predictions including GCMs with cycles that do not match the seasonal variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not surprising that we found modest deviations between SOILWAT and GCM soil moisture values as well (Supplementary Fig 10 and Supplementary Table 10), particularly across Eastern Asia, which is a region where several GCMs demonstrate difficulties in representing the monsoonal precipitation regime84.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We compared SOILWAT output to the demand-supply relationship of water availability in the Budyko framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We fitted annual output of SOILWAT for F=Eactual / P, that is, the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (AET=Eactual, mm) to annual precipitation (MAP=P, mm), against the Budyko aridity index AIb=1/AIUNEP, that is, the ratio of potential evapotranspiration (PET=Epotential, mm) to annual precipitation36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used Fuhs equation to represent the Budyko curve, that is, F=1+AIb(1+AIb)1/ (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  85); while AIb describes the prevailing climatic conditions,  can be interpreted as the combined influence on water availability of all other factors such as vegetation, soil and seasonality86.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated  for each region based on mean annual SOILWAT output of AET and PET by numerically minimizing the sum of the squared differences between F and 1+AIb(1+AIb)1/ (refs 86, 87) across simulated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The resulting Budyko curves agree well with SOILWAT output that was aggregated without functional constraints, for example, when summarized by locally weighted polynomial regression lines (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find this favourable agreement with the Budyko framework despite the fact that our estimates of  are not precise because we used mean annual values (that is, spatial instead of temporal variation) and because our simulations included only temperate drylands, for example, cells with AIb less_than 2 are mostly not included (but would contain most of the information of the shape of the curves).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison confirms that that actual evapotranspiration in dry regions is limited not primarily by potential evapotranspiration rates, but by other factors including seasonal soil moisture, soil conditions, and vegetation20,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding climate change impacts in dryland regions, thus, requires models such as SOILWAT, which simulate these other factors in detail and which do not rely on an aridity index as model driver11,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Code availability', 'The source code of SOILWAT v0.1.0-gtd is available
