Antibiotic-producing symbionts dynamically transition between plant pathogenicity and insect-defensive mutualism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Pathogenic and mutualistic bacteria associated with eukaryotic hosts often lack distinctive genomic features, suggesting regular transitions between these lifestyles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present evidence supporting a dynamic transition from plant pathogenicity to insect-defensive mutualism in symbiotic Burkholderia gladioli bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a group of herbivorous beetles, these symbionts protect the vulnerable egg stage against detrimental microbes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production of a blend of antibiotics by B. gladioli, including toxoflavin, caryoynencin and two new antimicrobial compounds, the macrolide lagriene and the isothiocyanate sinapigladioside, likely mediate this defensive role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to vertical transmission, these insect symbionts can be exchanged via the host plant and retain the ability to initiate systemic plant infection at the expense of the plants fitness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide a paradigm for the transition between pathogenic and mutualistic lifestyles and shed light on the evolution and chemical ecology of this defensive mutualism.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Symbiosis is ubiquitous in nature and constitutes a major source of evolutionary innovation, playing a fundamental role in the origin and diversification of eukaryotic life on Earth1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microbial symbionts influence virtually all aspects of eukaryote biology2, and their impact on host fitness ranges from detrimental to beneficial, occasionally shifting along this continuum3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although such shifts have important implications for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of symbiosis, observations of recent or dynamic transitions between parasitic and mutualistic lifestyles are scarce, and reports on their occurrence rely largely on phylogenetic evidence4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, genomic analyses across bacterial groups reveal that general signatures distinguishing pathogenic and mutualistic microbes are often lacking4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we report on a transition between pathogenicity and mutualism in Burkholderia bacteria associated with a widespread group of herbivorous beetles, the Lagriinae (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that these insect-defensive mutualists likely evolved from plant pathogenic bacteria, and that they can still infect a plant host, proposing an ecological context in which the lifestyle transition may have occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we elucidate symbiont-produced compounds that inhibit the growth of relevant microbial antagonists of the insect.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Burkholderia as vertically transmitted symbionts in Lagriinae', 'Lagriinae beetles harbour extracellular bacteria in a pair of accessory glands connected to the female reproductive system7 (Fig 1a,d) that are transmitted vertically via the egg surface7 (Fig 1b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shortly before hatching, some bacterial cells enter the egg and colonize invaginations of the cuticle located dorsally in the embryo that later close to form three compartments in the larva7 (Fig 1c,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify the bacterial symbionts associated with the invasive South American soybean pest Lagria villosa8 and to confirm their vertical transmission route, we characterized the bacterial community in the symbiont-bearing structures of field-collected adult females and eggs laid by these females, as well as in larvae of laboratory cultures using 454 sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) amplicons and quantitative PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified a closely related cluster of bacteria from the genus Burkholderia as the most prevalent taxon in female accessory glands and eggs (6586% and 3071% of reads per individual gland or egg clutch, respectively) (Supplementary Fig 1a,b), and we found the same bacteria in mean abundances of 1.39 × 106, 1.83 × 107 and 1.59 × 108 16S rRNA gene copies per egg, larva and adult female gland, respectively (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longer 16S rRNA reads (1.11.3 kb) obtained by Sanger sequencing revealed that the symbionts are most similar to Burkholderia gladioli, a well-known plant pathogen, and that at least three highly similar strains coinfect L. villosa beetles (Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As supported by findings in the congeneric beetle species Lagria hirta, the coexistence of multiple symbiotic B. gladioli strains within individual beetles might be a common feature in Lagriinae beetles (Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the strains could be successfully isolated from L. villosa and cultured in vitro (B. gladioli Lv-StA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, Burkholderia-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed symbiont localization in the adult female reproductive glands, on the egg surface and in the unusual dorsal organs of larvae (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Burkholderia gladioli symbionts are transmitted vertically via egg smearing in Lagria villosabeetles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,d) Adult females carry the symbionts within two pairs of accessory glands associated with the reproductive system as confirmed by FISH on cross-sections of a female reproductive system (inset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b,e) Host eggs are covered with a secretion containing Burkholderia bacteria, as revealed by FISH on an egg wash.

antifungal protection by B. gladioli symbionts', 'The specialized localization of the symbionts in the larval and adult stage and the vertical transmission route suggested an important functional role of Burkholderia in the insect host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore generated symbiont-free (aposymbiotic) beetles by egg-surface sterilization to evaluate potential differences to their untreated symbiotic counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, aposymbiotic eggs suffered more frequently from fungal infestation, pointing to a protective role of the symbionts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we isolated spores of the most frequently encountered fungal antagonist of L. villosa eggs under laboratory conditions, Purpureocillium lilacinum (formerly Paecilomyces lilacinus), that has been previously reported as an egg entomopathogen9 and as a natural enemy of L. villosa adults and larvae10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon exposure to the fungal pathogen, surface-sterilized eggs experienced fungal growth significantly more often and at higher levels than control eggs (Fig 2a,d and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, reinfection of surface-sterilized eggs with Burkholderia symbionts from egg washes or cultured B. gladioli Lv-StA significantly reduced fungal infestation, confirming that the absence of the symbionts rather than the surface-sterilization procedure itself was responsible for increased susceptibility to fungal growth (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The symbionts protective effect was further corroborated by the significantly higher probability of fungal growth on untreated eggs from aposymbiotic as compared to symbiotic mothers (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to P. lilacinum, the symbionts also inhibited the growth of the fast-growing soil fungus Trichoderma harzianum and the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana in vivo, revealing a generalized antifungal protection by the symbionts (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although eggs suffering from P. lilacinum infection hatched at similar rates as those without fungus (Supplementary Fig 5a), larvae hatching from infected eggs had significantly lower chances of surviving the first instars, demonstrating that fungal inhibition by the symbionts confers a benefit to the host (Fig 2e and Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the impact of fungal growth on survival varied among the different treatments and was most pronounced for aposymbiotic individuals, suggesting that there may be costs of the symbiosis in the absence of fungal infection (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: B. gladioli symbionts protect L. villosa greater than  eggs from fungal infestation.In the absence of the symbionts on L. villosa

survival curves (KaplanMeier) and the corresponding standard error are shown.Full size image', 'Antibiotic production by B. gladioli Lv-StA', 'Given that the cultured bacterial symbiont (B. gladioli Lv-StA) showed strong antifungal activity in vitro (Fig 2f) and its application in vivo fully restored the naturally observed egg protection (Fig 2ac), we used this strain to investigate the chemical nature of the symbiont-conferred protection based on whole-genome sequencing, chemical analyses and bioassays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioinformatic mining revealed several secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters including those coding for the previously described bioactive compounds toxoflavin11 (Supplementary Table 2) and caryoynencin12 (Supplementary Table 3), as well as an orphan gene cluster coding for a complex polyketide, homologous to the etnangien biosynthetic assembly line characterized in Sorangium cellulosum13 (Fig 3a and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS)-based metabolic profiling of B. gladioli Lv-StA culture extracts confirmed the production of the azapteridine toxoflavin (1) and the polyyne caryoynencin (2), which represent known bioactive metabolites14,15,16,20, as well as a polyketide structurally related to etnangien, which we named lagriene (3) (Fig 3b and Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure of lagriene was elucidated using MS and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Supplementary Figs 714).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, an aromatic glycoside was identified in the extracts (Supplementary Fig 6b), and its structure was fully resolved by MS and NMR (4) (Fig 3b and Supplementary Figs 7,1520).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter compound, which we named sinapigladioside, contains an isothiocyanate moiety, a rare structural feature among bacterial metabolites17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar sulfur-containing structures are typically found in metabolites of plants (mustard oils), mainly of the order Brassicales, where they serve as chemical defence against herbivores and pathogens18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production of these four compounds by B. gladioli Lv-StA suggested them as candidates for the protective effect on the eggs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the in vivo production of the identified metabolites, we analysed extracts from eggs that were surface sterilized, reinfected with B. gladioli Lv-StA and exposed (or not) to P. lilacinum spores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using HPLC-MS, we confirmed the presence of toxoflavin, lagriene and sinapigladioside, implying that the symbionts also produce these antimicrobial agents in vivo, without requiring a trigger from the antagonistic fungus (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unsurprisingly, caryoynencin was not detected in the extracts, since this highly reactive compound is known to degrade rapidly12,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To shed further light on the functional role of the bacterial metabolites, we assessed the activity of the compounds against a number of entomopathogenic microorganisms in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas toxoflavin and lagriene possess antibacterial activity (for example, against Brevibacillus laterosporus and Bacillus thuringiensis, respectively) (Supplementary Note 1), caryoynencin and sinapigladioside displayed antifungal activities against P. lilacinum (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the beetle symbionts provide a blend of chemical defence compounds against fungal pathogens and potential bacterial antagonists.

relative abundance within each chromatogram, but is not comparable among the green, black and blue profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the egg extracts, toxoflavin was detected in one of the three replicates, whereas lagriene and sinapigladioside were detected in all three replicates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Production of the compounds was independent of the exposure to P. lilacinum, and was not detected in the aposymbiotic controls in any of the replicates.Full size image', 'Ancestral plant-associated lifestyle of the symbionts', 'The finding that B. gladioli protects an insect was unexpected given that many B. gladioli strains are well-known plant pathogens21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we set out to investigate (1) whether the beetle symbionts evolved from plant-pathogenic ancestors, and (2) whether they retained the ability to successfully infect host plants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterization of the bacterial symbionts in Lagriinae beetles from Europe (Lagria hirta), Brazil (L. villosa), Japan (Lagria nigricollis, Lagria rufipennis and Lagria okinawana) and Australia (Ecnolagria sp.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  revealed the presence of B. gladioli in accessory glands of females in all six species (Fig 4d and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, considering also the morphological description of symbiont-bearing organs in numerous other Lagriinae species7, the association with B. gladioli is likely ancient and widespread in this beetle subfamily.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A 16S rRNA-based phylogeny revealed that the symbionts are interspersed within the monophyletic clade of plant-pathogenic B. gladioli, supporting the symbionts plant pathogenic ancestry (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of symbiont monophyly indicates thatdespite a considerable degree of symbiont specificity and a characterized route for vertical transmissionLagriinae beetles at least occasionally exchange B. gladioli strains with their environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: The

plants to female beetles and subsequent screening for Burkholderia indeed revealed the transfer of symbionts to the plant tissue (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, artificial infection of soybean with B. gladioli Lv-StA resulted in systemic infection (Supplementary Fig 22) and reduced seed production compared with water-treated controls (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concordantly, cotyledon assays revealed that soybean mounts a defence response against B. gladioli Lv-StA (Fig 4c and Supplementary Fig 23), showing that the plant recognizes the beetle symbiont as a pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is conceivable that toxoflavin production by Lv-StA is involved in plant pathogenicity, as has been previously demonstrated for B. gladioli and B. glumae22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the beetle is capable of transmitting its symbiotic B. gladioli to soybean plants, where the bacteria can reproduce, spread systemically and ultimately impact plant fitness, confirming that the bacteria maintain the potential to interact pathogenically with a plant host, as well as mutualistically with the beetle.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The defensive symbiosis with Burkholderia constitutes a potential key innovation in Lagriinae beetles for the protection of the vulnerable and immobile egg stage exposed to the soil environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that egg-surface contamination is a widespread route for symbiont transmission in insects24, this mechanism may have originally evolved for protection or at least may have been reinforced by the additional protective benefit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Symbiont-mediated egg defence is known for some marine crustaceans25, and immobile larval stages are symbiotically protected against pathogenic fungi in beewolves26 and leaf-rolling weevils27, indicating that the protection of immature animals through mutualistic microbes may be a common phenomenon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, the prolific production of a broad spectrum of secondary metabolites28 and the ability to engage in pathogenic or mutualistic interactions with a wide range of eukaryotic hosts29 may predispose members of the genus Burkholderia for defensive symbioses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The in vitro and genomics-guided metabolic profiling of the cultured Lagria symbiont as well as the chemical analysis of the reinfected beetle eggs revealed that the associated B. gladioli can provide a diverse antimicrobial armory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we provide evidence that secondary metabolite production is important for beetle protection and potentially also for plant pathogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the symbiont-mediated production of the four identified compounds and their fitness consequences for the beetle under field conditions remain to be assessed, and at present we cannot completely rule out the possibility that competitive exclusion or additional bioactive metabolites contribute to the symbionts protective effect on beetle eggs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our observation that a protective beetle symbiont evolved from plant pathogenic ancestors and retains the ability to infect the beetles host plant provides a plausible scenario for the evolutionary switch from pathogenicity to a dual lifestyle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are many examples of insect-vectored plant pathogens30, and some of these indirectly benefit their insect vector by altering plant physiology or suppressing plant defences30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the Lagriinae symbiosis is exceptional in that the symbionts are not only consistently associated with their insect host, but also provide a direct benefit to the insect that is independent of its plant pathogenic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide evidence for a transition from a plant pathogenic to an insect mutualistic lifestyle, and describe an ecological setting in which it likely occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They also support that such shifts are not necessarily unidirectional, but can be dynamic on both ecological and evolutionary timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our findings highlight arthropod-associated microbes as promising sources for novel bioactive compounds.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
