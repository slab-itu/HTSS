Clonal selection in the human V1 T cell repertoire indicates  TCR-dependent adaptive immune surveillance  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
' T cells are considered to be innate-like lymphocytes that respond rapidly to stress without clonal selection and differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use next-generation sequencing to probe how this paradigm relates to human V2neg T cells, implicated in responses to viral infection and cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevalent V1 T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is private and initially unfocused in cord blood, typically becoming strongly focused on a few high-frequency clonotypes by adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clonal expansions have differentiated from a naive to effector phenotype associated with CD27 downregulation, retaining proliferative capacity and TCR sensitivity, displaying increased cytotoxic markers and altered homing capabilities, and remaining relatively stable over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrastingly, V2+ T cells express semi-invariant TCRs, which are present at birth and shared between individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human V1+ T cells have therefore evolved a distinct biology from the V2+ subset, involving a central, personalized role for the  TCR in directing a highly adaptive yet unconventional form of immune surveillance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tcells have been preserved alongside  T cells and B cells over the last 450 million years of vertebrate evolution1, and are increasingly recognized as having important roles in immune responses to both microbial and non-microbial stress challenges2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although  T cells recognize target cells in an MHC-independent fashion, consistent with a lack of surface CD4/CD8 co-receptor expression, the key paradigms underpinning their distinct immunobiology are unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse studies have highlighted  T cell subsets bearing semi-invariant TCRs1,3,4,5, suggestive of an innate-like biology and a limited range of self-ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In humans the V2+ repertoire predominant in peripheral blood arguably conforms to this paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As for other unconventional lymphocyte populations in humans such as natural killer T (NKT) cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, V2+ T cells feature a conserved chain pairing (in the case of V2+ cells with V9), restricted CDR3 region diversity, comprising motifs conserved between many individuals6, and is generated early in gestation7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, there is strong evidence V2+ cells share a conserved biology, as they display potent TCR-dependent reactivity to pyrophosphate antigens generated by many species of bacteria/mycobacteria, with the butyrophilin-like molecule BTN3A1 a central player in antigen recognition8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The extent to which these ideas apply to the human V2neg repertoire, present in both blood and peripheral tissues, is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have highlighted a diverse variable (V) region usage for this subset, and a diverse range of ligands have also been proposed for  TCRs3, although to what extent they represent physiological reactivities is uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, some studies have highlighted the potential for TCR-independent effector functions9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, V2neg  T cells are implicated in immune responses to viral infection, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV)11,12, but also Epstein Barr virus13,14, and can also recognize a broad range of cancer cells15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One possibility is that within a seemingly diverse V2neg subset there exist conserved innate-like populations; however, a distinct biology underpinning V2neg  T cell stress responses might alternatively be involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Characterizing the V2neg TCR repertoire would enhance our understanding of this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we use next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches to define the V2neg repertoire from human peripheral blood, focusing on the predominant V1 subset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By comparing neonates and healthy CMV-seropositive/CMV-seronegative adults, we show that the V1 TCR repertoire is private, initially unfocused, and subsequently shaped by TCR-dependent clonal selection, concurrent with differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that a distinct mode of adaptive immune surveillance applies to the V1 subset, and raise further questions regarding the nature of the  TCR-linked stress challenges driving evolution of these responses in vivo.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'V2+ and V2neg T cell phenotype in human peripheral blood', 'We first characterized V2neg T cells in the peripheral blood of healthy adult donors selected for subsequent repertoire analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for possible effects of CMV status on phenotype12,16 we compared 10 CMV-seropositive and 10 CMV-seronegative donors, selecting individuals of a similar age (1830 years), as previous studies have highlighted age-related changes in the CMV-specific  T-cell repertoire17,18 and the  T-cell repertoire in general19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all individuals we detected V2+ and V2neg  T-cell populations (Fig 1a), the latter dominated by V1+ cells (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous studies, we observed a modestly increased proportion of V1+ cells in CMV+ individuals (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we noted the presence of a V9/V1 chain pairing in all individuals to varying degrees (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both V2neg T cells and the V1+ subsets of  T cells displayed a mixed CD27-/CD45RA+ or CD27+/CD45RA+ phenotype in most individuals (Supplementary Fig 1A,B), as previously described16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison, V2+ T cells were predominantly CD27+CD45RA (Supplementary Fig 1A,B), consistent with previous studies21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Peripheral blood  T-cell populations in donors analysed for  TCR repertoires.

successful purification of V1 T cells, nearly all TCR sequences obtained used V1 (Fig 2a); for TCR, consistent with flow cytometry (Fig 1a,d), V9 sequences were commonly prevalent (Fig 2a) and

CMVneg adults), remarkably strong focusing of the V1+ response was observed towards a small number of individual clonotypes (Fig 2b; Supplementary Fig 2E).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was evident for both TCR and TCR chains, and the majority of total error-corrected reads could be accounted for by a small number of the most prevalent clonotypes (10) (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCR D75 values (the percentage of unique sequences required to account for 75% of total reads) were  less_than 6% in this grouping (mean 2.23±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  0.53%), emphasising extreme skewing (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the V9/V1 populations consistently present were often highly clonally focused.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address whether this extreme clonotypic focusing was restricted to V1 sequences, we developed a negative selection strategy enabling analysis of the broader V2neg population (Supplementary Fig 3A,B), in four individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more diverse range of V sequences were observed in these analyses, including chiefly V3 and V8, with evidence of moderate clonotypic focusing in some individuals for V2neg, V1neg V chains (Supplementary Fig 3C), although these V regions were used in a small percentage of clonotypes in these donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast with this focused adult subgroup, dramatically less focused repertoires were observed in seven individuals (TCR D75 mean 14.95±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2.74%; in most cases the top 10 sequences represented  less_than 20% of the total error-corrected reads detected) and used a varied set of V gene segments (Fig 2d,e; Supplementary Fig 2D,F).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results establish that while not universal, extreme clonotypic focusing is a common feature of the V1 and V2neg  TCR repertoire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Applying a TCR D75 cut-off threshold of 6% (equivalent to the lowest quartile TCR D75 values), we defined this minority of individuals with higher D75 values as a diverse adult subgroup (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the average TCR D75 values and Shannon-Weiner index for CDR31 diversity highlighted a trend towards decreased diversity (lower TCR D75) in CMV+ versus CMVneg donors, the difference was not significant (Fig 2f, left; Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably the diverse adult donors were mostly (5/7) CMV seronegative (Fig 2c), and included the youngest members of the cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in mean TCR D75 values between adult focused and adult diverse donors was 7-fold (2.23±0.53 versus 14.95±2.74 respectively, P less_than

V2+ repertoire in four adults highlighted that while V1+ cells used various V and J gene segments, V2+ cells almost exclusively used V9 paired with JP (Supplementary Fig 6A,B), with CDR39 lengths of 1118 amino acids (3354 nt) (Fig 4c), and  greater than 50% of CDR3s composed of 14 amino acids in all donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, analysis of the ten most frequent TCR and TCR clonotypes in V2+ cells from each donor revealed constrained lengths in both CDR39 and CDR32 (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in V1+ cells the CDR3 and CDR3 lengths of the ten most frequent clonotypes, typically accounting for  greater than 50% of the repertoire, were extremely diverse both within and between individuals (Fig 4d, Supplementary Fig 6C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, multidimensional clustering analysis confirmed the TCR CDR3 length distributions of V2+ T cells were similar across different donors, whereas those of the V1 compartment were highly individual (Supplementary Fig 6D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, comparisons of the ten most prevalent TCR and TCR1 clonotypes from each donor revealed they were private sequences, absent in any other individuals either at a nucleotide or amino acid level (Supplementary Tables 25; Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, they frequently involved extremely complex CDR3 regions, comprising numerous N/P nucleotide additions (111 nt for TCR; 528 nt for TCR) in addition to D and J region nucleotides (Supplementary Tables 23), indicating rare recombination events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was particularly pronounced for the predominant V1 chains in each donor, which utilized 12 D regions and contained a mean of 16 N/P nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, after error correction, nearly all CDR3 and CDR3 sequences were found to be private.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The very few TCR and TCR clonotypes observed in  greater than 1 individual generally resulted from relatively simple recombination events with little N nt addition, and were low in frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of V1 repertoire data with age and sex matched TCR repertoire data revealed that V1 as a repertoire was even more private than TCR (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the V1 TCR repertoire was overwhelmingly private, with different TCR clonotypes present in each individual, and these observations also extended to non-V1 sequences in our V2neg  T cell analyses, suggesting it may be a generic property of the V2neg TCR repertoire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In contrast, several V2 subset-derived CDR3 protein sequences were shared between all four samples at a relatively high frequency (Fig 4g; Supplementary Fig 7A,B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These involved recombination of V9 and JP segments with limited N/P nucleotide addition (generally  less_than 3 nt) indicating their origin from convergent recombination23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  V9 sequences in V2+ cells were constrained in length (Fig 4c,d) and were more public than TCR, TCR chains and TCR in V1+ cells (Fig 4f), and often contained a typical 14 amino acid sequence motif (Supplementary Fig 7C)6,7,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although V2 sequences were relatively private compared with TCR (Fig 4f,g), more CDR32 sequences were shared between donors than CDR31 sequences (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously noted, CDR32 often contained a hydrophobic L or V residue at position 6 (Supplementary Fig 7D)24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, in stark contrast to V1+ T cells, but analogous to iNKT25 and MAIT26 populations, the V2V9 population expresses a semi-invariant TCR.

#@NEW_LINE#@#  We sorted sub-populations of V1+ cells based on expression of CD27 and CD45RA, markers that have been used to identify naïve and memory subsets in CD8 cells27 and  T cells16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly we observed the vast majority of clonal populations resided in CD27lo/neg- CD45RA+ populations (gates C and D), whereas clonotypes found in CD27hi populations (gates A and B) were strikingly diverse (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, when applying a CD27hi and CD27lo/neg gating strategy to individuals with focused V1 TCR repertoires, they displayed a dominant CD27lo/neg CD45RA+ phenotype but also retained a minor CD27hi population, whereas V1 T cells of both cord blood, and V1 diverse adults, were predominantly CD27hi (Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, focused donors had elevated percentages of V1+/CD27lo/neg cells compared with diverse and cord blood donors (Fig 5f, left).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the percentage of CD27lo/neg cells each donor displayed inversely correlated with the TCR D75 and Chao 1 indices of V1 diversity (Fig 5f, right panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These correlations suggested that V1 TCR repertoire focusing was accompanied by transition of V1+ T cells from a CD27hi CD45RA+ to a CD27lo/neg CD45RA+ phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this directly, we sorted V1+ CD27hi versus CD27lo/neg populations from two focused adult donors and performed NGS TCR repertoire analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This unequivocally confirmed that the V1+/CD27hi population displayed a diverse TCR repertoire, generating TCR repertoires and TCR D75 values similar to cord blood and diverse adult donors, whereas the V1+/CD27lo/neg population was comprised of even more pronounced dominant TCR clonotypes (Fig 5g), compared with each donors original TCR repertoire profile (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inter-individual comparisons revealed the majority of V1+CD27hi T cells expressed other markers typical of naïve CD8 T cell populations including IL-7R, CD28, and CCR7 and CD62L, while V1+/CD27lo/neg cells had downregulated surface expression of these markers similarly to memory CD8 compartments (Fig 5h) (reviewed in Akbar and Fletcher, 2005)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although CD45RA and CD27 have been used before to assign  memory compartments16,21, our CD27hi versus CD27lo/neg gating strategy represents a new approach to immunophenotyping V1 populations, which more closely aligns naïve/effector marker expression to V1 TCR diversity/clonality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'V1+CD27lo/neg clones respond to IL-15 and TCR stimulation', 'Comparisons of the functional responsiveness of total V1 T-cell subsets indicated robust CD3/CD28-dependent activation equivalent to CD8+ T cells and V2+  T cells (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, V1+ CD27lo/neg T cells displayed a markedly enhanced responsiveness to both CD3/CD28 and IL-15 relative to CD27hi V1 T cells after short-term stimulation (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, and unlike V2+ T cells, V1+ T cells were largely unresponsive to the innate T cell trophic IL-18 or IL-12 cytokines (Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with their high IL-7R expression (Fig 5g), CD27hi V1 subsets proliferated preferentially in response to IL-7 stimulation relative to CD27lo/neg V1 populations, whereas the latter displayed more pronounced IL-15-induced proliferation (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, single cell PCR confirmed that cells that proliferated (that is, became CFSElo) in 7-day IL-7 cultures predominantly expressed diverse TCRs, irrespective of whether V1 T cells were analysed

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
' T cells have been highlighted as a key cellular exemplar of lymphoid stress surveillance, which invokes unconventional lymphocytes that can quickly initiate responses to stress challenges without the obligatory delay associated with clonal expansion and differentiation28, a paradigm thought to apply to some murine  TCR subsets29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although V2+ cells increase in number upon microbial challenge30, they arguably fit this paradigm7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how it applies to human V2neg T cells has to date remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our findings expose several features of V1 T cells, which comprise the dominant proportion of V2neg T cells, that differ fundamentally from this paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of being pre-expanded, in most adults a small number of specific clonotypes emerge from an initially unfocused neonatal V1 T-cell repertoire, undergo pronounced clonal expansion, and ultimately dominate the V1  T-cell compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, such clonotypic expansions were relatively stable over time, and their occurrence was not an inevitable consequence of a maturing  T-cell compartment, as a sizeable minority of adults had largely unfocused repertoires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CDR3 sequences of dominant clonotypes were extremely complex, suggesting heavy selection of initially low frequency clonotypes resulting from single, unlikely recombination events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, V1 TCR sequences observed were, overwhelmingly, unique to each individual, indicating the V2neg repertoire, including dominantly expanded clonotypes, is essentially private.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, analyses highlighted V9/V2 cells shared sequences in TCR and (to a lesser extent) TCR, confirming this subset featured a semi-invariant TCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly V1 clonal expansion was accompanied by phenotypic differentiation and a distinct functional biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfocused adult TCR repertoires were associated with apparently naïve V1 populations characterized by a CD27hiCCR7+CD28+IL-7R+CD62L+ phenotype evident in all individuals but predominant in the diverse adult subgroup; moreover, cord blood V1 cells largely conformed to this phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, clonally expanded populations were analogous to CD8 T effectors in displaying a CD27lo/negCCR7negCD62LloCD28negIL-7Rneg phenotype, and similarly were marked out by CX3CR1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to CD27hi V1+ cells, CD27lo/neg V1 subsets displayed more rapid activation and proliferation in response to CD3/TCR stimulation, upregulation of multiple cytotoxic markers equivalent to CD8 EMRA subsets, differential cytokine responsiveness (enhanced to IL-15 and a lack of response to IL-7), and differential homing receptor expression, consistent with a functional effector status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, CD27hi V1+ T cells were responsive to IL-7, expressed secondary lymphoid homing receptors, displayed relatively slow proliferation kinetics after TCR stimulation, and largely lacked expression of perforin/granzymes, consistent with a functionally naïve status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings reveal a fundamentally adaptive biology for V1 T cells, and suggest the  TCR has a central role in driving this biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While they do not formally exclude the possibility that stochastic processes could explain the expansions we observe, they strongly support a model involving clonal selection of naïve V1 T cells that express functionally useful TCRs enabling responses to microbial/non-microbial stress challenges encountered, accompanied by differentiation to an effector phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They argue against the idea that V1 clonotypic focusing merely represents an immunological imprint of past stress challenges, and instead are more suggestive of long-lived, highly specific, functional  T-cell memory that enables augmented responses to recurrent stress challenges, akin to classical immunological memory, although importantly, not MHC-restricted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The model outlined above shares several key tenets with classical adaptive immunity, but differs critically in being MHC-unrestricted, and represents an unconventional mode of adaptive immune surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although one limitation of our study is that it focuses predominantly on V1 T cells, our repertoire data highlight that V3 and V8 populations exhibited a degree of clonotypic focusing and were equivalently private to V1 repertoires, suggesting the biology we observe for V1 T cells could also apply to other human V2neg T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in several key respects this model does not apply to V9/V2 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to V1 populations our V9/V2 TCR repertoire data confirm highly restricted CDR3 lengths, including prevalent V9 sequences of limited complexity that were common to multiple individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these data, Dimova et al.7 detected prevalent V9 sequences that were present at birth in multiple individuals, irrespective of pathogen exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations are consistent with a semi-invariant, innate-like biology for the V9/V2 subset that is in keeping with their polyclonal activation by pyrophosphate antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a confluence of features we observe in V1 T cells, which include profound clonotypic expansions of often highly complex TCRs from an initially completely unfocused, private repertoire, and concomitant phenotypic differentiation involving loss of secondary lymphoid homing markers and upregulation of effector molecules, point to a very different adaptive biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This model raises a number of questions, including regarding V1positive T-cell homing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of naïve CD27hi V1 subsets expressed both CCR7 and CD62L, suggesting they may access secondary or alternatively tertiary lymphoid organs, and may become primed there before differentiating to CD27lo/neg effectors, which are CCR7neg CD62Llo, but also display CX3CR1 upregulation, which may affect peripheral or endothelial homing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How this transition occurs is unclear, however conceivably dendritic cells, which prime  T-cell responses, may also prime MHC-independent V1 responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How our results relate to V2neg development in solid tissues, where they represent the dominant  T-cell subset, is unclear, but could potentially involve central or local priming events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the kinetics of V2neg T-cell responses merit further investigation, but might parallel those of conventional  T-cell adaptive responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the stress challenges underlying V2neg clonotypic focusing are uncertain, one obvious possibility is infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although V2neg T-cell responses have been strongly linked with CMV infection11,15 they are not limited to this setting, since we found CMV-seronegative individuals also exhibited extreme clonotypic focusing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies assessing in parallel V2neg TCR repertoire focusing and microbial exposure, including during stress stimuli such as acute CMV infection, will shed light on how V2neg adaptive immune surveillance operates during relevant infectious challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model would predict a small number of previously low frequency clonotypes may become heavily expanded during/after such challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, dissecting the reasons why some adults retain largely unfocused, naive V1 repertoires is important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although differential pathogen exposure may be one factor, holes might conceivably exist in the V1 TCR repertoires of certain individuals, resulting in an inability to respond to a specific pathogen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, while we introduced a binary delineation of our cohort into focused and diverse individuals, both CD27hi and CD27lo/neg V1 subpopulations were present in all individuals, highlighting both the universal nature of the adaptive biology we observe and also the fact that in reality there is likely to be a continuous spectrum of diversity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding when clonotypic focusing occurs in life is clearly important, including in neonates, when conventional adaptive immunity is less potent and  T-cell responses may play an important role31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are required to more comprehrensively explore V1 repertoire focusing throughout life, and how this links with pathogen exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'How V2neg adaptive immune surveillance relates to  TCR ligand recognition merits consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the focusing we observe is highly CDR3-specific, even within the same chain pairing combination, we hypothesize it results from TCR ligand-dependent selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identity of ligands for such specificities is largely unclear (see below), but might include self-encoded and/or foreign proteins3,33,34,35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, although the private TCR repertoires we observe may reflect reactivities restricted to each individual, they do not formally exclude the possibility of degenerate recognition of conserved ligands by diverse TCRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Studies on V2neg T cells have highlighted a diverse and somewhat confusing range of TCR ligands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these ligands highlight the broad recognition capabilities of the V2neg  TCR, their physiological importance is less clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For future studies, our model strongly suggests that natural in vivo expansion and phenotypic differentiation may be important considerations in assessing the biological relevance of proposed  TCR ligands to adaptive immune surveillance by V2neg T cells, and for prioritising clonotypes for ligand identification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this perspective, while unequivocal binding and/or structural data have been determined for phycoerythrin (PE) - and CD1d-reactive V2neg TCRs33,35,37, both PE and CD1d reagents published to date stain a small percentage ( less_than 0.1%) of V1 T cells in peripheral blood in the absence of in vitro expansion, and the naïve/effector phenotype of such cells is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While such cells clearly do not represent dominantly expanded blood clonotypes, reactive populations could be preferentially localized to solid tissues or be lipid-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analogy, notably CD1d-restricted iNKTs comprise a minor component of  T cells in peripheral blood but are highly prevalent in liver38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, conceivably expanded clonotypes could recognize particular CD1d-presented lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies are required to resolve these questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this context,  TCR specificities present on V2neg T cells naturally expanded during infection, which include the LES36 and POS4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39) TCRs, may be particularly relevant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The LES TCR, which directly binds Endothelial Protein C Receptor36, conceivably represents a molecular exemplar of V2neg adaptive immune surveillance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Naturally expanded during acute CMV infection to20% of total T cells, the LES clone was CD28negCD45ROneg, suggestive of an effector phenotype40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, the LES TCR utilizes a highly complex TCR rearrangement (incorporating 14 N/P additions) and a simpler TCR chain, typical of many of the V2neg dominant clonotypes we observed in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However LES TCR exact sequences were not observed in any individual from our cohort, and at least the CDR3 region of the LES TCR chain has been highlighted as important for LES/EPCR ligand binding36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations not only indicate the LES TCR was private to the individual in which it originated, but, raise the possibility that reactivity to EPCR might also be private, consistent with failure of previous attempts to identify reactivity to EPCR in other individuals36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The V8V1 POS4 TCR, also derived from a clonotype expanded in acute foetal CMV infection39, would superficially appear to conflict with this study, as it was observed in multiple individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tellingly, POS4 is exceptional in comprising CDR3 and CDR3 both resulting from recombination of germline-encoded segments without any N/P nt addition (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest this TCR is preferentially generated in gestation before TdT is expressed at 20 weeks41, and that its expansion during acute infection may reflect recognition of an important CMV-associated (although not necessarily CMV-encoded) ligand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, while our data stress the overwhelmingly private nature of the V2neg TCR repertoire, the POS4 TCR clonotype, because of its generation and expansion in utero, may be the exception that proves the rule, relative to most adult peripheral TCR sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pre-expanded, semi-invariant T cells such as MAIT, iNKT and some  T-cell subsets, as well as NK cells, may permit rapid responses to stress challenges such as pathogen infection, before conventional adaptive immunity has time to develop28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What advantage would a parallel V2neg adaptive immune surveillance system provide, involving clonal selection of private TCR clonotypes from a diverse repertoire?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possibilities include the potential for amplification of the stress response, and immunological memory to recurrent stress stimuli, both justifying further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, the system may permit diverse routes to recognition of altered self.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One potential paradigm was suggested by LES reactivity to EPCR, which enabled functional reactivity to CMV-infected endothelial cells (a key target for CMV infection in vivo) via a TCR-extrinsic, CMV-induced multimolecular stress signature36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However additional paradigms will no doubt emerge from identification of further ligands for clonotypes naturally expanded in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, another important consideration is the protection from pathogen immune escape mechanisms provided by V2neg adaptive immune surveillance versus stress sensing by alternative routes such as innate immune subsets, NK cells, and semi-invariant T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, these alternative cell types rely on conserved germline-encoded receptors/ligands such as PRRs that sense PAMPs/DAMPs, NKG2D that recognizes MHC-like stress antigens, and MHC-like molecules such as MR1/CD1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, there is strong evidence for pathogen escape from both PRRs42 and NKG2D43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Morever, CD1 molecules recognized by NKT cells, like class I MHC molecules themselves, are targeted by various viral proteins44, and MAIT cells are decreased in HIV45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the evolution of a parallel adaptive immune surveillance system, involving a radically different biology centred on clonal amplification from within a diverse, private V2neg antigen receptor repertoire, and potentially exploiting diverse ligands private to each individual, may provide a much greater challenge for pathogens to evade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'V2neg T cells are strongly implicated in pathogen-specific11 and anti-tumour immunity46, and are the subject of increasing immunotherapeutic interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three aspects of the adaptive biology we outline here have translational relevance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Firstly, major differences in the ability of specific, private V2neg  TCRs to mediate physiologically relevant antigen recognition events would open the possibility of identifying and exploiting optimal V2neg TCR clonotypes (for example, via T-cell engineering), to enhance pathogen/cancer-specific immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Secondly, the longevity of dominant clonotypes suggests interaction of vaccination approaches with V2neg immune surveillance merits further investigation, and might be manipulable to enhance vaccine protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a greater understanding of the relationship between different V2neg TCR ligands, their mode of recognition, tissue expression and regulation/dysregulation, will undoubtedly provide novel therapeutic avenues and insights.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Note added in proof: Consistent with the suggestion that viral infection may be one stress challenge that drives clonal expansions in the V2-negative compartment, a recent study from Ravens et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and published in Nature Immunology (doi: 10.1038/ni.3686) has highlighted clonotypic  T cell expansions following CMV reactivation after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
