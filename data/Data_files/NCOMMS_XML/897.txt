Conformational changes in intact dengue virus reveal serotype-specific expansion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) alone undergoes structural expansion at 37 °C (associated with host entry), despite high sequence and structural homology among the four known serotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The basis for this differential expansion across strains and serotypes is unknown and necessitates mapping of the dynamics of dengue whole viral particles to describe their coordinated motions and conformational changes when exposed to host-like environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we capture the dynamics of intact viral particles of two serotypes, DENV1 and DENV2, by amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) and time resolved Förster Resonance Energy Transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show temperature-dependent dynamics hotspots on DENV2 and DENV1 particles with DENV1 showing expansion at 40 °C but not at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDXMS measurement of virion dynamics in solution offers a powerful approach to identify potential epitopes, map virus-antibody complex structure and dynamics, and test effects of multiple host-specific perturbations on viruses and virus-antibody complexes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), is a major global challenge with 390 million estimated infections annually1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are four distinct serotypes of DENV and infection by one serotype does not confer immunity against heterologous serotypes2 but may instead cause a more severe and life-threatening form of dengue infection through antibody-dependent enhancement3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there is a commercially available vaccine, its efficacy is poor4 and there are no alternative therapeutics3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DENV is a member of the Flaviviridae family and is transmitted to humans via the bite of a mosquito vector (Aedes sp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of mosquitoes)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mature viral particle consists of a single stranded RNA genome, a lipid bilayer membrane and a structural proteome consisting of three proteins: capsid (C), envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E- and M-proteins form the outermost viral shell with 180 copies arranged in icosahedral symmetry9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amphipathic stem and transmembrane helices of the E- and M-proteins help anchor them to the lipid bilayer10 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  C-protein is present inside the viral particle and complexed with viral genomic RNA11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Temperature-dependent changes in DENV1 and 2 accompanying

temperature, pH and hostprotein interactions, among others12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these, temperature represents one of the important triggers in initiating the infectious phase of the DENV virus upon host cell entry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in temperature during vector (28 °C) to host (37 °C) transmission has been shown to trigger variable degrees of structural transitions across all four dengue serotypes and is most prominent in strains of DENV2, as smooth to rough surface transitions13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, serotypes DENV1, 3 and 4, show no observable changes between these temperatures from cryo-EM studies (Fig 1)15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences in temperature-induced structural transitions are intriguing due to the high sequence similarity ( greater than 60%) in their scaffold E-proteins13,14,15,16,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although cryo-EM structures of viral particles describe the viral envelope and symmetry10,19 at 28 and 37 °C, they only represent a single stable endpoint state and offer limited predictive insights into its large-scale temperature and other host-specific perturbation-dependent transitions12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low resolution (13 Å) of the expanded DENV2 (New Guinea-C (NGC)) structure at 37 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13) precludes high resolution identification and mapping of the expanded state within the E- and M-proteins, while the moderately high resolution structure (4.5 Å) of DENV1 (PVP159) at 28 °C (and 37 °C) does not permit identification of localized domain movements within E- and M-proteins between these temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high sequence and structural homology of DENV1 and DENV2 at 28 °C does not provide any apparent correlation between sequence/structural assembly13,14 and the observed differential temperature-dependent expansion in DENV2 and DENV1 in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This necessitates a thermodynamic description of the whole viral particle in solution at separate temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) captures thermodynamic transitions of proteins by measuring the increment in mass when backbone amide hydrogens exchange with solvent deuterium20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The extent of HDX is dependent on hydrogen bonding and solvent accessibility of the protein22,23, without the limitation of size/quaternary assembly24, at the seconds and slower time scales22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In order to describe the differences in temperature-induced expansion, we used DENV1 (PVP 159) and DENV2 (NGC) for carrying out HDXMS on intact viral particles at 28, 37 and 40 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV1 and DENV2 in the rest of the manuscript refer specifically to PVP159 and NGC strains, respectively.

structures of individual components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next tracked the expansion process in DENV using time resolved Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) to determine the temperature threshold for the transition and to monitor the cooperativity of temperature-dependent expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dual fluorescence labelled (E-protein and lipid bilayer) DENV particles were used as TR-FRET probes across a temperature range from 25 to 40 °C to track their expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that DENV2, at 37 °C, shows temperature-specific differences due to specific assemblies of E-protein on the viral particle and highlight the importance of quaternary contacts in virions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, DENV1 showed no expansion at 37 °C and exhibited a different expansion profile at 40 °C, with a different set of temperature-specific loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, TR-FRET measurements revealed a transition in temperature-dependence of expansion in DENV2 from 25 to 37 °C, while DENV1 expansion occurred only at 40 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus a combination of HDXMS and TR-FRET indicate the importance of viral assembly and conformational dynamics to explain differential host-specific responses in structurally similar viral strains and offer powerful insights into viral dynamics and temperature-dependent expansion of DENV2 and DENV1.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Amide hydrogen deuterium exchange of whole dengue particles', 'In order to capture temperature-induced changes in the two dengue serotypes: Purified DENV1 (PVP 159) and DENV2 (NGC), intact, infectious viral particles were equilibrated at 28, 37 or 40 °C as specified, for 30 min and deuterium exchange was then initiated by 10-fold dilution in deuterated buffer (aqueous buffer reconstituted in D2O) to result in a final deuterium oxide concentration of 90% (refer methods, Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deuterium exchange was carried out for 1 min and the exchange reaction was quenched by rapidly lowering pHread to 2.5 followed by complete proteolysis by online pepsin, chromatographic separation and mass over charge (m/z) determination of all pepsin fragmented peptides as described in methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequencing of C, E and M-peptides yielded sequence coverages of 20, 77.2 and 56% for each of the constituent proteins, respectively, from DENV2 and 28, 71.7 and 45.3% for each of the constituent proteins, respectively, from DENV1 (Supplementary Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deuterium exchange was calculated by subtracting centroid masses of deuterium exchanged peptides for each time point from that of undeuterated peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Isotopic mass envelopes of selected peptides are shown in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mass shifts provided a readout of the average numbers of deuterons exchanged at a given time point of exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative deuterium exchange for each pepsin fragment peptide was calculated as a ratio of observed exchange to maximum exchangeable amide hydrogens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mass spectral envelopes were typical of EX2 deuterium exchange kinetics25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A relative fractional

image', 'Our initial experiments showed no increases in deuterium exchange for time points from 1 min up to 60 min (Supplementary Fig 3), suggesting that 1 min of deuterium exchange offered an optimal window for capturing temperature-specific perturbations on DENV2 particles (Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence deuterium exchange at 1 min for both DENV2 and DENV1 particles across all pepsin fragmentation peptides allowed effective mapping of temperature-specific effects on intact viral particles at all temperatures tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the 180 copies of the E-protein are organized with icosahedral symmetry resulting in 12 five-fold vertices, 20 three-fold faces and 30 two-fold edges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative deuterium exchange profiles as well as temperature-dependent differences can be assumed to represent averages of all 180 E-proteins on the virus surface of all viral particles within a sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative exchange across each of the asymmetry units was not different as inferred from the absence of multimodal isotopic envelope profiles or lack of broadening of isotopic envelope profiles for any of the peptides from DENV1 and DENV2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative deuterium exchange of the E-protein (Fig 2a,b,c) mapped onto the cryo-EM structure of the unexpanded DENV2 and DENV1 (Fig 2d) at 28 °C was used to generate a heat-map, which highlighted striking differences between DENV1 and DENV2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, deuterium exchange of E-protein on DENV2 was greater compared to the deuterium exchange of E-protein on DENV1 at 28 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peptides spanning glycosylation sites (N67 and N153) on DENV2 E-protein (residues 57-69, 152-163) showed the largest exchange relative to the other fragment peptides (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, peptides spanning equivalent glycosylation sites in DENV1 (residues 54-69, 152-173) did not show higher exchange relative to the rest of the protein (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to E-protein, peptides from C- and M-proteins from both DENV serotypes also showed greater relative deuterium exchange in DENV2 relative to DENV1 at 28 °C (Supplementary Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DENV2 expansion at 37 °C', 'Changes upon temperature-induced expansion (2837 °C) of DENV2 were monitored by comparing differences in deuterium exchange at 28 and 37 °C for all peptides across the E-, M- and C-proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the asymmetry unit arrangements are highly similar across DENV2 at both 28 and 37 °C (Fig 1), any differences in exchange between the two temperatures would cancel out any ensemble averaging effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our readout provides an absolute magnitude difference in temperature-dependent exchange that is independent of asymmetry unit-dependent ensemble averaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It should be noted that temperature alters intrinsic rates of amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange, as reported in previous studies26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these studies on unfolded model peptides, we estimated the intrinsic rate of HDX to be2.3-fold greater at 37 °C compared to 28 °C (detailed in Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed increases in deuterium exchange at 37 °C would therefore represent a composite of the intrinsic increases in deuterium exchange rate as a function of temperature together with temperature-dependent conformational changes accompanying DENV2 expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We reasoned that for our intact protein and viral particle HDXMS analyses, this 2.3X magnitude increase in intrinsic rates of deuterium exchange would account for a relatively minor contribution to the measured difference in deuterium exchange between DENV at higher and lower temperatures at times of 1 min and longer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would be expected since the predicted decrease in protection factors in DENV2 with temperature-dependent expansion would be greater relative to this 2.3-fold increase in intrinsic deuterium exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To experimentally confirm this, we carried out test studies with HDXMS on post-pepsin hydrolysed unassembled E-protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all peptides we were unable to detect observable differences in centroid values between 28 and 37 °C (Supplementary Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further control experiments comparing deuterium exchange measurements on DENV2 labelled for 26 s at 37°C with that for 1 min at 28°C established that the estimated 2.3-fold effects of temperature on intrinsic exchange were within the s.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of deuterium exchange measurements and experimental conditions as well as the 0.5 Dalton significance threshold for defining temperature-specific changes (Supplementary Note 2, Supplementary Figs 5,6a,b, Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirmed that our measurements under our experimental conditions reported the effects of temperature-dependent expansion of DENV alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Temperature-dependent increases in deuterium exchange were observed in specific loci across all three structural proteins of DENV2 and correlated with expansion of the virus structure at 37 °C (Fig 3a,b and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temperature-specific differences in deuterium exchange within the E-protein (Fig 3a) align according to the interdimer and intradimer interfaces in the viral surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loci showing greater deuterium exchange were mapped onto regions in all ectodomains (I, II, III) of E-protein and included the amphipathic stem helices as well as the transmembrane helices (Fig 3a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Domain II showed the largest temperature-specific differences that were localized to overlapping peptides spanning residues 78-107 and 238-278 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intradimeric interface of E-protein (238-260) in domain II exhibited the greatest difference in deuterons exchanged between 28 and 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This large increase in deuterons exchanged is indicative of disruption of the interdomain interface upon expansion13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

second and third stem helices (431-448) and transmembrane helices (465-486) also showed large increases in deuterium exchange at 37 °C (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the first stem helix and

specific to DENV1 alone (Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping these temperature-specific loci onto the respective cryo-EM structures of DENV2 and DENV1 revealed that the largest temperature-dependent increases in deuterium exchange were localized to separate E-protein quaternary contacts along the icosahedral axes between DENV2 and DENV1 (Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In DENV2, the E-intradimeric

that lies along the five-fold and three-fold vertices exhibited the greatest temperature-dependent increases in deuterium exchange between 28/37 and 40 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reveals that the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Viral particles in solution are coordinated dynamic entities that respond to diverse perturbations through their lifecycle, such as temperature, pH, hostprotein interactions, among others12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDXMS offers a powerful method to probe dynamics in solution of intact viral particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By applying HDXMS on two DENV serotypes exhibiting varying temperature-dependent responses, we have captured the equilibrium conformational changes in DENV2 and DENV1 and their constituent proteins in their native state, which encompass proteinprotein contacts as well as interactions with genomic RNA and lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has allowed a delineation of temperature-dependent expansion from viral breathing, through parallel analysis of all three DENV structural proteome constituents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparative analysis of unassembled and viral E-protein points to important quaternary effects on E-protein packing in modulating dengue viral dynamics and interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strain and serotype-specific expansion of DENV2 and DENV1 were also confirmed with TR-FRET and revealed that DENV2 shows transition in temperature-dependent expansion from 25 to 37 °C with no further changes at 40 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV1 in contrast showed expansion only at 40 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The RFU mapped onto the E-protein on intact DENV2 shows unsurprisingly, a non-uniform pattern highlighting dynamic hotspots on the viral surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed deuterium exchange to an equivalent extent within the M-protein and to a lesser extent in the C-protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the intact virion as a highly dynamic assembly with unobstructed solvent access to M- and C-proteins, despite being invisible from surface maps of whole viral particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the different regions of the E-protein are equally solvent exposed on the surface of the virus, their deuterium uptake values are non-uniform and this is indicative of the importance of H-bonding contributions and quaternary contacts to rates of deuterium uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the two respective strains from the two serotypes of DENV1 and DENV2 show that despite homologous viral assembly, structure and protein sequences, there are large differences in thermodynamic stability and also in their response to diverse environmental perturbations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DENV at 37 °C represents the physiologically relevant form of the virus as it enters the human host during infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At later stages of dengue infection, DENV is further exposed to temperatures as high as 40 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These temperature switches enhance viral protein dynamics that drive large rearrangements of the structural proteome and is most apparent in the cryo-EM structure of expanded DENV2 at 37 °C (refs 13, 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our HDXMS studies revealed that the dimer interface showed the largest temperature-dependent increases in deuterium exchange in DENV2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Careful analysis of the cryo-EM structure of the temperature-expanded virus particle13 also shows that the dimer interfaces are broken in the B-dimer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the pentamer shows the smallest differences and is the relatively more stable symmetry unit (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cryo-EM structure also shows minimal differences in this pentamer assembly after expansion (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These temperature-specific loci are in contrast to those observed in DENV1 at 40 °C where the largest temperature-dependent increases in deuterium exchange were observed at interaction interfaces along the three- and five-fold vertices (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results hold important implications in considering viral particles as integrated thermodynamic units with separate energy thresholds for their expansion governed by a combination of sequence and structural contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DENV1 with lower thermal protein fluctuations at 28 °C requires a higher temperature trigger to expand, while DENV2 is more dynamic and expands at 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that the asymmetry unit arrangements are highly similar across DENV2 at both 28 and 37 °C, any contribution of ensemble averaging on differences in exchange between the two temperatures would be cancelled out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our readout provides an absolute magnitude difference in exchange with temperature that is independent of asymmetry unit-dependent ensemble averaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is corroborated by our observation of no temperature-dependent effects up to 37 °C across DENV1, which has an identical asymmetry unit distribution as DENV2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the changes in deuterium exchange in DENV2 at 37 °C solely report on conformational changes alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It should be noted that structures of DENV1 and DENV2 show all 180 copies of the E-protein in a virion, uniformly arranged into symmetry units (12 pentamers: 20 trimers: 30 dimers), resulting in an equimolar (1:1:1) distribution of E-protein units into five-fold, three-fold and two-fold vertices, at both 28 and 37 °C temperatures13 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The RFU of all peptides from intact DENV2 and DENV1, but not the difference in deuterium exchange with temperature, can be assumed to represent ensemble averages from all three contributing asymmetry units across all DENV peptides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For peptides mediating equivalent quaternary interactions across the icosahedral axes, there would be no signal averaging observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, for peptides mediating differential contacts across asymmetry units, signal averaging would need to be factored in absolute deuterium exchange measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the intradimeric interface of E-protein, common across all 90 E-protein dimers in the virion is independent of the icosahedral arrangement, and there would be no contribution of averaging to deuterium exchange measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas, an E-protein peptide from DIII in A, B and C arrangements within an asymmetric unit (Fig 2b,c) would show context-dependent differences in deuterium exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would be attributable to unique contacts mediated by the same peptide in five-fold, five-foldthree-fold interface and the three-fold vertices contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the overall deuterium exchange measured for every constituent virion peptide represents a variable average that is a function of the unique quaternary contacts that each peptide possibly mediates in the context of its position within the symmetry unit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If large differences in basal deuterium exchange for a given peptide in each symmetry unit were likely, these would be detected as multimodal isotopic distributions in deuterium exchanged samples, indicative of EX1 kinetics25,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smaller differences would be evident as extended isotopic envelope distribution patterns due to overlapping exchange of closely exchanging species, indicative of EXX deuterium exchange kinetics29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected no multimodal isotopic envelopes in any of the virion peptides from DENV1/DENV2, indicating no large differences in exchange in peptides mediating contacts across symmetry units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A closer spectral width analysis of isotopic envelopes in deuterium exchanged peptides from DENV1 and DENV2 and compared to homogenous unassembled E-protein showed no peptides with atypical spectral widths (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HDXMS thus offers a powerful tool for analysis of dynamics in intact viral particles to map temperature-dependent differential expansion in dengue and other flaviviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects of perturbations would be readily interpretable when there are no perturbation-dependent changes in asymmetry unit distributions, as ensemble averaging effects would cancel out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When representing HDXMS results on viral structures, it is important to take into consideration the unique orientation and surface display of different regions of proteins in each asymmetric unit and any attendant distortion of HDXMS results due to their arrangement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, if a surface is visible in only one out of three asymmetry units in DENV2 and shows large differences in deuterium exchange with temperature, differences in exchange in this peptide would appear to be disproportionately higher than another peptide showing equivalent magnitude difference in deuterium exchange, but hidden from the surface in the two other asymmetry units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for localizing regions showing the largest magnitude differences without any distortion from the structure itself, it is important to first identify and rank these on the basis of HDXMS difference plots, rather than base it on maps of HDXMS results on a composite structure, such as that of a virus with multiple substructural units.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among the four serotypes of DENV, the intradimeric interactions of E-protein was predicted to be weakest in DENV2 NGC strain while the interactions between E-proteins along the five-fold and three-fold vertices were predicted to be weakest in DENV1 PVP 159 strain based on cryo-EM16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, we observed at peptide resolution that these loci of weaker interactions displayed the greatest temperature-specific differences in the respective DENV2 (NGC) and DENV1 (PVP 159).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations that these temperature-dependent differences are observed only in the whole viral particle but not in the E-protein in solution further emphasized the important contributions of quaternary contacts and interactions with other viral biomolecular constituents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the strengths of quaternary interactions have been hypothesized to impact the stability of flaviviruses30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Epitope accessibility is one of the primary factors affecting the potency of neutralizing antibodies31 and the rates and extent of viral structural transitions influences the degree of epitope accessibility, which in turn are dependent upon the underlying dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many antibodies against flaviviruses exhibit characteristic time and temperature-dependent binding and neutralization32,33,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monoclonal antibodies targeting partially or entirely cryptic epitopes on DIII of E-protein such as 1A1D-2, 4E11, 2H12 and E111 (refs 32, 35, 36, 37) are among the best characterized temperature-dependent antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These antibodies share overlapping epitopes mostly spanning variable regions on DIII A (306-314), B (320-326), D 347-351), E (365-371) and G (387-393) strands with the exception of E111, whose predominant epitopes are localized to strands Cx (332-334) and C (336-341).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All peptides spanning each of these characterized epitopes above in both DENV serotypes showed temperature-dependent changes in deuterium exchange (Fig 5), which is consistent with the increased binding seen at higher temperatures32,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly in both DENV1 and DENV2, the magnitude of deuterium exchange in possible non-homologous, cryptic epitopes differed at lower vector-specific temperatures (28 °C) relative to the human host (37/40 °C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  E111, a DENV1-specific mAb, showed a large (20-fold) enhancement in binding and neutralization at 40 °C relative to 37 °C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32), which strongly corroborated our findings showing differential expansion of DENV1 at 40 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We further examined the effects of temperature-dependent changes on the E-dimer dependent epitopes (EDE) that are recognized by an important class of broadly neutralizing and highly potent antibodies38,39 in both DENV1 and DENV2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EDEs are constituted by the  strand (67-74), fusion loop (97-106) and ij loop (246-249) in DII from one E-monomer and the 150 loop (148-159) from the adjacent E-protein subunit38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, temperature-dependent increases in deuterium exchange were observed in peptides spanning the fusion loop, ij loop and the 150 loop in both DENV1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicated that the conformation of these epitope sites is likely altered with DENV1 and DENV2 expansion and may influence the binding of these antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, in DENV2, the greatest temperature-dependent increase in deuterium exchange was observed at the E-intradimeric interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the EDEs across the E-dimers may be spatially separated in the expanded DENV2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless, EDE antibodies are broadly neutralizing against all DENV serotypes and including the thermally stable Zika virus40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this possibly suggests that these EDE antibodies exert neutralizing effects against all DENV serotypes and Zika virus through multiple mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mapping the epitopes of these antibodies on whole DENV particles by HDXMS under various host-specific temperature perturbations will reveal in greater detail the mechanisms of antibody action by this important class of antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structures of free viruses do not offer predictive insights into potential antibody binding sites and this represents a limitation of current structural biology tools.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structural studies together with HDXMS measurement of virion dynamics in solution offer a powerful combinatorial approach to identify potential epitopes, map virus-antibody complex structure and dynamics, and test effects of multiple host-specific perturbations including temperature, pH and osmolality on viruses and virus-antibody complexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, HDXMS offers a powerful new probe for probing dynamics of intact virus particles in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work represents a description of enveloped
