Physical properties of the HIV-1 capsid from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is highly dependent on its capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capsid is a large container, made of 1,300 proteins with altogether 4 million atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the capsid proteins are all identical, they nevertheless arrange themselves into a largely asymmetric structure made of hexamers and pentamers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large number of degrees of freedom and lack of symmetry pose a challenge to studying the chemical details of the HIV capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulations of over 64 million atoms for over 1 s allow us to conduct a comprehensive study of the chemicalphysical properties of an empty HIV-1 capsid, including its electrostatics, vibrational and acoustic properties, and the effects of solvent (ions and water) on the capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations reveal critical details about the capsid with implications to biological function.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The family of retroviruses is characterized by their ability to incorporate viral DNA into a host cells genome1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most retroviruses infect cells during mitosis when the chromatin is exposed to the cytoplasm1,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the genus of lentiviruses, like the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), have evolved to infect nondividing cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the host cells chromatin is protected by the nucleus, the HIV-1 replication process requires coordination between reverse transcription of viral RNA and nuclear import3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral RNA is encased in a shell made of the capsid protein CA4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Originally thought to play a trivial role in the infection process, it is now well established that the viral capsid fulfills several essential functions1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, capsid involvement in the prevention of innate sensor triggering8,9,10,11, regulation of reverse transcription3,12 and regulation of the nuclear import pathway1,13,14,15 is of central importance to the successful infection of a host cell3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Structurally, CA consists of a single monomer composed of two independent domains, the C-terminal domain (CTD) and the N-terminal domain (Fig 1a)16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In solution, CA readily forms dimers connected by their CTDs16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At higher concentrations of CA and at high salt concentrations (1 M NaCl), the protein assembles into elongated tubes5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such tubes are made of the hexameric form of CA, arranged in a honeycomb lattice5,17,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assembled HIV-1 capsids are highly asymmetric cone-shaped structures5,22, with sizes ranging from 100 to 200 nm long and 45 to 50 nm wide (Fig 1b)1,5,22, that are made of pentamers and hexamers following Eberhards theorem21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of the pentamers induces high curvature and permits the closure of the capsid4,5,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in the HIV-1 capsid seven pentamers are located at the base and five pentamers at the tip (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The HIV-1 capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The HIV-1 capsid is made of a single capsid protein (CA), containing 11 -helices and a 310 helix.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) CA arranges into a fullerenic cone, consisting of pentamers (green) and hexamers (tan).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fully solvated HIV-1 capsid model without genome, including neutralizing ions and 150 mM NaCl, contains a total of 64,423,983 atoms5.Full size image', 'The function of a CA monomer is to assemble into a complete capsid, while the function of the assembled capsid is to infect a living cell; the chemicalphysical properties of the assembled capsid are essential to elucidating its biological function23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, the investigation of the chemicalphysical properties of the HIV-1 capsid without genome require the simulation of an entire virus-like particle (VLP), namely a 1.2 s, 64 million atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation (Fig 1b)5,17,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of the trajectory reveal atomic details as well as global emergent properties of an entire HIV-1 VLP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the simulations reveal spontaneous translocation of water and ions through the capsid core, a molecular process related to reverse transcription27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, analysis of the electrostatic potential produced by the empty capsid reveals electrostatic equivalence between the interior and exterior of the capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, analysis of the distribution of ions around the capsid reveals a binding pattern and specific binding sites on the capsid for chloride and sodium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the mechanical vibrations and normal modes of the empty capsid reveal possible pathways related to capsid uncoating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our findings set the stage for a better understandingfrom an atomic-resolution perspectiveof the emergent properties of the HIV-1 capsid and their relationships to the infective cycle.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Stability of the HIV-1 capsid', 'We began our analysis by assessing the stability of the HIV-1 capsid model, formed by 1,300 copies of the CA, shown in Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stability of the individual constituents of the capsid, namely CA pentamers and hexamers, was evaluated by means of root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  from the starting structure over the course of the simulation (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The r.m.s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  values were calculated excluding parts of the protein known to be disordered or mobile28, such as the cyclophilin-A (cypA) binding loop and residues 210 to 220 directly after -helix 11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average r.m.s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for CA hexamers and pentamers of 3.5±1.1 Å shows the local stability of the capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the measured r.m.s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  over the trajectory for CA pentamers and hexamers of 2.7±0.6 and 3.8±1.0 Å, respectively, shows that the pentamers are on average more rigid than the hexamers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the variability within the ensemble of hexamers in the capsid was 3.7±0.9 Å as compared with 2.6±0.5 Å for the 12 pentamers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the stability of the capsid as a whole was evaluated by calculating the r.m.s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  matrix between pairwise structures over the course of the trajectory (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Movie 1); the distance matrix shows that after 400 ns all capsid structures are within 3.5±1.0 Å of each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Stability of the HIV-1 capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Time evolution of the root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  for hexamers and pentamers, and the moving average with a window size of 10 ns is shown in blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) For all area and height calculations, the three principal moments of inertia of the entire capsid define the x, y and z axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cross-sectional area is estimated as the area of an ellipse where the major and minor axes are the maximal distance between parts of the capsid along the  and  axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The height of the capsid is defined as the longest distance from the tip (bottom) to the base (top) along the  axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Time evolution of the capsids cross-section, and the moving average with a 10 ns window size is shown in blue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Time evolution of the height of the HIV-1 capsid; the moving average with a 10 ns window size is shown in blue.Full size image', 'Changes in the cross-sectional area and height of the capsid are related to its global stability (Fig 2bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, both the height and cross-sectional area were calculated along the three principal axes of inertia of the capsid (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, during the first 400 ns of simulation, a shrinking of the capsid was observed, evidenced by a reduction in both the height and cross-sectional area at a rate of 0.025 nm ns1 and 0.113 nm2 ns1, respectively (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 400 ns, the capsid height and cross-section reach a plateau for the remaining 800 ns of the simulation that is used in the subsequent analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Examination of the water density in the interior and exterior of the capsid reveals the origin of capsid shrinkage (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the first 100 ns of simulation, a decay in water density was observed inside the capsid, followed by stabilization around 1.000±0.002 gm cm3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the rates of water moving in and out of the capsid are 20.1 × 103±1.6 × 103 and 19.7 × 103±1.5 × 103 water molecules per ns, respectively (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transfer rates of water indicate thermal equilibrium between the interior and exterior of the capsid and imply that the HIV-1 capsid is capable of replacing all of its contained water in 1 s. Remarkably, the transfer rates observed for HIV-1 are in stark contrast with order of magnitude smaller transfer rates observed for poliovirus capsids29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Electrostatics and ion permeability of the VLP', 'The capsid protein is negatively charged; in fact, at pH 7, the net electric charge of the whole capsid is 3,528 e. The electrostratic potential due to the distribution of electric charge of a fully solvated capsid, that is, explicitly including water and ions, was calculated at 20 ps intervals over the course of the simulation, over a grid containing 350 × 353 × 600 bins along the ,  and  direction, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting electrostatics maps were averaged over the last 400 ns of simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Snapshots of the electrostatic maps at regular intervals over the trajectory, averaged over 10 ns of simulation, are presented in Supplementary Fig 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time-averaged electrostatic potential is shown in Fig 3a,d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, a gradient of up to 7 V is observed between the CypA binding loop and the inner core of CA (Fig 3c); in addition, the innermost layer of the VLP constitutes an isopotential volume spanning the entire capsid (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, the effective electrostatic potential of hexamers and pentamers is remarkably similar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the regions of the solvent inside and outside of the capsid are at the same electrostatic potential as shown in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Electrostatic potential averaged over the final 400 ns of the HIV-1 capsid simulation.The electrostatic calculation includes all capsid atoms and all solvent molecules for a total of 64,423,983 atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bar scale indicates the magnitude of the electrostatic potential in Volt, ranging from 1.3 V (red) to 6.0 V (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Exterior view of the HIV-1 electrostatic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red line indicates the location of the cross-section shown in b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Cross-section of the electrostatic potential of the HIV-1 capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bulk in the interior and exterior of the capsid assume the same electrostatic potential values, namely 1.3 V.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The HIV-1 capsid is a finely tuned nanodevice that modulates several molecular events during HIV-1 infective cycle by interacting with multiple cellular host factors1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural stability of the capsid during different stages of the infective cycle remains poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, despite observing a global shrinking of the capsid compared with our original model5, the overall shape of the capsid and the structure of CA hexamers and pentamers remained largely unaltered over 1.2 s of simulation time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such global and local stability further supports the fullerenic model of the HIV-1 capsid, as well as the stability of the capsid interfaces, formed by dimers and hexameric/pentameric rings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation that a shrinkage of the capsid is followed by a stable structure is consistent with coarse-grained simulations of HIV-1-like particle assembly, where a global arrangement of the VLP occurs followed by local re-arrangement of the VLP structure48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our results suggest that a closed capsid, irrespective of its cargo, once assembled, remains stable and closed while still permitting the passage of water and ions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'So far, acoustic and normal mode analysis for large macromolecular systems have been limited to symmetric particles or coarse-grained representations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study we determined acoustic properties and PCs from all-atom simulations of a solvated capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the capsid exhibits an oscillatory behaviour manifested as surface waves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis indicates that the fundamental frequencies associated with such waves occur in the ultrasound regime (2.38 to 11.9 MHz).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our surprise, the fundamental frequencies were associated with different regions of the capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the tip of the capsid, where pentamers are closer to each other, presents the highest fundamental frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, our NMA results suggest that the capsid exhibits long-range collective dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such correlations over long distances may play important roles during infection, as they permit the capsid to transfer information to/from distant regions of its structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allosteric communication across the capsid could serve a function during nuclear import, during which interactions between the nuclear pore complex and the capsid modulate infection1 (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A significant result from the present study is the discovery of binding of cations and anions in genetically important regions of the assembled capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are not the first group to observe ions bound to CA in high-order assemblies; in addition to water molecules, chloride ions were detected by X-ray crystallography at multiple interfaces of a planar hexameric lattice (including the central pore, the CTD dimer and the threefold symmetry axis)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whether chloride or sodium ions play a biological role is unclear, as they may be substituting for other ions available in the cytoplasm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, not all of the binding sites we observe have also been observed experimentally; particularly, sodium has not yet been observed to interact with the hexameric lattice in the X-ray structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the observed electrostatic signature of the assembled capsid together with the ion binding sites could indicate the existence of proteinprotein interfaces for as yet undiscovered cellular factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the distribution of charge on the surface of the capsid of another retrovirus, the Rous sarcoma virus, is essential for successful infection50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our observation of ion-specific binding sites could also explain the requirement for high-salt concentrations for in vitro assembly of CA tubes and VLPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Remarkably, we also observe that ions translocate through chloride- and sodium-specific channels within the surface of the capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While homeostasis could be a simple explanation for ion translocation, there are other biological functions of the capsid that could require the existence of such channels3,29,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, reverse transcription (which is coupled to capsid uncoating) requires that DNA nucleotides be able to move from the exterior to the interior of the capsid3,16,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is possible that the channels found within the capsid serve to translocate small molecules, including nucleotides, necessary during different stages of the infective cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, in authentic virions, deviations should be expected from the distribution of ions and electrostatics presented here due to the presence of HIV-1 single-stranded RNA and other proteins in the interior of the capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the native HIV-1 capsid contains two copies of its negatively charged 9.7 kb-long genomic RNA53 that likely induces osmotic and mechanical pressures between the interior and exterior of the capsid; a similar shift in pressure has also been proposed for poliovirus capsids29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, changes in pressure of the capsid have been observed during reverse transcription in time-lapse atomic force microscopy experiments that result in rupture of the capsid at the narrow end54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the context of in vivo cargo, the ions channels identified in the present study could help regulate the osmotic shock produced during reverse transcription of the genomic RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present work is a comprehensive study of the chemicalphysical properties of the HIV-1 capsidan important therapeutic target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through the combination of state-of-the-art MD simulations with scalable, robust and model-free statistical analysis, we characterizedat atomic resolutionthe stability, electrostatics, water/ions permeability and the dynamic and acoustic properties of the HIV-1 capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results may provide a new avenue for the development of therapeutic interventions that seek to alter the biophysical properties of the HIV-1 capsid towards the treatment of disease.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
