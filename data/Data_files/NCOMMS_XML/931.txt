Topological superconductivity in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Theoretically, it has been known that breaking spin degeneracy and effectively realizing spinless fermions is a promising path to topological superconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, topological superconductors are rare to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we propose to realize spinless fermions by splitting the spin degeneracy in momentum space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we identify monolayer hole-doped transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)s as candidates for topological superconductors out of such momentum-space-split spinless fermions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although electron-doped TMDs have recently been found superconducting, the observed superconductivity is unlikely topological because of the near spin degeneracy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, hole-doped TMDs with momentum-space-split spinless fermions remain unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Employing a renormalization group analysis, we propose that the unusual spin-valley locking in hole-doped TMDs together with repulsive interactions selectively favours two topological superconducting states: interpocket paired state with Chern number 2 and intrapocket paired state with finite pair momentum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A confirmation of our predictions will open up possibilities for manipulating topological superconductors on the device-friendly platform of monolayer TMDs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The quest for material realizations of topological chiral superconductors with nontrivial Chern numbers1,2,3,4 is fuelled by predictions of exotic signatures, such as Majorana zero modes and quantized Hall effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, natural occurrence of bulk topological superconductors are rare with the best candidates being superfluid 3He (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5) and Sr2RuO4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, much recent experimental progress relied on proximity-inducing pairing to a spinorbit-coupled band structure building on the proposal of Fu and Kane7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their key insight was that a paired state of spinless fermions is bound to be topological and that the surface states of topological insulators are spinless in that the spin degeneracy is split in position space (r-space): the two degenerate Dirac surface states with opposite spin textures are spatially separated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, despite much experimental progress along this direction8,9,10,11,12,13,14, the confinement of the helical paired state to the interface of the topological insulator and a superconductor limits experimental access to its potentially exotic properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another type of exotic paired states that desires material realization is the finite-momentum-paired states, which has long been pursued since the first proposals by Fulde and Ferrell15 and by Larkin and Ovchinnikov16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most efforts towards realization of such modulated superconductors17,18, however, relied on generating finite-momentum pairing using spin-imbalance under a (effective) magnetic field in close keeping with the original proposals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exceptions to such a spin-imbalance-based approach are refs 19, 20 that made use of spinless Fermi surfaces with shifted centres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, there have been proposals suggesting modulated paired states in cuprate high-Tc superconductors21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unambiguous experimental detection of a purely modulated paired state in a solid-state system is lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We note an alternative strategy that could lead to pairing possibilities for both topological and modulated superconductivity: to split the spin degeneracy of fermions in momentum space (k-space).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach is essentially dual to the proposal of Fu and Kane, and it can be realized in a time-reversal-invariant non-centrosymmetric system when a pair of Fermi surfaces centred at opposite momenta ±k0 consist of oppositely spin-polarized electrons (see Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When such a spin-valley-locked band structure is endowed with repulsive interactions, conventional pairing will be suppressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, there will be two distinct pairing possibilities: interpocket and intrapocket pairings, where the latter will be spatially modulated with pairs carrying finite centre-of-mass momentum ±2k0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: k-space spin-split in the spin-valley-locked band structure of group IV monolayer TMDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic Fermi surface hosting

valleys K and K, which centred at opposite momenta ±K with respect to the  point.Full size image', 'What is critical to the success of this strategy is the materialization of such k-space-split spinless fermions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A new opportunity has arisen with the discovery of a family of superconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials, monolayer group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MX2 (M=Mo, W, X=S, Se)24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the transition metal atom M and the chalcogen atom X form a 2D hexagonal lattice within a layer as in graphene, monolayer TMDs differ from graphene in two important ways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, TMD monolayers are non-centrosymmetric, that is, inversion symmetry is broken (see Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, monolayer TMDs are direct-gap semiconductors28 with a type of Dresselhaus spinorbit coupling29,30 referred to as Ising spinorbit coupling31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This spinorbit-coupled band structure leads to the valley Hall effect30,32, which has established TMDs as experimental platforms for pursuing valleytronics applications30,32,33,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our focus, however, is the fact that there is a sizable range of chemical potential in the valence band that could materialize the k-space spin-split band structure we desire (see Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the carriers in TMDs have strong d-orbital character and, hence, correlation effects are expected to be important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, both intrinsic and pressure-induced superconductivity have been reported in electron-doped (n-doped) TMDs24,25,26,27 with the debate regarding the nature of the observed superconducting states still on-going37,38,39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we propose to obtain k-space-split spinless fermions by lightly hole-doping (p-doping) monolayer TMDs such that the chemical potential lies between the two spin-split valence bands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigate the possible paired states that can be driven by repulsive interactions42 in such lightly p-doped TMDs using a perturbative renormalization group (RG) analysis going beyond mean-field theory38,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find two distinct topological paired states to be the dominant pairing channels: an interpocket chiral (p/d)-wave paired state with Chern number |C|=2 and an intrapocket chiral p-wave paired state with a spatial modulation in phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The degeneracy can be split by the trigonal warping or Zeeman effect.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#

(see Fig 1b,c), which leads to a gapped spectrum and a Sz-preserving spinorbit coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such Ising spinorbit coupling31 acts as opposite Zeeman fields on the two valleys that preserve time-reversal symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore the spinorbit coupling is orbital-selective44 and selectively affects the valence band with a large spin-split29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By lightly p-doping the TMDs with the chemical potential  between the spin-split valence bands, spin-valley-locked fermions can be achieved near the two valleys (see Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming negligible trigonal warping at low doping, we can use a single label =, to denote the valley and the spin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Denoting the momentum measured from appropriate valley centres ±K by q, the kinetic part of the Hamiltonian density is', 'Figure 2: Symmetry-distinct pairing channels in a lightly p-doped monolayer TMD.The two oppositely spin-polarized Fermi surfaces centred at K and K

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the gap structures of (d) p-wave and d-wave both belong to the two-dimensional irreducible representation E and can mix as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number in each wedge labels the angle corresponding to the phase of each gap function at the midpoint of the Fermi surface segment in the wedge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the (p+ip)- and (did)-waves have the same

annihilates a spin-up electron with momentum q relative to the valley centre K or a spin-down electron with momentum q relative to the valley centreK (see Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the spin-valley-locked two-valley problem is now mapped to a problem with a single spin-degenerate Fermi pocket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the possible paired states with total spin z=±1 and z=0 in fact represent the novel possibilities of intrapocket modulated pairings with total z=±1 and interpocket pairing with total z=0, respectively (see Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Pairing possibilities', 'To discuss the pairing symmetries of the two pairing possibilities, it is convenient to define the partial-wave channels  with respect to the two-valley centres ±K.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since a total spin z=±1 intrapocket pair consists of two electrons with equal spin, Pauli principle dictates such pairing to be in a state with odd partial-wave .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stepping back to microscopics, such pairs carry finite centre-of-mass momentum ±2K and form two copies of phase-modulated superconductor15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This case may or may not break time-reversal symmetry due to the absence of locking between the s of the two pockets =,.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the total z=0 interpocket pairing, the allowed symmetries of a superconducting state is further restricted by the underlying C3v symmetry of the lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the absence of an inversion centre allows the pairing wavefunction in each irreducible representation to be a mixture between parity-even and -odd functions with respect to the  point45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, s-wave mixes with f-wave and d-wave mixes with p-wave (see Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the irreducible representations of C3v, two fully gapped possibilities are the trivial A1 representation, which amounts to (s/f)-wave pairing () and a chiral superposition of the 2D E representation, which amounts to a mixture of p±ip and did pairing ().  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mixing implies that the non-topological f-wave channel that is typically dominant in trigonal systems as a way of avoiding repulsive interaction will be blocked together with s-wave by the repulsive interaction in the p-doped TMDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, it is clear that the pairing instability in  channel is all one needs for topological pairing in the p-doped TMDs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two distinct topological paired states', 'To investigate the effects of the repulsive interactions between transition metal d-orbitals, we take the microscopic interaction to be the Hubbard interaction, which is the most widely studied pardignamtic model of strongly correlated electronic systems', '', 'where W is the ultraviolet energy scale, U greater than 0 and ni,s is the density of electrons with spin s on site i.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By now, it is well established that the interaction that is purely repulsive at the microscopic level can be attractive in anisotropic channels for low-energy degrees of freedom, that is, fermions near Fermi surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The perturbative RG approach has been widely used to demonstrate this principle on various correlated superconductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the model of p-doped TMDs defined by Equations (1) and (2), the symmetry-allowed effective interactions at an intermediate energy scale  close to the Fermi level in the Cooper channel (see Supplementary Note 1) would be:', '', 'where q and q are the incoming and outgoing momenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Now, the remaining task is to derive the effective inter- and intrapocket interactions g,(q,q) and g,(q,q) perturbatively in the microscopic repulsion U and check to see whether attraction occur in the  channel (see Methods and Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Before going into the details of calculation, it is important to note that isotropic pairing with  is forbidden by Pauli principle in the total z=±1 channel and blocked by the bare repulsive interaction in the total z=0 channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we need to look for attraction in the anisotropic  channel, which is given by the momentum-dependent part of g(0).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With our assumption of isotropic dispersion at low-doping, one needs to go to the two-loop order to find momentum dependence in the effective interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fortunately, it has been known for the model of Equations (1) and (2) that effective attraction is indeed found in anisotropic channels at the two-loop order46.

#@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two ways this degeneracy can be lifted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the trigonal warping will suppress intrapocket pairing as the two points on the same pocket with opposing momenta will not be both on the Fermi surface any more (see Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, a ferromagnetic substrate will introduce an imbalance between the two pockets, which promotes intrapocket pairing47 (see Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: The inter- and intrapocket  paired states.The gap functions of the  paired states have the approximate form qx±iqy on the two pockets

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The distinct topological properties of the two predicted exotic superconducting states lead to unusual signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interpocket  paired state (see Fig 3a) is topological with Chern number |C|=2 because of the two pockets (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Chern number dictates for two chiral edge modes, which in this case are Majorana chiral edge modes each carrying central charge (1)/(2) (refs 1, 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to d+id paired state on a single spin-degenerate pocket, which is another chiral superconducting state49,50,51,52,53,54 with four chiral Majorana edge modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An unambiguous signature of two Majorana edge modes in the interpocket chiral  paired state will be a quantized thermal Hall conductivity1 of', '', 'at temperature T, where c=1 is the total central charge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, signatures of the chiral nature of such state could be revealed by a detection of time-reversal symmetry breaking in polar Kerr effect and muon spin relaxation measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a sharp signature of anisotropy of the pairing will be the maximization of the critical current in a direct current superconducting quantum interference device (dc SQUID) interferometry set-up of Fig 4a at some finite flux max0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Configurations of possible SQUID experiments for probing

the two junctions for isotropic and anisotropic pairing, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The proposed dc SQUID interferometer set-up that can probe the finite pair momentum of the intrapocket pairs for the C=0 case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TMD is oriented in the direction such that the phase of the pairing wavefunction is spatially modulated along the junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The period in flux  of the modulated voltage V across the SQUID loop is expected to be halved into (hc)/(4e) since the difference between the pair momenta on the two sides of a junction requires simultaneous tunnelling of a spin-up and a spin-down intrapocket pair, each carrying pair momentum 2K and 2K, into the uniform superconductor.Full size image', 'The intrapocket  paired state (see Fig 3b) is not only topological, but also its phase of the gap is spatially modulated with ei2Kr and ei2Kr for spin-up and -down pairs, respectively, where r is the spatial coordinate of the centre-of-mass of the pair (see Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the gaps on the two pockets are not tied to each other in principle, the system may be either helical respecting time-reversal symmetry (C=0) or chiral (C=2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either way, there will be a Majorana zero mode of each spin species at a vortex core so long as z is preserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What makes the intrapocket paired state distinct from existing candidate materials for topological superconductivity, however, is its spatial modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Smoking gun signature of the modulation in phase would be the halved period (hc)/(4e) of the oscillating voltage across the dc SQUID set-up in Fig 4b in flux  due to the difference between the pair momenta on the two sides of the junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another signature of the intrapocket paired state will be the spatial profile of the modulated phase directly detected with an atomic resolution scanning Josephson tunnelling microscopy23,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we propose the k-space spin splitting as a new strategy for topological superconductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we predict lightly p-doped monolayer TMDs with their spin-valley-locked band structure and correlations to exhibit topological superconductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the monolayer TMDs, WSe2 may be the most promising as its large spin-splitting energy scale56 allows for substantial carrier density within the spin-valley-locked range of doping57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rationale for the proposed route is to use a lower symmetry to restrict the pairing channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The merit of this approach is clear when we contrast the proposed setting to the situation of typical spin-degenerate trigonal systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a higher symmetry, trigonal systems typically deals with the need for anisotropic pairing due to the repulsive interaction by turning to the topologically trivial f-wave channel2,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The n-doped TMDs whose low-energy band structure is approximately spin-degenerate fall into this category.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, experimentally realized superconductivity in n-doped systems would likely be topologically trivial even if the superconductivity is driven by the same repulsive interaction we consider here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The predicted topological paired states in p-doped TMDs are a direct consequence of the spin-valley locking, which breaks the spin degeneracy in k-space and creates two species of spinless fermions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental confirmation of the predicted topological superconductivity in p-doped TMDs will open unprecedented opportunities in these highly tunable systems.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
