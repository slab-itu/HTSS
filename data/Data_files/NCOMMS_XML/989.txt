Mutant KRAS promotes malignant pleural effusion formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is the lethal consequence of various human cancers metastatic to the pleural cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the mechanisms responsible for the development of MPE are still obscure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that mutant KRAS is important for MPE induction in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pleural disseminated, mutant KRAS bearing tumour cells upregulate and systemically release chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) into the bloodstream to mobilize myeloid cells from the host bone marrow to the pleural space via the spleen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells promote MPE formation, as indicated by splenectomy and splenocyte restoration experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, KRAS mutations are frequently detected in human MPE and cell lines isolated thereof, but are often lost during automated analyses, as indicated by manual versus automated examination of Sanger sequencing traces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the novel KRAS inhibitor deltarasin and a monoclonal antibody directed against CCL2 are equally effective against an experimental mouse model of MPE, a result that holds promise for future efficient therapies against the human condition.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The pleural cavities of two million cancer patients per year are affected by malignant pleural effusion (MPE), caused by primary malignant pleural mesothelioma or by metastatic cancers originating from the lung, breast, gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MPE manifests with vascular leakiness that leads to fluid accumulation in the pleural space and is etiologically associated with fulminant inflammation and neovascularization, rather than mere tumour-induced lymphatic obstruction2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the reason why some patients with pleural tumours develop MPE while others do not remains unknown3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dichotomous phenotype of wet pleural carcinomatosis associated with a MPE versus dry pleural carcinomatosis without a MPE is critical, since patients with even minimal effusions face a worse prognosis and limited treatment options3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous work on experimental mouse models of MPE revealed that pleural tumour-secreted CC motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) mediates MPE formation by stimulating angiogenesis and vascular leakage and by driving myeloid cells, including monocytes and mast cells, from the bone marrow to the pleural metastatic milieu5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the molecular culprits responsible for tumour cell CCL2 secretion and subsequent MPE precipitation remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, MET, EML4/ALK, RET and other mutations have been identified in pleural tumour biopsies and pleural fluid aspirates from MPE patients8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EGFR mutations were recently implicated in MPE development and patients with KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas were found to have more frequent pleural metastases compared with wild-type ones17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, no study has addressed the role of KRAS mutations in MPE development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hypothesized that the ability of a tumour cell to induce a MPE once it homes to the pleural space is linked with an underlying molecular signature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this and to model the biologic events that follow pleural metastasis, we determined the mutation status of multiple murine and human cancer cell lines and simultaneously tested their ability to induce MPE by directly injecting them into the pleural space of appropriate recipient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that pleural homed cancer cells harboring activating KRAS mutations are competent of MPE induction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we provide evidence that this genotype-phenotype link is primarily mediated via mutant KRAS-dependent CCL2 signalling that results in the recruitment of CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells to the pleural space, a phenomenon requiring intact splenic function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show that KRAS mutations are detectable in human MPE by careful analyses of Sanger sequencing traces and that mutant KRAS-mediated MPE is actionable.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A link between KRAS mutations and MPE', 'To identify a possible MPE-associated genotype, we cross-examined five murine C57BL/6-derived and five human cancer cell lines for genotype and MPE competence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we directly injected 1.5 × 105 mouse or 106 human tumour cells or 3 × 106 HEK293T benign human embryonic kidney cells into the pleural cavities of C57BL/6 (mouse cells) or NOD/SCID (human cells) mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, we Sanqer-sequenced the Kras, Egfr, Pik3ca and Braf transcripts of mouse cells after reverse-transcribing them to cDNAs and amplifying them with specific primers (Supplementary Table 1), and obtained mutation data for KRAS, EGFR, PIK3CA and BRAF genes of human cells from COSMIC20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KRAS mutations of human cells were also verified in-house.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among mouse cells, three Kras-mutant (Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC; MC38 colon adenocarcinoma; and AE17 malignant pleural mesothelioma, bearing heterozygous KrasG12C, KrasG13R, and KrasG12C mutations, respectively) and two Kras wild-type (B16F10 skin melanoma and PANO2 pancreatic adenocarcinoma) cell lines were identified, which were all free of additional mutations in Egfr, Pik3ca or Braf genes (Fig 1a; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among human cells, A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells and their derivatives, long-term passaged (LTP) A549 cells that have suffered Y chromosome loss, featured a heterozygous KRASG12S mutation, while SKMEL2 skin melanoma, HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma, and HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells were KRAS wild-type (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These human cell lines also had wild-type EGFR, PIK3CA and BRAF genes, with the exception of HT-29 cells that harbor BRAF and PIK3CA mutations20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KRAS-mutant cell lines exhibited enhanced KRAS mRNA expression and RAS activity compared to KRAS wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig 1ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, upon pleural injection to appropriate hosts, all cell lines produced extensive pleural carcinomatosis, but exclusively KRAS-mutant cells gave rise to MPE (Fig 1bd; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To definitely test this in an isogenic cellular system, we derived lung adenocarcinoma cell lines from C57BL/6 and FVB mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, C57BL/6 mice received ten and FVB mice four weekly intraperitoneal injections of the lung carcinogen urethane (1 g kg1), as described elsewhere21,22, and were killed after 10 months, followed by long-term lung tumour culture in vitro23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting cell lines (C57BL/6 and FVB-derived urethane-induced lung adenocarcinoma, CULA and FULA cells, respectively) were tumourigenic when implanted subcutaneously in syngeneic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, three different FULA cell lines had three different Kras mutations (including Q61H, Q61R and G12V mutations), while CULA cells were Kras wild-type (Fig 1a; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with the results from existing cell lines, all Kras-mutant FULA cell lines were MPE-competent, while Kras-wild-type CULA cells were not (Fig 1bd; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, out of the 12 different cell lines tested, six out of six KRAS-mutant cell lines were MPE-competent and none out of six MPE-incompetent, while none out of six KRAS-wild-type cell lines was MPE-competent, and six out of six MPE-incompetent (P=0.0022; 2-test), indicating a statistically significant association between mutant KRAS and MPE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Selective induction of malignant pleural effusions by KRAS-mutant tumour cells.Mutation status of and malignant pleural disease induction by twelve murine and human tumour cell lines after pleural delivery to appropriate recipient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Kras cDNA Sanger sequencing traces of C57BL/6 mouse splenocytes (control) and of five C57BL/6 mouse tumour cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Black arrows indicate heterozygous missense mutations in Kras codons 12 and 13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Data summary of pleural tumor mass (n=53, 26, 19, 30, 19, 27, 20, 16, 14, 14, 14, and 15, respectively, for LLC, MC38, AE17, B16F10, PANO2, FULA, CULA, A549, LTP A549, SKMEL2, HT-29, and HEK293T cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Data summary of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) volume (n=53, 26, 19, 30, 19, 27, 20, 16, 14, 14, 14, and 15, respectively, for LLC, MC38, AE17, B16F10, PANO2, FULA, CULA, A549, LTP A549, SKMEL2, HT-29, and HEK293T cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Representative images of MPEs (dashed lines), pleural tumours (t), lungs (l), and hearts (h) imaged through the diaphragm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 1 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Data summary of pleural CD11b+Gr1+ cells (n=516 animals/group were analysed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Representative dotplots and gating strategy for the quantification of pleural CD11b+Gr1+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are presented as mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P, probability values for overall comparisons by one-way ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  * and ***: P less_than 0.05 and P less_than 0.001 for the comparison between HEK293T cells and any other cell line (b) or for the comparison between any Kras-mutant and any Kras-wild-type cell line (c,e) by Bonferroni post-tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT, wild-type;

log-rank test) earlier compared with mice with dry pleural carcinomatosis from Kras-wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to early lethality, mutant Kras-dependent MPE development was associated with a massive influx of myeloid cells into the pleural space.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was investigated using irradiated C57BL/6 chimeras reconstituted with luminescent bone marrow from ubiquitously luminescent CAG.Luc.eGFP donor mice fully backcrossed to the C57BL/6 strain6,7,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourteen days after pleural tumour cell injection, only chimeras injected with Kras-mutant tumour cells showed an increased thoracic bioluminescent signal (Supplementary Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This KRAS-dependent inflammatory response associated with MPE formation was predominated by both polymorphonuclear and mononuclear myeloid cells that expressed both CD11b and Gr1, and either Ly6c or Ly6g (Fig 1e,f; Supplementary Figs 1g and 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MPE development triggered by KRAS-mutant cancer cells was associated with an influx of increased numbers of all kinds of myeloid cells into the pleural space, but not with the presence of newly-appearing morphologically or molecularly distinct cell types, since differential pleural cell counts and flow cytometry results were similar percentage-wise in mice with or without a MPE (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to triggering a myeloid inflammatory response, KRAS-mutant pleural tumours and MPEs showed enhanced angiogenic and vasoactive potential in several in vivo assay systems compared with KRAS-wild-type tumours (Supplementary Fig 2bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we did not detect an increased proliferative or clonogenic capacity specifically characterizing KRAS-mutant cells and tumours compared with KRAS-wild-type ones (Supplementary Fig 2ei).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was in accord with the equal total mass of pleural tumors per mouse observed across pleural-injected KRAS-mutant and wild-type tumour cells (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results suggested that mutant KRAS-driven MPE is associated with induction of an inflammatory, angiogenic, and vasoactive response in the pleural space, but not necessarily with enhanced pleural tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mutant KRAS promotes MPE', 'To corroborate the link between KRAS mutations and MPE, we undertook both shRNA-mediated KRAS silencing in cell lines harboring mutant KRAS, as well as mutant KRAS overexpression in cell lines harboring wild-type KRAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stable transduction of six different Kras-mutant mouse tumour cells with lentiviral-delivered Kras-specific shRNA (shKras) resulted in diminished expression of both murine Kras isoforms (2A and 2B) and decreased RAS signalling compared with random (control, shC) shRNA, whereas overexpression of mutant KrasG12C isoforms in murine and human cell lines carrying wild-type KRAS via retroviral transduction enhanced the respective KRAS protein levels and increased RAS signalling (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Manipulation of KRAS signalling did not result in obvious enhancements of tumour cell proliferation or survival in vitro; on the contrary, overexpression of KrasG12C2A in PANO2 cells and of KrasG12C2B in B16F10 cells slowed their growth rate (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, upon direct inoculation of all parental and daughter KRAS-modulated cell lines into the pleural space of appropriate (C57BL/6, FVB or NOD/SCID) host mice, all mice developed similar extent of pleural carcinomatosis, but expression of mutant KRAS was a cardinal determinant of MPE in all cell lines examined (Fig 2a,b; Table 2; Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More specifically, Kras silencing universally abrogated MPE formation by LLC, MC38, AE17 and three different FULA cell lines, that is, in cells harbouring either KRAS G12C (LLC & AE17 cells), G13R (MC38 cells), G12V, Q61H or Q61R (FULA cells) mutations, whereas oncogenic KrasG12C expression conferred MPE competence to B16F10, PANO2, SKMEL2, and HEK293T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably: (i) expression of KrasG12C isoform 2A conferred enhanced MPE competence to PANO2 cells compared with KrasG12C isoform 2B, although the later was more abundantly expressed by KRAS-mutant cancer cells; and (ii) mutant KRAS expression converted even benign HEK293T cells to MPE competence (Fig 2a,b; Table 2; Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using pleural injection of parental and KRAS-modulated MC38 and PANO2 cells into C57BL/6 chimeras reconstituted with CAG.Luc.eGFP bone marrow, we identified that mutant KRAS is not only responsible for MPE development, but also for the associated pleural influx of CD11b+Gr1+ cells (Fig 2c; Supplementary Fig 5c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicated that mutant KRAS is dispensable for pleural tumour growth, but important for MPE development and for the associated systemic recruitment of CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells, and suggested that KRAS must be responsible for the secretion of a solute mediator of MPE by tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Mutant KRAS promotes malignant pleural effusion development.Impact of shRNA-mediated Kras silencing on MPE competence of cell lines harboring mutant Kras, and of mutant KrasG12C overexpression in cell lines harboring wild-type KRAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Data summary of pleural tumor mass (n=14, 12, 11, 14, 11, 11, 9, 9, 11, 10, 13, 16, 12, 16, 9, 10, 9, and 9, respectively, for LLC shC, LLC shKras, MC38 shC, MC38 shKras, AE17 shC, AE17 shKras, FULA shC, FULA shKras, B16F10 pC, B16F10 pKras2A, B16F10 pKras2B, PANO2 pC, PANO2 pKras2A, PANO2 pKras2B, SKMEL2 pC, SKMEL2 pKras2B, HEK293T pC, and HEK293T pKras2B cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Data summary of MPE volume (n=14, 12, 11, 14, 11, 11, 9, 9, 11, 10, 13, 16, 12, 16, 9, 10, 9, and 9, respectively, for LLC shC, LLC shKras, MC38 shC, MC38 shKras, AE17 shC, AE17 shKras, FULA shC, FULA shKras, B16F10 pC, B16F10 pKras2A, B16F10 pKras2B, PANO2 pC, PANO2 pKras2A, PANO2 pKras2B, SKMEL2 pC, SKMEL2 pKras2B, HEK293T pC, and HEK293T pKras2B cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Data summary of pleural CD11b+Gr1+ cells (n=711/group were analysed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are presented as mean±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P, probability values for overall comparisons by one-way ANOVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ns, *, **, and ***: P greater than 0.05, P less_than 0.05, P less_than 0.01, and P less_than 0.001 for the comparison between the indicated cell line and the respective control (c) by Students t-test or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests, as appropriate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  WT, wild-type;

Supplementary Fig 7c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, splenectomy protected NOD/SCID mice from A549-induced MPE (KRASG12S; Supplementary Fig 7e), further suggesting that myeloid and not lymphoid splenic cells promote MPE in these lymphoid-deficient mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Splenectomy-conferred protection was long-lived, as even mice collected 30 days post-tumour cell injection did not have MPE (Supplementary Fig 7c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address whether splenic CD11b+Gr1+ cells are required for MPE development, tumour-naive and tumour-bearing CAG.Luc.eGFP mice were used as splenocyte donors to splenectomized pleural MC38 (KrasG13R)-bearing C57BL/6 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These CAG.Luc.eGFP donors received pleural injections of saline (naive splenocyte), control shRNA-expressing MC38 cells (MC38 shC-educated splenocyte) or Kras specific-shRNA expressing MC38 cells (MC38 shKras-educated splenocyte) and 13 days later, their spleens were collected and processed to single-cell suspensions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, splenectomized or sham-operated C57BL/6 hosts received pleural MC38 cell injections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At post-injection day 9, splenectomized animals received five million intravenous splenocytes obtained from naive, shC or shKras MC38-bearing donors whereas, at post-injection day 13, these mice were analysed for MPE incidence, volume, survival, and for Luc+CD11b+Gr1+ recruited pleural cells (derived from transplanted splenocytes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, only splenocytes from donors inoculated with MC38 cells bearing intact mutant KRAS signalling were able to translocate to the pleura and promote MPE formation in splenectomized mice harbouring pleural MC38 cells (Supplementary Fig 7fh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicated that KRAS-mutant pleural tumours induce the sequential recruitment of CD11b+Gr1+ cells from the bone marrow to the spleen and into the pleural cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, that during MPE formation, bone marrow-borne, splenic CD11b+Gr1+ cells are conditioned by solute mediators secreted by KRAS-mutant pleural tumours (possibly CCL2) and functionally contribute to MPE development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'KRAS mutations in human MPE', 'We next Sanger-sequenced the KRAS transcripts of 12 human MPEs caused by metastatic lung adenocarcinomas according to established protocols16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, KRAS mutations were present in numerous MPEs, but were not always readily detectable by automated Sanger sequencing trace analysis using BioEdit software29, since mutant base traces were often hidden underneath wild-type traces superimposed by the other KRAS allele, or by tumour-infiltrating stromal cells (Fig 4a,b; Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also analysed recently published data of the site of recurrence of 481 resected non-small cell lung cancers according to KRAS and EGFR mutation status, and found that KRAS mutations overall were highly significantly (P less_than 0.0001;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The dichotomous phenotype of primary and metastatic pleural tumours, some of which are associated with an MPE whereas others are not, is of paramount clinical importance, and prompted us to hypothesize that a causative molecular signature underlines MPE formation2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that cancer cells bearing different KRAS mutations cause MPE upon pleural dissemination and that mutant KRAS is important for experimental MPE development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, that mutant KRAS-driven MPE is attributed to a CCL2-dependent signalling cascade that is necessary for the sequential translocation of CD11b+Gr1+ cells from the bone marrow to the spleen and the tumour-involved pleural cavity, where, in turn, these cells promote MPE formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proof-of-principle clinical data indicate that KRAS mutations are present in a substantial proportion of MPE patients in Europe and that they might be underestimated by automated sequencing analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that pharmacologic interception of this newly identified KRAS-driven, CCL2-mediated pathway to MPE can prevent MPE development.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The newly identified genotype-disease connection between mutant KRAS and MPE was corroborated using 12 different isogenic cellular systems of parental and daughter KRAS-modulated cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each and single one of these systems, mutant KRAS was required and sufficient for MPE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly impressive was the switch of PANO2 cells upon KrasG12C2A expression from complete MPE incompetence during a months observation to acute and lethal MPE induction within 7 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same is true for benign HEK293T that were rendered MPE-proficient by isolated expression of KrasG12C2B per se.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  But is the proposed mutant KRAS-MPE link clinically relevant?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KRAS mutations are not frequently found in human MPE as opposed to EGFR and EML4/ALK mutations8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we believe that KRAS mutations are not looked for because they are considered not actionable and mutually exclusive to EGFR mutations, notions that are currently being revisited8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show the clinical data that indicate that KRAS mutations are frequent in European patients with MPE from lung adenocarcinoma and that they might be underappreciated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study also showed how KRAS mutations can be missed in MPE samples, but persist in cultured cell lines derived from the same patients16, a finding recapitulated in patients from our centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, most MPE sequencing studies were performed in Asian populations with high EGFR and EML/ALK and low KRAS mutation frequencies8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study of European patients with resected lung tumours clearly showed that KRAS mutations are linked with pleural spread19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, pleural tumours are diffuse-multifocal and probably multiclonal36 and it is conceivable that mutant KRAS MPE-initiating cells escape detection in focal pleural tumour tissue biopsies and low-volume pleural fluid aspirates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We do not claim that KRAS mutations are the only ones that cause MPE in humans and postulate mutant KRAS effects to be class effects shared by all driver mutations aligned along the KRAS pathway, including EGFR, KRAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, MET, EML4/ALK, RET and others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, mutant EGFR was recently shown to cause MPE when expressed in H1299 human lung adenocarcinoma cells17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, possible pathogenic roles for other lung cancer drivers in MPE remain to be shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together with the advent of MPE sequencing techniques8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, such developments could lead to targeted therapies for MPE in the near future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, MPE is a clinically heterogeneous set of diseases from a number of primary sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KRAS mutations are more relevant to patients with lung, pancreatic, and colon cancers and leukaemias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other tumors (that is, breast cancer) other mutations may be functionally involved in MPE formation (that is, HER2), a postulation that awaits experimental confirmation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, future human studies aimed at identifying genotypephenotype linkages in various tumours need to be tailored appropriately and need not rely on cross-sectional frequency observation design.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prospectively genotyped, case-matched, and longitudinally observed patient cohorts are more likely to give answers to questions such as the KRAS-MPE link proposed here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to the novel cancer genome-phenotype association, we further show here that mutant KRAS-driven MPE is mediated via CCL2-dependent paracrine signalling to CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The well-studied cell-autonomous effects of mutant KRAS conferring addictive proliferation advantages to the tumour cell35,37 may be complemented by this paracrine axis and may temporally precede its clinical manifestation, since mutant KRAS likely promotes pleural metastasis prior to MPE development18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As opposed to neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL1, CXCL2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25), tumour-elaborated CCL2 is a potent monocyte/macrophage mobiliser promoting angiogenesis and metastasis34,38 and was identified here as the transcriptional target of mutant KRAS in tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding complements previous observations implicating CCL2 in mutant KRAS-driven inflammation in the lung epithelium39 and in MPE formation5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, mutant HRAS also induces IL-8 signalling40 and the results imply that different RAS proteins may control distinct chemokine repertoires in order to mobilize defined myeloid cell subsets to tumour sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our present and previous findings5,6,7 indicate that pleural tumour-originated CCL2 mobilizes two distinct cell populations from the bone marrow: mast cells and CD11b+Gr1+ cells41,42, both known to respond to CCL2 (refs 7, 25), to facilitate breast cancer metastasis to the lungs34, and to sustain tumour growth by promoting angiogenesis28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD11b+Gr1+ cells were previously identified in MPE42 along with mast cells that were shown to promote MPE by fostering tumour growth and vascular permeability7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the spleen is an important intermediate organ for MPE development, similar to other tumour models, with its marginal zone functioning as a reservoir for bone-marrow-derived CD11b+Gr1+ cell progenitors that are subsequently rapidly deployed to tumour sites43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments, in line with the work of others26,27,28,43,44 incriminate the spleen as a pro-tumour organ and suggest that the splenic environment is essential for CD11b+Gr1+ cell recruitment to MPE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As splenectomy provided marked protection to mice against incipient MPE, splenectomy at the time of pleurodesis or catheter placement may yield considerable benefit to patients with MPE, a notion worth exploring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we present evidence that mutant KRAS-mediated MPE is actionable by the novel inhibitor of KRAS membrane transport deltarasin, lending hope for clinical targeting of the oncogene in the future30,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, a CCL2 neutralizing antibody6,7,33,34 was as effective as deltarasin, strengthening the KRAS-CCL2 connection and indicating that intercepting downstream of mutant oncogene targets may be an alternative to their direct targeting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the clinical significance of KRAS and other driver mutations of lung and other cancers in MPE that needs to be established, open questions that remain include whether the hypoxic pleural environment impacts MPE development and whether it triggers phenotypic changes in pleural metastasized tumour cells, including the KRAS/CCL2 axis reported here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we show that KRAS mutations are causally linked with MPE in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that this link rests on a defined innate immune response and that it might be at play in humans with the condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that this work opens up avenues of potential progress towards aetiologic MPE therapy, by providing preclinical proof-of-concept data on immediate and feasible targeted interventions, such as splenectomy and KRAS and CCL2 blockade, which could provide meaningful benefits to patients with MPE in the future.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
