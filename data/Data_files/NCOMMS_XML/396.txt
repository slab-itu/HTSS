Simultaneous optical and electrical in vivo analysis of the enteric nervous system  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a major division of the nervous system and vital to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and its communication with the rest of the body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the brain and spinal cord, relatively little is known about the ENS in part because of the inability to directly monitor its activity in live animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we integrate a transparent graphene sensor with a customized abdominal window for simultaneous optical and electrical recording of the ENS in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The implanted device captures ENS responses to neurotransmitters, drugs and optogenetic manipulation in real time.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The enteric nervous system (ENS) contains the largest population of neurons in the peripheral nervous system, five times the amount in the spinal cord, and is often referred to as the second brain due to its autonomous functions1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Organized into two types of ganglia, the myenteric and submucosal plexuses, the ENS is composed of motor neurons, sensory neurons and interneurons, and it is responsible for regulating vital functions such as gut motility and homeostasis2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Damage to the ENS is associated with inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome and other functional GI disorders4,5,6, which affect one quarter of the worlds population and result in over 21.7 million hospitalizations and $141.8 billion in costs each year7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ENS dysfunction often accompanies systemic conditions such as obesity and diabetes, and emerging evidence suggests a link between Parkinsons disease and the ENS9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Compared with the central nervous system, less is known about the ENS circuitry and its electrophysiological dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, although ENS dysfunction is known to be associated with diseases like functional GI disorders, the exact electrophysiology is less clear12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As opposed to the brain and spinal cord, which can be imaged via cranial and spinal windows and recorded via implantable electrodes14,15,16, a major limitation in deciphering the ENS circuitry is our inability to optically image or electrically record ENS activities in live animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particular challenges for ENS recording include: the peristatic movements of the intestine, high background noise associated with surrounding longitudinal and circular muscles, lack of a fixed surface (for example, the skull or spine) to stabilize the device and maintain good contact, and the highly immunogenic gastrointestinal (GI) environment that interferes with ENS activities (in contrast, the central nervous system is much more immune tolerant towards foreign substrates)17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gut movement also makes it extremely challenging to track the same groups of enteric neurons over multiple imaging sessions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, given our limited knowledge about the ENS electrophysiology and high background noise, it is important to develop capabilities of simultaneous optical/electrical recording to take advantage of available transgenic reporter mice to validate and interpret recorded data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ENS has been imaged previously in an acute setup, where the intestine was brought out of the abdominal cavity, and the mouse was killed after the imaging session20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method has several limitations if being applied to ENS recording: (i) the external environment and stretching the intestine out of the abdomen create artefacts due to ENS sensitivity to mechanical and chemical stimuli; (ii) the imaging duration is limited and (iii) this setup does not allow chronic monitoring over an extended period, which is important for understanding ENS-related physiology in health and disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An intravital abdominal window was previously developed to image intestinal epithelial stem cells21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this setup, the intestine was glued to the coverslip on the window, which was also kept in place by glue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the glue causes substantial local inflammation, which could interfere with ENS activity, and makes this approach ill-suited for studying ENS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other factors also make this approach impractical for chronic (repeated) studies of the ENS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tendency of coverslip breakage hinders repeated imaging sessions and prevents integration of electrical recording devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Peristaltic movements often cause the intestine to break off from the glue and detach from the window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adhering the intestine to the window can cause intestinal obstruction or chronic inflammation, leading to high-mortality rates, fibrosis and mucus buildup, preventing repeated measures of the ENS function over the course of the experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To overcome these limitations, a three-dimensional (3D)-printed insert is designed and surgically implanted into the animal to stabilize the intestine without blocking its motility functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through a customized abdominal intravital window, we manage to chronically image the same location in the mouse gut over several days and observe neuronal firing using the transgenic Pirt-GCaMP3 mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By further integrating a transparent graphene sensor into the window, we demonstrate the ability to perform concurrent optical and electrical recording of ENS activity, with high spatiotemporal resolution to detect waveforms of single action potentials (APs) from individual enteric neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use these novel capabilities to analyse the effects of various chemical and biomolecular stimuli and optogenetic manipulations on the gut, showing that such in vivo, real-time detection methods provide unique information necessary for the understanding of gut functionality in vivo.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In vivo imaging using abdominal window', 'We designed a customized window to overcome the limitations found in earlier window designs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We started by surgically inserting a window into the fascia and skin layer of the mouse abdomen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The window uses thermally resistant, borosilicate glass, which is also much less susceptible to damage and less likely to break than conventional glass coverslips.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below the window, a 3D-printed insert holds the intestine in place while providing support and prevent ischaemia (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike a chemical adhesive, the implant is not adhered to the intestine, minimizing inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, it can be tightened to reduce tissue movement without blocking proper digestion functions and peristalsis, extending the lifetime of the mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other applications, such as intravital cranial and spinal windows, implants are placed at locations inaccessible to the mice, but abdominal windows are subject to constant scratching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore developed a protocol using vet wrap to prevent the mouse from damaging the window, which substantially prolonged mouse survival and avoided inflammation (Supplementary Video 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mice implanted with the window consistently live up to 3 months, until they are killed for humane reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We demonstrated that it is possible to image the ENS in vivo using this setup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt1-cre:tdTomato mice were chronically imaged with inverted multiphoton microscopy (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this transgenic strain, enteric neurons and other neural crest progeny are labelled with tdTomato22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The grid-like myenteric plexus formed by individual neurons is clearly visible through the transplanted abdominal window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To track the same set of enteric neurons on different days, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran was injected retro-orbitally into the mouse to stain the vasculature, which served as a reference roadmap to locate the same region of the ENS (Fig 1be and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During subsequent imaging sessions, we were able to identify the same neurons using this vasculature roadmap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plexus and vasculature morphology remained largely unchanged 11 days after the implantation surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: In vivo chronic multiphoton microscopy of ENS with abdominal window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of in vivo multiphoton microscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (be) Days 2, 5, 8 and 11 after abdominal surgery, respectively, of in vivo multiphoton imaging in Wnt1-cre:tdTomato mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ENS is labelled with tdTomato (red), and the vasculature is labelled with FITC-dextran (green).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100â€‰m.Full size image', 'Detection of ENS activity via graphene electrodes', 'To perform simultaneous electrical recording, we needed to integrate electrodes onto the abdominal window.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrical recording device needs to be: (i) transparent to allow imaging through the device, (ii) inert and biocompatible to minimize fibrosis and inflammation, (iii) highly sensitive to detect ENS APs from background noise and (iv) durable for long-term chronic monitoring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To meet these stringent requirements, we developed a graphene-based electrode array that can be integrated onto the abdominal window to measure electrical activities in the ENS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consisting of a carbon sheet one atom thick, graphene offers unique advantages as a transparent material with superb conductivity (zero bandgap), biocompatibility (an inert surface) and strength (Youngs modulus higher than diamond and 207 times stronger than steel by weight)24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The chip contains nine graphene electrodes, ranging from 50â€‰m by 50â€‰m to 500â€‰m by 500â€‰m.

session (replicate) was conducted in a new animal each time, except for chronic recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings were repeated in four different animals for each chemical stimulation (acetylcholine, bethanechol, serotonin or tegaserod), with a total of 20 recording sessions in distinct animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recordings with TTX application were repeated in three different animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chronic recordings were compared between responsive and non-responsive animals recorded on days 1, 3 and 5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  470â€‰nm stimulation experiments were repeated in four NOS1-creERT2:Chr2 mice and four wild-type mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P-values were determined using paired, one-sided t-tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data analysis', 'Electrical data were analysed in MATLAB to identify spikes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For consistency between recordings, a lower threshold was determined using a minimum signal-to-noise ratio.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An upper threshold was also used to filter out artefacts in the signal caused by violent perturbations because of stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The code was not changed between analyses of experiments to maintain consistency and prevent bias.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Once spikes had been identified, the effect of each stimulant was determined by calculating the percentage of spikes occurring before and after the stimulus in each recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For consistency, the time window being analysed before the stimulus is the same length of time being analysed after the stimulus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This time window is at least 2â€‰min for all recordings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Optical data were analysed in ImageJ software.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean grey value was calculated for regions containing dynamic GCaMP fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean grey value, proportional to the amount of fluorescence, was used to determine the relative activity level during the optical recording.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability',
