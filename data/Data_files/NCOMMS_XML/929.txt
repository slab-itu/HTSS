The human amygdala parametrically encodes the intensity of specific facial emotions and their categorical ambiguity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The human amygdala is a key structure for processing emotional facial expressions, but it remains unclear what aspects of emotion are processed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated this question with three different approaches: behavioural analysis of 3 amygdala lesion patients, neuroimaging of 19 healthy adults, and single-neuron recordings in 9 neurosurgical patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lesion patients showed a shift in behavioural sensitivity to fear, and amygdala BOLD responses were modulated by both fear and emotion ambiguity (the uncertainty that a facial expression is categorized as fearful or happy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found two populations of neurons, one whose response correlated with increasing degree of fear, or happiness, and a second whose response primarily decreased as a linear function of emotion ambiguity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our results indicate that the human amygdala processes both the degree of emotion in facial expressions and the categorical ambiguity of the emotion shown and that these two aspects of amygdala processing can be most clearly distinguished at the level of single neurons.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The human amygdala has long been associated with recognizing faces and facial emotions1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects who lack a functional amygdala can have a selective impairment in recognizing fearful faces4,5,6, and blood-oxygen-level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) shows activation within the amygdala that is often highest for fearful faces7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the large majority of work has focused on fearful faces1, the human amygdala is also responsive to neutral or happy faces measured using BOLD-fMRI10 and single-neuron recordings11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in some studies the amygdala responds to some extent to all facial expressions15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, amygdala neurons in non-human primates16,17 respond to faces, face identities, facial expressions, gaze directions and eye contact18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, recent neuroimaging studies still argue for a disproportionate amygdala response to facial expressions related to threat (fear and anger21) and lesion studies provide strong support for a role in recognizing fear2,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is worth noting that the above-mentioned lesion studies encompass damage to both basolateral and centromedial nuclei.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, patients with lesions involving only the basolateral, but sparing the centromedial nuclei, have revealed diverging results from those with such complete lesions, typically showing a hypersensitivity to fear22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the three amygdala lesion patients we study here, most of the basolateral complex of the amygdala was lesioned but the centromedial nucleus was spared, and we thus hypothesized that these patients would show an increased sensitivity to fear in faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the other hand, in addition to encoding facial emotions, an alternative hypothesized function of the amygdala is to identify ambiguous stimuli and modulate vigilance and attention as a function thereof24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we tested the hypothesis that the amygdala encodes aspects of perceptual ambiguity when making judgments about facial emotions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout this study, by ambiguity we refer to the closeness to the perceptual boundary during categorical decision between two emotional facial expressions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in studies of decision-making, the term ambiguity usually refers to an absence of information about a stimulus above and beyond categorical uncertainty.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the term ambiguity here refers exclusively to categorical uncertainty, because all information about the stimulus was always available and the task was deterministic (see Discussion section for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous neuroimaging work indicates that the amygdala can differentiate stimuli that vary in their perceptual ambiguity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the amygdala responds strongest to highly trustworthy and untrustworthy faces but less to faces of intermediate (ambiguous) trustworthiness27,28,29, even if the faces are perceived unconsciously27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, for both faces varying along a valence dimension and faces varying along an orthogonal non-valence dimension, the amygdala responds strongest to the anchor faces30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this idea, it has been found that emotional stimuli of any type lead to greater amygdala activity compared to neutral stimuli, with comparable effect sizes for most negative and positive emotions31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these findings argue that the amygdala plays a key role in processing categorical ambiguity of dimensions represented in faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test these two theories of human amygdala function, we performed three separate studies to investigate this question at three levels of abstraction: (i) human epilepsy patients with single-neuron recordings in the amygdala, (ii) healthy subjects with fMRI, and (iii) subjects with well-defined lesions of the amygdala for behavioural analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All subjects performed the same task, in which we asked them to judge the emotion of faces that varied systematically as a function of both ambiguity and the degree of fear or happiness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The behavioural and neuroimaging results revealed a role of the amygdala in processing of both emotion degree and ambiguity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the single-neuron level, in contrast, we found clear evidence for a segregation of these two functions: we identified two separate populations of neurons, one whose response correlated with the gradual change of fearfulness or happiness of a face and a second whose response primarily correlated with decreasing level of categorical ambiguity of the emotion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This separation of function was only visible at the level of individual neurons but not at the level of BOLD-fMRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights the utility of directly recording single neurons, which enabled us to, for the first time, reveal two separate human amygdala neuron populations who signal the degree of emotion and levels of emotion ambiguity during decision making about faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our work indicates that both signals are likely used for computations performed by the amygdala.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Emotion judgments', 'We asked subjects to judge emotional faces as fearful or happy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faces were either unambiguously happy or unambiguously fearful (anchors) or graded ambiguous morphs between these two emotions (Fig 1a,b and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were 3 patients with focal bilateral amygdala lesions (Supplementary Fig 2), 9 neurosurgical patients (14 sessions; Supplementary Table 1) and 19 healthy subjects for the fMRI study, as well as another 15 healthy control subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the three amygdala lesion patients, most of the basolateral complex (lateral, basal and accessory basal nuclei) was lesioned bilaterally but the central, medial and cortical nuclei of the amygdala were intact (see Supplementary Fig 2 and Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern of amygdala damage has been previously reported to result in possibly exaggerated (hypervigilant) responses to fear stimuli22,23,32 (see Discussion for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Behavioural results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A face was presented for 1 s followed by a question asking subjects to identify the facial emotion (fearful or happy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After a blank screen of 500 ms, subjects were then asked to indicate their confidence in their decision (1 for very sure, 2 for sure or 3 for unsure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Faces are not shown to scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Sample stimuli of one female identity ranging from 0% fear/100% happy to 100% fear/0% happy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (cq) Behavioural results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Group average of psychometric curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The psychometric curves show the proportion of trials judged as fearful as a function of morph levels (ranging from 0% fearful (100% happy;

xhalf: unpaired two-tailed t-test: t(27)=1.10, not significant (NS); : t(27)=1.98, NS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the amygdala lesion patients (xhalf=44.2±1.88%) were more likely to judge faces as fearful, with xhalf significantly lower than neurosurgical patients (Fig 1d; xhalf=53.2±4.97%; t(15)=3.00, P=0.0089, effect size in Hedges g: g=1.81, permutation P less_than 0.001) and controls (xhalf=51.1±5.16%; t(16)=2.23, P=0.040, g=1.34, permutation P=0.058) and  significantly steeper (Fig 1e; t(15)=3.85, P=0.0016, g=2.33, permutation P=0.002).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also confirmed these behavioural results with a logistic mixed model (Supplementary Notes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our results suggest that amygdala lesion patients had an abnormally low threshold for reporting fear, a finding consistent with prior reports22,33 (see Discussion section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Confidence judgments', 'We defined emotion ambiguity as the variability in judging the emotion of a given morphed face.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The more variable the judgment, the more ambiguous is the face (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After reporting a face as fearful or happy, we asked subjects to report their confidence in their decisions (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects reported significantly higher levels of confidence for anchor faces (no ambiguity) compared to the ambiguous faces (Fig 1f,j,n; one-way repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) of morph levels; lesion: F(6,12)=3.22, P=0.040, 2=0.36; neurosurgical: F(6,72)=16.6, P=6.15 × 1012, 2=0.11; control: F(6,84)=27.2, P=8.26 × 1018, 2=0.40).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, reaction times (RT) for the fearful/happy judgment were faster for anchor faces compared to ambiguous faces (Fig 1g,k,o; lesion: F(6,12)=2.20, NS, 2=0.13; neurosurgical: F(6,78)=9.09, P=1.56 × 107, 2=0.059; control: F(6,84)=12.3, P=7.12 × 1010, 2=0.14; Supplementary Fig 3a; fMRI: F(6,108)=8.45, P=1.59 × 107, 2=0.044).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For further analyses, we grouped all trials into three levels of ambiguity (Fig 1b; anchor, intermediate (30%/70% morph), and high (4060% morph)), which showed the expected systematic relationships with confidence (Fig 1h,l,p) and RT (Fig 1i,m,q and Supplementary Notes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, this relationship was similar in all subject groups including the amygdala lesion patients, arguing that amygdala lesion patients were not impaired in judging ambiguity and confidence, even though they were atypical in how they judged the degree of fear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Functional neuroimaging', 'We next conducted a fMRI study with 19 healthy subjects using the same morphed face stimuli and task (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each subject first performed a separate face localizer task to identify a functional region of interest (ROI) within the amygdala sensitive to faces (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first compared the response of voxels within the functional ROI as a function of emotion degree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that activation correlated with the degree of emotion (interestingly, increasing activation correlated positively with the degree of happiness, negatively with the degree of fear) specifically within the left amygdala (Fig 2a; peak: Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate: x=21, y=6, z=15, Z=3.22, 6 voxels, family-wise error (FWE) P less_than 0.05, small volume corrected (SVC)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average BOLD signal within the entire ROI in the left amygdala was significantly negatively correlated with increasing fear levels (Fig 2b; Pearson correlation: r=0.79, P=0.034; see Supplementary Fig 4b and Supplementary Table 2 for whole-brain results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: fMRI results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Fear levels were negatively correlated with the BOLD activity in the left amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used a functional amygdala ROI defined by the localizer task (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The generated statistical parametric map was superimposed on anatomical sections of the standardized MNI T1-weighted brain template.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Images are in neurological format with subject left on image left.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R: right.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Parameter estimate (beta values) of the GLM for each fear level (Pearson correlation: r=0.79, P=0.034).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colour scale denotes increasing degree of fear (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars denote one s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  across 19 subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Ambiguity levels were correlated with the BOLD activity in the right amygdala (functional ROI defined by localizer task).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Time course of the BOLD response in the right amygdala (averaged across all voxels in the cluster) in units of TR (TR=2 s) relative to face onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars denote one s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  across subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One-way repeated ANOVA at each TR: *P less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Parameter estimate of the GLM for each ambiguity level (one-way repeated-measure ANOVA, P=0.0025).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars denote one s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  across subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Asterisks indicate significant difference between conditions using paired two-tailed t-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Mean GLM parameter estimate of all voxels within the functional ROI for each side of the amygdala and for each aspect of the emotion coding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars denote one s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  across subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-test against 0: **P less_than 0.01, and +: P less_than 0.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Peak voxel activity within the basolateral nuclei (BLA) and central nuclei (CeA) for each aspect of the emotion coding.Full size image', 'Next, we investigated whether the amygdala BOLD signal correlated significantly with ambiguity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This time we found a significant increase of activity in the right, but not the left, amygdala with decreasing level of ambiguity (Fig 2c; peak: x=30, y=0, z=21, Z=3.17, 17 voxels, FWE P less_than 0.05, SVC) (see Supplementary Fig 4c and Supplementary Table 2 for other areas).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time course of the BOLD signal in the right amygdala as a function of different ambiguity levels revealed that anchor faces elicited the strongest BOLD response while the most ambiguous faces elicited the weakest response (Fig 2d,e; one-way repeated ANOVA of parameter estimate (beta values): F(2,36)=7.10, P=0.0025, 2=0.062; average % BOLD change of TR 3 and 4: F(2,36)=2.55, NS, 2=0.051).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference between anchor versus intermediate ambiguous faces was no greater than that between intermediate versus the most ambiguous faces (paired t-test on beta values: t(18)=1.44, NS, g=0.58), suggesting that different levels of ambiguity were encoded with similar strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that when modelling with four ambiguity levels (anchor, 30%/70% morph, 40%/60% morph and 50% morph), and/or when adding RT as another orthogonalized parametric modulator, we derived essentially the same results (Supplementary Fig 4fn).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the observed correlation with ambiguity appeared to track the degree of ambiguity parametrically and could not be attributed simply to different RTs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the above results remain qualitatively the same when using an anatomical ROI of the entire amygdala (Supplementary Fig 4d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Confirming the lateralized results described above, the average BOLD signal within the entire functional ROI of the amygdala showed a marginally significant interaction between the laterality of activation and the aspect of emotion coding (Fig 2f; repeated-measure ANOVA of laterality (left versus right) × emotion aspect (degree versus ambiguity): F(1,18)=4.04, P=0.060, 2=0.0018).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the fusiform face area also tracked the emotion degree and ambiguity (Supplementary Notes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we found that both emotion degree and ambiguity modulated the BOLD signal of the amygdala, with the left amygdala primarily tracking the degree of happiness and the right amygdala primarily tracking ambiguity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Amygdala neurons encode the degree of fear or happiness', 'Finally, we investigated the amygdalas role in emotion and ambiguity at the single-neuron level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We recorded from 234 single neurons ( greater than 0.2 Hz mean firing rate) in the amygdalae of 9 neurosurgical patients implanted with depth electrodes (Supplementary Table 1; see Supplementary Fig 5 for spike sorting quality metrics) while they performed the same task (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, we recorded 14 sessions (as is customary in analyses of human single-unit recordings, neurons from each individual recording session were considered independent even if they were from the same patient because it was not possible to reliably record the same neurons across sessions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We quantified the response of each neuron based on the number of spikes observed after stimulus onset (1.5 s window, starting 250 ms after stimulus onset, as is customary given the long latencies of human amygdala neurons34,35).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ninety-six neurons (41.0%) were responsive to the onset of faces (response versus firing rate at baseline 1 s before stimulus onset; paired two-tailed t-test, P less_than 0.05; 59 increased and 37 decreased activity compared to baseline; binomial test on the number of significant cells: P less_than 1020).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This substantial proportion of face-responsive neurons in the amygdala is similar to previous studies13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next investigated whether neurons were modulated by emotion degree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the response of 33 neurons (14.1%; binomial P less_than 107; 15 were also face responsive; see Supplementary Fig 7e,f for chance levels and Supplementary Notes for control analysis) was correlated with morph levels (averaged separately for each morph level, linear regression with %fearful at P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following, we refer to this group of neurons as emotion-tracking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were two subtypes of such responses: 21/33 neurons increased their firing rate as a function of the degree of fear (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 7a,c), whereas 12/33 increased their firing rate as a function of the degree of happiness (Fig 3b and Supplementary Fig 7b,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Emotion-tracking neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Example neuron that increased its firing rate as a function of %fear (linear regression, P=0.024).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Example neuron that increased its firing rate as a function of %happy (P=0.032).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Right shows the average firing rate for each morph level 250- to 1,750-ms post-stimulus onset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grey lines represent linear fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars denote ±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  across trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Waveforms for each unit are shown at the left.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Histogram of regression R2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neurons that had a higher firing rate for fearful faces are shown on the right of 0, whereas neurons that had a higher firing rate for happy faces are shown on the left.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fear-tracking neurons are in red, happy-tracking neurons are in blue, whereas non-emotion-tracking neurons are in grey.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Slope of linear regression fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grey: non-emotion-tracking neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red: fear-tracking neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue: happy-tracking neurons.Full size image', 'The linear model we used revealed that a substantial proportion of variance was explained by a continuous response as a function of the degree of fear or happiness (see Fig 3c for R2), with an average absolute slope of 0.80±0.75 Hz/100%fear (Fig 3d;

using the atlas of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37), consistent with the altered emotion judgement in lesion patients and the distribution of emotion-tracking neurons (both of which also involved primarily the BLA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, activation by emotion ambiguity (Fig 2c) also appeared in the basolateral nucleus (all voxels), consistent with the distribution of ambiguity-coding neurons (also see Fig 2g for peak voxel activity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These commonalities should, however, be considered cautiously, given the limited spatial resolution to differentiate individual amygdala nuclei across all our measures, especially fMRI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With the fMRI study, we were able to detect effects of emotion ambiguity and effects of fear degree in the right and left amygdala, respectively (Fig 2ae).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we found consistent results also with our single-neuron recordings: consistently, the distribution of emotion-tracking neurons showed a similar difference in laterality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significantly higher proportion of emotion-tracking neurons was in the left versus right amygdala (left: 16.6%, right: 6.9%; 2-test: P=0.018; Supplementary Table 1), and interestingly, 11 out of the 12 neurons showing increasing firing rate with the degree of happiness were in the left amygdala, consistent with the BOLD signal in the left amygdala that increased as a function of happy degree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although different sides of the amygdala might focus on encoding different aspects of the emotion, it is worth noting that both sides of the amygdala encoded both aspects to some extent (Fig 2f), even though the BOLD signal did not reach statistical significance in all cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the observation of both types of neurons bilaterally and that ambiguity-coding neurons were observed in approximately equal proportions (left: 11.8%, right: 13.8%;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We used happyfear morphed faces to test for neural representations of emotion degree and emotion ambiguity in the human amygdala across three different approaches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients with amygdala lesions had an abnormal sensitivity to the degree of fear but showed normal metrics of ambiguity (confidence and RT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, our fMRI study showed that the BOLD signal within the amygdala decreased with both the degree of fearfulness and the categorical emotion ambiguity, albeit on different sides of the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our electrophysiological study revealed one population of neurons that tracked the degree of fear or happiness in a face while another population of neurons primarily tracked decreasing categorical ambiguity (the uncertainty that a stimulus is either fear or happy).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings argue for the coding of both emotion intensity and categorical ambiguity in the amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crucially, we found that these effects could only be fully disentangled at the level of single neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used a unique combination of approaches to address the debate of whether the human amygdala encodes the degree of fear and happiness and/or categorical ambiguity between emotions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Different methods measure different signals and have therefore often pointed to somewhat different conclusions, likely accounting in good part for discrepant conclusions in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we used identical stimuli and task, our three different methods still produced somewhat different conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since our single-unit data clearly shows that the amygdala encodes both emotion degree and ambiguity, more macroscopic methods (fMRI, lesion) can provide evidence for either emotion degree or ambiguity codinggiven that both types of neurons are intermingled, there is in principle signal to produce either interpretation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is important to note that the relationship between the BOLD-fMRI signal and neuronal population activity in general remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, there is a marked dissociation during perceptual suppression in non-human primates38, and we found that the neuronal population activity matched the direction of BOLD signals for emotion ambiguity but not degree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An estimation of the exact proportion of each type of emotion-tracking neurons and the coupling between the BOLD and electrophysiological signals was limited by the number of neurons that we could sample; future studies with substantially more recording of neurons will be necessary to answer these questions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously used sparsely sampled bubbled faces to argue that neurons in the human amygdala encode subjective fear/happy judgments rather than objective stimulus properties35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, with those stimuli, different random parts of faces are revealed in every trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes it difficult to determine the relationship between stimulus input and behavioural output, because both variables change trial-by-trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we used morphed stimuli that disambiguate stimulus properties and subjective behavioural judgments, because in different trials, different decisions are made for the same stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this approach, we here conclusively demonstrated that responses of human amygdala neurons reflect the subjective decision in trials where only the decision, but not the sensory input, is variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that, when selecting neurons based on a contrast such as fear versus happy or ambiguity level, the two variables (sensory input and decision) co-vary and such selections are therefore not appropriate to disambiguate these two scenarios.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, our approach was to use a model that considers the activity of all recorded neurons, regardless of selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our conclusions rest on comparing two emotions (fearful and happy), and we chose the fear/happy contrast because of the large existing literature on this pair of emotions, which has been used in a series of prior studies of the amygdala7,9,22,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a control, we also tested another pair of emotions (anger versus disgust) and found similar conclusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains an open question whether our results generalize to other emotions, or indeed might generalize to ambiguity about stimuli other than facial emotions, or about decisions that do not involve emotions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The existing literature uses the term ambiguity for two entirely different constructs, and it is important to distinguish the two to properly frame our results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first definition, which we used throughout, refers to the closeness to categorical boundaries (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39 for a classical example of perceptual ambiguity that uses the same meaning of ambiguity as we did here).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second definition, which we did not refer to here, is related to missing information about stimuli in economic decision-making.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In studies of face processing such as ours, the probability of stimuli belonging to one or the other category (that is, fear/happiness, trustworthy/untrustworthy) is known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, increased amygdala responses to the second type of ambiguity have been found in studies on decision-making that do not involve ambiguous choices between two facial attributes24,26,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to this finding, other studies find increased amygdala responses to certainty in tasks where an ambiguous choice is made between two options for a face27,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus fMRI studies on categorical ambiguity are consistent with our present result by showing that the amygdala tracks the categorical certainty and often shows a minimal response when categorical ambiguity is highest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our results fit with a subset of studies on the amygdalas role in coding perceptual ambiguity/certainty, specifically those studies that investigate the same construct of ambiguity as ours27,28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, emotion ambiguity and certainty are closely related and inversely correlated, and these neurons might encode emotion certainty or confidence in emotion judgment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we interpret any change in firing rate, or in BOLD signal, as carrying information, and therefore do not further interpret the sign of that change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although all our stimuli should be equally attended given the task demands of having to make judgments about them, we acknowledge that task difficulty, attention, mental efforts and RT are of course all intercorrelated to some extent, and future studies will be needed to further distinguish the possible contribution of attentional effects in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, future studies will be necessary to investigate whether ambiguity-coding neurons are from a circuit separate from the emotion-tracking neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, ambiguity-coding neurons might pool the activity of emotion-tracking neurons to generate the ambiguity signal, that is, ambiguity-coding neurons effectively code for the absolute degree of emotions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second hypothesis predicts that ambiguity-coding neurons would respond later in time relative to emotion-tracking neurons, a hypothesis that remains to be tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our three amygdala lesion patients, most of the basolateral complex of the amygdala was lesioned but the centromedial nucleus was intact, an important difference to the complete amygdala lesion that has been studied in detail in patient S.M.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (refs 32, 42).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BLA is the primary source of visual input to the amygdala and the centromedial amygdala is a primary source of output to subcortical areas relevant for the expression of innate emotional responses and associated physiological responses43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centromedial amygdala provides most of the amygdala projections to hypothalamic and brainstem nuclei that mediate the behavioural and visceral responses to fear44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the projection neurons in the central nucleus are mostly inhibitory, and are, in turn, inhibited by inhibitory intercalated cells in the lateral and basal amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disinhibition through this pathway is thought to lead to the expression of emotional responses43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although direct evidence of the role of amygdala subregions in threat and fear processing comes predominantly from rodent lesion research47 and optogenetics48, our present finding of a lowered threshold for reporting fear for morphed faces is consistent with prior human amygdala lesion results: patient S.M., who has complete amygdala damage including both basolateral and centromedial nuclei, showed an increased threshold for reporting fear (the opposite of our finding)2, while another group of five patients with only BLA damage demonstrated a hyper-vigilance for fearful faces (similar to our finding)22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A putative mechanism explaining this difference between the two types of amygdala lesion patients comes from optogenetic work in rodents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific activation of the terminals that project from the BLA to the central nucleus reduces fear and anxiety in rodents, whereas inhibition of the same projection increases anxiety49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thus possible that the partial amygdala lesions in our three subjects removed a normal inhibitory brake on fear sensitivity and resulted in exaggerated sensitivity to emotion mediated by the disinhibited central nucleus, just like in the prior studies22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is worth noting that the intact judgment of ambiguity in amygdala lesion patients suggests that the amygdalas response to ambiguity is not an essential component for behavioural judgments of emotion ambiguity and that such judgments may sufficiently rely on structures elsewhere in the brain that also represent information about ambiguity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies could further probe this issue by conducting fMRI studies like ours but in patients with lesions to the amygdala.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Decisions about faces are frequently ambiguous, including those about facial emotions, and optimal decision-making thus requires an assessment of ambiguity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus expect that an assessment of uncertainty is a crucial variable represented in areas concerned with decision-making about faces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have further shown that the activity of amygdala neurons correlates with the confidence in emotion judgment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, this shows that two closely related variables with meta-information about the decision itself (fear/happy) are represented in the amygdala, one based on objective discriminability of the stimuli and the second based on the subjective judgment of their discriminability: ambiguity and confidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies of the amygdala frequently report lateralized amygdala activity, indicating a clear hemisphere-specific processing difference between the left and right amygdalae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such lateralization has been observed in a wide range of tasks, with diverse approaches, and across species, such as category-specific single-neuron responses to animals in the right human amygdala50, differential electrophysiological and biochemical properties of the amygdala neurons in pain processing in rats51 and left amygdala BOLD-fMRI activation to fearful eye whites in humans9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we also found lateralized fMRI activation: the left amygdala by emotion degree and the right amygdala by emotion ambiguity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The left amygdala activation is consistent with the left-lateralized response reported to fearful eyes9,52, and the right amygdala activation by ambiguity may be related to findings showing that the right amygdala BOLD signal correlates with the overall strength of a faces trustworthiness27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A possible caveat to the study of lateralization of single-neuron responses with epilepsy patients is that people with epilepsy have a higher rate of abnormal lateralization of function, with often more bilateral representations than people without epilepsy53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also worth noting that the laterality of neuronal response matched BOLD-fMRI in some aspects but not the others in the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution fMRI, precise localization of the electrodes and more neurons recorded will be necessary in future studies to further address this question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, our electrophysiological results demonstrate that neurons in the amygdala can signal both the categorical ambiguity and the degree of emotional facial expressions and that they do so in largely non-overlapping neuronal populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Findings from fMRI would thus be expected also to show coding of these two parameters, depending on the details of task demands and statistical power.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, both the fMRI and the single-unit recordings suggested a relatively lateralized representation of emotion degree in the left amygdala (primarily tracking the degree of happiness in the face), a finding that may be related to the lexical demands of classifying our stimuli into discrete emotions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A methodological contribution of our study is that, while all three methods we used support a role for the amygdala in processing facial emotion, the detailed conclusions about such a role may look quite different, depending on the method used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While unrealistic in most cases, we would nonetheless
