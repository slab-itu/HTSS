Large-scale inference of protein tissue origin in gram-positive sepsis plasma using quantitative targeted proteomics  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The plasma proteome is highly dynamic and variable, composed of proteins derived from surrounding tissues and cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the complex processes that control the composition of the plasma proteome, we developed a mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy to infer the origin of proteins detected in murine plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strategy relies on the construction of a comprehensive protein tissue atlas from cells and highly vascularized organs using shotgun mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein tissue atlas was transformed to a spectral library for highly reproducible quantification of tissue-specific proteins directly in plasma using SWATH-like data-independent mass spectrometry analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the method can determine drastic changes of tissue-specific protein profiles in blood plasma from mouse animal models with sepsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strategy can be extended to several other species advancing our understanding of the complex processes that contribute to the plasma proteome dynamics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The blood plasma proteome is maintained by influx and efflux of proteins from surrounding cells and organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The liver secretes the majority of the highly abundant plasma proteins, the so-called classical plasma proteins, involved in plasmas principal functions such as serving as transport medium, provide colloid osmotic pressure and maintaining hemostasis through the complement and coagulation systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood plasma also contains numerous other tissue proteins that most likely do not contribute to the principal functions of blood plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This group of proteins exists in larger numbers1 than the classical plasma proteins and their role, if any, in the plasma is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A subset of these proteins may be waste products resulting from the normal turnover of proteins and cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is probable that many, but not all, of the proteins found in plasma are under homeostatic control and play important or vital roles in healthy or diseased states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Currently, detailed understanding of the factors behind the control of the blood plasma proteome is still missing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains unknown to what extent various tissues can alter the blood plasma composition under healthy and pathological conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent development of SWATH-like data-independent analysis mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) facilitates the acquisition of close-to-complete digital representations of analysed trypsin-cleaved proteomes from biological samples2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, protein identities and quantities are extracted from the DIA-MS maps using a spectral library constructed from previously acquired shotgun MS analyses3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present how a priori constructed spectral libraries can be extended to include information regarding protein tissue distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of extensive shotgun MS analysis of several organs and cell types in mice, we created a tissue atlas, a distribution map of the tissue proteomes across highly vascularized organs and cells adjacent to the blood plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting shotgun MS data were transformed to a spectral library, and based on the protein distribution map in the tissue atlas it is possible to infer protein origin of the detected proteins in the blood plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We applied the spectral library and DIA-MS to characterize the blood plasma proteome dynamics during severe sepsis using mice as a model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sepsis is a life-threatening condition responsible for over 8 million deaths every year5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathogenesis of sepsis involves both exaggerated inflammation and immune suppression, caused by a dysregulated and overwhelming immune response to microbial pathogens present in the blood stream6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sepsis is a multifactorial and systemic disease with rapid disease progression that can lead to vascular leakage and multiple organ failure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it can be expected that the complex pathogenesis in sepsis results in changes in tissue protein concentrations in the blood plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that DIA-MS analysis of septic blood plasma reveals a drastic reorganization of the blood plasma proteome related to disease severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The plasma proteome response is complex and involves subgroups of proteins that are regulated differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Part of the plasma proteome followed a dose-dependent reorganization, while another group of tissue proteins were increased in the most severely ill animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase of tissue proteins in critically ill animals may indicate early signs of organ failure, a hallmark of sepsis pathology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Construction of a murine protein tissue atlas', 'Construction of a tissue atlas requires deep proteome analysis of isolated tissues and cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we focused on heavily vascularized organs: liver, kidney, spleen, lung, heart, blood plasma and adjacent cell types such as leukocytes, erythrocytes, platelets and blood vessels (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The organs, cell types and blood plasma were isolated from healthy Balb-C mice along with additional blood plasma samples from two different mouse strains: non-Swiss albino and C57BL6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, for one additional Balb-C blood plasma sample, the most abundant plasma proteins were removed using a depletion column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The isolated organs and cells were homogenized and the extracted proteins were separated by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After in-gel digestion, peptides were analysed by shotgun liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shotgun data were analysed using two databases, UniProt and PANTHER8; UniProt is larger and therefore contains more proteoforms compared with the smaller and more consistently annotated PANTHER database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 1% false discovery rate, we identified 8,240 and 6,652 unique proteins, respectively, and this difference is a result of the more complex protein inference problem in the larger database as 95% of all identified peptides were shared between the two searches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein tissue distribution was established using percentage distribution of scaled spectral counts as previously described9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the distribution profiles between the proteomes using Pearson correlation revealed three major distinct groups (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most clearly defined sample group contains all the plasma samples and shows a high degree of similarity with a correlation of 0.96 or higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second group consists of proteomes from the organs: lung, liver, heart, spleen, aorta and kidney.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The last group is the most distant to the other proteomes and includes the blood cells: platelets, leukocytes and erythrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The protein distribution profiles are presented as a heat map in Fig 1c (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heat map reveals that the number of unique proteins for a single cell type or organ is not evenly distributed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, there is a considerable overlap regarding protein content between the different organs and cells, but the protein abundance levels for a subset of the proteins are distinct between anatomical locations, as previously shown11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Construction of a tissue-specific protein abundance atlas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Vascularized organs, plasma and cells adjacent to the blood plasma were collected from healthy Balb-C mice.

identified proteins per organ, blood vessel and cells is shown in brackets below the heat map.Full size image', 'Enrichment of protein function in the protein tissue atlas', 'To assess whether the tissue- and cell-derived proteome maps are enriched for expected protein functions, we subdivided all the identified proteins into nine clustered expression profiles using k-mean clustering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was followed by functional enrichment analysis to determine functional groups associated with the different protein clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are presented as heat maps and the average spectral count distribution of the proteins within one cluster is shown as coloured bar plots of the individual heat maps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two clusters contain proteins found in plasma (Fig 2a III), whereas the other seven clusters include more tissue-specific proteins (Fig 2a IIIIX).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, cluster I consists of proteins that are almost exclusively represented in plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This cluster contains the most typical plasma proteins and is as expected enriched for biological functions such as the complement and coagulation systems (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cluster II is distributed evenly across both plasma and tissue proteomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Basic biological functions are enriched in this group such as protease inhibitors, cellcell adhesion proteins and members of the host defense system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of the well-known plasma proteins also reside in this group, as the analysed organs are highly vascularized and contain residual amounts of blood plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third cluster (III) consists of proteins that are present predominantly in all tissues and cells (Fig 2a III) but hardly detectable in plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of the biological functions enriched in this group are essential for basal cellular function such as cytoskeletal proteins or proteins involved in intracellular signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A common feature for the first three groups (Fig 2a IIII) is that they contain highly abundant proteins, contributing to over 64.5% of all measured MS spectra (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly, the plasma proteins that reside in cluster I and II are highly abundant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These two clusters contain 9.6% of all identified proteins but represents 33.2% of all MS spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining clusters contain in contrast less abundant proteins and display to a larger extent more tissue-specific protein profiles (Fig 2a IVIX).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These clusters reveal an enrichment of proteins with tissue-specific functions such as drug metabolism for liver (cytochrome P450 enzymes), contractile proteins for heart, proteins associated with surface tension in alveoli for lungs and ion transporters for kidney (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2c highlights the tissue distribution of selected proteins with high tissue specificity (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, several of the proteins are detectable in blood plasma and some of them are, or have been, used in the clinical routine to determine, for example, myocardial infarction14 or to classify hypertension15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that the protein distribution map can capture tissue-specific profiles correlating to the predominant biological functions associated with the analysed organs and cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Protein function enrichment of the tissue-specific protein abundance atlas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

injections, a total of 1,768 proteins were detectable in plasma from control animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue distribution of these 1,768 proteins across the analysed organs and cells can be used to infer the most likely origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used a 30% relative abundance across the tissues for a discrete protein tissue assignment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These tissue assignments have a considerable overlap with previously published proteome tissue maps16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared the results obtained in this work with a tissue-specific human data set based on RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry data16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At a relative intensity threshold of 30% spectral abundance across the tissues, 100% of the true-positive matches could be recovered, corresponding to a false discovery rate of roughly 26% determined using a receiver operator characteristics (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, functional enrichment for the proteins in the subdivided groups reveals enrichment of tissue-specific functions (Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We visualized the protein distribution between tissues and cells for all the proteins detectable in blood plasma using a circular polar histogram17 (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polar histogram contains bar plots for all the 1,768 proteins arranged in a circular fashion and the relative distribution of protein levels across tissues and cells are indicated by colours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The graph captures the vast majority of known classical plasma proteins in the protein group denoted as plasma (pink colour in Fig 3a), exemplified by proteins from the complement and coagulation systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These proteins are relatively few in number but highly abundant in blood plasma accounting for close to 70% of the total MS spectra (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This protein group includes typical plasma proteins discovered in Fig 2a III.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining proteins (non-plasma protein) are predominantly present in the different organs or cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of these non-plasma proteins have an even distribution between organs and cells, denoted as common in Fig 3a and Supplementary Figs 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these two protein groups (plasma and common) represent  greater than 90% of the detectable MS spectra in blood plasma from healthy animals (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To summarize, these results show that the blood plasma proteome can be subdivided into two fractions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One smaller fraction primarily comprised highly expressed and well-characterized blood plasma proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other fraction consists of protein predominantly expressed in the different organs and cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This part is more numerous and contains proteins of low abundance, many of which are evenly distributed between the different organs and cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, in the latter group several proteins reside with a high level of tissue specificity, primarily from cells present in the blood plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, all the shotgun MS results were used to construct a spectral library as previously described3,18,19 representing one of the largest constructed spectral libraries for mice containing in total 66,857 unique peptides, corresponding to 258,027 spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

identity and quantity from raw data obtained via DIA-MS4 using previously published software solutions3,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue atlas provides the means to measure how surrounding tissues, all organs, blood vessel and cells, influence the composition of the blood plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We applied this strategy to determine changes in the plasma proteome in mice progressing from a non-septic to a septic status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mimic the host response observed in sepsis, we inoculated wild-type Balb-C mice with a mouse virulent Streptococcus pyogenes strain by subcutaneous injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this experiment, we used 26 separate Balb-C mice in five different dose groups, where four mice served as control (PBS-injected).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining 22 mice were divided into four groups and subcutaneously infected with S. pyogenes bacteria with different concentrations (3.75 × 106, 7.5 × 106, 15 × 106 and 30 × 106).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were killed after 48 h and citrated blood was collected using cardiac puncture and 1 l non-depleted plasma was used for DIA-MS analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average weight loss within each group was directly

samples or more.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heat maps represent the protein expression of all the 786 identified plasma proteins in all the 26 animals subdivided into defined clusters using t-SNE20

that were regulated differently.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clusters 1, 3 and 5 contain proteins that are induced or repressed in a dose-dependent manner while the proteins in cluster 4 and 6 remained relatively constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proteins in cluster 2 on the other hand displayed a distinct expression pattern and were primarily increased in some of the most critically ill animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It appears that the concentration of these proteins suddenly increase once a certain threshold is reached, perhaps owing to cell necrosis and leakage of intracellular proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The different clusters suggest that there are two major response patterns in plasma during severe sepsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One group of proteins appears to be mobilized against the invading pathogen relating to disease severity whereas the second group is altered as a consequence of the disease since they are primarily expressed in the most severely ill animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Adding the protein tissue atlas to the data matrix and visualizing the proteins in a polar histogram indicates how the specific tissue profiles are distributed over the clusters (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The

different bacterial dose groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the plasma proteins, nearly 75% of the proteins are regulated in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 5b,c), whereas 22% of the proteins remained constant (cluster 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information is supported by functional enrichment of cluster 1 and 3 where enriched groups are complement proteins, proteins associated with cell adhesion and the immune response and several positive acute-phase proteins (Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also several tissue-specific proteins that are regulated in a similar dose-dependent manner exemplified with some of the tissue-specific proteins shown in Fig 3c (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, several of the proteins originating from surrounding organs and cells display a protein expression pattern defined in cluster 2 (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, almost all (99%) of the proteins within this group (cluster 2 in Fig 4b) are primarily derived from surrounding organs and cells including several known markers for cell necrosis such as lactate dehydrogenase (Supplementary Fig 4)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cluster 2 is enriched for functional protein groups essential for basal intracellular functions such as cell cycle, glycolysis and mitosis (Supplementary Data 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly proteins from platelets, erythrocytes, heart and leukocytes show a more drastic increase in the most affected animals (Fig 5e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, several of these tissue-specific proteins are not regulated consistently in all animals within the same

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we introduce an MS-based strategy to monitor the dynamics of tissue and cell-specific proteins in the blood plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The construction of a proteome-wide tissue atlas supports the inference of protein origin in the blood plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent analysis of blood plasma using DIA demonstrates how the spectral library can be used to quantitatively monitor close to 800 plasma- and tissue-specific proteins in a consistent and precise manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used this strategy to highlight how the surrounding tissue and cells influence the blood plasma in severe infectious diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The blood plasma proteome has over the years been extensively analysed as a source for understanding diseases in the blood and for biomarker discovery studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several biomarker discovery studies aim at finding prognostic and diagnostic factors in the blood plasma for many different types of diseases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, the underlying factors behind the control of the blood plasma proteome, down to the individual protein level, remain to a large extent unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent report demonstrated that the blood plasma proteome among humans is variable and that genetic control and longitudinal variation affect protein levels and biological processes24 underlining the complex dynamics of proteins transitioning in and out of the blood plasma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DIA-MS method is associated with quantitative reproducibility for a large number of proteins from the blood plasma, which can be used to facilitate the future assembly of large repositories of DIA-MS experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue atlas spectral library described here can further advance our understanding of how surrounding tissues and cells influence the plasma proteome and how the plasma proteome is modified as a function of disease progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This type of information is particularly relevant for systemic and multifactorial diseases such as sepsis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The quantification of biomarker groups associated with specific sepsis characteristics reveals how the groups have different regulation patterns as a consequence of disease severity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variable response observed for several of the quantified biomarkers in this study may explain why several of the biomarkers have generated unsatisfying results when tested individually.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future large-scale DIA-MS experiments on blood plasma from animals with sepsis and human sepsis patients using the tissue atlas spectral library will more accurately enable the correlation between groups of biomarkers and disease progression, disease severity and disease outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We predict that the strategy outlined here can be extended to measure how tissue proteins are regulated in many other pathological conditions improving our understanding of how surrounding tissues and cells can influence blood plasma as a consequence of disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This information can be useful to increase our knowledge of how different pathophysiological processes distort the protein composition of healthy plasma to further explore the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
