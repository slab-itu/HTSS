Endogenous adenosine maintains cartilage homeostasis and exogenous adenosine inhibits osteoarthritis progression  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by cartilage destruction and chondrocytes have a central role in this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With age and inflammation chondrocytes have reduced capacity to synthesize and maintain ATP, a molecule important for cartilage homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that concentrations of ATP and adenosine, its metabolite, fall after treatment of mouse chondrocytes and rat tibia explants with IL-1, an inflammatory mediator thought to participate in OA pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice lacking A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR) or ecto-5nucleotidase (an enzyme that converts extracellular AMP to adenosine) develop spontaneous OA and chondrocytes lacking A2AR develop an OA phenotype with increased expression of Mmp13 and Col10a1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adenosine replacement by intra-articular injection of liposomal suspensions containing adenosine prevents development of OA in rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the hypothesis that maintaining extracellular adenosine levels is an important homeostatic mechanism, loss of which contributes to the development of OA; targeting adenosine A2A receptors might treat or prevent OA.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis, affecting up to 25% of the population over 65, and 12% of all cases may be caused by prior joint trauma1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Worldwide in its distribution, the incidence of OA increases with age and the resulting pain, loss of joint function and mobility, social isolation, and a broadly reduced quality of life make OA a condition with a high medical and social impact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current treatment options are less than optimal and do not correct the underlying problem with the result that joint replacement surgery is often the eventual outcome3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'OA is characterized by changes in every structure in the joint, including cartilage destruction, synovial inflammation, osteophyte formation, enthesophytes, and significant bony changes4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The central player in OA is the chondrocyte, which responds to excess mechanical loading by releasing inflammatory mediators and proteolytic enzymes causing further cartilage damage5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, age-related inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of OA6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Adenosine is an endogenously produced physiological regulator and its intracellular and extracellular concentration is tightly controlled by oxygen consumption, cellular stress and mitochondrial functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Extracellular adenosine derives mainly from hydrolysis of ATP (primarily, but not exclusively, by the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73) and mediates its effects via activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (A1R, A2AR, A2BR and A3R).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adenosine has long been known to regulate inflammation and immune responses7,8 and work from our lab and others have demonstrated the importance of adenosine and its receptors in osteoblast, osteoclast, and bone marrow homeostasis9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior studies have suggested that adenosine receptors also regulate chondrocyte physiology and pathology in response to inflammatory stimuli in rodent, equine, bovine and human chondrocytes22,23,24,25,26 although the specific receptor(s) involved are not identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of endogenous adenosine (by addition of adenosine deaminase) or blockade of A2AR leads to cartilage degradation in equine cartilage explants27, although equine purine metabolism differs from other species as adenosine deaminase, present in lymphocytes, plasma and extracellular fluid of most species, is not present in horse lymphocytes or serum28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A3R stimulation has been reported to diminish OA development in a chemically induced model of OA30, principally due to the anti-inflammatory effects of A3R agonists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mice lacking A2AR were first developed by Chen et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in 1999 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31) and, in general, these mice have few obvious defects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, they develop osteopenia as a result of an increase in osteoclast number and function and they respond abnormally to a variety of stressors reflecting the loss of the A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as these mice age we note that they have increasing difficulty in grabbing food, walking and mating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We asked, therefore, whether the diminished mobility of A2AR-deficient mice might be due to intrinsic joint disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We report here that mice lacking A2AR spontaneously develop OA, characterized by altered cartilage composition and loss of cartilage, presence of chondrocyte hypertrophy and osteophytes, and increased subchondral bone density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rat articular cartilage explants release ATP and adenosine and load bearing in the physiological range induces further increases in extracellular adenosine levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interleukin-1 (IL-1), an inflammatory mediator that contributes to OA, diminishes ATP and adenosine release from cultured chondrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physiological loading of rat tibia increases adenosine release and is abrogated by IL-1 treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the role of adenosine in maintaining cartilage homeostasis, mice lacking CD73 also develop signs of OA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in a rat model of post-traumatic OA, intra-articular injection of liposomal suspensions containing adenosine prevent development of OA and this effect is abrogated by co-injection of an A2AR antagonist, but not an A2BR antagonist.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings indicate that extracellular adenosine, acting at A2AR, has a critical function in the maintainenance of cartilage homeostasis and that adenosine replacement may be a new approach to treat or prevent OA.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mobility of A2AR KO mice', 'Although the mobility of A2AR knockout (KO) mice appeared to be limited we confirmed that deletion of A2AR leads to loss of mobility by subjecting wild-type (WT) and A2AR KO mice to an open field test to quantitate movement over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The A2AR KO mice moved a shorter distance than WT mice (Fig 1a, A2AR KO=664±123 cm versus WT 1,404±129 cm; P less_than 0.001 (Students T-test), moved less quickly (velocity for A2AR KO=1.11±0.21 cm s1 versus WT 2.34±0.22 cm s1; P less_than 0.001 (Students T-test)) with increased time spent in the border of the cage (A2AR KO=575.5±7.7 s versus WT=370.2±45.6 cm s1; P less_than 0.001 (Students T-test)) and immobile (A2AR KO=530.8±11.5 s versus WT 442.3±15.4 s; P less_than 0.001 (Students T-test)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of rearing, a normal mouse exploratory behaviour (measured in the first 10 min of the field test), was also reduced in A2AR KO mice (15±4 times per 10 min, P less_than 0.0001 (Students T-test)) compared to WT mice (51±7 times per 10 min).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capacity of the A2AR KO mice to run on the rotarod apparatus with a constant acceleration was also reduced compared to the WT mice (A2AR KO=86±11 s versus WT=145±22 s, P less_than 0.01 (Students T-test)).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Osteoarthritis in A2AR KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Open field and rotarod tests were carried out in 25-week-old WT and A2AR KO mice (n=5 for each group) and the digital record analysed, as described in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shown are the mean (±s.e.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  values obtained during each 10 min interval for distance moved, immobility time, rearing frequency, velocity of motion and time spent in the border and the latency to fall in the rotarod test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Immunohistologic staining for Collagen X and MMP-13 in a representative section of tibia from a WT and A2AR KO mouse (12 week old mice, original magnification 400 X).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sections from the same mice stained with Safranin O and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) are shown in the right-hand panels (original magnification 100 X).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the lower panel is plotted the OARSI scores obtained on safranin-O-stained knees, as described in Materials and Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each data point represents the mean (±s.e.m.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of the blinded scores obtained on 45 different mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01, ***P less_than 0.001 versus WT (Student T-test or one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc test, as appropriate).Full size image', 'CT analysis of knee joints in A2AR KO and WT mice', 'Because one potential cause for the difficulty of the A2AR KO mice in mobility, holding food and breeding could be the development of arthritis we examined the knees of A2AR KO mice by CT. Three dimensional reconstruction of CT images demonstrated subchondral bony sclerosis and cartilage subsidence in the tibial heads of 8-, 12-, 26- and 52-week-old A2AR KO mice (Supplementary Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, in the same A2AR KO mice there were osteophytes that increased in size as the animals aged (Supplementary Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No bony or cartilaginous changes were observed in WT mice (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover CT analysis revealed a peak of bone volume, trabecular number and thickness in the midshaft bone of WT mice that gradually decreased with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in A2AR KO mice bone does not increase over time and then begins to decline resulting in an osteopenic phenotype once the animals reach adulthood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained for the bone mineral density values (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the subchondral area a significant decrease in bone mineral density was observed in the femurs of 8 week old mice and in the tibia and femur of 8 and 12 week old mice (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cortical area of the subchondral bone showed an initial decrease of the bone volume and density at 8 and 12 weeks and an increase of these parameters in older A2AR KO mice compared to the age-matched WT mice (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bone and cartilage changes observed were similar in male and female A2AR KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Histopathological changes in cartilage of A2AR KO mice', 'The radiologic appearance of the joints obtained by CT resembled changes seen in OA; to confirm that the radiologic changes reflected OA in the joints of the A2AR KO mice we examined histologic sections of the knees of these mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examination of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained knees revealed progressive reduction in cartilage thickness in A2AR KO mice compared to WT mice; these changes were detectable as early as 12 weeks of age (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over time there was increased fibrillation and thinning of cartilage as well, with increased subchondral bone and osteophytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chondrocytes present in the cartilage of the A2AR KO mice were increasingly disordered over time, as well.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There was significantly less glycosaminoglycan staining in the cartilage of A2AR KO mice by safranin O staining (Fig 1b) and PAS and trichrome stains further demonstrated loss of sulfated proteoglycans and collagen in the cartilage matrix (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These changes were detectable as early as 12 weeks of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunohistochemical staining showed increased MMP-13-positive and collagen X (Fig 1b), osteopontin- and fibronectin-positive cells in cartilage matrix of the A2AR KO mice starting as early as 12 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a composite score for osteoarthritic changes (OARSI score) showed marked differences between A2AR KO and WT mice, and the differences increased over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased OARSI scores were first detectable at 12 weeks of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both male and female A2AR KO mice were affected by OA although the changes were milder in females than males (e.g., OARSI score at 1 year 4.8±0.6 versus 3.2±0.2, males versus females, respectively, P less_than 0.05, n=4-5 for each (Students

hypertrophy, for example, col10a1, in addition to mediators that participate in the destruction of cartilage, for example, matrix metalloproteases like mmp13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, chondrocytes isolated from the cartilage of neonatal WT mice do not express col10a1 or mmp13 mRNA or protein (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, chondrocytes from neonatal A2AR KO mice express both of these markers of OA (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate that even shortly after birth chondrocytes from A2AR KO mice are already dysregulated and the changes likely contribute to the OA

in human OA we examined A2AR expression on chondrocytes in osteoarthritic cartilage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that A2AR were upregulated in the chondrocytes of patients with OA and appeared to colocalize with expression of MMP-13, a reflection of OA changes in chondrocytes (Supplementary Fig 3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were detected in the PTOA rat model (Supplementary Fig 3B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This change was not surprising as, in prior studies, we and others had demonstrated that there is upregulation of both A2AR receptor expression and function following exposure to inflammatory stimuli (IL-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)) which acts as a feedback regulator of inflammation in both murine and human cells32,33,34,35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One explanation for the difference between A2AR expression in human and murine OA cartilage is that the findings in A2AR KO mice do not reflect OA development in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the disparity between human and murine OA cartilage suggests that despite overexpression of A2AR there is diminished ligand for A2AR and resulting loss of A2AR function leading to development of OA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Adenosine and ATP release decrease after Il-1 treatment', 'To test the hypothesis that OA chondrocytes release less adenosine and its precursor, ATP, we quantitated adenosine and ATP release from

and that adenosine is present in supernates of cultured chondrocytes (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of primary mouse chondrocytes with IL-1 (5 ng ml1) for 24 h reduced the level of intracellular

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The results presented here provide evidence for a critical homeostatic mechanism in cartilage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chondrocytes release ATP which is converted to adenosine extracellularly; the adenosine that is present prevents the phenotypic changes in chondrocytes associated with development of OA via engagement of A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disruption of this mechanism, as a result of inflammation, injury or aging with reduction of intracellular and extracellular ATP and extracellular adenosine, leads to phenotypic changes in chondrocytes with greater expression of MMPs or collagens associated

homeostatic equilibrium to cartilage following injury by engagement of A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies of equine cartilage explants demonstrate that removal of extracellular adenosine by treatment with adenosine deaminase significantly increased the release of NO, MMP-13, MMP-3 and GAG, a cartilage matrix breakdown product, and that an A2A agonist reversed this effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggested that A2AR are tonically activated in articular chondrocytes preventing a shift in chondrocyte phenotype and chondrocyte-mediated damage to cartilage27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this finding was very interesting the marked difference between horse and other species with respect to purine metabolism (absent adenosine deaminase in the serum and nearly absent adenosine deaminase in various cell types in horses) suggested that horse tissues might be uniquely dependent on extracellular adenosine to maintain homeostasis29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the results reported here indicate that both mouse and rat chondrocytes and cartilage, respectively, release ATP and adenosine which regulates chondrocyte phenotype in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not test the hypothesis that loss of adenosine-mediated regulation of chondrocytes leads to OA-like changes in human chondrocytes or cartilage the similarity of the responses to adenosine of equine cartilage and equine, bovine and human chondrocytes22,23,24,25,26,27 suggests that the changes we observed in rats and mice are generalizable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although A2AR KO mice have been observed closely in numerous laboratories for many years their difficulty in mobility and the diminished use of their limbs in eating and mating was not remarked on, nor the cause determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that the difficulties in ambulation and other functions are most likely related to the premature development of OA in A2AR KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When examined, the A2AR KO mice have radiologic and histologic characteristics of OA, including the loss of glycosaminoglycans, collagen, and cartilage matrix with fraying, or fibrillation, and destruction of cartilage matrix, increased metalloprotease gene expression and production, chondrocyte hypertrophy, and development of osteophytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, despite the loss of bone volume and substance in A2AR KO mice, previously ascribed to increased osteoclast activity in the bone of these mice54, we observed increased subchondral bone density and osteophyte formation, paradoxical findings often observed in patients with OA55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice heterozygous for loss of A2AR and CD73 were not available for these studies although, because of the effects of inflammation on enhancing A2AR function56, it is possible that no difference from WT control mice would have been detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In cartilage samples from human OA patients and from PTOA rats, we observed an increase of chondrocyte A2AR expression suggesting that A2AR expression may be a feedback regulatory change in chondrocytes, as previously described for macrophages and endothelium33,36,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, expression profiling of chondrocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed a dramatic increase in A2AR expression as well58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to A2AR, the receptor for the parathyroid hormone (PTH), increases in OA patients and in a murine model of OA59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activation of the PTH receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor that signals via Gs like the A2AR, inhibits articular cartilage degeneration and promotes cartilage and chondrocyte regeneration59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has recently been appreciated that inflammation plays a central role in the development of OA60,61 and the findings reported here provide both confirmation of the hypothesis that inflammatory stimuli are central to the development of OA and evidence that tonic suppression of chondrocyte responses to inflammatory stimuli by A2AR ligation are important for joint homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The demonstration that loss of A2AR leads to premature OA in mice suggests that targeting A2AR might provide a useful approach to the prevention of cartilage deterioration in patients with OA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, recent studies suggest that methotrexate treatment for patients with symptomatic knee OA provides at least symptomatic relief of OA62 and many of the anti-inflammatory effects of methotrexate are mediated by methotrexate-induced increases in extracellular adenosine levels acting at A2AR and A3R63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the therapeutic trials of MTX in OA no attempt was made to evaluate changes in cartilage homeostasis or changes in cartilage destruction and it is unlikely that the short time frame of these studies could have permitted any demonstration of the effects of methotrexate on progressive cartilage loss or other manifestations of OA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although we observed a variety of effects of A2AR loss on chondrocytes and cartilage, it is likely that the loss of A2AR in other cells present in the synovium contributed to the development of OA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, an increase in osteoclast differentiation and function leads to marked osteopenia in A2AR KO mice54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, adenosine acting at A2AR diminishes expression of a variety of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF, which likely play a role in the pathogenesis of OA8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, tonic A2AR-mediated suppression of inflammatory responses maintains joint homeostasis and one approach to preventing and treating OA is to target A2AR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, testing of conditional A2AR knockouts and selective A2AR knockout on development of OA will yield a more nuanced understanding of the basis of the spontaneous OA in the A2AR knockout mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our studies we used a liposomal formulation to prolong the presence of adenosine in the joint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, preliminary studies in which we injected an aqueous solution of an A2AR agonist into joints had no effect on joint swelling or development of structural changes in the joint after anterior cruciate ligament disruption (C.C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and B.N.C., unpublished observation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We administered the liposomal adenosine preparations in both treatment and prevention groups of rats and prevented or treated joint swelling similarly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were surprised to observe that there was less structural damage to the joints, as reflected by a better OARSI score, in the rats in which the initial injection of liposomal adenosine was delayed for a week after knee injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The likely explanation for this effect is that the initial spike in inflammatory cytokines in the joint following injury of the knee which leads to chondrocyte expression of enzymes capable of destroying cartilage also leads to enhanced expression and function of A2AR in the injured tissue and, thus, a greater adenosine response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has long been appreciated that ATP levels are decreased in OA chondrocytes and this reduction in cellular ATP content may result from the effects of age, injury or inflammation on mitochondria6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are consistent with these observations and suggest how reduced intracellular ATP in chondrocytes could lead to diminished ATP release into the extracellular space resulting in diminished resistance to the phenotypic changes in chondrocytes that are associated with development of OA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, the reduction in ATP release observed here is greater than the reduction in intracellular ATP levels suggesting the possibility that there is also a reduction in the capacity of chondrocytes to export ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are a number of transporters that can export ATP to the extracellular space including ANKH and pannexins38,39 and ANKH expression is markedly reduced after exposure to IL-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  64) although the effect of injury or inflammatory mediators on pannexin-1 or pannexin-3 expression and function is less well established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, loss of pannexin-3 is protective in murine models of OA suggesting that this protein is not involved in the phenomena studied here65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observation that mice lacking expression of ANKH develop arthritis consistent with OA at an early age further supports the hypothesis that extracellular adenosine, derived from ATP, plays a homeostatic role in cartilage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further evidence for the importance of adenosine in the maintenance of cartilage and joint homeostasis is provided by the spontaneous OA observed in NT5E KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ecto-enzyme catalyses the hydrolysis of AMP to adenosine and prior studies have demonstrated that the loss of CD73 activity leads to exaggerated inflammatory responses66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently patients lacking CD73 have been described and while diffuse large artery calcification dominates the clinical picture nearly all of these patients suffer from a poorly characterized arthritis with associated periarticular calcification41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rheumatic manifestations observed in these patients are consistent with the notion that relative deficiencies in adenosine are deleterious for the structures of the joint.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another ectoenzyme, ENTPD1, which catalyses the hydrolysis of ATP and ADP to AMP, also plays an important role in endogenous suppression of inflammation although there are a number of other extracellular phosphatases capable of hydrolysing ATP, such as tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we were surprised that ENTPD1 KO mice did not develop OA it is likely that these other phosphatases hydrolysed sufficient ATP to adenosine to maintain homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We conclude that adenosine, acting at A2AR, is an important homeostatic regulator of chondrocytes and cartilage and adenosine repletion may represent a novel approach to treating OA (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Endogenous adenosine maintains cartilage homeostasis.Here we provide a conceptual model of the role of adenosine production and adenosine receptor ligation in inflammation and in the pathogenesis of OA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adenosine is generated which ligates A2AR maintaining homeostasis in cartilage after mechanical loading and other stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A2AR ligation exerts an anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effect by blocking NF-B nuclear translocation and promoting production of growth factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During OA progression a decrease of adenosine in the extracellular space occurs due partially to IL-1 effect on ATP and adenosine transporters and the enzymes involved in ATP/ADP catabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, decreased mitochondrial number, observed in OA chondrocytes, contributes to diminished cellular ATP levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, production and release of adenosine deaminase by inflammatory cells can exacerbate the progression of OA by further reduction of adenosine levels (unpublished
