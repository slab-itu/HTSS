An enduring rapidly moving storm as a guide to Saturns Equatorial jets complex structure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Saturn has an intense and broad eastward equatorial jet with a complex three-dimensional structure mixed with time variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The equatorial region experiences strong seasonal insolation variations enhanced by ring shadowing, and three of the six known giant planetary-scale storms have developed in it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These factors make Saturns equator a natural laboratory to test models of jets in giant planets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on a bright equatorial atmospheric feature imaged in 2015 that moved steadily at a high speed of 450 ms1 not measured since 19801981 with other equatorial clouds moving within an ample range of velocities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiative transfer models show that these motions occur at three altitude levels within the upper haze and clouds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the peak of the jet (latitudes 10° N to 10° S) suffers intense vertical shears reaching +2.5 ms1 km1, two orders of magnitude higher than meridional shears, and temporal variability above 1 bar altitude level.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'At the upper cloud level, the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn display a permanent system of alternating eastward and westward zonal jets whose intensity and width show few temporal changes since the first detailed measurements in 19791980 (refs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One exception is Saturns broad equatorial jet that extends from planetographic latitudes 35° N to 35° S reaching eastward peak velocities 450500 ms1 (refs 7, 8, 9) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The velocity field that traces the equatorial jet is much more complex than at other latitudes10, showing a vertical structure and temporal variability that have been so far not well-characterized, since a key part of the measurements at different altitudes were obtained in different epochs11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Equatorial jets of Jupiter and Saturn are particularly relevant to atmospheric dynamics because of their eastward flow (contrary to the equatorial westward flows that occur in other rapidly rotating planets, as Earth, Mars, Uranus and Neptune) and because of their intensity (Saturn Equatorial peak velocities reach one-third of the sound speed).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of Jupiters and Saturns jets is not well understood, and it is an open issue if they are deep or shallow in vertical extent and if they have deep or shallow forcing sources, or a mixture of both (solar heating, internal energy and latent heat release)1,2,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distinguishing between these possibilities requires a good characterization of the energy balance in the atmosphere, a quantification of the contribution of each of the above sources to forcing, a precise determination of the wind field, and knowledge of the structure of the deep atmosphere by gravity field measurement1,2,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Saturns Equatorial jet in time traced by cloud motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Voyager 1 and 2 in 19801981 (turquoise line, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7); Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 19901991 in the 889 nm methane absorption band (violet filled circles) and in 547 nm (empty circles) corresponding to the development of the 1990 GWS20; Ground-based historical GWS storms in 1876, 1933 and 1990 (magenta dots)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Cassini ISS in 2004-09 in the methane band at 889 nm (magenta line, refs 9, 13), and in 752 and 939 nm (black line, refs 9, 13); HST in 19942003 in the 889 nm methane band (blue dots)11.Full size image', 'The winds are measured by tracking features in the upper hazes and clouds close to the tropopause (at the altitude pressure level P100 mbar) and upper troposphere (P14 bar) where most solar radiation is deposited18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This layer has a thickness of 100150 km and acts as the coupling between the deep troposphere and the stratosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the equatorial region of Saturn experiences strong seasonal insolation variations enhanced by ring shadowing periods18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Saturns Equator has been the place of three of the six known Great White Spot (GWS) events that have been observed in the last 134 years19,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These giant planetary-scale storms influence the zonal winds giving insight on jet stability and forcing mechanisms23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, a semiannual oscillation (SAO) in the temperature and wind fields (occurring in the stratosphere between latitudes 15°N and 15°S) and its role in the upper troposphere represents another open issue of Saturns equatorial dynamics25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these factors make Saturns equator a natural laboratory where to test models of jet stability and generation in giant planets, a major open issue in geophysical fluid dynamics1,2,16, whose implications extend to the case of gas giant exoplanets27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we address the vertical structure and temporal variability of the puzzling Equatorial jet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images obtained in 2015 in the visual range, we were able to measure wind speeds using cloud tracking at three different altitude levels in the peak of the Equatorial jet between latitudes 20°N and 20°S.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The altitude of the tracers was retrieved using radiative transfer modelling of the spectral and geometrical dependence of the absolute reflectivity across the equatorial zone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining these wind measurements and altitude determinations with those previously reported during the last three decades, we constrain the temporal variability of the jet at different altitudes from 1980 to present, encompassing more than 1 Saturns year (29.5 years).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally we discuss these results in the context of the Equatorial dynamics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cloud morphology and long-term motion', 'Ground-based observations of Saturn obtained during the first half of 2015 showed the presence of a conspicuous white spot (WS) at red wavelengths ( 610950 nm) in the Equatorial Zone (planetographic latitude 6°N).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spot was easily detected by observers using telescopes in the range of 2540 cm in diameter contributing to the PVOL database of planetary images28 (Supplementary Table 1, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29) and with PlanetCam instrument on the 2.2 m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory30 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its motion, tracked from April to October, revealed a steady linear drift in longitude relative to the rotating reference frame System III31 with a rapid zonal velocity of u=447±1 ms1 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bright feature was accompanied by a dark spot moving at the same speed and 2° to its East (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar bright spot was found in PVOL images in JulyAugust 2014, close to the predicted position, moving rapidly with a velocity of u=445±1 ms1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The drift rate in the longitudinal position of both spots in System III was steady at a rate of 37.05° per day (for the white spot in 2015).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether these two similar features are in fact the same one tracked on different periods of time we used a reference system in which the 2015 spot is nearly stationary (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The long-term linear drifts of both spots in System III longitude allows to determine the mean speed of both spots with an accuracy of ±1 ms1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the data in hand, we cannot definitively conclude if the 2014 white spot changed slightly its drift velocity (being the same as the 2015 white spot feature), or if these are different spots which emerged separated in time but at close longitudinal positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both cases, these speeds are well above the 380 ms1 measured during the Cassini epoch at this latitude8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These high speeds at the Equator were only observed in 19801981 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7) during the Voyager flybys (Fig 1), suggesting one of the following possibilities: the spot is at a deeper level where faster winds are present15,32, or a change in the jet system have occurred since the last accurate wind measurements based on Cassini ISS data in 2009.

area in 890 nm becomes brighter than its surroundings at 336 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the dark spot being a region depleted in aerosol particles relative to its surroundings, which becomes dark in the methane bands due to gas absorption and bright in the ultraviolet due to the increasing effect of Rayleigh scattering by the gas at shorter wavelengths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

wind profiles (velocity as a function of latitude) at three different altitudes in the peak of the Equatorial jet (latitudes from 20°N to 20°S, Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we measured wind speeds in Cassini ISS images taken in April, September and October 2014 at similar wavelengths, namely red continuum (752 and 939 nm) and the strong methane absorption bands (728 and 890 nm)39 (Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then compared those winds with our previously published Cassini ISS wind profiles13 (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in the 336727890 nm wavelength group the retrieved winds from HST data globally agree with the Cassini profile at 728890 nm for 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The narrow central equatorial jet persists but a meridional broadening seems to have occurred between 2004 and 2009 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13) and during the current epoch 20142015 (Fig 7a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, at red continuum wavelengths (689750937 nm) the HST data show two groups of velocities (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One group is related to white spot and the wind speeds cluster at450 ms1 at latitudes from 2N° to 8°N.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The individual spots within the complex structure of white spot moved with speeds in the range u=425475 ms1, agreeing with ground-based data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We assume that all the points that follow these fast motions (black line in Fig 7b) are located at the same altitude level than that of the white spot, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  deeper relative to the other tracers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Globally, these rapidly moving features captured in HST images match the Voyagers mean profile, also added for comparison in Fig 7b (green line)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close to latitude 8°S, in a region where wind data from the Voyagers are not available, we find a group of tracers with high velocities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tentatively, one can identify these features as delineating a southern jet peak, symmetric in latitude to the northern one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If so, Saturns Equatorial jet at the lowest levels sampled has a similar shape to the Jupiter equatorial jet, that is, exhibiting a double symmetric peak relative to Equator1,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, the red continuum 689750937 nm wavelengths show a second group of lower velocities that follow the 2014 profile from Cassini ISS (blue and violet lines, Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This profile (Cassini 2014 and HST 2015) exhibits a velocity shift by +20 ms1 above those measured with Cassini ISS in 2004-2008 (red line, Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence in 2015 of the two different velocity profiles at red continuum wavelengths can be interpreted as the detection of clouds moving at two different altitude levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to radiative transfer modelling the profile showing low velocities corresponds to the 400700 mbar level whereas the profile with higher velocities corresponds to the 1.4 bar level (in agreement with the white spot velocity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We rule out waves as an explanation for the dual profile since no periodic structures are seen on the albedo patterns (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, as a further comparison, we have included in Fig 7b a smoothed version of the wind profile derived from 5-m images obtained by Cassini VIMS32 that senses cloud features as opacity sources to the infrared emission

downward shift of the tracers by about one scale height).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, temporal variability at deeper levels (below 1.4 bar) cannot be constrained with the present data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

There are at least three known sources that can be involved in the variability and vertical structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, three of the six rare Saturn giant planetary-scale GWS storms have originated in the peak of the equatorial jet in 1876, 1933 and 1990 (refs 2 and 19, 20, 21), the last one accompanied by large activity in 1994 (refs 42 and 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They probably represent one of the sources for major and long-lasting changes in the area although the operating mechanisms are not yet well understood2,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New shallow water layer dynamical simulations of the 1990 GWS show the effect of changing the equatorial jet structure on the storm evolution (therefore fixing the jet structure at the epoch of the storms outbreak) and the generation of abundant Rossby waves affecting the structure of the jet peak46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upward propagation of this wave activity could have formed an equatorial beacon in the upper stratosphere similar to that observed in the GWS 2010 (refs 47 and 48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, since the solar radiation penetrates down to altitudes 2 bars18, variability in the vertical upper cloud and haze distributions33,34,35,36,37,38 coupled to seasonal radiative effects enhanced at these latitudes by ring-shadowing is the most plausible second source for changes49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seasonal variability is observed in the temperature field above 400 mbar (refs 40 and 41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 20042014 Cassini temperature retrievals shows that aerosol heating produces a kink in the vertical temperature profiles from 100 to 400 mbar in the Equator40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that variability should occur in the thermal winds as retrieved from a modified thermal wind balance equation at Equator50, although large uncertainty exists in these retrievals40,43,48 (Fig 8b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, radiative-dynamical modelling points to the seasonal variability and vertical wind shear occurring in the peak of the jet just at the right latitudes and altitudes we observed49,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A three-dimensional Outer-Planet General Circulation Model (OPGCM) applied to Saturn showed that a meridional circulation develops at Equator and was found to be dominated by a seasonally reversing Hadley circulation51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temporal changes are predicted to occur at altitudes above 200 mbar, with the reversion of the Hadley circulation taking place at latitude 25°.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the altitude range 55200 mbar the model generates a symmetric jet at both sides of the Equator (latitudes 8°N and 8°S) with a seasonally variable speed of60 ms1 and whose maximum value is350 ms1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Maximum vertical shears in this altitude range predicted by the model are +0.6 ms1 km1 (6.2 × 104 s1) agreeing with other model predictions49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These models do not exactly match the observations (for example they do not reproduce the central jet observed at 60 mbar) but they show, in agreement with the observations, that the velocity changes forced by the seasonal insolation cycle occur in the center of the Equatorial jet at the expected altitudes (55200 mbar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Semi-Annual Oscillation (SAO) that has been detected in the stratosphere at altitudes above 20 mbar (refs 25, 26) could be the third mechanism involved in the velocity changes affecting winds at least down to the top of the upper haze at60 mbar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suspect that the changes at 60 mbar observed in 20042009 and 20142015 might be related to the SAO cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the observed downward propagation of the SAO damps at this level52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of measurements of the amplitude and vertical extent of the SAO below 20 mbar does not allow searching for its implication or coupling with the wind changes we observe at 60 mbar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results show that to constrain the coupling of the SAO (as derived from temperature measurements) to the wind field (as measured by cloud tracking) in the upper troposphere (50200 mbar) we need more long-term simultaneous observations of both magnitudes, along with the characterization of the vertical structure of cloud and hazes where the winds are measured.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, to characterize the vertical structure, it would be highly desirable to accompany these data with long-term wind measurements at deeper levels (13 bar) using the 5 micron window as in Cassini VIMS images32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical modelling will probably require a refinement of the GCM models51 that should be able to capture the SAO cycle and vertical structure of the Equatorial jet across the stratosphere and upper troposphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example they should be able to reproduce the intense jet centered at the Equator as observed at 60 mbar and the mechanisms that transport and concentrate momentum in such narrow latitude band.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Latent heat release by water condensation at the level P10 bar in Saturn54, and radiative relaxation effects on the zonal flow have been proposed as elements in the generation of such narrow Equatorial jets in shallow layers55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another important issue in modelling the upper troposphere dynamics is the imposed lower wind boundary condition, that is, how winds behave below the accessible region to remote observations (P34 bar).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, models of deep extending winds under deep forcing56,57,58 reproduce the double jet peak we observe in the Equator of Jupiter1 and Saturn (Fig 7, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiative-dynamical models50,51 should take this into consideration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To complete the research it would be very interesting to explore with the GCM51 how the dynamics of the Equatorial great storms (the GWS phenomenon) influenced both the stratospheric SAO and the global wind field in the region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be done injecting a heat or mass source at the appropriate latitude46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reanalysis of the available infrared data for the GWS 1990 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25) and the following up activity across 19941995 will serve to search for beacon activity in equatorial storms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
