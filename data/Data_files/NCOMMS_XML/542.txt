ORP4L is essential for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell survival  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Metabolic pathways are reprogrammed in cancer to support cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we report that T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells are characterized by increased oxidative phosphorylation and robust ATP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that ORP4L is expressed in T-ALL but not normal T-cells and its abundance is proportional to cellular ATP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ORP4L acts as an adaptor/scaffold assembling CD3, Gq/11 and PLC3 into a complex that activates PLC3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PLC3 catalyzes IP3 production in T-ALL as opposed to PLC1 in normal T-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Up-regulation of ORP4L thus results in a switch in the enzyme responsible for IP3-induced endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and oxidative phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ORP4L knockdown results in suboptimal bioenergetics, cell death and abrogation of T-ALL engraftment in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, we uncovered a signalling pathway operating specifically in T-ALL cells in which ORP4L mediates G protein-coupled ligand-induced PLC3 activation, resulting in an increase of mitochondrial respiration for cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting ORP4L might represent a promising approach for T-ALL treatment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Reprogramming of metabolic pathways by oncogenic signalling has emerged as a hallmark of cancer cells and may offer attractive targets for anticancer strategies1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is one of the deadliest and most aggressive hematological malignancies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite progress in intensive chemotherapy has achieved a 5-year event-free survival rate of 6070% in children and 3040% in adults, the success of the treatment is limited with 2025% of paediatric and over 50% of adult patients with T-ALL exhibiting resistance to therapy and relapse4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhanced molecular understanding of T-ALL biology will ultimately facilitate a targeted therapy driven approach that can improve survival of refractory T-ALL patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Ca2+ released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is taken up by mitochondria through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU)6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process provides reducing equivalents to support oxidative phosphorylation9,10 through the activation of three intramitochondrial dehydrogenases10,11 and ATP synthase12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Phospholipase Cs (PLCs) are a class of enzymes that execute an initial step in intracellular Ca2+ signaling13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In normal T-cells, PLC1 is a dominant enzyme controlling IP3 production and Ca2+ homeostasis15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PLC1 is activated through the TCR complex independent of G protein transduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, anti-CD3-induced Ca2+ release was not impaired in T-ALL cells lacking PLC1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16), suggesting that other components beyond PLC1 may be responsible for Ca2+ release in these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PLCs are canonical downstream targets of the Gq subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and have been reported to regulate Ca2+ release upon anti-CD3 stimulation in Jurkat T-cells16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This raises the issue of the role that PLCs versus PLC1 play in Ca2+ homeostasis of T-ALL cells and how PLCs are activated upon anti-CD3 stimulation of these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These heretofore unresolved fundamental issues are crucial for understanding the signalling pathways required for PLC activation and Ca2+ homeostasis in T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related protein 4 (ORP4; also known as OSBP2) is present as three major variants, ORP4L, ORP4M and ORP4S17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ORP4 is expressed constitutively in brain, heart and testis, but is virtually absent from other human and mouse tissues17,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ORP4 knockout mice exhibit teratozoospermia due to death of developing spermatozoa, indicating that ORP4 is essential for the survival of specific cell populations19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early studies reported that ORP4L was detectable in leukocytes from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia but not healthy donors20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports have consistently indicated that ORP4L is involved in tumour cell proliferation and survival18 and a target of the natural anti-proliferative steroidal saponin, OSW-1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  22), suggesting the involvement of ORP4L in control of oncogenic cell growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present study, we report the importance of elevated ORP4L expression in G protein-coupled ligand-induced PLC activation in T-ALL cells and identify ORP4L as a major node in Ca2+ homeostasis, bioenergetics and survival of these cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Elevated ORP4L expression is related to increased respiratory rate', 'In contrast to most cancer cells that rely on aerobic glycolysis as the major source of ATP, leukocytes from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia are characterized by high respiratory rates and low aerobic glycolysis23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain insights into the metabolic regulation of T-ALL cells, we first performed bioenergetics analyses in normal T-cells and primary T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found significantly elevated cellular ATP levels (Fig 1a) and increases of ATP in both the mitochondria and the cytosol (Supplementary Fig 1a,b) of primary T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This robust energy production is further underlined by the increased rate of basic oxygen consumption (OCR; Fig 1b) accompanied by a significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most other types of cancer, aerobic glycolysis characterized by lactate production is hyperactive24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This does not appear to be the case in primary T-ALL cells (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oligomycin (Oli) and FCCP inhibit mitochondrial respiration and force cells to the glycolytic pathway to maintain energy supply; treatment with these agents is indicative of the reserve cellular glycolytic potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normal T-cells displayed a significant increase of the aerobic glycolysis under oligomycin and FCCP treatment (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas, primary T-ALL cells and T-ALL cell lines including Jurkat, Molt-4, CEM and MT-4 cells showed a decreased potential to upregulate the glycolytic machinery (Fig 1c; Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) slightly decreased ATP generation in normal T-cells (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, primary T-ALL cells and T-ALL cell lines exhibited a significant decrease of ATP upon oligomycin treatment, but were resistant to a drop of cellular ATP induced by 2-DG (Fig 1d; Supplementary Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Elevated ORP4L expression is concurrent with aberrant energy metabolism in T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) ATP levels were measured in normal T-cells (n=5) and primary T-ALL cells (n=8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Baseline OCR and lactic acid levels in normal T-cells (n=4) and primary T-ALL cells (n=6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Lactic acid levels in normal T-cells (n=4), primary T-ALL cells (n=6), Jurkat T-cells and Molt-4 cells after treatment of oligomycin (Oli, 5 M) or FCCP (5 M) for 4 h.

Supplementary Fig 2e) and ATP levels (Fig 1i; Supplementary Fig 2f), whereas ORP4L overexpression increased these parameters (Fig 1j,k; Supplementary Fig 2g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude off-target effects of ORP4L shRNA, we also performed rescue experiments in ORP4L knockdown Jurkat T-cells, overexpression of ORP4L abolished the OCR and ATP decrease upon ORP4L knockdown (Supplementary Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicated that ORP4L is required for the energy homeostasis of T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Aberrant Notch-1 signalling has a major role in the pathogenesis of T-ALL, as more than 60% of T-ALL cases harbour activating mutations in the NOTCH-1 gene25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most T-ALL cell lines harbouring activating mutations in NOTCH-1 fail to respond to small-molecule -secretase inhibitors (GSIs) therapy, owing to mutational loss of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumour suppressor26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detected Notch-1 and PTEN status in all 18 T-ALL primary samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 18 cases, 10 have activating mutations that involve the extracellular heterodimerization domain and/or the C-terminal PEST domain of NOTCH-1, and 7 of the 18 samples display PTEN loss (Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the expression of ORP4L is independent of the Notch-1 and PTEN status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, PTEN-null T-ALL cells were shown to display upregulated glycolysis27 as compared with PTEN-positive cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jurkat, CEM and Molt-4 are PTEN-null cell lines, and MT-4 cells are PTEN-positive (Supplementary Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, all of these cell lines were unable to resort to glycolysis in response to uncoupling of respiration (Fig 1c,d; Supplementary Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support the notion that T-ALL cells may paradoxically depend more on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation than glycolysis to meet their energy demands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ORP4L assembles CD3 with Gq/11 and PLC3 into a signalling complex', 'To address the mechanistic role of ORP4L in the energy homeostasis of T-ALL cells, we carried out a proteomic analysis of ORP4L-interacting components in Jurkat T-cells with an antibody specific for ORP4L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-ORP4L and control IgG immunoprecipitates of cells stimulated with anti-CD3 were separated on SDSPAGE (Fig 2a), and polypeptides specifically associated with ORP4L were identified by mass spectrometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 14 proteins were identified as potential ORP4L binding partners by subtracting proteins precipitated by control IgG from those identified in anti-ORP4L precipitated specimens (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD3, Gq/11 and PLC3 were among these candidates; the finding was confirmed by western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding of Gq/11 to CD3 is activated upon anti-CD3 stimulation28, and these proteins can associate with PLC for signal transduction29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physical interactions between ORP4L and its binding partners were further investigated by co-immunoprecipitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of anti-CD3 treatment, low levels of complexes of CD3 and PLC3 were detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On anti-CD3 stimulation, interaction of ORP4L with these two proteins increased in a time-dependent manner, but no difference was observed in the association of ORP4L and Gq/11 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interactions between ORP4L, CD3, Gq/11 and PLC3 raised the possibility that ORP4L could be required for the CD3Gqq/11 or Gq/11PLC3 interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we performed co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Gq/11 in Jurkat T-cells with ORP4L knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gq/11 was bound to CD3 and PLC3 upon anti-CD3 stimulation, but the binding was reduced in ORP4L knockdown cells (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, immunodepletion/immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that ORP4L depletion markedly reduced the CD3Gq/11 and Gq/11PLC3 interactions (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Normal T-cells exhibited no detectable ORP4L protein expression, and Gq/11 failed to bind to CD3 and PLC3 upon anti-CD3 stimulation of these cells (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The above results strongly suggest that ORP4L acts as an adaptor that couples CD3, Gq/11 and PLC3 upon anti-CD3 stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: ORP4L facilitates assembly of a signalling complex in T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) SDSPAGE gel silver-stained for control IgG and anti-ORP4L immunoprecipitated proteins from Jurkat T-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lane marked IB displays control IgG and anti-ORP4L immunoprecipitated proteins analyzed by western blot with anti-PLC3, Gq/11 and CD3 antibodies simultaneously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of ORP4L binding proteins in Jurkat T-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were incubated with 10 g ml1 of anti-CD3 for the indicated times before lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of Gq/11 binding to CD3 and PLC3 in control and ORP4L knockdown cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were infected with shNT or shORP4L lentivirus for 72 h, and then incubated with or without 10 g ml1 of anti-CD3 for 5 min before lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Co-immunoprecipitation analysis of Gq/11 binding to CD3 and PLC3 in Jurkat T-cell lysates before immunodepletion with ORP4L antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Co-immunoprecipitation analysis Gq/11 binding to CD3 and PLC3 in normal T-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells were incubated with or without 10 g ml1 of anti-CD3 for 10 min before lysates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of CD3 (green), ORP4L (red) and pan-Cadherin (blue) localization in shNT and shORP4L transduced Jurkat T-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 10 m.

image', 'Confocal imaging analyses showed that CD3 clustered in a non-uniform manner at the plasma membrane of unstimulated Jurkat T-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-CD3 stimulation, however, induced a striking redistribution of CD3 in the plasma membrane and increased its co-localization with ORP4L (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, redistribution of CD3 was not observed in ORP4L-depleted cells (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gq/11 was distributed uniformly at the plasma membrane and co-localized with ORP4L; its location did not change upon anti-CD3 stimulation or ORP4L depletion (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PLC3 exhibited an intranuclear localization in unstimulated cells (Fig 2h; Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-CD3 stimulation induced a partial but clear translocation of PLC3 to the plasma membrane where it co-localized with ORP4L (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell fractionation followed by the western blot analysis provided further evidence for translocation of PLC3 from the nucleus to the plasma membrane upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence experiments revealed localization of ORP4L at the plasma membrane, but most of this protein remained in the soluble cytosolic fraction after cell fractionation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To clarify the reason for this contradiction, we treated cells before lysis with membrane permeable cross-linking agent dithiobis-succinimidyl propionate (DSP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensity of the ORP4L band in plasma membrane fraction increased substantially after DSP treatment (Supplementary Fig 4c), consistent with the view that ORP4L associates with plasma membrane via peripheral, weak or transient interactions and that the lysis procedure disrupts the association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, ORP4L knockdown markedly inhibited the PLC3 translocation upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The responding cell number and the quantity of translocated PLC3 protein were reduced in ORP4L knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig 4d), which could be rescued by ORP4L overexpression (Supplementary Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal imaging showed that the active phosphorylated form of PLC3 (p-PLC3)31,32 was present only in the plasma membrane but not in the nucleus of anti-CD3 stimulated cells (Supplementary Fig 4f), indicating that intranuclear PLC3 was inactive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triple staining for CD3, Gq/11 and p-PLC3 displayed a high degree of co-localization, consistent with the notion that these proteins are assembled into complexes upon anti-CD3 stimulation in Jurkat (Fig 2i), Molt-4 (Fig 2j) and primary T-ALL cells (Fig 2k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas, the co-localization was inhibited in cells subjected to ORP4L knockdown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To conclude, the present results thus suggest that ORP4L functions as an adaptor/scaffold for the assembly of CD3, Gq/11 and PLC3 into a signalling complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ORP4L mediates PLC3 activation and IP3 production', 'Functional relationships among the signalling complex components scaffolded by ORP4L were further interrogated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Jurkat T-cells, anti-CD3 stimulation resulted in GTP exchange within

 Moreover, phosphorylation of PLC3 and PLC activity upon anti-CD3 stimulation were abolished by Gq/11 knockdown (Fig 3b), indicating that PLC3 is under these conditions activated by Gq/11.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We confirmed herein that, in contrast to normal T-cells, T-ALL cells preferentially utilize robust oxidative phosphorylation as a source of ATP, similar to a recent observation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells38 and leukemia stem cells41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our novel finding is that PLC3, activated through G protein-dependent signal transduction, serves as a major enzyme for IP3 generation and intracellular Ca2+ and energy homeostasis in T-ALL cells, due to a selective up-regulation of ORP4L in malignant transformed T-cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Upon analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms, we found that ORP4L specifically interacts with CD3, Gq/11 and PLC3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anti-CD3 stimulation enhanced these interactions, suggesting assembly of a signalling complex upon anti-CD3 stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunodepletion/co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that the binding of CD3 to Gq/11, crucial for PLC3 activation, depends on ORP4L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, confocal imaging showed CD3 and PLC3 redistribution and co-localization with Gq/11 only in the presence of ORP4L.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings suggest that ORP4L acts as an adaptor/scaffold to recruit CD3, Gq/11 and PLC3 for the formation of a G protein-dependent signalling complex in T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PLCs perform a catalytic function at the plasma membrane where their substrate, PIP2, is localized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, PLCs also exist at other subcellular locations such as the cytoplasm and the nucleus42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This separation of an enzyme from its substrates represents an important regulatory mechanism, but understanding the molecular interactions and subcellular targeting events that control PLC function requires new insight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that PLC3 mainly exists within the nucleus of T-ALL cells and translocates to the plasma membrane upon stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we envision that a pathway contributing to signal transduction from CD3 to the nucleus may be affected by ORP4L, and our new findings provide insight into points at which this pathway is regulated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, ORP4L enables CD3 signalling to Gq/11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also facilitates the shift of PLC3 location from the nucleus to the plasma membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This promotes assembly of CD3, Gq/11 and PLC3 into a macromolecular complex to enhance the efficiency, selectivity and specificity of CD3-G protein signal transduction for Ca2+ homeostasis in T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In normal T-cells subjected to anti-CD3 stimulation, LAT (pp36) is heavily tyrosine phosphorylated and subsequently binds PLC1 to increase IP3 and intracellular Ca2+ in a G protein-independent manner44,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process is required for CD3 chain recruitment to active ZAP70 with a central role in CD3 signaling47,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, CD3 chain expression in T-ALL cells is defective49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, CD3 signalling is swapped to Gq/11 in the presence of ORP4L and sequentially activates Gq/11 and PLC3, which becomes the dominant enzyme for IP3 generation and intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in T-ALL cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that ORP4L in this way supports mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for T-ALL cell survival (Fig 5i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In agreement with the observed effects of ORP4L on IP3 generation, spontaneous Ca2+i oscillations in the cytosol and the mitochondria were reduced in ORP4L knockdown cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, ORP4L manipulations were shown to modify the mitochondrial PHD activity, OCR and ATP levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations provide evidence that ORP4L controls ER Ca2+ release by facilitating the catalytic action of PLC3 to sustain PHD activity and ATP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to many other types of cancers, T-ALL cells do not appear to over-utilize aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect24, but rely on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results in our study and those recently reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells38 and leukemia stem cells41 reveal a defect in employing glycolysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reasons for this phenotype represent an important avenue of future investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Enhanced oxidative phosphorylation induced by reprogramming of Ca2+ homeostasis by ORP4L in T-ALL cells offers a plausible mechanistic explanation for the mode of energy metabolism in these transformed leukemia cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In accordance with the role in ATP production, ORP4L acts as a key protein in T-ALL cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ORP4L-depleted cells displayed growth suppression and were sensitized to energy status-dependent autophagic cell death in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further support for this concept was produced by primary T-ALL cell engraftment in a NOD/SCID model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced engraftment of T-ALL cells with ORP4L knockdown in a NOD/SCID model demonstrated that ORP4L is crucial for T-ALL cell survival in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, our results reveal that selective ORP4L expression in T-ALL cells mediates G protein-dependent signalling and leads to translocation and activation of PLC3 to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis and bioenergetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ORP4L is thus essential for T-ALL cell survival and could therefore be a viable therapeutic target for T-ALL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of its expression/activity by RNAi or small-molecular compounds may serve as a new approach to treat this deadly malignancy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
