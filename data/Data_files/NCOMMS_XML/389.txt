Generation of mice with longer and better preserved telomeres in the absence of genetic manipulations  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although telomere length is genetically determined, mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with telomeres of twice the normal size have been generated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we use such ES cells with hyper-long telomeres, which also express green fluorescent protein (GFP), to generate chimaeric mice containing cells with both hyper-long and normal telomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that chimaeric mice contain GFP-positive cells in all mouse tissues, display normal tissue histology and normal survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both hyper-long and normal telomeres shorten with age, but GFP-positive cells retain longer telomeres as mice age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Chimaeric mice with hyper-long telomeres also accumulate fewer cells with short telomeres and less DNA damage with age, and express lower levels of p53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In highly renewing compartments, such as the blood, cells with hyper-long telomeres are longitudinally maintained or enriched with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that wound-healing rates in the skin are increased in chimaeric mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work demonstrates that mice with functional, longer and better preserved telomeres can be generated without the need for genetic manipulations, such as TERT overexpression.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures localized at the ends of chromosomes, which in vertebrates consist of tandem repeats of the TTAGGG DNA sequence ending in a 3overhang of the G-rich strand1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Telomeres protect chromosome ends from degradation and DNA repair activities and are essential for chromosome stability1,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shelterin complex, composed of six proteins, binds telomeric repeats and is involved in telomere protection and telomere length regulation1,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Telomere length decreases associated to cell division due to the inability of the replication machinery to copy the very ends of chromosomes6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Telomerase, a reverse transcriptase, can add de novo repeats onto telomere ends8,9 and in this manner can elongate or maintain telomeres in cells where it is active, such as cancer cells and pluripotent stem cells10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the adult organism, telomerase activity is restricted to adult stem cell compartments, which also show the longest telomeres; however, this is not sufficient to prevent progressive telomere shortening with ageing14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When telomeres become critically short, they impair stem cell function17 and the regenerative capacity of tissues12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the molecular level, critically short telomeres trigger a persistent DNA damage response that leads to senescence or apoptosis18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is mounting genetic evidence supporting the notion that accumulation of critically short telomeres leads to ageing and ageing-associated diseases both in mice and humans20,21,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, telomerase-deficient mice, which show accelerated telomere shortening owing to telomerase deficiency, display organ dysfunction and accelerated ageing24,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar phenotype is observed in human diseases with mutations in telomerase20,25,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Telomere length is genetically determined and varies inter species28,29,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the rate of telomere shortening and of accumulation of short telomeres with age also varies between species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, while humans are born with an average telomere length of 1015 kb and they shorten at a rate of 70 bp per year, mice of the Mus musculus C57BL6 mouse strain, are born with telomeres 4050 kb at birth, which shorten 100-times faster than in humans, while the average telomere length in dogs varies between 11.4 and 27.9 kb and telomeres shorten 10-fold faster than in humans16,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the accumulation of short telomeres is predictive of individual longevity both in birds and mice31,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We and others recently described that telomerase is activated and telomeres elongated in the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst in mice, where it resets the normal telomere length of the unmodified species34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also found that in vitro expansion of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from the ICM results in a further telomere lengthening until doubling the normal telomere length of the ICM of the blastocyst, a process that is associated to loss of heterochromatic marks35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, this telomere elongation occurs in the absence of modifications in the telomerase gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These in vitro generated telomeres are referred to as hyper-long telomeres35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, ES cells with hyper-long telomeres can be aggregated in morulae, and can undergo development to the blastocyst stage maintaining the hyper-long telomere phenotype35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we set to address the hypothesis of whether it would be possible to modify the normal telomere length of the M. musculus species by altering telomere length in ES cell in the absence of genetic manipulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we set to study whether ES cell with hyper-long telomeres owing to in vitro passaging, were able to give rise to chimaeric mice composed of cells with hyper-long telomeres, and to study telomere length dynamics with ageing in these mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results indicate that it is possible to generate mice bearing cells with hyper-long telomeres and that these cells contribute to the normal architecture and function of adult organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the accumulation of short telomeres with ageing is reduced in cells bearing hyper-long telomeres, which in turn results in lower accumulation of DNA damage in tissues with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, cells with hyper-long telomeres are maintained with ageing in highly proliferative compartments like blood, as well as are able to heal skin wounds faster than cells bearing normal length telomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings demonstrate that it is possible to modify the telomere length of a mammalian species in the absence of any genetic manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opens the possibility of altering the rate of accumulation of short telomeres with ageing in the absence of changes in telomerase expression, thus avoiding its potentially undesired effects in facilitating cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Few passages required for ES cells with hyper-long telomeres', 'We showed previously that ES cells lengthen their telomeres upon in vitro expansion35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, here we first addressed whether there was a limit to telomere lengthening during expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we subjected ES cells to over 60 passages in vitro and analysed telomere length by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) on metaphase spreads at different passages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mean telomere length was increased until passage 24 and then, was maintained until passage 60 (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 1a), suggesting that a few passages are sufficient to reach maximum telomere length in ES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was further confirmed by telomere Q-FISH and telomapping techniques (Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To discard that differences in telomere length were caused by changes in probe accessibility, or ploidy, we performed Q-FISH with a centromeric major satellite probe and found no significant differences in centromeric fluorescence at different passages (Methods, Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study whether other changes might occur during in vitro expansion of ES cells, we subjected four independent clones of ES cells at passage 6 and passage 16 to RNA-deep sequencing and found only five genes (out of 19,555 genes analysed) significantly differentially expressed for a false discovery rate (FDR) below 0.05 analysed using DESeq (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These genes were Sox18 (upregulated 20-fold compared with ES cells at passage 6) and Sox17, Zbtb48, Chst15 and Jph4 (downregulated less than twofold compared with ES cells at passage 6) (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, RNA-seq analysis showed very few changes in gene expression between ES cells at passages 4 and 16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we did not observe alterations in mRNA expression of telomerase genes, nor in components of shelterin, or in other genes associated to telomere biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed similar telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) telomerase activity in passage 4 and passage 16 ES cells (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, none of the genes with altered expression levels have been implicated in longevity36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Analysis of ES cells bearing hyper-long telomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Mean telomere length analysed on metaphase spreads in primary MEF (passage 2) and ES cells at the indicated passages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The M in the graph indicates the number of metaphases studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Underneath, the two graphs show the histograms corresponding to telomere signals in the primary MEFs and ES cells at passage 24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Mean TRF1 intensity in primary MEFs (passage 2), blastocysts and ES cells at the indicated passages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Underneath, the graphs show the histograms for TRF1 intensity in MEFs and ES cells at passage 24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Representative micrographs of TRF1 stain in selected samples described in b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 10 m.

note longer telomeres in GFP-positive ICM cells compared with the GFP-negative ICM of the unmodified species).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gross phenotypic analysis of the resulting chimaeric mice showed that they were normal compared with the unmodified species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To track cells derived from GFP-positive ES cells with hyper-long telomeres, we performed immunohistochemistry of different tissues with an anti-GFP antibody.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we focused our analyses in the intestine and the skin as an example of two highly proliferative tissues, as well as in the brain, as an example of a low proliferative tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tissues were analysed at four time points during the mouse lifespan: 0; 1; 6; and 12 months of life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed the presence of both GFP-positive and -negative cells in all tissues analysed (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The percentage of GFP-positive cells was 2050 per cent in all tissues studied, and this was maintained when chimaeric mice were analysed at different time points indicating that cells bearing long telomeres are functional and maintained with ageing (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, these chimaeric tissues showed a normal histology and we did not observe any pathological finding (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study dynamically the fate of cells with hyper-long telomeres in vivo, we performed a longitudinal analysis of the percentage of cells expressing GFP in peripheral blood samples from chimaeric mice bearing either normal or hyper-long telomeres (Fig 2d) from 4 until 8 months of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that GFP-positive cells with hyper-long telomeres are maintained, or even increased in some cases, over time with respect to the starting point (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As control, while GFP-positive cells containing normal telomere length were also maintained with time (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further confirmed telomere length in GFP-positive or -negative cells by Q-FISH in blood samples from these chimaeric mice (Supplementary Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that in chimaeric mice bearing GFP-positive cells with normal telomere length both the GFP-positive or -negative cells display similar telomere intensities (upper graph and pictures), while in chimaeric mice bearing GFP-positive cells with hyper-long telomeres, GFP-positive cells display brighter telomeres than the GFP-negative cells (lower graph and pictures;

greater than 2 -H2AX foci in tissues at 6- and 12-months-old animals (Fig 6b,c and Supplementary Fig 15a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a moderate number of cells showing DNA damage in all the tissues

damage by maintaining a functional telomere capping structure41,46,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the lower DNA damage, we also detected increased numbers of cells positive for p53 staining in the GFP-negative population compared with the GFP-positive cells both in intestine and skin (Fig 6d and Supplementary Fig 15b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that hyper-long telomeres are well

hyper-long telomeres would be advantageous compared with normal length telomeres in the context of the organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, we generated two types of chimaeric mice: chimaeric mice with normal length telomeres by microinjecting ES cells at passage 4 (telomere length being similar to telomere length of the inner cells mass of the blastocyst35) in morulae and expressing GFP (in order to follow these cells in chimaeric tissue), as well as chimaeric mice with hyper-long telomeres by microinjecting ES cells expressing GFP at passage 16 (with hyper-long telomeres) (see

bearing either normal or hyper-long telomere between 6 and 12 months and adult non-chimaeric mice of the 129S1 or C57Bl6 backgrounds (used as age-matched controls) between 6 and 12 months were

blade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantified the surface of the 4 mm wound every day.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area of the wound was reduced with days until its closure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In chimaeric mice with normal telomere length wounds were healed at the same rate than in control non-chimaeric mice (Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, in chimaeric mice with hyper-long telomeres, we found that rate of wound-healing was higher in the GFP-positive cells with hyper-long telomeres compared with the GFP-negative cells and the in the non-chimaeric age-matched controls (Fig 7b,c and Supplementary Fig 17).

to wound-healing in the chimaeric mice with hyper-long telomeres (Supplementary Fig 19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate that hyper-long telomeres are advantageous for skin

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It has been previously shown that telomere length is a molecular determinant of ageing and lifespan in mice22,55,56,57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, short telomeres lead to accelerated ageing22,24,26,47 and longer telomeres owing to telomerase overexpression can delay ageing and increase lifespan in mice55,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these studies have been carried out using genetic manipulations of the telomerase genes either throughout generation of genetically modified mice or through the use of gene therapy strategies26,55,56,57,58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we set to address the possibility of generating mice with longer telomeres than normal in the absence of any genetic manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously showed that telomeres lengthen during in vitro expansion of ES cells35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This telomere lengthening occurs simultaneously to the loss of heterochromatic marks at telomeres and in the absence of changes in the global DNA methylation (SINE elements) or subtelomeric methylation or telomerase activity35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon is also recapitulated when differentiated cells are reprogrammed to iPS cells and expanded in vitro, again associated to changes at telomeric heterochromatin13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in the absence of telomerase differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to iPS cells, but telomeres do not lengthen13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggested that is possible to generate cells with hyper-long telomeres simply by in vitro passaging and, thus, in the absence of manipulation of the telomerase gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it remained unknown whether cells derived from ES cells with hyper-long telomeres are maintained throughout embryonic and adult development in mice, and they retain longer telomeres and lower ageing-associated DNA damage in the adult organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first observed moderately passaged ES cells (up to passage 24) showed maximum telomere length and similarly high levels of the TRF1 protein to those characteristic of pluripotent ES cell and iPS cells41,60 as well as of cells of the in vitro cultured ICM35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, excessive passaging (that is, passage 60), resulted in decreased TRF1 levels and in accumulation of telomere damage as indicated by increased presence of TIFs and MTS, a telomere aberration associated with telomere fragility and indicative of telomere replication defects38,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These aberrations could be associated to decreased levels of TRF1 protein at late ES cell passages, as TRF1 protects cells from both types of damage38,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in spite of decreased TRF1 protein levels at later passages, we did not observe increased telomere fusions, suggesting that a minimum threshold for telomere capping is safeguarded in ES cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these observations indicate that only a limited number of passages are necessary to generate pluripotent stem cells with hyper-long telomeres and high levels of TRF1, in the absence of telomere damage and telomere aberrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a moderate number of passages ensure a very similar genome-wide expression profile between ES cells at early passages as indicated by very few gene expression changes by RNA-seq.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we did not observe any changes in the expression of telomerase, shelterin proteins, or any other genes related to telomere biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The main challenge in this study was the successful generation of chimaeric mice derived from ES cells with hyper-long telomeres (GFP-positive to allow lineage tracking), which contain GFP-positive cells (up to 50% of cells in different tissues analysed) with longer telomeres than those of the unmodified species, both at the stem cell and more differentiated compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we obtained chimaeric mice, which show much longer telomeres than those of the unmodified species in the absence of changes in expression of telomerase or telomere-binding proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, chimaeric mice and tissues were healthy and did not display any histopathological alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, GFP-positive cells with hyper-long telomeres maintained longer telomeres and showed a lower abundance of cells with short telomeres at different times points up to 1 year of age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, GFP-positive cells showed lower levels of telomere fragility and fusions, as well as lower DNA damage with ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are in line with previous findings describing that transgenic overexpression of TERT in mice from a different genetic background (C57BL6), which also resulted in longer telomeres, also showed a lower accumulation of DNA damage with ageing61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained by TERT overexpression achieved by using a gene therapy strategy55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next tested whether having hyper-long telomeres was advantageous or disadvantageous for cells in highly proliferative compartments such as the blood and the skin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Longitudinal studies in which we dynamically followed cells with hyper-long telomeres in blood with ageing, showed that these cells were maintained or even amplified over time, suggesting that hyper-long telomeres are not disadvantageous and may be positively selected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also in line with this notion, by using skin wound-healing assays, we observed that skin cells with hyper-long telomeres were able to repair more rapidly the skin wounds compared with the skin of the unmodified species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whether long telomeres are protective from cancer or may increase the risk of tumour formation is still debated61,62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our previous studies, we showed that TERT gene therapy using AAV9 non-integrative vectors was sufficient to delay many age-related diseases, including cancer22,55,56,57,58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, neither chimaeric mice with hyper-long telomeres nor control mice developed any tumour during the period of analysis, suggesting that both hyper-long and normal telomeres behave similarly with respect to tumour formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, in line with this, we found that hyper-long telomeres did not result in any long-term deleterious effects for the mice, as indicated by a similar or slightly increased survival of the chimaeric mice bearing cells with hyper-long telomeres compared with chimaeric mice with normal telomere length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, chimaeric mice with hyper-long telomeres did not demonstrate a shortened latency period for tumour formation and continued tumour-free at week 20 after the start of the treatment, although the final tumour yield is still to be concluded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, these findings demonstrate that cells bearing hyper-long telomeres render juvenile telomeres in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results are proof of principle that it is possible to generate adult tissues with longer telomeres than normal in the absence of genetic modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies warrant generation of a new strain of mice with hyper-long telomeres, which will be instrumental to further study the impact of hyper-long telomeres in species longevity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, our results highlight the importance of using of ES cells or iPS cells with long telomeres for regenerative medicine.'
