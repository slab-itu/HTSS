T cell receptor recognition of CD1b presenting a mycobacterial glycolipid  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'CD1 proteins present microbial lipids to T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Germline-encoded mycolyl lipid-reactive (GEM) T cells with conserved  T cell receptors (TCRs) recognize CD1b presenting mycobacterial mycolates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the molecular basis underpinning TCR recognition of CD1b remains unknown, here we determine the structure of a GEM TCR bound to CD1b presenting glucose-6-O-monomycolate (GMM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GEM TCR docks centrally above CD1b, whereby the conserved TCR -chain extensively contacts CD1b and GMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through mutagenesis and study of T cells from tuberculosis patients, we identify a consensus CD1b footprint of TCRs present among GEM T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using both the TCR - and -chains as tweezers to surround and grip the glucose moiety of GMM, GEM TCRs create a highly specific mechanism for recognizing this mycobacterial glycolipid.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
' T cells use their clonotypic  T cell antigen receptors (TCR) to sense microbial-derived peptides that are presented by molecules encoded by the polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC)1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, studies show that TCRs can recognize foreign non-peptide antigens, including bacterial vitamin B metabolites bound to MR1 and microbial lipid-based antigens bound to CD1 (refs 2, 3, 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies broadly expand the biochemical range of natural antigens that trigger  T cell responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A second new and general insight into  T cell function is that the monomorphic CD1 and MR1 antigen-presenting molecules can activate conserved populations of responding T cells, which are not restricted to the genetic background of the donor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such donor-unrestricted T cells can show characteristic TCR gene usage patterns that are more broadly conserved across the human species than even the most public MHC-restricted TCRs3,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two most widely studied examples are type I Natural Killer T cell (NKT) TCRs, which typically express TCR -chains encoded by the TRAV10-TRAJ18 gene segments and recognize CD1d (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8), and mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT) that are typically encoded by TRAV1-2 joined to TRAJ33 and recognize MR1 (refs 9, 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to CD1d, which is designated as a group 2 CD1 protein, the human CD1 locus encodes three group 1 antigen-presenting molecules, CD1a, CD1b and CD1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each of these proteins possesses distinctly shaped antigen-binding clefts and show differing expression on B cells, myeloid dendritic cells and Langerhans cells, which increasingly point to separate immunological functions11,12,13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD1b differs from the other human CD1 proteins in that it binds both to adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) and AP-3 complexes, which promote trafficking to lysosomes, where antigen loading is more strongly controlled by acid pH (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, CD1b possesses a particularly large and deep antigen-binding cleft that contains two pockets (C, T) not found in other CD1 proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The four antigen-binding pockets (A, F, C and T) of CD1b bind the hydrocarbon chains of amphipathic antigens (Ag), allowing the hydrophilic head groups to protrude from the F-pocket through the F-portal4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The outer surface of CD1b near the F-portal is the presumed surface for TCR contact, but the mode of TCR binding to CD1b has not been directly observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The development of group 1 CD1 tetramers now increases our understanding of human lipid-reactive T cell populations17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, CD1b tetramers carrying a mycobacterial glycolipid, glucose-6-O-monomycolate (GMM), demonstrated the existence of polyclonal T cells recognizing GMM lipids and among tuberculosis (TB) patients20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CD1 proteins are non-polymorphic and the responding T cells show two defined TCR conservation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, germline-encoded mycolyl lipid-reactive (GEM) T cells express nearly identical TCR -chains encoded by TRAV1-2 and TRAJ9, and TCR -chains that are biased toward usage of TRBV6-2 or TRBV30 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This TCR -chain was also identified in one T cell clone (clone 18) that recognizes free mycolic acid, a deglycosylated form of GMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, LDN5-like T cells are a distinct T cell population that expresses TRBV4-1+ TCRs, which bind CD1bGMM complexes with lower affinity than the GEM TCRs22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, TCR-defined T cell types exist in the human CD1b-reactive repertoire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the structure of a GEM TCR bound to the CD1bGMM complex, thereby representing the first description of a TCRCD1bAg ternary complex and sheds light on the general nature lipid-reactive TCRs that are broadly conserved in humans21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data provide specific structural explanations for the TCR variable (V) and joining (J) genes that define GEM T cells, identify two distinct modes of typical and atypical antigen recognition, as well as conceptual insight into the biased TCR selection of GEM T cells towards a glycolipid antigen by a pathogen of worldwide importance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Overview of the GEM TCRCD1b ternary complex', 'GEM TCRs from clones 1, 42, 21 bind CD1bGMM with relatively high affinity (KD1 M)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refolded the TCR from clone 42 (GEM42) that was encoded by three gene segments typical of GEM TCRs: TRAV1-2, TRAJ9 and TRBV6-2 (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next we generated a panel of CD1b mutants, of which one (Ile160Ala) was expressed at a particularly high yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like wild type CD1b, CD1b-Ile160Ala readily loaded a natural GMM with an average chain length of C32 (C32 GMM) and bound the GEM42 TCR with a comparable but slightly higher affinity that wild type CD1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently determined the structure of the ternary complex to 3.2 Å resolution (Table 1; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Data collection and refinement statistics.Full size table', 'The GEM42 TCR docked over the 1 and 2-helices of CD1b with a centrally located footprint (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comparison of the first footprints of TCRs on CD1a and CD1b show an extreme contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, the CD1a autoreactive TCR (BK6) binds at a site distant from the F-portal of CD1a and does not contact the bound lipid ligands23 (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, the GEM42 TCR is positioned near the centre of the CD1b platform and directly covers the F-portal, thereby fully surrounding and extensively contacting the protruding glucose headgroup (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the GEM TCR bound in an orthogonal orientation with respect to the long axis of the CD1b antigen-binding cleft, whereupon the TCR -chain and -chains sat over the 2-helix (residues 151160) and 1-helix (residues 6880) of CD1b, respectively (Fig 1b; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The buried surface area (BSA) on complexation by the GEM TCR was 1,600 Å2, of which the TCR - and -chains contributed 52% and 48%, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this interface, the CDR3 loop and CDR3 loop contributed the most to the interaction with CD1bGMM, with 27% and 35% of BSA, respectively (Figs 1b and 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the GEM TCR formed an extensive interaction network with CD1bGMM complex, thereby providing immediate molecular insight into the basis for the previously observed patterns of TCR - and -chain conservation in polyclonal GEM T cells from latent TB patients20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: TRAV1-2 TCRs recognize CD1b, MHC-I and MR1.Overview of the TRAV1-2 TCRs in complex with CD1b (coloured white; a,b,g), MHC-I (coloured dark grey; c,d,h) and

regions control specificity for CD1b and GMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TRAV1-2 gene element encodes the CDR1 and CDR2 germline-encoded loops, which played an important role (10% BSA each) in contacting CD1bGMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the corresponding CDR1 and CDR2 loops from the TCR -chain played a lesser role (BSA of 5% and 4%, respectively) (Fig 2a; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differential contributions from the TRAV and TRBV regions of the GEM TCR reflected the different extent of the TCR - and -chain bias in GEM T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Considering the particular roles of GEM TCR-defining residues in CD1bGMM recognition, the positioning of Gly29 and Phe30 enabled the CDR1 loop to lay flat and proximal to the 2-helix of CD1b, with the main chain backbone of the CDR1 loop mediating van der Waals and polar contacts with a cluster of CD1b residues including Glu156, Arg159 and Glu164 (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions were complemented by the Asn31 side chain forming a hydrogen bond with Thr157 from CD1b (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TRAV1-2-encoded CDR2 loop mediated hydrophobic contacts with CD1b, whereby Val57 and Leu58 wedged between the aliphatic side chains of Gln152 and Glu156 of CD1b (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These hydrophobic contacts were flanked by two closely associated framework residues, Tyr55 and Arg84 from the TRAV1-2 chain, which interacted with CD1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, Tyr55 is within hydrogen bonding distance to the main chain of CD1b (Gly153), and Arg84 extended towards CD1b and formed a salt bridge with Glu156 (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The TRAJ9-encoded CDR3 loop played a key role at the GEM TCRCD1bGMM interface, abutting the GMM antigen, and residing between the helical jaws of the CD1b antigen-binding cleft, forming mostly hydrophobic contacts with residues from both the 1- and 2-helices of CD1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, Thr109 and Gly110 packed against Thr157 from the 2-helix of CD1b, while Phe112 plugged into a hydrophobic crevice formed by Ile69, Val72 and the aliphatic moiety of Glu68 (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In comparison to the other CD1 isoforms, the invariant TCR -chain of the GEM TCR made a series of contacts that were either unique to CD1b, or absent in some of the other CD1 family members (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Role of the TCR -chain in CD1b recognition', 'The role of the CDR1 loop was restricted to Tyr31 contacting Val72 on CD1b, the latter of which was also contacted by Val57 from the CDR2 loop (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This CDR2 loop contact was supported by an adjacent framework residue Tyr55, which hydrogen-bonded to Glu68 of CD1b (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the germline-encoded regions of the TRBV6-2 gene played a limited role in contacting CD1b (Fig 2a and Supplementary Table 2), consistent with its present, but weak contribution to GEM TCR motifs observed in polyclonal T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, Glu30 from the CDR1 loop, while not contacting CD1b, played a key role in maintaining the conformation of Arg109 from the CDR3 loop, which formed many contacts with GMM and CD1b (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, Arg109 extended into a niche formed by Phe75, Arg79 and Glu80, forming a salt bridge with Glu80 from CD1b (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Glu80 abutted Leu110, which, together with Ala111 also stacked against Tyr151 from CD1b (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, our observations suggest a potential role of the CDR3 loop in fine-tuning the interactions with the F-pocket of CD1b, thereby refining GEM TCR recognition of CD1bGMM (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A two-chain tweezers mechanism grips GMM', 'The mechanism of glycolipid recognition by the GEM TCR is visually striking and can be compared to tweezers, whose jaws are formed by the CDR3 and CDR3 loops, grasping at the protruding glucosyl moiety of GMM (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This headgroup grasping mechanism is highly distinct from a recently solved CD1alipidTCR complex23, in which the TCR does not directly contact bound lipid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, this two-chain mechanism in which glucose is sandwiched between TCR - and -, is distinct from type I and type II NKT TCR antigen recognition, in which only one TCR chain contacts antigen24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tweezers mechanism prompted functional studies of the GEM TCRs fine specificity for GMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Molecular tweezers grip the glucose

antigen structure remains unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One atypical GEM TCR expressed by clone 18 (GEM18 TCR) recognized free mycolic acid (MA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This antigen lacks the glucosyl moiety, pointing toward possible promiscuity20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, CD1b-reactive clones known as LDN5-like T cells, do show specificity for the glucosyl group of GMM22,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured GEM clone 42 and clone 18 responses to molecules with altered head groups, including MA, which lacks glucose, as well as mannose-6-O-monomycolate (ManMM) and galactose-6-O-monomycolate (GalMM), which differ from GMM only in the orientation of one hydroxyl group in the hexosyl ring at position C2 or C4, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all cases alteration of the headgroup abolished the GEM clone 42 T cell response, demonstrating precise specificity for the glucosyl moiety (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This fine specificity for GMM arose from the extensive contacts made by the GEM42 TCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, the double glycine motif, Gly110-Gly111, enabled the CDR3 loop of the GEM42 TCR to pack against the glucose headgroup, while the main chain carbonyl of Gly110 also formed a hydrogen bond with the mycolyl -hydroxyl group of GMM (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Arg107 rested above GMM, where it hydrogen-bonded with the 2-OH moiety of the glucose headgroup.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The axial position of 2-OH in ManMM likely accounted for the lack of recognition by the GEM42 TCR (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, Arg107 collaborated with Asp113 from the CDR3 loop, by forming a salt bridge with it, which held Asp113 in place so that it formed hydrogen bonds with the 2-OH and 3-OH groups of glucose (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, Arg107 functioned like a capstone as its positioning allowed two key interdomain interactions: stabilization of the TCR  and -chains, as well as binding with glucose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of response to GalMM and other related analogues correlated with the finding that glucose moiety formed hydrogen bonding contacts with the main chain of the CDR3 loop (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While there is space to accommodate a galactose moiety between the molecular tweezers, the altered stereochemistry of the C4 hydroxyl would result in loss of interactions with the TCR -chain at positions Ala111 and Gly112 and unfavourable contacts with CD1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'GMM was also contacted by other germline-encoded elements of the GEM42 TCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, Asn31 from the CDR1 loop formed a hydrogen bond with the C1 hydroxyl moiety of GMM, and Tyr31 from the CDR1 loop formed a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the glucosyl ester linkage to mycolic acid (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, every polar moiety of the GMM antigen was involved in an interaction with the GEM42 TCR (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, of the 230 Å2 solvent exposed surface area of GMM available for TCR contact, 93% was buried upon ligation with the TCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the tweezers-like grip of the GMM antigen provided the molecular basis for the high affinity and strict specificity of this GEM42 TCR for this mycobacterial glycolipid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Roles of germline and N-region encoded residues in GEM TCRs', 'GEM T cells were so named based on the use of germline-encoded sequences and the paucity of N-region additions at the TRAVTRAJ junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the CDR3 sequences from GEM T cells suggests a candidate mechanism by which N-region additions, when present, do not interfere with CD1bGMM binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In half of the known GEM TCR -chains, position 108 is encoded by N nucleotides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This residue is variable, and can be Asn, Arg, Val or Gly (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relative insensitivity of GEM TCRs to changes encoded by N-region additions at position 108 agrees with the structural observation that this residue is rotated outward on the CDR3 loop so that it makes no interactions with TCR -chain, CD1b or GMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Arg107 is conserved among all GMM-specific GEM TCRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arg107 is encoded by TRAV1-2 in GEM clones 21 and 1, as well as two TCRs from donor A14, known as A14PCR1 and A14PCR2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one of the GEM TCR -chains, A14PCR2, the consensus GEM CDR3 is formed without any N nucleotides, and thus entirely encoded by the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the GEM42 TCR, TRAV1-2 was trimmed so that it lost sequences that would have encoded Arg107, but the N nucleotides encoded Arg107 (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining these observations with the structural evidence that Arg107 serves a capstone function (Fig 3a), we propose a capstone switch mechanism whereby TRAV1-2 usually encodes Arg107.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case that nucleotides encoding this residue are chewed back, the relatively rare event of random N-nucleotide recovery of arginine can nevertheless be selected based on the crucial structural role of the arginine side chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Typical and atypical GEM TCRs', 'The GEM18 TCR can be considered atypical, because it recognizes unglucosylated mycolic acid whereas the other typical clones recognize GMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clone 18 differs from all five typical GEM TCRs in that it lacks arginine at position 107, and possesses a Leu107 instead, thereby explaining the lack of specificity for glucose (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clone 18 also lacks the key Asp113, which is found in three typical GEM TCRs and contributes TCR  and  pairing20 (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, clone 18 does possess two residues, Gly110 and Phe112, which interact with the A-roof of CD1b and aspects of the mycolyl moiety that are shared between GMM and MA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the GEM42 TCR provides a framework for identifying the particular mechanisms of atypical TCR mediates recognition of mycolic acid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Remoulding of CD1bGMM on GEM TCR ligation', 'To establish the extent of conformational plasticity occurring upon TCR engagement of CD1bGMM, we compared the GEM42 TCRCD1bGMM ternary complex to the binary CD1bGMM (C32) structure (Table 1, Supplementary Fig 4), and the previously solved structure of the non-liganded GEM42 TCR (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the exception of the CDR3 loop, the CDR loops of the GEM TCR did not move appreciably after CD1bGMM binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CDR3 loop moved maximally by4 Å to avoid steric clashes and make favourable contacts with CD1bGMM (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the invariant TCR -chain of the GEM TCR was a fixed recognition determinant of CD1bGMM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our binary structure of CD1b-C32 GMM was similar to one previously determined with C54 GMM (C51-C57) bound to CD1b (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29) (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The glucosyl moiety extends substantially out of the CD1b cleft and can exhibit mobility (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCR engagement caused two major conformational changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Namely, the glucose headgroup was flattened by the CDR3 loop, being displaced by 5 Å towards the 2-helix of CD1b (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This bulldozing of the headgroup was essential to enable favourable contacts between glucose and the GEM TCR, and also enabled TCR contacts with the CD1b molecule itself (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To accommodate the altered position of GMM, the hinge region of the CD1b 2-helix was remoulded (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Repositioning of Gln152 caused a ripple of conformational change, including the displacement of Tyr151, which caused re-orientation of Phe84 and Phe88 as well as shifting of Phe144 (Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively these changes altered a segment of the 2-helix of CD1b itself (residues 146150), undergoing a rigid body shift of 1.52.0 Å (Fig 4b).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The antigen display platform present in all four human CD1 proteins is asymmetric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When depicted in the conventional way, the left side of CD1 platforms are dominated by the A-roofs, while the right side of CD1 platforms is characterized by a small, round portal through which antigens can protrude4,12,13,14,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This feature suggests a hypothetical mechanism whereby TCRs approaching the left side would mainly contact CD1 itself, but a central or right-sided footprint would overlie the F-portal and contact protruding antigen4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a CD1a-autoreactive TCR bound directly to the A-roof of CD1a such that its left-shifted footprint made no contact with a lipid ligand23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast the GEM42 TCR adopts a central position and extensively contacts the glycolipid, thereby revealing that highly distinct TCR recognition mechanisms exist in the group 1 CD1 system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'GEM T cells are defined by the particular TRAV1-2+ TCR they express20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data using tetramers with mutant CD1b proteins demonstrate that the pattern of CD1b-lipid complex recognition is conserved among polyclonal T cells from unrelated donors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GEM TCRs specificity towards GMM is notable given that GMM arises in mycobacteria from the esterification of host glucose with mycobacterial-derived mycolic acid, and thus the existence of GMM is considered to represent a signature for mycobacterial infection of hosts34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the intricate network of interactions provide a basis for understanding the strict specificity of the GEM42 TCR towards GMM, including its C2 and C4 hydroxyl groups of the glucosyl moiety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GMM is a foreign lipid that is structurally distinct from all known self lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although self mono-glucosyl lipids exist, the 6-linked glucose present in GMM is pivoted in a way that differs substantially from 1-linked glucose in -glucosyl ceramides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Type I and Type II NKT TCR recognition of glycolipids, the TCR  and TCR- chains, respectively, dominate contacts with the glycolipid headgroup25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here the TCR - and -chains function together so that the headgroup lies between the two chains, acting like tweezers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus GEM TCRs are exquisitely and simultaneously sensitive to two fixed components, namely CD1b and the mycobacterial glycolipid antigen itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to broad expression of antigens for MAIT and NKT cells, GEM T cells are specific for an antigen found only in a limited range of Actinobacteria and so detection or manipulation of their response could serve diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The GEM TCRCD1bGMM structure provided specific insights into both the function of aspects of the TCR that are highly conserved (TRAV1-2, TRAJ9) and less conserved (TRBV6-2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, CD1b mutagenesis studies showed that the energetic hot spot matched with the invariant TCR -chain footprint of two characterized GEM TCRs, as well as polyclonal GEM T cells isolated from tuberculosis patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus GEM T cell recognition is underpinned by a conserved CD1bGMM footprint driven by the invariant TCR -chain usage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As CD1b can present mycolates of different length (C32-C80), the impact of such variation could effect GEM TCR recognition by altering the conformation of CD1b platform itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a conserved footprint of TRAV1-2 encoded residues in GEM T cells, MAIT cells and MHC-reactive T cells, which was surprising based on the markedly differing primary structures of these three antigen-presenting molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conserved mode of binding is not determined by individual, residue-specific interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, key contacts are made with a shared aspect of tertiary structure, highlighting the versatility of this scaffold in recognizing distinct classes of antigen-presenting molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, here we report the first structure of an  TCR bound to CD1bantigen complex, and simultaneously provide a molecular basis into how the immune system uses conserved recognition features to target a mycobacterial lipid antigen formed during infection of the host.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
