Armc5 deletion causes developmental defects and compromises T-cell immune responses  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Armadillo repeat containing 5 (ARMC5) is a cytosolic protein with no enzymatic activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Little is known about its function and mechanisms of action, except that gene mutations are associated with risks of primary macronodular adrenal gland hyperplasia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we map Armc5 expression by in situ hybridization, and generate Armc5 knockout mice, which are small in body size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Armc5 knockout mice have compromised T-cell proliferation and differentiation into Th1 and Th17 cells, increased T-cell apoptosis, reduced severity of experimental autoimmune encephalitis, and defective immune responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mice also develop adrenal gland hyperplasia in old age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yeast 2-hybrid assays identify 16 ARMC5-binding partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together these data indicate that ARMC5 is crucial in fetal development, T-cell function and adrenal gland growth homeostasis, and that the functions of ARMC5 probably depend on interaction with multiple signalling pathways.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The gene Armadillo was first identified in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a gene controlling larval segmentation with morphological similarity to armadillos1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  -Catenin is the human and mouse orthologue of fruit fly Armadillo3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Armadillo/-catenin protein contains 13 and 12 conserved armadillo (ARM) repeats, respectively: each repeat is about 40 amino acid (aa) long and consists of 3 -helices4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Multiple repeats form an ARM domain which has a groove for binding various other proteins in its tertiary structure5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More than 240 proteins, from yeasts to humans, are known to contain an ARM domain6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although -catenin is believed to interact with and regulate cytoskeleton function, its roles and those of ARM domain-containing proteins, in general, are very versatile in cell biology, including cytoskeleton organization8, cell-cell interactions9, protein nuclear import10, degradation11 and folding12, cell signalling/sensing13,14,15, molecular chaperoning16, cell invasion/mobility/migration17, transcription control18, cell division/proliferation19 and spindle formation20, to name some of them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'At the tissue and organ levels, ARM domain-containing proteins are involved in T-cell development21, lung morphogenesis22, limb dorsal-ventral axis formation23, neural tube development24, osteoblast/chondrocyte switch25, synovial joint formation26, adrenal gland cortex development27 and tumour suppression28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Due to the very diverse functions of ARM domain-containing proteins, it is challenging to predict their mechanisms of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, these aspects of many ARM domain-containing proteins remain undeciphered, and quite a number of them are given the name ARMC (ARM repeat-containing), followed by Arabic numbers (for example, ARMC1, 2, 3 and so on).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARMC5 is one such protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Human and mouse ARMC5 proteins share 90% aa sequence homology and have similar structures29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mouse ARMC5 is 926 aa in length and contains 7 ARM repeats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A BTB/POZ domain towards its C-terminus is responsible for dimerization or trimerization31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several groups reported in 2013 and 2014 that ARMC5 gene mutations are associated with primary macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (PMAH) and Cushings syndrome34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assié et al.34 demonstrated that no viable HeLa cells could be obtained when they were stably transfected with ARMC5-expressing vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They suggested that the default function of wild-type (WT) ARMC5 is the suppression of cell proliferation or promotion of apoptosis, which might explain the adrenal cortex hyperplasia seen in patients with ARMC mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No other reports on ARMC5 function and mechanisms of action are available in the literature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the present work, we have studied the tissue-specific expression of Armc5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have generated Armc5 gene knockout (KO) mice, and revealed that ARMC5 is vital in development and immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that aged KO mice develop adrenal gland hyperplasia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have identified a group of ARMC5-interacting proteins by yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) assay, paving the way for further mechanistic and functional investigations of ARMC5.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our study demonstrated that Armc5 mRNA was highly expressed in the thymus and adrenal glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its deletion led to small body size in mice and compromised T-cell proliferation and differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KO mice presented defective induction of EAE and anti-LCMV immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  KO mice developed adrenal gland hyperplasia in old age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARMC5 is a protein without enzymatic activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our Y2H assays identified 16 candidate ARMC5-binding proteins potentially capable of linking ARMC5 to different signalling pathways involved in cell cycling and apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Armc5 expression at the mRNA level was upregulated immediately (within 2 h) after CD4 T-cell activation by T cell receptor (TCR) ligation and less so and at a slower pace in CD8 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its expression level then declined in the following days (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Armc5 expression in CD4 cells cultured under Th1 or Th17 conditions after 1 day remained low (Supplementary Fig 13), and was not influenced by the presence of different lymphokines, such as IL-2, IL-6 or TGF-1 (Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Armc5 mRNA expression in CD8 cells 8 days after LCMV infection was significantly lower than in naive CD8 cells (Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that this molecule is probably important in the early stage of TCR-triggered T-cell activation to prepare cells for entry into the cell cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This notion is supported by cell cycle analysis, which revealed that KO T cells were compromised in G1/S progression (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We found reduced numbers of infiltrating T cells as well as Th1 (IFN-+) and Th17 (IL-17+) cells in the CNS of KO EAE mice compared to WT EAE controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such decreases were likely responsible for the diminished EAE manifestations in KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reduced CNS lymphocyte infiltration could be caused by compromised clonal expansion/differentiation of T cells in the periphery, defective migration of such cells into the CNS, reduced expansion/differentiation of these cells in the CNS, decreased apoptosis of cells in the periphery and CNS, or all of the above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defective KO T-cell clonal expansion/differentiation in the periphery was apparent according to our in vitro and in vivo results (Figs 4 and 7b), but whether this is also the case in the CNS remains to be studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We demonstrated that ARMC5 deletion resulted in comprised TCR-stimulated proliferation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro and LCMV-specific CD8+ T-cell clonal expansion in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we observed a significant reduction in SLECs in KO mice following LCMV infection while MPECs were increased.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest a function for ARMC5 in promoting T-cell growth following TCR engagement possibly by regulating activation threshold levels; this provides a potential explanation for the observed increase in T-cell death following FasL engagement (Fig 4c) in KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that augmented apoptosis also plays a role in compromised Th1 and Th17 development from naive KO CD4 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ARMC5 mutations lead to PMAH in humans and diffuse adrenal gland hyperplasia in mice (Fig 3d), indicating that it has a default function of repressing adrenal cell proliferation, or a default pro-apoptotic function, or both.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, an in vitro study of the human adrenal gland cell line H295R revealed that ARMC5 overexpression culminates in apoptosis34, supporting its putative default anti-apoptotic function in adrenal glands.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dichotomous functions of ARMC5 in T cells versus adrenal glands indicate its tissue- or context-specificity, likely due to ARMC5s association with different binding partners.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In different types of cells, ARMC5 might preferentially bind to a certain partner, depending on its relative abundance in a given cell type or cell status.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the default function of ARMC5 in certain types of cells or cells with a given status could be either pro- or anti-proliferation, pro- or anti-apoptosis, or neutral.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could explain the different phenotypes seen in T cells versus adrenal glands, in terms of proliferation and apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could also explain the obvious dilemma that KO T-cell development in the thymus, which involves fast thymocyte proliferation, is normal, but TCR-stimulated T-cell proliferation/differentiation and virus-induced T-cell clonal expansion are defective in KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although B cells were not the focus of this study, we did demonstrate that KO B cells were compromised in proliferation triggered by BCR ligation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although KO mice had normal serum IgG levels, it is possible that, under strenuous conditions, KO mice might manifest defective humoral immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Based on the functional results of our ARMC5 study, those from PMAH investigations, and protein association information from Y2H assays, we propose the following speculative model of ARMC5 mechanisms of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ARMC5 transcription and protein expression are increased when the cells are activated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induced ARMC5 forms dimers (or multimers) in cytosol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such dimers are able to interact with different molecules in pathways regulating cell cycling and apoptosis, for example, CUL3 for cell cycling and DAPK1 for apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, depending on the relative abundance of binding proteins in different cell types and cells in different states, ARMC5 may interact preferentially with one or the other, leading to opposite functions in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that list of associating proteins might expand, pending further verification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we demonstrated that ARMC5 has vital functions in fetal development, T-cell biology, immune responses and adrenal gland biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have created Armc5 KO mice as the first animal model of a rare human disease: PMAH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our mechanistic study to identify ARMC5-binding partners has laid the groundwork for further elucidation of ARMC5s mechanisms of action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a better understanding of these mechanisms, this molecule may be deployed as a therapeutic target in immune and endocrine disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
