Bone-in-culture array as a platform to model early-stage bone metastases and discover anti-metastasis therapies  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The majority of breast cancer models for drug discovery are based on orthotopic or subcutaneous tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therapeutic responses of metastases, especially microscopic metastases, are likely to differ from these tumours due to distinct cancer-microenvironment crosstalk in distant organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, to recapitulate such differences, we established an ex vivo bone metastasis model, termed bone-in-culture array or BICA, by fragmenting mouse bones preloaded with breast cancer cells via intra-iliac artery injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer cells in BICA maintain features of in vivo bone micrometastases regarding the microenvironmental niche, gene expression profile, metastatic growth kinetics and therapeutic responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through a proof-of-principle drug screening using BICA, we found that danusertib, an inhibitor of the Aurora kinase family, preferentially inhibits bone micrometastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, certain histone methyltransferase inhibitors stimulate metastatic outgrowth of indolent cancer cells, specifically in the bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, BICA can be used to investigate mechanisms involved in bone colonization and to rapidly test drug efficacies on bone micrometastases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the clinic, primary breast tumours are usually surgically removed soon after diagnosis, leaving patients tumour-free.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, 2040% of breast cancer survivors will eventually suffer metastasis to distant organs, sometimes years after surgery1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the life-threatening enemy is typically not the bulk of primary tumours, but the dispersed metastatic seeds, which have disseminated to distant organs, may be temporarily dormant, and may resume aggressive outgrowth under certain yet-to-be-identified conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current adjuvant therapies are intended to eliminate these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the therapeutic decisions and strategies are usually based on pathological features of primary tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metastases are likely to differ from their parental primary tumours due to Darwinian selection and/or adaptation in a different milieu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In either case, the microenvironment in distant organs plays a critical role in driving the selection and/or adaptation of cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Bone is the organ most frequently affected by breast cancer metastasis3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its diagnosis relies on skeletal-related events, including pathological fractures8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, these events are caused by the vicious cycle between osteoclasts and cancer cells4,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer cells can release factors such as parathyroid hormone-related protein, which will stimulate the production of Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) by osteoblasts, leading to the activation of osteoclasts9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reciprocally, growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 and transforming growth factor- are released from dissolved bone matrix to further fuel cancer cell growth9,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have recently provided evidence supporting a pre-osteolytic phase of bone colonization before the vicious cycle13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this phase, breast cancer cells, especially the luminal subtype, tightly interact with cells in the osteoblast lineage, or osteogenic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Osteoclasts, on the other hand, do not appear to be involved until the transition from osteogenic lesions to osteolytic lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this finding, cancer cells injected through the iliac artery soon became tightly embedded in bone tissues and could only be dissociated with protease digestion, even after bone fragmentation14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This characteristic led us to establish an ex vivo model named bone-in-culture array or BICA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we provide evidence demonstrating that BICA mimics cancerbone interactions in the pre-osteolytic phase, and also recapitulates transitions to the osteolytic phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it represents a preclinical platform that may fill the gap between in vitro and in vivo models, and accelerate mechanistic and pharmacological studies of bone metastasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'BICA provides a bone-like microenvironment', 'BICA is based on a technique that we have previously established, namely intra-iliac artery (IIA) injection13, which selectively delivers cancer cells into the hindlimbs of mice through arterial circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After injection, cancer cells usually home to the spongy bone of the tibia or femur bones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To develop BICA, we extracted and fragmented epiphysis and metaphysis of hindlimb bones containing the cancer cells (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bone fragments (0.51.5 mm in diameter and 0.20.4 g cm3 in mineral density; Supplementary Fig 1b,c) can be maintained in tissue culture for up to 6 weeks without significant loss of viability (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the breast cancer cells utilized in this study are engineered to express luciferase, bioluminescence imaging can be used to quantify viable cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer cells remain confined within fragments during this time, probably due to the tight interaction between cancer and bone cells (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 2050 bone fragments can be obtained from one mouse, thus greatly reducing the number of mice needed for each experiment and making multiple parallel applications feasible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following paragraphs of this section, we describe several experiments performed to compare BICA with in vivo bone lesions (IVBL) introduced by IIA injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these comparisons, we also included orthotopic tumours and cancer cells maintained in two-dimensional (2D) cultures to represent the non-bone microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: BICA provides a bone-like microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of IIA injection-based establishment of BICA and IVBL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Luciferase/fluorescence protein-tagged cancer cells are inoculated into the external iliac artery of mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The injected animals will either be killed for BICA or left alive to give rise to IVBL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For BICA set-up, femur and tibia bones are extracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epiphysis and metaphysis are segmented into pieces (12 mm in diameter), which will then be arranged into low-attachment 96-well plates with cell culture media.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer cells can be traced using confocal microscopy and bioluminescence imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar in upper right panel, 100 m.

determine whether the microenvironment of cancer cells in BICA and IVBL are similar, we performed immunofluorescent staining of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen I (Col-I) and cathepsin K (CTSK).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ALP and Col-I are expressed in the cells of the osteoblast lineage, whereas CTSK is a marker of activated osteoclasts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression pattern of these molecules is very similar in the two models (Fig 1b and Supplementary Fig 1e), and consistent with what we have previously found in bone micrometastases at the pre-osteolytic stage13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Peri-vascular niche has been increasingly implicated in regulating cellular fates of disseminated tumour cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined whether endothelial cells remain in BICA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, immunofluorescence staining of CD31+ cells uncovered that at least some of these cells can persist for up to 3 weeks in BICA (Supplementary Fig 1f), providing potential opportunities to study the interaction between cancer cells and the peri-vascular niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although activated osteoclasts are absent at early time points, we noticed that some monocytes, the precursors of osteoclasts, remain close to bone fragments in BICA (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test whether these monocytes still maintain the potential to differentiate into osteoclasts, we added macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and RANKL to the medium and performed staining of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) to examine osteoclastic activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, M-CSF/RANKL treatment induced TRAP+, multinuclear osteoclasts (Supplementary Fig 2a) indicating that monocytes in BICA retain differentiation abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ask whether monocytes can spontaneously differentiate into activated osteoclasts in BICA, we applied cancer cell models that rapidly induce osteolytic vicious cycle in vivo, namely MDA-MB-231 cells and one of its osteotropic subpopulations, SCP28 cells15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At relatively late time points (35 weeks), we examined osteoclast differentiation by CTSK or TRAP staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, these cancer cells induced spontaneous osteoclastogenesis in BICA, both to monocytes suspended in medium (Supplementary Fig 2b) and to those remaining in bone fragments (Fig 1d and Supplementary Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, cancer cells that undergo indolent metastatic growth and prolonged pre-osteolytic stage (MCF-7) did not exhibit the same activity (Supplementary Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The activated osteoclasts in BICA appear to dissolve bone matrix as evidenced by an increased surface-to-volume ratio in SCP28-containing bone fragments (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, SCP28 cells showed a similar growth kinetic to in vivo condition and grew more rapidly as compared to the parental MDA-MB-231 cells in early time points, confirming that BICA can recapitulate metastasis bone tropism (Supplementary Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The growth kinetics of SCP28 cells in BICA closely mimicked the same cells in IVBL till 4 weeks after injection (Supplementary Fig 2f), when tumour-induced osteoclastogenesis had already started.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the growth then became retarded, probably because the tumour burden had saturated the bone surface area in the fragments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, BICA may not be able to recapitulate full-fledged vicious cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this limitation, our data demonstrated the suitability of BICA in modelling pre-osteolytic stage and perhaps also the transition from pre-osteolytic to osteolytic stages during bone colonization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To further characterize BICA at a molecular level, we performed transcriptomic profiling to determine similarities or differences between BICA and IVBL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cancer-containing bone segments in both BICA and IVBL were subjected to RNA-seq along with 2D culture samples and orthotopic tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since we used MCF-7 cells as a proof of principle, the cancer cell and host transcriptomes are human and mouse, respectively, and can be separated by mapping them to different reference genomes (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first applied CIBERSORT16 to the mouse sequences to deduce cell types constituting the microenvironments of BICA, IVBL and orthotopic tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major cellular components are comparable between BICA and IVBL, both of which differ markedly from those in orthotopic tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, among the 13 major cell types included into the analysis, osteoblasts, osteoprogenitors and mesenchymal stem cells together account for over two-thirds of microenvironment cells in both BICA and IVBL, but not in orthotopic tumours (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data support our previous finding that the niche of early-stage bone colonization is predominantly osteogenic13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principle component analysis and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding analysis17 of human RNAs indicated that the transcriptomic profiles of cancer cells in BICA more closely mimic those in IVBL, as compared to cancer cells in 2D and in orthotopic tumours (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results provide additional evidence supporting BICA as a platform to mimic the bone microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BICA provides opportunities to study metastasis dormancy', 'Some indolent cancer cells undergo delayed growth after being introduced into the bone by IIA injection13, suggesting a period of dormancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To track cellular fates of cancer cells in different microenvironment, we used inducible expression of histone protein 2B (H2B) fused with either firefly luciferase (Fluc) or green fluorescent protein (GFP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar systems were used before to study quiescent adult stem cells18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the expression of H2B-Fluc/GFP was fully induced in all cells, we withdrew doxycycline and followed GFP or bioluminescence signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We expected quiescent cells would maintain the expression of the fusion proteins in nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proliferating cells would have the fusion proteins diluted in each cell, but the overall quantity of the proteins should maintain the same level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell death would cause a net loss of these proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validated these predictions in 2D cultures by immunofluorescence staining of GFP in conjunction with Ki67 or BAX to indicate proliferation and apoptosis, respectively (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose BAX as an apoptosis marker here because Cleaved Caspase 3 is absent in MCF-7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, we also used constitutive expression of Fluc/GFP to simply follow numbers of viable cancer cells (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The combination of constitutive and inducible systems allowed us to delineate cancer cell fates: if a cell population is mainly consists of proliferating and dying cells, one would expect to see an alteration of constitutive Fluc/GFP (depending on the balance between proliferation and cell death), but a net decrease of induced H2B-Fluc/GFP signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, dormant cell population would have stable signals in both settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Dormant cancer cells in BICA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Experimental systems to determine cancer cell fates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Left:

Supplementary Fig 4ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, the induced H2B-Fluc signal of MCF-7 cells was stable for 2 weeks in BICA before starting to decrease, whereas the same signal in 2D cultures rapidly decreased (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that cancer cells in BICA maintained expression of H2B-GFP and were negative for both Ki67 and BAX (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since endothelial cells persist in BICA (Supplementary Fig 1f), we asked whether dormant cancer cells localize to peri-vascular niche20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, as reported in the previous literature21, we detected indolent MDA-MB-231 cells adjacent to CD31+ cells (Supplementary Fig 4d), supporting the significance of this niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data strongly suggest that some indolent cancer cells undergo a short period of dormancy in BICA, providing an opportunity to study the underlying mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BICA recapitulates the osteogenic niche', 'We asked whether the cancerniche interaction in BICA mimics that of IVBL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of the RNA-seq results revealed that cancer cells in both BICA and IVBL exhibited increased expression of mTOR target genes as well as genes involved in cellcell adhesions (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with our previous studies showing that luminal breast cancer cells utilize E-cadherin to form heterotypic adherens junctions with N-cadherin expressed by osteogenic cells13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This interaction activates the mTOR pathway in cancer cells and drives metastatic progression during early-stage bone colonization13 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following experiments, we asked whether BICA could recapitulate the cancerniche interaction observed in whole animals by pharmacological or genetic perturbations of the heterotypic adherens junctionsmTOR pathway in both BICA and IVBL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Cancer cells in BICA recapitulate the cancerniche interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) ssGSEA analyses of RNA-seq data identified coordinated alterations of mTOR target genes (left) and cell adhesion pathway genes (right) of MCF-7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each dot represents an individual animal (orthotopic (Ortho-) and IVBL), pooled bone fragments from an animal (BICA) or a tissue culture plate (2D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars: s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P value was determined by two-tailed unpaired MannWhitney U-test.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Schematic shows the previously demonstrated mechanism of cancerniche interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various perturbations are applied in subsequent figure panels as indicated, including an mTOR inhibitor, an antibody against E-cadherin (anti-Ecad) and genetic knockout (KO) of N-cadherin (Ncad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a comparison, a MAPK inhibitor is also used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Representative pictures demonstrating the conditional knockout of N-cadherin in Osterix+ cells in the bone of Osx-cre tetO;

N-cadherin is important for cancer colonization both in IVBL and in BICA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, we tested the efficacies of an mTOR inhibitor (Torin 1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor (PD98059) and a neutralizing antibody against E-cadherin on cancer cells in BICA, IVBL or 2D cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both the mTOR inhibitor and anti-E-cadherin treatment significantly inhibited the progression of IVBL (Fig 3f,g), as expected based on our previous findings (Fig 3b)13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the MAPK inhibitor failed to affect bone colonization (Fig 3h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When applied to BICA, both the mTOR inhibitor and anti-E-cadherin treatment could similarly inhibit cancer cells with high efficiencies (Fig 3i,j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the efficacy of anti-E-cadherin treatment is higher in BICA as compared to 2D cultures (Fig 3j), indicating that BICA enhances sensitivity of cancer cells to E-cadherin blockade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, BICA confers resistance to the MAPK inhibitor, a phenomenon also seen in IVBL (Fig 3h) but not in 2D culture (Fig 3k).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, BICA, similar to IVBL but different from 2D

their effects on cancer cells in BICA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The library contains 68 small-molecule epigenetic modulators (designated as EG library, available from Selleckchem, Catalogue # L1900).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was chosen based on the rationale that adaptation of cancer cells to the bone microenvironment may involve epigenomic reprogramming, which might be modulated by some of these compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For comparison, we simultaneously applied these compounds to the same cancer cells in 2D cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We intended to identify compounds exhibiting differential effects in BICA as compared to 2D cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two rounds of tests were conducted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first round, the EG library was divided into functionally related groups containing five to six compounds (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Groups that exhibited strong effects were then separated and subjected to the second-round tests (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first round of tests, diverse effects of different groups were observed in both BICA and 2D cultures (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we noticed that Aurora kinase inhibitors and histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitors exhibited significant but opposite effects: the former inhibited and the latter stimulated tumour growth in BICA, as compared to the same cancer cells in 2D cultures

fragments revealed strong negative impacts of these compounds on the viability of healthy bone cells (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we only focused on the Aurora kinase inhibitors

danusertib could achieve over 90% inhibition rate of tumour growth in BICA, but only 60% in 2D or 3D cultures (Fig 5a and Supplementary Fig 7a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference is unlikely due to different levels of baseline proliferation, as the proliferation rate in 3D suspension medium is much lower than that in 2D or BICA, yet the inhibition rate of danusertib in 3D culture is similar to that in 2D culture, but lower than that in BICA (Supplementary Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the bone microenvironment appears to enhance sensitivity of cancer cells to danusertib.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

inhibitory effects as with MCF-7 cells (Fig 5b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next tested the efficacy of danusertib in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were especially interested in examining the effects of danusertib on early-stage, microscopic bone metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we chose to use indolent models with a prolonged pre-osteolytic stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bone colonization kinetics of MCF-7 cells were characterized in our previous studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The osteolytic vicious cycle typically occurs over 5 weeks after IIA injection13, providing a time window to examine drug effects in the pre-osteolytic stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment with danusertib almost completely abolished the progression of pre-osteolytic bone lesions (Fig 5d and Supplementary Fig 7c).

spontaneous bone metastases (Fig 5e), but not local recurrences of orthotopic tumours (Supplementary Fig 7e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we asked whether danusertib inhibits bone colonization by eliminating dormant cancer cells, which would be highly desirable in the clinic to permanently decrease risks of recurrence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Towards this end, we used the inducible H2B-Fluc/GFP system and found that danusertib decreased the otherwise stable H2B-Fluc/GFP signals in BICA, a strong indication of reduction of dormant cancer cells (Fig 5f and Supplementary Fig 7f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was supported by the BAX expression observed in H2B-GFP+ cells in danusertib-treated bone fragments (Fig 5g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, these data support that danusertib treatment represents an effective strategy to prevent bone recurrences, possibly by eliminating dormant disseminated tumour cells in the bone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'EPZ-6438 and MM-102 stimulate tumour progression in bone', 'EPZ-6438 targets EZH2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  26), and MM-102 is a potent WDR5/MLL interaction inhibitor27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both of these compounds stimulated tumour growth in BICA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this stimulatory effect was BICA-specific (Fig 4d and Supplementary Fig 7b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2D cultures, these two compounds had modest inhibitory effects on cancer cell viability at a dosage of 10 M (35% inhibition for EPZ-6438 and 13% inhibition for MM-102).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a clear dose-dependent increase of tumour burden was seen when applied to BICA (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same effects of these drugs were also seen using MDA-MB-361 as a second model in BICA (Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then examined whether EPZ-6438 (chosen over MM-102 because it has been tested in vivo28) could also promote bone colonization in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Towards this end, we performed IIA injection of MCF-7 cells on animals without oestradiol supplement, which usually resulted in even more indolent bone colonization of this ER+ cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EPZ-6438 significantly increased bone colonization even under this oestradiol-deficient condition (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is likely that histone methylation may play an important role in cancerniche interaction and resistance to oestrogen deprivation therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because EZH2 has been considered to be a tumour-promoting gene, we hypothesized that its function could be context-dependent in human metastases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used an EZH2 target gene signature29 as an index of EZH2 activities, and applied it to breast cancer metastases in different organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, a large variation was observed: bone and brain metastases express significantly lower levels of EZH2 target genes as compared to metastases in other organs (Fig 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the bone microenvironment may favour reduced EZH2 activities in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate the utility of BICA for discovery of unexpected effects of compounds and their target pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6:

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It has long been recognized that the microenvironment plays an important role in dictating metastatic progression and modulating therapeutic responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both direct cellcell crosstalk and interaction with extracellular matrix can rewire signalling network inside cancer cells, thereby modulating their behaviours under specific conditions30,31, probably through inducing epigenetic changes in cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particularly in bone both osteoblasts and osteoclasts, as well as other resident cells, together constitute a unique cellular and molecular environment5, which likely renders metastatic cells resistant to some and vulnerable to other perturbations as compared to the same cancer cells in other milieu.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A prominent example is anti-osteoclast treatment with bisphosphonate and denosumab, which have been widely used in the clinic to limit the progression of osteolytic bone metastases32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, several pathways have been shown to mediate cancerbone crosstalk, including Notch33, transforming growth factor- (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34), HIF35,36, Integrin37, Irf7 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38), VCAM1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39) and mTOR13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These clinical and preclinical investigations highlighted the urgency of considering microenvironment when treating metastatic cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BICA meets this imperative need by recapitulating cancerniche interaction in early-stage bone colonization and revealing bone-specific therapeutic responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Some previous studies also aimed to model cancerbone interactions under ex vivo or in vitro settings40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One study added cancer cells to already-fragmented bone chips41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Others attempted to mimic one or a few aspects of the bone microenvironment by using extracellular matrix43,44, hydrogel45, man-made ceramic and composite scaffolds46, or cell-derived matrices47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BICA differs significantly from these approaches, in that it delivers cancer cells into natural bone tissue via circulation, and allows the subsequent seeding and cancerniche interaction to occur in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the tight cancerbone adherence, several important features are maintained after fragmentation, including the cellular components of the metastasis niche, the gene expression of cancer cells, growth kinetics and the specific mechanisms of cancerniche crosstalk (Figs 1, 2, 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This faithfulness has not been demonstrated in any of the above ex vivo models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Co-transplantation of human fetus bone fragments and cancer cells have been demonstrated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spontaneous bone metastases occurred preferentially to human bones over mouse bones in this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the cancerbone interaction is between human tissues48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, restricted availability of fetus bone tissue limits the wide application of this approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it would be difficult to apply quantitative and rapid parallel assays with spontaneous metastasis models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BICA overcomes these barriers and provides a highly complementary platform to accelerate therapeutic and mechanistic studies of bone metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the current study BICA was primarily used to model pre-osteolytic micrometastases, although we also demonstrated its potential to investigate the onset of osteoclast activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps because of limited bone surface area and insufficient monocyte supply, the ability of BICA to model full-fledged vicious cycle is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pre-osteolytic stage corresponds to the phase when adjuvant therapies are applied in the clinic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although adjuvant therapies are intended to target micrometastases in distant organs, the decision and choice of specific treatments has to be made based on features of primary tumours.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study we provided three specific examples of how cancer cells in a different context may respond differently to certain drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While danusertib exhibited enhanced efficacies on cancer cells interacting with bone, two HMT inhibitors unexpectedly showed the opposite trendthey promoted tumour growth, specifically in the bone microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several types of mechanisms could lead to such markedly altered responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, cancerbone interaction may rewire the signalling network in cancer cells, thereby altering their responses to certain drugs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, some drugs may act on the microenvironment niche cells, thereby indirectly affecting cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, biophysical and biochemical properties of the microenvironment niche may enrich or deprive certain drugs, thereby changing the bioavailability of these drugs to cancer cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies will be needed to delineate specific mechanisms behind each drug that exhibits distinct effects on cancer cells in the bone microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We observed that endothelial cells could persist for weeks in BICA (Supplementary Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we detected dormant cancer cells adjacent to endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results support that the peri-vascular niche regulates metastasis dormancy20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our previous studies demonstrated that the osteogenic niche promotes cancer cell proliferation13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, cellular fates of cancer cells may be influenced by their distribution or migration between different microenvironment niches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More quantitative and, ideally, real-time imaging will be needed to further pursue this hypothesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A limitation of BICA is the lack of immune cells other than monocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adaptive immunity was shown to play an important role in bone metastasis38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This limitation may be partially overcome by reconstituting some of the immune cell components in the ex vivo environment of BICA in future studies.'
