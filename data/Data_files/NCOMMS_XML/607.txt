Endoglin integrates BMP and Wnt signalling to induce haematopoiesis through JDP2  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Mechanisms of haematopoietic and cardiac patterning remain poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the BMP and Wnt signalling pathways are integrated in an endoglin (Eng)-dependent manner in cardiac and haematopoietic lineage specification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eng is expressed in early mesoderm and marks both haematopoietic and cardiac progenitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of Eng, yolk sacs inappropriately express the cardiac marker, Nkx2.5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, high levels of Eng in vitro and in vivo increase haematopoiesis and inhibit cardiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Levels of Eng determine the activation of both BMP and Wnt pathways, which are integrated downstream of Eng by phosphorylation of Smad1 by Gsk3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By interrogating Eng-dependent Wnt-mediated transcriptional changes, we identify Jdp2 as a key Eng-dependent Wnt target, sufficient to establish haematopoietic fate in early mesoderm when BMP and Wnt crosstalk is disturbed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies provide mechanistic insight into the integration of BMP and Wnt signalling in the establishment of haematopoietic and cardiac progenitors during embryogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the developing embryos, haematopoietic and cardiac cells arise as subpopulations of lateral plate mesoderm1,2, but the phenotypic profiles of these progenitors as well as the molecular mechanisms regulating their specification remain not well defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is known that BMP and Wnt signals from the extra-embryonic region and epiblast, respectively, are required for mesoderm induction3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homozygous deletion of BMP4 and its type 1 receptor BMPR1a, as well as Wnt3 and its intercellular effector -catenin, result in embryonic lethality due to the failure of mesoderm formation and subsequent patterning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wnt signals along with BMP are also critical to establish the prospective cardiac population1 by directing the migration of cardiac progenitors from the primitive streak to the heart forming region4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This convergence of Wnt and BMP signalling is also observed during haematopoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies involving avian embryo manipulation and in vitro differentiation of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells have demonstrated that the combination of Wnt and BMP signalling is essential for haematopoietic specification and commitment towards the primitive erythroid lineage1,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously reported that endoglin (Eng), an ancillary receptor for the transforming growth factor- superfamily, is required for early haematopoietic lineage specification, and that Eng acts by modulating output of the BMP signalling pathway7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Haematopoiesis was found impaired in both Eng-deficient differentiating ES cells10 and embryos9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, upregulation of Eng using doxycycline-inducible Eng (iEng) ES cells resulted in enhanced haematopoietic differentiation and suppressed cardiac differentiation7, suggesting a key role for this receptor in early cell fate specification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using zebrafish and mouse models, in the present study, we provide in vivo evidence for the dual role of Eng in blood and cardiac lineage specification, and show that this effect results from enhanced Wnt activity, which is directly regulated by Eng.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, levels of Eng determine the activation potential of both BMP and Wnt pathways, and phosphorylation of Smad1 by Gsk3 is the point of integration between BMP and Wnt signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show that Eng identifies early progenitors endowed with haematopoietic and cardiac potential that are Eng+Flk-1+ and Eng+Flk-1, respectively, demonstrating that Eng marks not only haematopoietic but also cardiac cell fate within the mesoderm population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through whole transcriptome analyses of these early haematopoietic and cardiac progenitor fractions, in the presence or absence of the Wnt inhibitor IWR, we identified Jdp2, a member of the AP-1 transcription factor family, as a key Eng-dependent downstream target of Wnt signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we show Jdp2 expression is sufficient to establish haematopoietic fate in early mesoderm when BMP and Wnt crosstalk is disturbed, providing mechanistic insight into the establishment of haematopoietic and cardiac progenitors during embryogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Effect of Eng induction in vitro and in vivo', 'Our previous findings using in vitro differentiation of iEng ES cells suggest a time-dependent effect, as Eng overexpression from day 2 to 8 of embryoid body (EB) differentiation repressed cardiogenesis, whereas Eng overexpression from day 4 to 8 had no effect7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To better understand this temporal dependence, we performed a fine time-course analysis, which revealed a short window from day 2 to 3 in which overexpression of Eng enhances haematopoiesis and represses cardiac differentiation (Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the time at which mesoderm is being specified to haematopoietic or cardiac fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate whether Eng induction results in cardiac suppression in vivo, we collected E8.5 mouse embryos, a time point with abundant cardiovascular progenitors11, and transduced these with lentiviral vectors encoding Eng or empty vector (control pSAM; Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Control explant cultures gave rise to large clusters of cells positive for cTnI (Supplementary Fig 1d, lower left), in contrast to Eng-transduced explants, which presented significantly reduced numbers of cells expressing cTnI (Supplementary Fig 1d, lower right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a complementary approach, we utilized a cardiac reporter transgenic zebrafish, in which GFP identifies cardiac progenitors that are positive for myosin light chain 2 Tg(cmlc2:EGFP)12, to determine whether Eng induction disturbs cardiac specification in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) embryos at the 12-cell stage were injected with human ENG messenger RNA (mRNA), which has been previously demonstrated to cross-react in zebrafish13, or with control mCherry mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our in vitro and ex vivo studies, live imaging analyses at 16 h post fertilization (h.p.f.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  demonstrated impaired cardiogenesis in ENG-injected embryos, evidenced by reduced levels of GFP expression (Fig 1a, right panel) when compared with mCherry-injected controls (Fig 1a, left panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses confirmed that the number of EGFP+ (cmlc2+) cells within the ENG+ population was reduced when compared with those within the control mCherry+ population (Fig 1b), further indicating that enhanced expression of Eng represses cardiac specification during gastrulation', 'Figure 1: The dual effect of endoglin in early cell specification requires Wnt activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) ENDOGLIN (ENG) and control mCherry mRNAs were injected into Tg(cmlc2:EGFP) zebrafish embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Embryos were imaged to visualize cardiac progenitors (EGFP+ cells) at 16 h.p.f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All views are dorsal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 m.

(YS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eng/ E9.5 YSs have been reported to exhibit severely reduced haematopoietic colony activity as well as marked downregulation of Scl, Gata1, Gata2 and globins9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we interrogated here whether the role of Eng was to actively repress other lineages in E9.5 YSs (Supplementary Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the gene expression level, we observed significant upregulation of Nkx2.5 (Supplementary Fig 1f, left), one of the earliest markers of cardiac development14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression levels of Gata4 and cTnI also trended towards elevated levels in Eng-null YSs (Supplementary Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest a role for Eng in enabling the haematopoietic program by preventing the expression of cardiac-specific genes at hemogenic sites during mesoderm specification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then evaluated the effect of overexpressing Eng in vivo during mouse embryo development using iEng mice, which we generated from the previously described iEng ES cells7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed in Fig 1c, robust induction of Eng was observed in E8.5 YSs from embryos whose mothers were treated with dox during pregnancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, equal numbers of YS cells from these embryos were directly plated into methylcellulose containing haematopoietic cytokines to examine haematopoietic colony activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As observed in Fig 1d, Eng-induced YSs gave rise to increased numbers of haematopoietic colonies when compared with non-induced YSs, confirming that Eng induction results in enhanced haematopoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess cardiogenesis, we dissected E8.5 embryos, and separated anterior (containing cardiac progenitors) from posterior domains (used for genotype).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of Pdgfra and Flk-1 identifies cardiac progenitors at this developmental stage15,16, therefore we analysed the expression of these markers in the Eng+ cell fraction of the anterior regions of these embryos.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with our hypothesis, the frequency of Pdgfra+Flk-1+ cells within the Eng+ population was found significantly decreased when Eng was induced (Fig 1e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these in vivo data confirm dual positive/negative functions for Eng in the establishment of haematopoietic and cardiac progenitors, respectively, during mesoderm specification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Eng directly regulates Wnt signalling', 'Based on the critical role of Wnt signalling during early haematopoiesis and cardiogenesis1,6,17, we investigated whether Wnt activation is involved in Eng-mediated mesoderm specification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we assessed the effect of the canonical Wnt signalling inhibitor, IWR-1, in Eng-induced EB cultures, and found that the inhibitory effect of Eng induction (+dox) on cardiac differentiation was abrogated by inhibition of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether this would also be the case in vivo, we cultured Eng- and mock-transduced embryo explants in the presence or absence of IWR-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the in vitro EB data, addition of IWR-1 to Eng-transduced primary cultures counteracted the inhibitory effect of Eng on cardiac differentiation (Supplementary Fig 1g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that Wnt inhibition by IWR-1 in EB cultures negatively affected the ability of Eng to induce haematopoiesis (Fig 1h), demonstrating that the function of Eng at this early stage of development requires active Wnt signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine whether Eng induction promotes Wnt activation, we generated a -catenin-dependent reporter ES cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reporter (7xTcf-FFluc//SV40-mCherry) contains 7Tcf-binding sites, allowing us to monitor Wnt activity using a luciferase reporter assay18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subjected Eng-induced or control cultures to a brief pulse of Wnt signal (3 h of exposure to the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021), and observed that reporter activity was increased in Eng-induced cultures when compared with non-induced or mock cultures (DMSO treated; Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased reporter activity observed in the Eng-induced sample that had been treated with CHIR99021 was confirmed by western blot using an antibody specific for active -catenin (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was further corroborated in vivo utilizing Tg(7xTCF:mCherry) zebrafish embryos, which at 12 h.p.f.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  exhibit transgenic reporter expression regulated by Wnt/-catenin signalling, as measured by mCherry fluorescence19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We injected 12-cell stage zebrafish embryos with ENG mRNA or control venus mRNA (Fig 2c, upper panels), and at 12 h.p.f., injected embryos were collected and analysed for mCherry expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed that mCherry expression within the ENG+ cell fraction in ENG-injected embryos was significantly increased when compared with that found within the venus+ cell fraction in venus-injected controls (Fig 2c, lower panels; Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, mCherry expression within the ENG cell fraction of ENG-injected embryos was similar to control levels, 21% (Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, equivalent results were obtained when we injected an ENG mutant construct encoding a deletion of the orphan domain (OD; Supplementary Fig 2b,c), which is required for ENG expression and ligand binding20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data confirm that Eng induction enhances Wnt activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Endoglin-mediated Wnt activation enhances Smad1 activity to promote haematopoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) A -catenin-dependent reporter

haematopoietic activity correlating with reduced levels of Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation when dorsomorphin, a BMP signalling inhibitor, was added to these cultures7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown in Xenopus that Smad1, the downstream effector of BMP signalling, is also a target of Gsk3-mediated phosphorylation21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gsk3 is a component of the Wnt degradation complex, and inhibition of this kinase, which maintains the Wnt pathway activate, contributes to the stabilization of activated Smad1 and ultimately strengthens BMP signalling21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, western blot analyses of day 4 Eng-induced EB cultures revealed that increased levels of phosphorylated Smad1 (S456/8 and S426/8) were accompanied by higher levels of dephosphorylated active -catenin and inhibitory forms of Gsk3 (pGsk3 / S21/9) (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether Eng regulates both BMP and Wnt signals to enhance Smad1 activity and, consequently, increased haematopoietic commitment from mesoderm, we investigated whether sustained Wnt-deregulated Smad1 activity could phenocopy Eng overexpression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated an ES cell line with inducible expression of mutant Smad1 (S210A) lacking the Gsk3-mediated phosphorylation site (Supplementary Fig 2e,f), which has been shown to be responsible for Smad1 degradation21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As hypothesized, enhanced haematopoiesis was observed only in Smad1 S210A dox-induced cultures (Fig 2e, left), similar to the effect of Eng induction in this developmental stage7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induction of wild-type (WT) Smad1 had no effect on colony formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, whereas Wnt stimulation with CHIR resulted in enhanced haematopoiesis in induced WT Smad1 cultures (iSmad1 WT), no effect was observed in the S210A mutant (Fig 2e, right), confirming that Wnt-mediated enhancement of haematopoiesis is dependent on the phosphorylation of Smad1 at S210.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To gain further insight into how integration of BMP and Wnt pathways regulates the commitment of mesoderm, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation in D4 EBs followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) for Smad1 in the absence or presence of IWR-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the previous reports22, Smad1 binding was detected at the regulatory elements of known BMP targets Id1, Id2 and Id3 (Fig 2f), which was also validated by ChIPquantitative PCR (qPCR; Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, IWR-1 treatment negatively affected Smad1 binding at specific loci (Fig 2f,g) and genome wide (Fig 2h; Supplementary Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the 10,466 sites identified, Smad1 binding was impaired at 3,500 sites and disrupted at 6,500 sites (respectively, groups A and BSupplementary Fig 2i), thus supporting the essential role of BMP and Wnt integration to regulate Smad1 activity at the genome-wide level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we also observed Smad1 binding at Tbx5 and Wnt inhibitory factor1 (Wif1; Supplementary Fig 2g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tbx5, along with Nkx2.5, is a key transcription factor for cardiac specification, as well evidenced by studies showing that disruption of its interaction with chromatin remodelling complex resulted in impaired cardiogenesis23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that BMP and Wnt integration is critical for cardiac commitment, our data suggest that BMP may repress Tbx5 expression in mesodermal cells, which could account for Eng-mediated cardiac repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wif1 has been identified as a Smad1 target and it has been postulated to modulate BMP and Wnt activities in the developing mouse lung24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with Xu and colleagues, we observed that Smad1 occupies similar regions in the promoter and first intron of the Wif1 gene (Supplementary Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these data demonstrate that BMP and Wnt modulation is critical not only for Smad1 stability but also for the genome-wide occupancy of its binding sites in mesodermal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Haematopoietic and cardiac progenitors express Eng', 'To determine whether Eng expression regulates haematopoietic and cardiac cell fate specification from uncommitted mesodermal progenitors, we utilized a GFP-Brachyury (Bry) reporter ES cell line25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this cell line, GFP is knocked into the Bry locus, allowing us to monitor Bry expression during EB differentiation, and, importantly, to isolate early mesodermal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, using this reporter ES cell line, Keller and colleagues have demonstrated that in day 3 EBs, haematopoietic progenitors are enriched within the Bry+Flk-1+ cell fraction, whereas cardiac cells are predominantly in the Bry+Flk-1 cell subpopulation11,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this evidence, we investigated the expression of endoglin (Eng or E) in combination with Flk-1 (F) in day 3 Bry+ EB cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3a, four distinct cell subpopulations were identified: E+F+, E+F, EF+ and EF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These subfractions were FACS-purified, and sorted cells were reaggregated for 24 h in the absence or presence of IWR-1 to determine whether Wnt activity would affect Eng-mediated mesoderm specification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the haematopoietic potential in reaggregates from E+F+ and EF+ subpopulations by plating these in methylcellulose containing haematopoietic cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results showed a significant enrichment in haematopoietic activity in the Bry+ cell fraction that is double positive for Eng and Flk-1 (E+F+) when compared with the unsorted group (30-fold), and remarkably also superior than the EF+ subpopulation (2-fold) (Fig 3b, white bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enrichment was abrogated by IWR-1, indicating that Wnt activity is required for the haematopoietic commitment of E+F+ cells (Fig 3b, black bars).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhibitory effect was not observed in cells negative for Eng (EF+; Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the previous data25, only very few haematopoietic colonies were observed when the Flk-1-negative cell population was assayed (E+F and EF; Supplementary Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine their cardiac potential, reaggregates from E+F and EF populations were plated as monolayers in the presence IWR-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, contractile cardiomyocytes were observed only in the E+F group with IWR-1 (Supplementary Movies 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations were corroborated by analyses for the cardiac functional Tnni3 gene (Fig 3c), which showed prominent expression in the Bry+E+F (fourfold higher than unsorted and Bry+EF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal that Eng identifies

analysed the expression pattern of various genes expressed in the E+F+ population (Supplementary Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In support of our RNA-Seq data, we found the expression pattern of Jdp2 and Epas1 to be co-localized to that of Eng as well as the haematopoietic transcription factor Gata2, which were observed in the posterior region at this developmental stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

that Jdp2 is an important downstream effector of Eng.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding was subsequently validated in vivo using Eng-deficient E9.5 YSs, which have defective haematopoietic development9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jdp2-encoding and GFP control lentiviral vectors were introduced into Eng-null (KO) and littermate control (CTL) YSs, and haematopoietic activity was enumerated following their direct

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our study has revealed Eng as a critical modulator of the crosstalk observed between BMP and Wnt signalling pathways during early cell fate specification of the cardiac and haematopoietic lineages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, Eng ensures the commitment of Bry+ mesodermal precursors (GFP+Eng+) towards the haematopoietic lineage by repressing the cardiac program in hemogenic sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we have identified Jdp2 as a target of Eng-mediated BMP and Wnt signalling, providing a molecular mechanism that illustrates how signalling pathways and their targets orchestrate the haematopoietic commitment of mesoderm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'During embryogenesis, BMP signals are not only required for mesoderm induction but also for blood commitment36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, forced expression of Smad1 enhances hemangioblast activity and the haematopoietic commitment of these cells towards the haematopoietic lineage37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to BMP, the Wnt signalling pathway plays pivotal roles in development38, and specifically in the haematopoietic system, Wnt signals are required for primitive haematopoiesis39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, crosstalk between BMP and Wnt has been reported to be involved in the activation of the haematopoietic program in mesodermal cells5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings provide key insights into the mechanism behind this crosstalk, as they reveal that Eng modulates BMP and Wnt signals to enhance Smad1 activity and ultimately haematopoiesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further demonstrated that BMP and Wnt integration via Smad1 is critical to regulate gene expression in mesodermal cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, Smad1 binding was detected at Tbx5, suggesting a potential mechanism of Smad1-mediated Tbx5 repression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, reduced levels of Tbx5 have been reported upon Eng induction7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we revealed that Jdp2 is regulated by Eng-mediated BMP and Wnt modulation and plays a critical function in promoting the haematopoietic commitment from early mesoderm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jdp2, an AP-1 family transcription factor, has been reported to modulate chromatin by inhibiting histone acetyltransferase activity41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Jdp2 expression was shown to be important for the lymphoid versus myeloid lineage decision by modulating DNA methylation42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophil activity has been reported to be impaired in Jdp2/ mice43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A function for Jdp2 during embryogenesis had not previously been documented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these studies, we speculate that BMP- and Wnt-mediated Jdp2 induction may be required for directing epigenetic modification of mesodermal progenitors, allowing them to acquire the haematopoietic fate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Together, our data support the notion that Eng is critical for the crosstalk between BMP and Wnt pathways during development and contribute to broaden our understanding of the transforming growth factor- superfamily signalling in embryonic cell fate decisions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
