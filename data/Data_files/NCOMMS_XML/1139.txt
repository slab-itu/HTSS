Probing nanofriction and Aubry-type signatures in a finite self-organized system  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Friction in ordered atomistic layers plays a central role in various nanoscale systems ranging from nanomachines to biological systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It governs transport properties, wear and dissipation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defects and incommensurate lattice constants markedly change these properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, experimental systems have become accessible to probe the dynamics of nanofriction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we present a model system consisting of laser-cooled ions in which nanofriction and transport processes in self-organized systems with back action can be studied with atomic resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that in a system with local defects resulting in incommensurate layers, there is a transition from sticking to sliding with Aubry-type signatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate spectroscopic measurements of the soft vibrational mode driving this transition and a measurement of the order parameter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show numerically that both exhibit critical scaling near the transition point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies demonstrate a simple, well-controlled system in which friction in self-organized structures can be studied from classical- to quantum-regimes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dry friction is the resistance to the relative movement of two solid layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is responsible for many phenomena such as earthquakes, wear or crack propagation and is of enormous practical and technological impact1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Amontons and Coulomb, friction between solids is proportional to the normal force but independent of the contact areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This intriguing result was explained by realizing that macroscopic objects touch at asperities that are deformed2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A different signature occurs when atomically flat surfaces slide against each other, as for example encountered in micro- or nanoelectromechanical systems or biological molecular motors1,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this nanoscale level the friction is no longer described by the Amontons-Coulomb law.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, mathematical models were developed which are simple enough to be analysed analytically and yet should capture the salient features of the friction phenomena.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the sliding atomic layers are in contact with a thermal environment, dry friction phenomena are a problem of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics as well as nonlinear dynamics5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One of the most successful models describing friction phenomena is the FrenkelKontorova (FK) model6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It consists of a chain of coupled particles sliding over a static periodic potential, which mimics a rigid undeformable substrate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis of this model has revealed highly nontrivial, nonlinear dynamics such as the creation of kinks and anti-kinks, which facilitate the sliding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For an infinite system with incommensurate lattice periodicities, this model displays the celebrated Aubry transition7, where the sliding motion becomes frictionless, due to the competition of different interaction energies in the atomic many-body system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In solid-state systems, this superlubric regime has been demonstrated in nanocontacts of graphene and gold surfaces8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In finite systems a smooth-sliding regime with finite dissipation exists instead of the superlubric phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An Aubry-type transition with a symmetry breaking signature occurs, when the system changes from the smooth-sliding to stick-slip regime12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'With the advent of atomic and friction force microscopes and microbalances it became possible to study individual sliding junctions at the atomistic level14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These techniques have identified many friction phenomena at the nanoscale, but many key aspects of friction dynamics are not yet well understood due to the lack of probes that characterize the contact surfaces directly and in situ1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Laser-cooled and trapped ions have been proposed to emulate nanocontacts and to provide insights into the dynamics of friction processes18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this scenario, the FK model is emulated by a chain of ions trapped in the harmonic potential of an ion trap, which is overlapped with an optical standing wave mimicking the corrugation potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Signatures of an Aubry-type transition, that is, fragmentation and symmetry breaking of the periodic configuration of the ion chain, have been predicted, when the optical lattice depth increases above a critical value19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another signature of the Aubry transition is the existence of a soft mode, that is, a vibrational mode whose frequency approaches zero at the critical point and drives the transition from pinned to sliding motion12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such behaviour is also predicted for finite chains of ions in an external optical corrugation potential21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, Bylinskii et al.22 succeeded in cooling up to five ions into an optical lattice and demonstrated the onset of reduced friction and dissipation in a coupled atomic many-body system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this experiment, the symmetry breaking Aubry-type transition has been observed for the first time with microscopic resolution23, together with velocity effects in the stick-slip motion24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another synthetic system, in which the microscopic processes of friction have become accessible, are colloidal monolayers driven across external optical potentials25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All these systems aim to emulate the classical FK model, where a layer of interacting particles slides over a fixed rigid corrugation potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report on the microscopic and spectroscopic control of a system without an externally imposed corrugation potential but consisting of two deformable back acting atomic layers, whose relative motion exhibits the phenomena of nanoscale friction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This system has similarities to a refined microscopic model of friction, which replaces the rigid substrate by a deformable substrate monolayer pinned to a solid body26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we investigate static friction under the influence of a structural defect and demonstrate physical properties of the system, which are common to finite incommensurate systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use a structural defect (kink) in an ion Coulomb crystal27 to create a local disturbance in the ion spacing in the upper and lower chain, and demonstrate an Aubry-type transition when the interatomic spacing of the layers is varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show, using numerical calculations, that the soft mode frequency exhibits a power law scaling behaviour in the vicinity of the critical point, where the system becomes superlubric.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental spectroscopic measurements show a small reduction in the frequency of the soft mode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-vanishing frequency of the sliding mode is due to the finite temperature exciting nonlinear dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the experimentally measured order parameter agrees with numerical results, which also exhibit a power law scaling in the vicinity of the critical point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our system relates to solid-state phenomena such as charge density waves28 and dislocations in crystals6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the scenario of two interacting, deformable atomic chains with back action is analogous to friction in fibrous composite materials29, sliding of DNA strands30 and propagation of protein loops31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The manuscript is structured as follows: in the first section we introduce our experiment and model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the next section, we investigate the structural features of an Aubry-type transitionthe symmetry breaking, the order parameter and the hull function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then study the properties of the soft mode using spectroscopic measurements and numerical calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we discuss our results and prospects of our model system.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Experimental system', 'Our system consists of a two-dimensional ion Coulomb crystal in a linear rf trap32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several tens of 172Yb+ ions are laser-cooled to temperatures around T1 mK, so that they crystallize and self-organize into two ordered chains with interatomic distances of ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15 to 20 m, see Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ions are fluoresced by near-resonant laser light and imaged onto an electron multiplying charged coupled device (CCD) camera providing single atom and photon detection, as graphically depicted in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The axial harmonic confinement of the ion trap leads to an inhomogeneous ion spacing, in particular at the edges of the crystal, while the central part of large-enough crystals exhibits a slowly varying lattice spacing with interatomic distances a and b within one layer and in between the layers, respectively, see Fig 1b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Experimental set-up and model system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of the experimental set-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several tens of ions are trapped inside a linear rf trap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An rf amplitude of around 1,000 V at the four quadrupole electrodes creates a time averaged confining potential in radial direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The harmonic axial confinement is created via different dc voltages on the segmented electrodes, indicated by the orange dashed line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical radial and axial trapping frequencies are  kHz and  kHz, leading to inter-ion distances of a20 m and b15 m. The ions are illuminated with laser 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vibrational mode spectroscopy is performed with laser 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fluorescence of the ions is imaged onto an electron multiplying CCD camera.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The central part of the Coulomb crystal can be pictured as a self-organized interface between two solids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the axial movement of the two atomic layers we consider the following model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each chain is connected to the substrate via springs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The next-neighbour interaction between particles in the same row is modelled as spring forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deformability leads to identical intra chain spacing a in upper and low layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The chains can move relative against each other, using differential laser light forces.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) A structural defect inside the Coulomb crystal locally breaks the periodicity of the two chains, resulting in different particle distances a1 and a2 in the chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) The Coulomb potential of one row of ions acts as the corrugation potential for the other row.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The depth of the corrugation U0 determines the dynamics of the system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below a critical corrugation depth  the system displays horizontal mirror symmetry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above the critical value  the symmetry is broken.Full size image', 'In the following, we consider the one-dimensional axial motion of the two chains along the z axis in opposite directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The friction dynamics depends on the relative interaction energies within each crystal row, Uintra, and between the rows, Uinter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate the energy scales of these competing interaction strengths in our system, we relate them to the characteristic length and frequency scales in the Coulomb crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, it is convenient to view the system as two linear chains of identical particles of mass m which are joined by interatomic springs of stiffness , depending on the inter-ion distance a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The masses are attached to a rigid support by external springs of stiffness  due to the elastic confinement in the ion trap along the axial direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here  is the frequency of the centre of mass mode along the z axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this setting, the two chains of ions can be moved and distorted by optical forces or light pressure as indicated with FA and FB in Fig 1b,c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the case of periodically ordered chains as shown in Fig 1b, stick-slip motion of the two layers of ions with respect to each other is expected to be approximated by the classical PrandtlTomlinson model34, where a single particle has to overcome the potential energy barriers created by the periodic atomic lattice below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when a structural defect is present, the local disturbance in the periodicity of upper and lower chain leads to the nonlinear many-body phenomenon of reduced friction6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The underlying reason is that atoms in one layer will now locally sense different corrugation potential energies, which then can be stored by the internal springs described by .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate friction in soft chains of atomically flat layers under the presence of a defect, we create a stable structural defect in the centre of the Coulomb crystal, see Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This causes slightly different interatomic distances a1 and a2 in the central part of the Coulomb crystal, see Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A rough estimate of the interaction energy between two ions inside one layer is Uintra=z2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corrugation potential pinning ions of one chain with respect to the other chain can be locally approximated as , as indicated in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depending on whether the interaction inside an atomic layer or between the layers is larger, a transition from the sliding to the pinned regime at a critical depth of the corrugation potential U0,c is expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interaction dynamics between the two atomic layers is thus governed by two competing energies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In harmonic approximation, they can be expressed in terms of frequencies pinning= and natural=, defining the corrugation parameter =.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To estimate the ratio of the competing energy scales, we have numerically calculated  and  for the central ions in the zigzag configuration, see Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While  depends on both interatomic distances a and b, the natural frequency of an ion inside a layer can be expressed as , when considering only next-neighbour interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we vary the relative interatomic distances a and b, and with this the strength of the interaction potentials, we expect to observe a pinned to sliding transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally this can be achieved by varying the ratio =rad/ax of radial and axial trapping frequencies, that is, the aspect ratio of radial and axial confinement in the ion trap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  is used as the control parameter in our experiment to cross the transition at the critical point c. For the numerical calculations we also plot , which scales linearly with  close to the transition, see Supplementary Fig 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Symmetry breaking transition', 'A general signature of Aubry and Aubry-type transitions, in both infinite and finite systems, is the breaking of analyticity7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This refers to the description of the sliding system in terms of a hull function, which parameterizes all possible configurations of the ground state under the presence of a sliding force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This function becomes non-analytic when the Aubry transition is crossed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our system, as the two ion chains are brought closer together the corrugation depth increases and eventually reaches a critical point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above this point the corrugation prevents the ions from assuming all positions during sliding and their trajectories, and thus the hull function, become discontinuous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the point where PeierlsNabarro (PN) barriers are formed6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To study the analyticity breaking in our system, we first conduct numerical simulations of a 30-ion crystal under the presence of differential forces applied to upper and lower ion chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the classical FK model, the hull function zj(zj,0) is defined as the coordinate of a particle j under the influence of a static corrugation potential in relation to its unperturbed coordinate zj,0 without the underlying lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the self-organized system of two interacting atomic chains, the corrugation potential is given by the Coulomb potential of the 2nd row of ions and thus cannot be switched off.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To calculate the hull function in such a system, we first apply opposite forces ±F/2 to each row of the crystal to obtain zj.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then we apply the force F to both rows in the same direction, moving the lattice along with the ion to obtain zj,0, that is, the equilibrium position of the ions in the harmonic trapping potential without any influence of the underlying lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We implement this principle in our numerical simulations and show the result in Fig 2a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A more detailed evolution of the hull function can be found in the Supplementary Movie 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the same control parameter , where a primary gap opens up in the hull function at zj,0=0, we observe a structural symmetry break in the equilibrium positions of the crystal configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is visible in Fig 2b, which shows photos of experimental realizations of 30-ion crystals at different .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are compared to images obtained from numerical simulations at T=1 mK, shown in Fig 2c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both the experiment and the simulations no driving force is applied to the crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The motional excitation of the ions is due to the finite temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Symmetry breaking of the crystal and restoring force.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Numerically calculated hull functions in units of the lattice constant a for the two central ions, left (red points) and right (black points) to the crystal centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below c=6.41 the hull functions are continuous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the pinning transition is crossed they exhibit a central gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slightly below c secondary gaps are observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inhomogeneity of the crystal leads to a lower charge density, and thus lower natural, further away from the crystal centre.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the defect is not at the centre, the pinning transition occurs for  less_than c.

cusp where the system chooses a state of broken symmetry, a typical signature of a second-order phase transition, see dashed line in Fig 2d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When evaluating the experimental data, to reduce the accumulated error of fitted ion positions and to avoid errors due to aberrations of our imaging system at large distances from the optical axis, we measure and plot a reduced version  which

using the data from numerical simulations, we calculate the restoring force FR, which is needed to restore symmetry in our system, above the transition point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FR can be identified with the static friction force FS in an infinite and thus homogeneous chain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FS is needed to overcome the PN barriers and translate the localized defect by one lattice site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Fig 2e, FR is shown for a homogeneous and inhomogeneous crystal with defect, as well as an ideal zigzag.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The restoring forces are similar, indicating that our model system, consisting of finite and inhomogeneous Coulomb crystals, is a good approximation to large scale systems, with homogeneous particle spacing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparing the axial inter-ion distances near the defect, we find that distances between the innermost ions differ by less than 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For next-neighbour ions the difference increases to a few per cent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared to the force FS5 × 1020 N needed to move two perfectly matched chains (a zigzag configuration without defect) against each other, the static friction force is reduced by more than an order of magnitude slightly above the pinning transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The derivation of FS for the scenario of unperturbed crystals, analogous to the PrandtlTomlinson model, is detailed in the Supplementary Note 2.

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Its frequency being zero signifies it costs no energy to translate the layers relative to one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For finite systems, the frequency of the lowest vibrational mode approaches zero but remains finite both above and below the pinning transition and thus the system is only superlubric at the critical point12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an ideal zigzag however no such soft mode exists, as the system is commensurate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only when a structural defect is present in the lattice disturbing the regular ordering of particles a soft mode is present.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is localized at the position of the defect35 and kink dynamics governs the sliding of the two atomic layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We first calculate the dispersion relation of the vibrational modes

soft mode on the control parameter  and the corrugation parameter .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For  less_than 6.8 this mode is the lowest frequency mode in the crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its frequency reaches zero at the transition point, indicated by a vertical dashed line, and assumes finite values in the sliding regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the experiment we use differential laser light forces to resonantly excite the vibrational modes of the ion Coulomb crystal by sinusoidal intensity modulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An experimental photo in which the soft mode is excited is shown in Fig 3c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further details are found in the Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measurement results are depicted as red circles in Fig 3a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Below the sliding-to-pinning transition, our measurements agree with the calculated frequencies of the dispersion relation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Close to the transition the experimental measurements deviate from theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above the critical point no excitation of the soft mode was possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand this behaviour, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations of the unperturbed crystal, that is without laser excitation, at finite temperatures (for details see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the ion trajectories the vibrational spectrum of the crystal was extracted using a Fourier transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To benchmark our analysis, we first perform simulations at T=5 K and find the results to be in good agreement with our calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At an increased temperature of T=50 K the Fourier spectrum of the ion vibrations deviates from the dispersion relation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For T=1 mK and  greater than c we observe a broad range of frequencies in the Fourier transform with no clear resonance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For  less_than c the soft mode frequencies extracted from these simulations agree with the experimentally observed resonances.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We attribute the deviation of the observed frequencies near the transition point to the increasing contribution of the nonlinearities of the PN potential, which is shown in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Above the symmetry breaking transition the thermal amplitude of the kink motion overcomes the barriers between potential minima, and no single distinct mode frequency exists.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For consistency, we compare the experimentally observed thermal amplitudes of the central ions to numerical simulations similar to Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this we obtain an estimate for the temperature of the crystal, which is found to be T=0.5±0.4 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The finite size of ion Coulomb crystals in a harmonic trap and thus the inhomogeneous charge density results in a global curvature of the PN potential, as can be seen in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in stark contrast to the vanishing PN potential for infinite systems below criticality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only is the crystal finite, but we expect the sliding dynamics to be governed by the local distortion of the structural defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To discern whether critical scaling exists in this system, we numerically calculate the soft mode

'In this work, we use an ion Coulomb crystal with a structural defect to experimentally and numerically study static friction in a self-organized system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the scenario emulated by our model system two deformable chains slide on top of each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such situations frequently arise in nature, in particular in biomolecules30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We experimentally observe the symmetry breaking at the sliding-to-pinning transition and we spectroscopically resolve the frequency of the localized vibrational mode, which is responsible for charge transport in our system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strength of trapped and laser-cooled ions is that they are a readily accessible model system, in which many-body physics can be observed with single atom resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With high quality imaging optics, a spatial resolution of a few nm can be achieved36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single atom resolution also allows studies of kinetic friction20,37 and the spectroscopic access to internal degrees of freedom enables investigations of non-equilibrium dynamics and transport processes with ns and s time resolution38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typically, trapped ions are confined in harmonic potentials which lead to an inhomogeneous ion spacing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that the inhomogeneity due to the boundary conditions and the system size influence our model system only slightly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is due to the fact, that we focus on the phenomena of the onset of sliding, which is dictated by the localized lattice defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the controllability of Coulomb crystals it is possible to extend our model to versatile geometries, e.g., equally spaced crystals in anharmonic potentials or ring traps39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the ideas presented in this work may be used to investigate the currently poorly understood Aubry transition in two-dimensional systems40, since ion traps can trap large three-dimensional Coulomb crystals composed of regular two-dimensional layers41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, by investigating the soft mode of the sticking to sliding transition, we demonstrate the spectroscopic observation of the highly nonlinear vibrational mode of the structural defect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These localized modes have also been proposed for the implementation of quantum information protocols35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, the high energy gap mode and its coupling to the low frequency mode of the localized defect were observed (T. Schaetz, personal communication).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the future, the experiments can be improved by further cooling to the K regime using narrow transitions32 or dark resonances42,43, making quantum effects of friction accessible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can provide a new platform for studying the physics of Wigner crystals18,44.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Coulomb crystals and structural defect creation', 'Coulomb crystals form, when ions are cooled to kinetic energies lower than the potential energy of the Coulomb system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is achieved by laser cooling the 172Yb+ ions on the broad, dipole allowed atomic transition 2S1/2 to 2P1/2 at 370 nm with a natural linewidth of =20 MHz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of the cooling laser is detuned from resonance by =/2 resulting in a crystal temperature close to the Doppler cooling limit of T=0.5 mK.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cooling laser illuminates the ions with a power between 200 and 300 W.
