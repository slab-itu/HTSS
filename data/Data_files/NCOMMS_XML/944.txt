HMGA1 amplifies Wnt signalling and expands the intestinal stem cell compartment and Paneth cell niche  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'High-mobility group A1 (Hmga1) chromatin remodelling proteins are enriched in intestinal stem cells (ISCs), although their function in this setting was unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior studies showed that Hmga1 drives hyperproliferation, aberrant crypt formation and polyposis in transgenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we demonstrate that Hmga1 amplifies Wnt/-catenin signalling to enhance self-renewal and expand the ISC compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hmga1 upregulates genes encoding both Wnt agonist receptors and downstream Wnt effectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hmga1 also helps to build an ISC niche by expanding the Paneth cell compartment and directly inducing Sox9, which is required for Paneth cell differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human intestine, HMGA1 and SOX9 are positively correlated, and both become upregulated in colorectal cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results define a unique role for Hmga1 in intestinal homeostasis by maintaining the stem cell pool and fostering terminal differentiation to establish an epithelial stem cell niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work also suggests that deregulated Hmga1 perturbs this equilibrium during intestinal carcinogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) provide a paradigm for studying adult stem cell function due to their exceptional self-renewal potential and repetitive structural organization1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the intestinal lining is among the most highly regenerative tissues, renewing itself every 35 days to protect the gut from pathogens and maintain nutrient intake essential for life.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the past decade, a population of self-renewing, columnar epithelial cells located at the base of the intestinal crypts has been identified and characterized as ISCs1,2,3,4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are marked by the serpentine receptor, leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), which mediates Wnt signalling cues from the niche5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lineage tracing experiments demonstrate that these ISCs are responsible for the exuberant regeneration and tissue homeostasis in intestinal epithelium1,4,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite extensive study, the molecular mechanisms that govern their behaviour are only beginning to be elucidated1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work also demonstrates that aberrant expression or mutation of key regulators of ISCs leads to neoplastic growth and intestinal carcinogenesis10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Emerging evidence highlights the central role for chromatin structure and chromatin-binding proteins in maintaining stem cell properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, recent work found that the high-mobility group A1 chromatin remodelling proteins (HMGA1, formerly HMG-I/Y) regulate stem cell properties in cancer12,13,14,15,16,17,18, although their role in normal development has remained elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HMGA1 gene encodes the HMGA1a and HMGA1b isoforms19,20,21, which function as architectural transcription factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HMGA1 proteins bind to specific DNA sequences13,22,23,24, modulate chromatin structure23 and recruit other transcriptional complexes to regulatory regions throughout the genome13,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HMGA1 is highly expressed during embryogenesis, with high levels in normal embryonic stem cells13,16,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postnatally, HMGA1 is expressed in adult stem cells, such as hematopoietic27,28 and intestinal stem cells29, but absent or barely detectable in mature, differentiated tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cancer, HMGA1 becomes aberrantly expressed through oncogenic transcription factors and epigenetic alterations, or in rare cases, chromosomal translocation events13,17,30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, HMGA1 is overexpressed in most high-grade or poorly differentiated cancers studied to date, and high levels portend a poor prognosis in diverse tumours12,13,14,15,16,17,18,26,31,32,33,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In murine tumour xenografts, HMGA1 drives tumour progression and cancer stem cell properties, at least in part, by inducing stem cell transcriptional networks12,13,14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In human embryonic stem cells, HMGA1 maintains a de-differentiated state by upregulating genes involved in stemness and pluripotency16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, HMGA1 is required for reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells by the Yamanaka factors; disrupting HMGA1 expression or function prevents the derivation of fully reprogrammed cells16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given its dual role in normal development and cancer, further studies to dissect HMGA1 function in each setting are needed to determine the therapeutic potential of targeting HMGA1 in cancer or harnessing its function for tissue regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We previously demonstrated that transgenic mice overexpressing murine Hmga1 from the H-2Kb promoter and immunoglobulin  enhancer all succumb to lymphoid tumours35; females also develop uterine sarcomas36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this model, the transgene is expressed in the intestines14 in addition to lymphoid cells35 and uterine tissue36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hmga1 transgenics develop marked proliferative changes in the epithelium of the small and large intestine, with aberrant crypt formation and polyposis14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine how Hmga1 disrupts tissue homeostasis in the intestines of transgenic mice and intestinal cancers overexpressing HMGA1, we examined its expression and function in our transgenic model and in intestinal organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discover that Hmga1 expands the ISC pool and Paneth cell niche in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hmga1 is a key factor involved in the organization of ISCs into three-dimensional (3D) organoids in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that Hmga1 enhances ISC expansion and self-renewal by amplifying Wnt/-catenin signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hmga1 also directly upregulates Sox9 and expands the Paneth cell niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is an example of Hmga1 fostering terminal differentiation to establish a stem cell niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, both HMGA1 and SOX9 are positively correlated in human intestinal epithelium, and both become markedly upregulated in colorectal cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results reveal a unique role for Hmga1 in maintaining both the ISC pool and niche cells within intestinal crypts and suggest that this equilibrium is perturbed when Hmga1 becomes deregulated during carcinogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hmga1 drives expansion of the ISC compartment', 'A prior gene expression profile study showed that Hmga1 is among the genes enriched in Lgr5+ ISCs (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HMGA1 is also among the genes most highly expressed in diverse epithelial human cancers as compared to normal epithelium, including intestinal malignancies12,13,14,17,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore sought to elucidate the functional role of Hmga1 in ISCs, both in normal intestinal epithelial homeostasis and in intestinal neoplasia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we crossed our Hmga1 transgenic mice onto Lgr5-EGFP mice6, which mark Lgr5+ ISCs with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Hmga1 transgene is driven by the H-2Kb promoter and  enhancer, which confer transgene expression in intestinal crypt basilar cells37, lymphoid cells35 and uterine tissue36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both Hmga1 transgenic and wild-type (WT) mice, Hmga1 protein localizes to the nuclei of Lgr5+ ISCs (Fig 1ad).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Lgr5+ ISCs extend further up the crypts in the Hmga1 transgenic mice compared to WT mice in all regions of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum;

Mann-Whitney test) and relative frequency of Lgr5+ISCs per crypt cell isolates by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were significantly (P less_than 0.05; two-tailed Students t-test) increased in the Hmga1 transgenic small intestine (Fig 1g,h), further validating the expansion in ISCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether Hmga1 gene expression accounts for the elevated protein levels in the Lgr5+ ISCs, we assessed Hmga1 mRNA in WT mice and found that it is increased by 4-fold in Lgr5+ ISCs isolated by FACS compared to Lgr5 cells (Fig 1g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also assessed Hmga1 mRNA in crypt cells from the transgenic model and found that Hmga1 expression is increased about twofold in both Lgr5+ ISCs and Lgr5 cells compared to the same cell populations in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both WT and transgenic models, Hmga1 mRNA is enriched in the Lgr5+ ISC population (Fig 1g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Hmga1 localizes to ISCs and its overexpression expands the ISC compartment in transgenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) ISCs from WT/Lgr5-EGFP+ mice stain green (upper panel) in small intestinal cross-sections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hmga1 stains red and localizes to GFP+ ISCs (lower panel).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Intranuclear Hmga1 stains brown (immunohistochemistry (IHC)) in small intestinal cross-sections from WT/Lgr5-EGFP+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) ISCs stain green in Hmga1/Lgr5-EGFP+ transgenic mice and extend further up the base of the crypt in Hmga1 transgenic mice compared to WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (Cells with red nuclear staining outside of crypts are Hmga1 transgenic lymphocytes) (d) Intranuclear Hmga1 stains brown (IHC) in small intestinal cross-sections from Hmga1/Lgr5-EGFP+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Fluorescent staining identifies GFP+ ISCs at each region in the small intestine of WT and Hmga1 mice (duodenum, jejunum, ileum).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) The percentage (mean±s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of GFP+ ISCs per crypt in WT and Hmga1 transgenic mice are shown;

differentiated epithelial cells extend towards the luminal centres of the organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We derived organoids from small intestinal epithelial crypt cells isolated from transgenic or WT mice and compared bud formation and projected surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior to culture, an equal number of crypts from WT or Hmga1 transgenic mice of similar sizes were isolated by passage through a 70 M filter41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to the histologic results in the transgenic mouse intestine, we found a marked increase in projected surface area per organoid (Image-Pro Plus Version 6) and bud number per organoid in those derived from the Hmga1 transgenic mice as compared to WT controls (Fig 2ac; Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There were more Hmga1 organoids with  greater than 3 buds as compared to WT organoids by day 6 in culture (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of WT organoids had 1 buds per organoid, while the majority of Hmga1 organoids had 2 buds at day 6 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we isolated small crypts by passage through a 40 M filter40,41 and performed time-lapsed confocal microscopy42,43,44,45 to ascertain the rate of self-renewal in Lgr5+ ISCs and bud development from day 0 to day 6 in 3D organoid culture (Fig 2df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A representative image of crypt cells from days 0 and 6 from WT mice or Hmga1 transgenics, respectively, are shown (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discovered a marked increase in the rate of self-renewal at day 6 in the Lgr5+ ISCs from the Hmga1 transgenics compared to the WT mice based on the projected surface area of Lgr5+ cells (Manager software; Stanford Photonics; Fig 2e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to our prior results using standard microscopy, we also found more buds and greater projected surface area of Lgr5+ cells in the Hmga1 organoids versus the WT organoids by confocal microscopy (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Hmga1 enhances ISC function in gut organoid cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Typical 3D organoids cultured from crypts are shown from WT or Hmga1 transgenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Bud numbers were ascertained in 3D organoids from isolated crypts (n greater than 100 organoids per mouse;

Supplementary Fig 4), in contrast to WT organoids, which only stain for Lgr5-GFP+ at the tips of the buds (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these studies demonstrate that Hmga1 maintains undifferentiated Lgr5+ ISCs and enhances self-renewal in this model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we sought to determine whether Hmga1 is required for self-renewal and ISC function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we silenced Hmga1 in WT crypt cells using lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Hmga1 (shHmga1) and compared this to WT crypt cells transduced with a control lentiviral vector in organoid cultures (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crypt cells were incubated with Wnt3a to enhance transduction efficiency as previously reported2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hmga1 expression was repressed in the organoids transduced to express the shHmga1 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, the crypt cells with Hmga1 silencing formed very few organoids with smaller projected surface areas and decreased bud number, while those transduced with control vector organized into typical 3D structures and generated new buds (Fig 3ac; Supplementary Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To rule out any potential nonspecific toxicity from the shHmga1 vector, we also tested an inducible, shRNA lentiviral vector targeting Hmga1 (inducible-shHmga1), which is linked to a gene encoding red fluorescent protein (RFP); both RFP and shHmga1 are induced by doxycycline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crypt cells transduced with the lentivirus, but not induced to express the shHmga1 vector, organized into 3D organoids with buds similar to what we observed in WT crypt cultures (Fig 3d; top panels).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the uninduced organoids (cultured without doxycycline) do not express RFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, those organoids in which the shHmga1 vector was induced by doxycycline express RFP and exhibit an impaired capability to proliferate and generate 3D organoids; the projected organoid surface area was decreased compared to uninduced controls (Fig 3d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bud formation was also disrupted (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hmga1 gene silencing in organoids transduced with the inducible shHmga1 was confirmed by quantitative, reverse transcription PCR (qPCR; Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further validate these findings, we transduced organoids derived from the Hmga1 mice with the shHmga1 vector and found that silencing Hmga1 also disrupted their ability to form organoids and generate buds (Supplementary Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies indicate that Hmga1 is a key factor involved in self-renewal, bud formation and organization into 3D organoid structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Hmga1 deficiency disrupts ISC function in 3D organoids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Representative images of organoid formation after silencing Hmga1 by delivery of lentiviral vector expressing shRNA targeting Hmga1 (knockdown or KD) or control lentivirus (Cont) are shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars, 50 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'HMGA1 expression has been identified among genes most enriched in embryonic and adult stem cells, although its function in these settings had been poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our studies reveal a role for Hmga1 in both stem cell self-renewal and establishment of a stem cell niche within small intestinal crypts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The HMGA gene family includes HMGA1 (on chromosome 6p21) and HMGA2 (on chromosome 12q15), both of which are highly expressed during embryonic development, but with low or undetectable levels in differentiated tissues13,16,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aberrant expression of HMGA1 occurs in most poorly differentiated human cancers, including gastrointestinal cancers such as colon, gastric, pancreatic and esophageal cancers, and high levels correlate with poor outcomes in diverse tumours13,30,31,32,33,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, a prior study in colorectal cancer identified HMGA1 among the genes most enriched in cancer relative to adjacent, non-malignant tissue33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HMGA1 is also required for properties attributed to cancer stem cells, including tumour initiator cells, growth as 3D spheres and metastatic progression14,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, HMGA2 overexpression occurs primarily in benign tumours of mesenchymal origin31, as well as a subset of malignant tumours52,53,54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dual role for Hmga1 in normal development and poorly differentiated cancers suggests that it regulates cell fate decisions, although a detailed understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in these processes was previously unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that Hmga1 amplifies Wnt signalling to drive self-renewal and ISC expansion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hmga1 not only upregulates Wnt agonist receptor genes, but also enhances expression of genes downstream of WntTcf4/-catenin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results, together with the prior finding that Tcf4 binds to the HMGA1 promoter in colorectal cancer cells56, suggest that Hmga1 is involved in a feed-forward loop, whereby Tcf4/-catenin induces Hmga1, leading to enhanced Wnt signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expansion of ISCs in our transgenic mouse model was recapitulated in vitro in organoid cultures, which depend on Hmga1 for organization into 3D structures and bud formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our transgenic mouse and organoid models provide valuable tools to further dissect downstream pathways regulated by Hmga1 in ISCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a murine model of gastric cancer, Wnt signalling also upregulates Hmga1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  57).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We are the first to show that Hmga1 enhances Wnt/-catenin signalling at multiple levels in the pathway, consistent with a feed-forward amplification loop, whereby Wnt induces Hmga1, which in turn, upregulates Wnt/-catenin signalling (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our work also uncovered a role for Hmga1 in Paneth cell differentiation, mediated in part, through Sox9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paneth cells constitute an epithelial niche, providing Wnt3a and other signals to maintain ISCs and permit self-renewal within the crypts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cues from the epithelial and stromal niche are likely to help govern whether Hmga1 induces Sox9 to drive Paneth cell differentiation or other Wnt signals to drive self-renewal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because adult stem cells can divide asymmetrically, Hmga1 could promote ISC division to generate both an identical daughter cell and a differentiated Paneth cell, or even a more fully differentiated transit-amplifying cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies indicate that R-spondin 1, another Wnt receptor agonist secreted by intestinal stromal cells, is required for ISC maintenance in mice39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be seen whether Hmga1 also regulates R-spondin 1 in stromal niche cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, mesenchymal stem cells within the bone marrow niche also express high levels of HMGA1, although the functional significance of HMGA1 in this setting is not yet known58.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior studies indicate that quiescent, label-retaining cells that are responsible for intestinal epithelial regeneration following injury also differentiate into secretory progenitors and Paneth cells59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hmga1 may also function in this setting, although lineage-tracing experiments will be needed to test this.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to establishing a role for Hmga1 in maintaining ISC and niche compartments, we also found a positive correlation between HMGA1 and SOX9 in normal human large intestinal epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, both genes are upregulated in colorectal cancer, indicating that this pathway may contribute to human intestinal carcinogenesis14,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (Apc)+/ murine model of intestinal carcinogenesis showed that Hmga1 is downstream of the miR-26 tumour suppressor60, suggesting that APC mutations in colorectal cancer lead to HMGA1 induction through loss of miR-26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HMGA1 is also upregulated in the setting of inflammation13, and intestinal carcinogenesis is frequently preceded by chronic inflammation and injury61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both inflammatory lesions and genetic alterations (APC inactivating mutations) could cooperate to induce HMGA1 during carcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Paneth cell expansion also occurs in mice with deletion in the Apc tumour suppressor62, and Hmga1 could contribute to this phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although there are no discrete populations of Paneth cells outside of the proximal colon in humans, lysozyme-expressing Paneth-like cells are found in human adenomas62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on our findings, it is plausible that HMGA1 induces formation of Paneth-like niche cells during colon carcinogenesis in the intestinal epithelium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in murine pancreatic cancer show that SOX9 reprograms acinar cells to ductal cells during carcinogenesis63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, HMGA1 could induce SOX9 and enforce Wnt signalling to drive stem cell properties and reprogram intestinal epithelial cells during carcinogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although HMGA1 and SOX9 are positively correlated in normal colonic epithelium and both become upregulated in cancer, it is not surprising that the correlation is lost in colorectal cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the large body of evidence demonstrating that colon cancer is initiated by the progressive acquisition of mutations in the APC pathway, which include genes upstream of SOX9 and the SOX9 gene itself10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there are multiple distinct mechanisms that could give rise to overexpression of HMGA1 and SOX9 in colorectal cancer, and SOX9 may depend, at least in part, on genetic lesions distinct from HMGA1 overexpression in this setting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our work not only reveals a novel function for Hmga1 in intestinal homeostasis through self-renewal of ISCs and Paneth cell differentiation, but also sheds light on possible mechanisms involved in Hmga1-mediated neoplastic transformation and intestinal carcinogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
