VEGFR2 pY949 signalling regulates adherens junction integrity and metastatic spread  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The specific role of VEGFA-induced permeability and vascular leakage in physiology and pathology has remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that VEGFA-induced vascular leakage depends on signalling initiated via the VEGFR2 phosphosite Y949, regulating dynamic c-Src and VE-cadherin phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Abolished Y949 signalling in the mouse mutant Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F leads to VEGFA-resistant endothelial adherens junctions and a block in molecular extravasation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vessels in Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mice remain sensitive to inflammatory cytokines, and vascular morphology, blood pressure and flow parameters are normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour-bearing Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mice display reduced vascular leakage and oedema, improved response to chemotherapy and, importantly, reduced metastatic spread.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inflammatory infiltration in the tumour micro-environment is unaffected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blocking VEGFA-induced disassembly of endothelial junctions, thereby suppressing tumour oedema and metastatic spread, may be preferable to full vascular suppression in the treatment of certain cancer forms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cancer is characterized by a dysfunctional and morphologically abnormal vasculature with elevated permeability and sparse pericyte and basement membrane coating, resulting in unstable vessels and poor blood flow1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dismal condition of the tumour vasculature is attributed to the hypoxic tumour micro-environment and the accompanying inflammation resulting in the production of a broad range of growth modulatory factors including vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), in particular VEGFA (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGFA causes increased vascular leakage by disruption of adherens junctions created through homophilic interactions between vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin molecules expressed on adjacent endothelial cells3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vessel normalization by titrating an appropriate level of anti-VEGFA therapy improves the efficacy of irradiation and chemotherapy4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, sustained anti-VEGFA therapy deteriorates vessel function and may cause increased hypoxia, increased local tumour cell invasion and increased metastatic propensity (for a review, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The role of VEGFA-induced permeability compared with VEGFA-regulated migration, survival and proliferation of endothelial cells is unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the signal transduction pathways induced by VEGFA to promote increased vascular permeability have remained unidentified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'VEGFA exerts its effects via two endothelial cell receptor tyrosine kinases denoted VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGFR1 binds and neutralizes VEGFA, thereby exerting a negative regulatory effect on endothelial cells, while VEGFR2 is essential in all known VEGFA biology6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGFR2 becomes activated and phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to VEGFA: Y949, Y1052, Y1057, Y1173 and Y1212 (mouse sequence numbers)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Y949 phosphosite in VEGFR2 (Y951 in human VEGFR2) presents a specific binding site for the T cell-specific adaptor (TSAd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSAd is implicated in VEGFA-induced permeability, by regulating VEGFR2-dependent c-Src signalling at endothelial cell junctions8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Y1052/1057 residues, located on the tyrosine kinase activation loop, are required for full kinase activity (see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6 and references therein).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The phosphorylated Y1173 binds phospholipase C, of importance for endothelial ERK1/2 pathway activation9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A phenylalanine knock-in mouse Vegfr2Y1173F/Y1173F is embryonically lethal due to arrested endothelial cell development10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Vegfr2Y1212F/Y1212F mouse lacks a developmental phenotype on a mixed background10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The aim of the current study was to examine the consequence of specific suppression of VEGFA-induced permeability on cancer progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGFA-induced molecular extravasation was attenuated in the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mouse due to perturbed signalling through the TSAd/c-Src/VE-cadherin pathway resulting in VEGFA-resistant adherens junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Y949F mutation however did not perturb other aspects of VEGFA-regulated vessel biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The loss of VEGFA-regulated leakage was compatible with vascular development and a morphologically normal vasculature including the presence of fenestrated endothelium in adult organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blood flow and blood pressure changes in response to VEGFA were unaffected by the mutation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cancer, the loss of VEGFA-regulated leakage was manifested as reduced tumour oedema, improved responsiveness to chemotherapy and suppressed metastatic spread due to an arrest in tumour cell intravasation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we show that a specific arrest in VEGFA-induced vascular permeability leading to attenuation of molecular extravasation in organs such as the trachea and skin is compatible with normal vascular development, morphology and function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mouse displayed reduced vascular leakage in several orthotopic tumour models and a significant reduction in metastatic spread of insulinoma and melanoma (see Fig 7 for a schematic summary of the results).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhanced vascular barrier in the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mouse led to reduced tumour oedema, allowing for increased chemotherapeutic efficacy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While our data strongly indicate that signalling via pY949-VEGFR2 regulates c-Src activation and VE-cadherin phosphorylation and therefore adherens junction integrity, we do not rule out the involvement of transendothelial pores/vesiculovacuolar organelles in VEGFA-induced vascular permeability29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Induced vascular permeability, also denoted vascular hyperpermeability or vascular leakage, may be acute or chronic30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The best studied factors regulating vascular leakage include VEGFA and inflammatory cytokines such as histamine and bradykinin31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An implication from the current study is that VEGFA dominates over inflammatory cytokines in regulating molecular extravasation, in the models studied here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGFA was originally identified as a vascular permeability factor30, but the physiological role of vascular permeability regulated by VEGFA/VPF has remained unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dvorak and colleagues implicated vascular permeability in the formation of a provisional matrix for the growth of new vessels32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data do not support an essential role for the VEGFA-driven pathway regulated by VEGFR2 pY949 signalling, in angiogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cheresh and coworkers have shown the critical role for c-Src-pathways in regulation of VEGFA-induced vascular permeability25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work extends these data by implicating pY949-VEGFR2/TSAd in regulation of c-Src pY418, VE-cadherin pY658 and the stability of adherens junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VE-cadherin is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in postcapillary venules compared with arteries/arterioles and regulated through flow-induced activation of c-Src, as judged from immunofluorescent staining of different capillary beds27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we noted a marked reduction in VE-cadherin Y658 phosphorylation in the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F lung lysates compared with WT, in agreement with the altered c-Src phosphorylation profile (Fig 6a,b) and with the persistence of adherens junctions in response to VEGFA, in vivo and in vitro (Fig 1gj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the complex biology of c-Src precludes a direct causeeffect relationship between c-Src pY418 phosphorylation and VE-cadherin/adherens junction stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that pY418 Src accumulates with relatively slow kinetics in vivo and that it translocates to junctions in complex with the adaptor molecule TSAd8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that the dynamics of c-Src activation differs between different subcellular compartments such as junctions and focal adhesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at focal adhesions, c-Src activity is induced as a consequence of cell adhesion-dependent focal adhesion kinase activation, which also affects vascular permeability most likely by orchestrating cell shape33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with the data presented here, focal adhesion kinase (Ptk2) gene knockout decreases tumour spread34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to technical constraints imposed by the quality of commercial c-Src antibodies, we have not been able to distinguish different subcellular pY418 Src pools in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, accumulation of pY418 Src in relation to the total c-Src pool was decreased both in Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F lung endothelial cells and in B16F10 tumours growing in mutant mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'VEGFA-induced accumulation of pT308 Akt was similar in the WT and mutant Y949F VEGFR2 conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akt plays an important role in vascular permeability induced by inflammatory cytokines26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Akt is critical for the activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in vivo, by phosphorylation on Ser1176 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  35), resulting in increased NO production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO, a potent regulator of the vascular tone, mediates vasodilation by stimulating soluble guanylyl cyclase and increasing cyclic GMP in smooth muscle cells36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we recorded transiently reduced blood pressure indicative of vasodilation in response to VEGFA in the descending aorta (Fig 2j) in both WT and Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result together with the full activation of Akt, judged from the pattern of pT308 Akt accumulation in the mutant, indicate that the NO pathway is intact in the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mouse.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  eNOS has previously been implicated in tumour vascular permeability, and inhibition of eNOS activity by a small caveolin-derived peptide (cavtratin) leads to suppressed tumour vascular permeability and reduced primary tumour growth without affecting blood flow and angiogenesis37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, while metastatic spread was suppressed in the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mouse, primary tumour growth was only modestly affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We noted reduced phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at phosphosite Y1173 in the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F lungs and in D12 B16F10 melanoma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of the human tyrosine residue, Y951 (corresponding to mouse Y949), in a purified recombinant intracellular VEGFR2 domain interferes with protein folding38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether protein folding is affected also in the full-length VEGFR2 remains to be shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We noted that the level of phosphorylation of the full-length mouse VEGFR2-Y949F mutant relative to WT VEGFR2 varied during tumour progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in B16F10 tumours, the relative level of pY1173 in WT VEGFR2 was higher than for VEGFR2-Y949F at an early stage, whereas the levels were similar at later stages of tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose that the reduced VEGFR2 phosphorylation in the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F lungs in D12 B16F10 tumours at least in part was a consequence of sustained VEGFR2/VEPTP complex formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEPTP is a receptor-type phosphotyrosine phosphatase specifically expressed in endothelial cells and known to have VE-cadherin and Tie2 as direct substrates39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGFR2 is an indirect substrate for VEPTP, resulting in dephosphorylation of VEGFR2 in complex with Tie2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we confirm and extend the data on the important role of VEPTP as an in vivo regulator of VEGFR2 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGFR2/VEPTP complex formation correlated with VEGFR2 pY1173 levels and the extent of oedema.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, B16F10 melanomas in WT mice showed low VEGFR2/VEPTP complex formation, high p1173 VEGFR2 levels and prominent oedema.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, melanomas in the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mice displayed high VEGFR2/VEPTP complex formation, low p1173 pVEGFR2 levels and reduced oedema.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With time, VEPTP/VEGFR2 complex formation decreased in tumours from both WT and Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, the VEGFR2 and c-Src activities were suppressed in the late stage of tumour growth in WT mice, showing a restriction in VEGFA signalling independent of VEPTP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gradual progression towards lower VEGFR2 phosphotyrosine levels over time is in agreement with models for resistance towards anti-VEGFA neutralizing therapy in cancer40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The extent of tumour oedema correlates to the blood supply, the volume of blood entering the tumour and the lymphatic drainage41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumour blood supply decreases as the tumour mass increases42, most likely due to a progressive deterioration of the tumour vasculature with eventually fewer functional vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tumours in Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mice were less oedematous, which we attribute to the higher vessel integrity in the mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Excess and persistent extravasation increases the interstitial pressure and impairs delivery of therapeutics to the tumour tissue4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement, the B16F10 tumour-bearing Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F mice were more responsive to treatment with chemotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Complete sealing of junctions to VEGFA, as well as to inflammatory cytokines, as a result of expression of a VE-cadherin/-catenin fusion protein, leads to a partial reduction in inflammatory cell extravasation43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, restricting VEGFA-induced permeability alone as in the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F genotype, failed to suppress inflammatory cell infiltration in RIP1-TAg2 insulinomas (Supplementary Fig 3ce) and B16F10 melanomas (Supplementary Fig 3hj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we do not exclude that acute inflammation or other aspects of inflammation not studied here are affected by the VEGFR2 mutation, our data suggest that there is no direct relationship between the capacity to spread metastasis and primary tumour inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, lodging of circulating tumour cells was unaffected by the mutation (Supplementary Fig 4b) suggesting that the stable Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F junctions may restrict the ability of tumour cells to enter but not exit the circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The caveats of the experimental metastasis model44 (that is, injection of tumour cells in the tail vein followed by lodging of tumour cells in the lung) compared with spontaneous metastasis, limits conclusions however.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Possibly, factor(s) other than VEGFA may contribute to extravasation of B16F10 cells in the lung; indeed, the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F endothelium retains sensitivity to other permeability-inducing factors than VEGFA such as histamine.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is pertinent to ask whether the reduced metastatic spread in the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F tumours can be attributed directly to the VEGFA-resistant Y949F junctions, that is, do tumour cells intravasate into the circulation via junctions?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, were other parameters, established as a consequence of the nonleaky junctions and the reduced oedema, more important?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we did not record significant changes compatible with vascular normalization4, that is, in vascular density, pericyte coating, necrosis or inflammation in the B16F10 melanomas from WT and mutant mice, we propose that the Vegfr2Y949F/Y949F phenotype primarily depends on the VEGFA-resistant junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, our data suggest that specifically suppressing VEGFA-induced vascular permeability without attenuation of vital aspects of VEGFA biology, for example, endothelial survival and neoangiogenesis, may offer an attractive strategy in future drug development to reduce oedema, to improve therapeutic efficacy and to suppress metastatic spread in cancer.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
