Somatic mutations in clonally expanded cytotoxic T lymphocytes in patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Somatic mutations contribute to tumorigenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these mutations occur in all proliferating cells, their accumulation under non-malignant conditions, such as in autoimmune disorders, has not been investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis have expanded CD8+ T-cell clones; in 20% (5/25) of patients CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, harbour somatic mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In healthy controls (n=20), only one mutation is identified in the CD8+ T-cell pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations exist exclusively in the expanded CD8+ effector-memory subset, persist during follow-up, and are predicted to change protein functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the mutated genes (SLAMF6, IRF1) have previously been associated with autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA sequencing of mutation-harbouring cells shows signatures corresponding to cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data provide evidence of accumulation of somatic mutations in expanded CD8+ T cells, which may have pathogenic significance for RA and other autoimmune diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'T cells undergo clonal expansion after they recognize cognate antigens, which are presented by professional antigen-presenting cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the mutation rate in lymphoid precursors has been estimated to be 106 per cell division, errors in DNA replication are likely to accumulate during cell divisions1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Somatic mutations have a critical function in cancer pathogenesis, and mutations derived from haematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells have also been detected in peripheral-blood cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon is called clonal haematopoiesis3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of somatic mutations in mature, clonally expanded, non-malignant T-cell populations has not been fully investigated, nor have their effects on the disease process and clonal properties been determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic inflammatory disease of autoimmune origin8, characterized by chronic inflammation9, and T-cell-mediated autoantibody production occurring years before the clinical diagnosis10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RA often co-manifests in patients with large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia, a rare lymphoproliferative disorder in which we recently discovered that expanded CD8+ T-cell clones harbour somatic STAT3 mutations13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, LGL leukaemia patients with multiple STAT3 mutations have a higher incidence of RA (43%) than patients without STAT3 mutations (6%)14, thus raising the possibility that patients with STAT3-mutated LGL leukaemia and clonal-lymphocyte proliferation are at a greater risk of developing a non-malignant autoimmune disease and that CD8+ T-cell clones carrying somatic mutations may participate in the autoimmune process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, autoimmune diseases may facilitate the acquisition of somatic mutations in lymphocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we investigate whether T cells in people with a non-malignant autoimmune disorder without known lymphoproliferation harbour somatic mutations and analyse blood samples from individuals with newly diagnosed, untreated RA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a flow-cytometry-based T-cell clonality screen we identify potential clonal expansions in the CD8+ T cells and confirm the findings using deep T-cell receptor  chain (TCRB) sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We discover somatic mutations in purified CD8+ T cells with a custom deep-sequencing panel including 986 immune-related genes and with exome and deep amplicon sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results provide a link between cancerous processes and autoimmunity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'The clonality of CD8+ T cells increases with age', 'We collected blood samples from 82 untreated newly diagnosed ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria-fulfilling RA patients and 20 healthy controls after obtaining written informed consent (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  T-cell clonality was initially screened with a flow-cytometry-based assay using a panel of TCR V-specific antibodies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method allows for rapid and robust analysis of TCRB V-gene usage and facilitates flow-cytometry-based cell sorting of the populations of interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the clonality in more detail (a T-cell clone is defined by a unique TCR  complementarity-determining region 3 CDR3 sequence), the samples were subjected to a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based TCR  (TCRB CDR3) deep-sequencing

'This study presents the novel discovery of somatic mutations in both immune- and proliferation-associated genes in the CD8+ T cells of patients with newly diagnosed, untreated RA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several recent reports have shown that somatic mutations originating from haematopoietic precursor cells occur in blood cells of the healthy elderly (clonal haematopoiesis) and that the prevalence of clonal haematopoiesis increases with age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these mutations occur recurrently in myeloid malignancies, and their presence in healthy individuals increases the risk of haematological cancers3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, somatic clonal mosaicism in blood- and buccal cells has also been shown to associate with solid tumours24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To underscore the developmentally late emergence of the mutations in CD8+ effector T cells, we used CD4+ cells as the comparator in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method excluded mutations that had already arisen in precursor cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the emergence of somatic mutations in effector T cells in patients with a non-malignant autoimmune process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Somatic mutations were identified in genes that were expressed in CD8+ lymphocytes and that are known regulators of immunity (such as IRF1 and SLAMF6) and cell proliferation (PLRG1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, no mutations were detected in CD4+ cells, and only one somatic mutation was identified in 1 out of the 20 healthy controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In 16% of the cases, the mutations were either frameshift- or nonsense-mutations, and thus functional consequences were apparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the effects of the identified non-synonymous mutations on the structure and function of the affected proteins, we used two separate bioinformatics tools (Polyphen-2 and SIFT), and both indicated likely deleterious effects in 32% of the non-synonymous cases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-sequencing results demonstrated that many of the mutated genes were highly expressed in CD8+ cells, and thus mutations in these genes have the capacity to modulate cellular functionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the RNA sequencing data also revealed a survival/proliferation-associated signature in the flow-sorted cells in which the mutations were located.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data together suggested that the expanded fractions differ from the highly polyclonal background pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differences may be both related and unrelated to the identified somatic mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More research is warranted to understand in detail the biological consequences of the identified somatic mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous studies with smaller cohorts have reported clonal CD8+ T-cell expansions in RA patients blood samples25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to these studies, we studied the clonal architecture of CD8+ T cells by NGS TCRB sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TCRB sequencing identified large clonal expansions in both RA patients as well as in healthy controls, and no difference in clonality was found between the two groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result was not unexpected because large CD8+ T-cell clones are not uncommon in the elderly28,29, and the median ages of our patient and control groups were essentially identical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, our results showed that age was positively correlated with the clonality index (older individuals harboured more large clones than younger people), a result in line with findings from studies showing that age is associated with decreased TCR diversity30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CD8+ T cells display more clonal characteristics than CD4+ cells do (as shown by our flow cytometry data, and sequenced by Qi et al.30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vigorous proliferation involving repeated DNA-replication cycles predisposes the clone to an increased risk of mutagenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Larger cell clones also enable detection of mutations with larger VAFs, thus technically facilitating identification of somatic variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the similar CD8+ clonality in the RA patients and controls, somatic mutations were observed in 5 (out of 25) RA patients and only in 1 (out of 20) healthy control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the chronic inflammatory state in RA9 may facilitate the acquisition of somatic mutations, and thus, we hypothesize that somatic mutations may also occur in other inflammatory conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Possible TCR target antigens in RA have been studied intensively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas CD4+ cells have received much attention, CD8+ cells have mainly been studied as a potential link between autoimmunity and viral infections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus-specific (Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), CMV, influenza) CD8+ T-cell enrichment has been reported in RA patients synovial fluid31, and EBV has been reported as a possible target antigen for expanded T cells in RA patients32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Virus-specific clones may display cross-reactivity towards autoantigens33, thus enabling interaction with the autoimmune inflammation process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the antigen target of the expanded clones in our study is unknown the interpretation of the results is limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  None of the largest ( greater than 5%) CD8+ clones were among the previously published virus-specific TCRB sequences, but this approach does not rule out the possibility that the clones might be virus-specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Future studies are needed to assess whether common viral- or auto-antigens are targets of these clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, TCRs show remarkable binding plasticity and cross-reactivity between allo-antigens and auto-antigens34,35, thus enabling autoreactive properties independent of their primary antigen target.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We identified somatic mutations in memory-type36 CD8+ T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two patients, the mutations were discovered in clones without CD45RA expression (effector-memory cells), and in one patient the mutated clone was CD45RA-positive (terminally differentiated effector-memory phenotype cells).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both phenotypes represent cells that have encountered their antigen, proliferated, and participated in a cytotoxic response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the antigen encounter, the clones failed to shrink and persisted in these patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that this finding may be due, in part, to the somatic mutations that the cells have acquired during the proliferation process (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Hypothesis for the accumulation of somatic mutations.Mature T cells undergo thymic selection, and during the expansion phase after antigen stimulation, mutation(s) occur (1st mutation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the cell population continues to grow, additional mutations may arise in the same clone, thereby resulting in different VAFs in the same clonal population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our patient cohort, CD4+ cells presented a more equally distributed T-cell repertoire than did CD8+ T cells (analysed with flow cytometry), and we did not find any somatic variants in CD4+ cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  APC, antigen-presenting cell; DN, double negative; DP, double positive; SP, single positive; MHC, major histocompatibility complex.Full size image', 'Future studies are needed to elucidate whether the mutation-harbouring CD8+ T-cell clones truly participate in the pathogenesis of an autoimmune disease, or whether they are like scars in the genome after vigorous antigen-driven proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the role of CD8+ cells in RA remains less well-established than the role of CD4+ T cells, there is a growing body of evidence supporting the role of CD8+ T cells as regulators of autoimmune arthritis37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the genes found to be mutated in our patient material (such as SLAMF6 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  38), PADI4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  39) and IRF1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40)) have been shown to regulate autoimmunity and to be associated with the initiation and progression of RA (PADI4 and IRF1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study highlights novel putative mechanistic similarities between autoimmunity and cancer: somatic mutations in disease-associated cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The occurrence of mutations in terminally differentiated T cells may discriminate a benign disorder from a malignant transformation (such as leukaemia or lymphoma), because terminally differentiated effector-memory cells have limited proliferation potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data lay the groundwork for future studies seeking to understand the role of somatic mutations in autoimmune diseases and other non-malignant disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

libraries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  cDNA fragmentation and sequencing adaptor tagging war performed using Illumina Nextera XT kit (FC-131-1096).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence data correction, quality trimming and read length filtering were performed with Trimmomatics using the following settings: leading: 3, trailing: 3, sliding window: 4:15 and minlen: 36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The gap-aware STAR aligner was used to perform the spliced alignment of final clean paired-end reads against the human reference genome (Ensembl GRCh38) with the guidance of the EnsEMBL reference gene models (EnsEMBL v80).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The default alignment and indexing settings (2-pass per-sample) were used, except that the overhang on each side of the splice junctions was set to 99.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Picard tools were used to sort the reads and to mark the reads.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reads were then assigned to genomic features using SubRead.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Default parameters were used in the feature summations except that reads were allowed to be assigned to overlapping genome features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Quality control analysis was performed using the RNA-SeQC and FASTQC with default settings and using genome annotation information downloaded from EnsEMBL (v80).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The obtained BAM files were normalized and the data was explored and visualized using the Qlucore Omics Explorer
