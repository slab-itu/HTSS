Mechanisms of assembly and genome packaging in an RNA virus revealed by high-resolution cryo-EM  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cowpea mosaic virus is a plant-infecting member of the Picornavirales and is of major interest in the development of biotechnology applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the availability of 100 crystal structures of Picornavirales capsids, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of capsid assembly and genome encapsidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we have determined cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions for the wild-type virus and an empty virus-like particle, to 3.4 Å and 3.0 Å resolution, respectively, and built de novo atomic models of their capsids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These new structures reveal the C-terminal region of the small coat protein subunit, which is essential for virus assembly and which was missing from previously determined crystal structures, as well as residues that bind to the viral genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations allow us to develop a new model for genome encapsidation and capsid assembly.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A crucial step in virus assembly is the specific encapsidation of the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is a particular challenge for single-stranded RNA viruses, as they must preferentially select their genomes from a high background of cellular mRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to their importance as pathogens and their relatively simple, non-enveloped capsids, members of the order Picornavirales have been extensively studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These viruses include members infecting vertebrates (poliovirus, hepatitis A virus), insects (deformed wing virus) and plants (cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV)) and 100 X-ray structures of their capsids are available1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, while these reveal the structure of the coat proteins in exquisite detail, they give very few clues about how RNA is packaged or how specificity is achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite many years of study on the replication cycle of the Picornavirales, remarkably little is known about the process of RNA encapsidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it is not known which type of coat protein aggregate is required for efficient RNA incorporation or what controls the specificity of RNA packaging2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CPMV, the type member of the Comoviridae subfamily of the plant-infecting Secoviridae, has a bipartite, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two segments, RNA-1 (6 kb) and RNA-2 (3.5 kb) (Fig 1a), are separately encapsidated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its icosahedral particles have a maximum diameter of 30 nm and are comprised of 60 copies each of a Large (L) and Small (S) coat protein (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  L and S are processed from a single precursor polyprotein, the RNA-2-encoded VP60, by the action of the RNA-1-encoded 24K proteinase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particles containing the two different genomic RNAs can readily be purified (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crystallographic structures are available for three comoviruses3: CPMV4,5, bean pod mottle virus (BPMV)6 and red clover mottle virus7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, the L and S subunits comprise three -barrel domains (two from L, one from S; Fig 1d) corresponding to the three quasi-equivalent conformers of a T=3 icosahedral lattice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comovirus capsids thus adopt a pT=3 quasi symmetry (Fig 1e), forming a particle with pronounced turrets formed from the S subunit at the particle fivefold axes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a penton of L and S subunits appears to be the basic building block for all Picornavirales capsids2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the capsid structure is well-understood, the organization of encapsidated genomic RNA is not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In only one instance, the RNA-2-containing component of BPMV, can details of RNA structure be observed6, where density for 11 ordered ribonucleotides near the particle threefold axes was visualized6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This RNA forms a trefoil, and binds in a complementary depression on the inside of the capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to icosahedral averaging it was impossible to deduce the RNA sequence, but the base composition was not random, and it was suggested that these sequences might be critical determinants for assembly or stability of capsids8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: An introduction to CPMV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of the Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) bipartite, positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-1 is 6 kb in length and contains the non-structural genes, while RNA-2 is 3.5 kb in length and contains the sequence encoding the large coat protein (L subunit) and small coat protein (S subunit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypertranslatable constructs (HT) separately expressing the viral proteinase and the precursor of the L and S subunits are used for production of eVLPs using the pEAQ vector system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) The sequence of S subunit amino acids 180213.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal 24 amino acid segment of S subunit is cleaved following assembly, and is coloured magenta.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cleavage site between Leu189 and Leu190 is shown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region of the polypeptide is highly positively charged and the positive amino acids are indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Schematic of CPMV density purification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNA-1 containing CPMV sediments at the bottom of a Nycodenz gradient (CPMV-B), RNA-2-containing CPMV (CPMV-M) sediment in the middle and empty CPMV particles sediment at the top of the gradient (CPMV-T).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPMV-T particles are the natural equivalent to empty virus-like particles (eVLPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) X-ray crystal structure of the asymmetric unit of CPMV (PDB 1NY74), coloured as above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal amino acid of the S subunit (leucine 189) is indicated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Icosahedral organization of CPMV (using PDB 1NY74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each icosahedral particle is comprised of 60 copies of both the L subunit and the S subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A view down the twofold axis is shown.Full size image', 'The mechanisms by which RNA is selected and packaged are also poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The only portion of the CPMV capsid proteins currently implicated in RNA packaging is a segment of 24 amino acids at the C terminus of the S subunit9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This sequence is proteolytically cleaved during maturation without affecting particle stability or infectivity10, and is therefore missing from X-ray structures of CPMV4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The suggestion that this region may promote interaction with RNA was supported by the fact that the S subunit loses its suppressor of host RNA silencing activity when the C terminus is removed11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, from studies using a system that can produce RNA-free CPMV capsids in the absence of infection12 it is clear that this extension is also essential for capsid assembly itself13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of the entire 24-amino acid sequence almost completely abolished empty particle formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect could be partially reversed by substituting the 24 amino acids with 6 histidines, suggesting that basic amino acids in the C-terminal extension may play a role in capsid assembly13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In recent years, the Comoviridae, especially CPMV, have become a major focus of research in biotechnology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPMV infects legumes and Nicotiana benthamiana, and grows to extremely high titres (1 g kg1 of leaf tissue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like many plant viruses, it is also exceptionally stable in the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPMV capsids can now be both genetically and chemically manipulated, and insertion of foreign sequences into surface loops is routine13,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CPMV is therefore being developed for many biotechnology applications, including biosensors, targeted nano-containers for drug delivery, nanomaterials, imaging agents and as a platform for novel vaccine development16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, wild-type CPMV has evolved to package its genome, reducing the potential for loading with heterologous cargoes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome this problem, an empty virus-like particle (eVLP) technology has been developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of the precursor of L and S subunits (VP60) in plants using an Agrobacterium-based, pEAQ vector system28 (Fig 1a) produces large quantities of essentially insoluble protein12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particle formation only occurs on co-expression with the viral 24K proteinase, allowing normal proteolytic processing of VP60 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result is efficient release of mature coat protein subunits and large quantities of eVLPs, which can be loaded with metal and metal oxide provided the C-terminal residues of the S subunit are first proteolytically removed13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, modification of the eVLP surface and particle loading with metal ions (Co2+, Fe2+ and Fe3+) have been achieved simultaneously for the first time29, and this may herald attempts to develop targeted therapeutics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore insertion of integrin-binding sequences into the surface loops of an eVLP has allowed targeting of eVLPs to human endothelial cells (Meshcheriakova et al., unpublished).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, despite much research on CPMV, its true potential in biotechnology may not be realized until we achieve a full understanding of the mechanisms that underlie capsid assembly and encapsidation of genomic RNA (or other cargo).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is not yet, for example, possible to package heterologous RNA or DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To gain insights into CPMV biogenesis, we have determined high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures for the CPMV eVLP, in which the C-terminal extension to the S subunit is visible, to 3.0-Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also determined the structure for wild-type CPMV containing its larger genomic RNA at 3.4 Å resolution, where density for genomic RNA is resolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resolution of both maps is sufficient to allow de novo atomic models to be built.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the availability of a system for producing capsids in the absence of infection has enabled us to use mutagenesis to explore the role of those amino acids predicted by the models to be involved in particle formation, and to discriminate between these and residues involved in RNA packaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This combined analysis has enabled us to develop a new model for RNA recognition and capsid assembly.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cryo-EM structure determination', 'Although the C-terminal extension to the S subunit is implicated in capsid assembly and RNA packaging, understanding these roles has been difficult because the normal maturation of the RNA-filled capsid involves its cleavage and dissociation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result no structural information for these residues is currently available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this deficiency, we decided to examine the structure of the CPMV eVLP particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crucially, not only are such eVLPs completely lacking in any encapsidated RNA, they also undergo C-terminal cleavage more slowly than wild-type virions, raising the possibility that we could determine the structure of an eVLP that retains the C-terminal segment using cryo-EM and single particle image processing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore collected a cryo-EM data set for CPMV eVLP comprising 1,150 micrographs collected on an FEI Titan Krios microscope, using a direct electron detector (for details of data collection and image processing see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each micrograph was recorded as an exposure movie consisting of 35 frames, which were computationally corrected for microscope drift and beam-induced movement30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particles were selected semi-automatically31, and a data set of 62.5k particles was assembled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iterative rounds of two-dimensional (2D) and 3D classification were then used to select a homogeneous subset of 4,998 particles for 3D structure refinement (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting final density map was sharpened using an empirically derived B-factor of 74.6 Å2 to 3.04 Å resolution (Fig 2a; EMD-3014).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Cryo-EM structures of eVLP and CPMV-B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) EM

fraction; CPMV-B) were collected from the bottom of a Nycodenz gradient, dialysed to remove the Nycodenz, and used for cryo-EM data collection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A data set of 1,750 electron micrographs was collected on the same microscope and detector as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particles were selected automatically, generating a total data set of 72k particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A homogeneous subset (4,331) of these particles was selected and used to determine a 3D reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final structure for CPMV-B was sharpened using an empirically derived B-factor of 107.6 Å2 to a final resolution at 3.44 Å (Fig 2b; EMD-3013).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the initial starting model for the eVLP structure was a sphere with a radius of 155 Å.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CPMV-B structure used the eVLP model filtered to 60 Å resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No information from the existing X-ray structure whatsoever was therefore used to generate either of the structures presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Atomic model building', 'As shown in Fig 2, the resolution of both eVLP and CPMV-B maps is high enough to clearly resolve amino acid side chains in the density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore decided to build de novo atomic models into the EM density rather than rely on existing atomic models for the CPMV capsid proteins (PDB 1NY74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We started with the higher resolution eVLP map, and built the polypeptide chain of a single copy of both the L and S subunit using Coot32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This preliminary model was then iteratively refined and rebuilt using REFMAC533 and Coot32 to progressively improve model quality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting model contained information for the majority of the polypeptide sequence, critically including a 13-residue segment in the C-terminal region of S subunit that had never been previously visualized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The refined eVLP atomic model was then docked into the 3.4-Å CPMV-B map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Residues in the eVLP atomic model for which no density was observed for CPMV-B were deleted (residues 190202 in S subunit) and amino acids resolved in CPMV-B but not eVLP were added and modelled (residues 184189 in the S subunit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This preliminary (for the CPMV-B structure) model was then again iteratively refined in REFMAC5 to give the final model presented in Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The structure of the C-terminal extension to the S subunit', 'The existing structural information for the CPMV capsid3,4 show the C terminus of S subunit after cleavage (ending at residue 189) in an extended conformation running across the exterior surface of the capsid towards a cleft between the S subunits that form the turret at an icosahedral fivefold vertex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is precisely the conformation we see in our CPMV-B structure (see the yellow segment in Fig 3a), but in the eVLP map we see additional density in this cleft that does not match the previously deposited structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density that would correspond to residues 184189 in the C terminus is very weak suggesting this segment is poorly ordered in the particle in solution (see the yellow segment in Fig 3b), and we have not been able to build a convincing model into this region of the map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is clear that the polypeptide chain takes a steeper path along the edge of the cleft than it does once C-terminal cleavage (between residues 189 and 190) has occurred (comparison of yellow segments in Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal segment then becomes ordered once more, and we see density corresponding to Leu190 to Arg202, residues absent from previous structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A loop runs from the top of the S subunit back into the cleft between subunits, before forming two turns of -helix running out of the cleft towards the bulk solvent (see magenta segment Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bottom of this segment appears to be very well-ordered, with clear density for side chains that make intimate contacts to the neighbouring S subunit around the penton (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density then becomes disordered once more, with Arg202 as the last ordered residue, suggesting that the 11 C-terminal residues are disordered in solution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, this tallies with functional observations that while truncation of the C-terminal segment by up to 11 residues are tolerated, larger truncations (12 residues or more) dramatically reduce the yield of intact eVLPs (see Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: The structure of the C-terminal extension of the S subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) EM density map of the unsharpened CPMV-B map with colours as described previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In yellow is the C terminus of CPMV-B (amino acids 184189), which follows the same path as the current atomic model (PDB 1NY74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The final C-terminal amino acids (190213) are missing from both the crystal structure and the CPMV-B EM density map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) EM density map of the unsharpened eVLP map with colours as described previously.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density corresponding to amino acid 184189 is coloured yellow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this section of the EM density is too weak to allow a polypeptide backbone to be built, we can clearly see this portion of the C-terminal moves in the eVLP map compared with the CPMV-B map (see yellow segment in a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coloured magenta is the newly resolved 13-amino

pentameric ring that forms the fivefold vertex of the particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is clear from the structure that hydrophobicity plays a central role in this network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shown in Fig 4a

#@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the importance of these interactions, we made mutations in the S subunit sequence and analysed their effects on both eVLP assembly and RNA packaging by the virus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While F192W has little discernable effect on eVLP assembly, it dramatically reduces the efficiency of RNA packaging, resulting in large numbers of empty capsids and systemic movement of the virus in the plant does not occur (Supplementary Table 2 and 3; Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of the matching hydrophobic surface on the S subunit itself (for example, V109W) has even more profound effects, preventing assembly of particles (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the network of interactions is complex, as mutation of the other phenylalanine residue (for example, F194W) has little discernable effect other than a slightly reduced particle yield.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Interactions between the C-terminal extension and the neighbouring S subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a)

appear to play a key role.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal segment is highly basic, and side-chain density for two arginine residues is visible at the bottom of the cleft (R193 and R195; see Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R193 is particularly well-ordered and forms a salt-bridge to E147, again in the neighbouring S subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the importance of this interaction, we mutated these residues and assayed for eVLP assembly and viral encapsidation of RNA in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both R193D and E147R are completely unable to assemble, while the double mutant R193D/E147R, which preserves the salt-bridge but swaps its directionality, is almost indistinguishable from the wild type (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R195G is similar to wild-type in terms of assembly, suggesting that it is the R193-E147 salt-bridge that is crucial for assembly (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interactions between the protein capsid and genomic RNA', 'The way in which eVLPs are expressed means that no genomic RNA is present in the cell, so none can possibly be packaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the eVLP has previously been shown to be devoid of plant cell mRNA13, including the recombinant message for either the viral coat proteins or proteinase, which are the two mRNAs that should have the highest sequence similarity to the genome12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in the 3.0 Å structure of the eVLP there is no EM density that can be attributed to anything other than capsid proteins, which together with their very low A260/280 ratio and lack of ethidium bromide staining in agarose gels13 strongly suggest that the eVLP particles are devoid of RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By contrast, the wild-type CPMV-B particle has packaged the full-length, 6-kb single-stranded RNA-1, and as expected we see significant extra density inside the capsid that we ascribe to this packaged RNA genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the B-factor correction used to sharpen the map and reveal high-resolution features such as amino acid side chains acts as a strong high-pass Fourier filter, removing low-resolution features in the map such as poorly ordered molecular components like the genomic RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shown in Fig 6a is a 40-Å-thick central slab through the unsharpened CPMV-B map (at 3.63 Å resolution; the unsharpened map is also included in the deposition for

density is an icosahedrally averaged picture of an asymmetric RNA molecule, so precise structural interpretation is impossible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, several observations can be made.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the shells of density have a thickness of 20 Å, and are 2025 Å apart, consistent with the packing of duplex nucleic acids observed in other virus structures (for example, refs 34, 36), suggesting that extensive base pairing occurs during encapsidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general form of the packaged RNA is dodecahedral rather than icosahedral (each is a different realization of 532 symmetry), with the strongest RNA feature in the map forming a truncated dodecahedral cage beneath the capsid shell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is strongly reminiscent of RNA packaging in insect viruses of the Nodaviridae, where ordered genomic RNA is packaged as a dodecahedral cage in both X-ray and EM structures37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The strongest CPMV density is directly beneath the twofold symmetry axes of the capsid, which are formed by the interface between two adjacent pentons, implying that this is the site where RNA binding is strongest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The density fades out as the RNA extends away from the twofold axis towards the threefold junctions that form the vertices of the truncated dodecahedron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We see two major bridges of density between the capsid shell and the RNA density that are candidates for amino acid side chains, both from the L subunit, that directly interact with RNA (Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These are Arg17 and Trp190, with Trp190 being by far the strongest density feature connecting the capsid shell to the RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Density for RNA-1 in the CPMV-B structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A 40-Å thick

residues, we mutated each and examined the effect on eVLP assembly and RNA encapsidation in vivo (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arg17 does indeed appear to be important for RNA packaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The cryo-EM structures presented here provide new insights into the structure of viruses in the Comoviridae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They demonstrate the ability of cryo-EM structures to guide site-directed mutagenesis that can begin to pick apart the molecular mechanisms that govern capsid assembly and genome packaging, providing the basis for a new model of CPMV particle assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The C-terminal region of the S subunit, despite its importance for particle formation, is normally lost during virus maturation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The novel structure of this region presented here therefore reveals for the first time an extensive protein:protein interface that combines both hydrophobicity and electrostatic interactions that are important for capsid assembly and RNA encapsidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many questions remain, but the C-terminal extension occupies the cleft between the small coat protein subunits that form the pentameric capsomere from which the virus assembles (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we do not resolve the residues that connect the C-terminal structure to the body of the S subunit (residues 184189), we do see extensive interactions to the neighbouring subunit around the pentameric ring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The C-terminal extension may act therefore as a dab of molecular glue stabilizing the structure of the penton of L and S subunits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of genomic RNA, this stabilization appears to be sufficient to allow formation of the intact eVLP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eVLP does lose its C-terminal extension over time, implying that the stability gained from making the many protein:protein interactions formed during capsid assembly is sufficient to make the eVLP structure stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, the role of the C-terminal extension would in fact precisely fit the definition of a molecular chaperone or a scaffold protein, enhancing the efficiency of folding/assembly reactions without becoming a part of the final structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 8: A model for CPMV Assembly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The L (green) and S (blue) subunits associate to form a coat protein penton.The C-terminal extension (magenta circle) appears to act as a dab of molecular glue, stabilizing the formation of the penton due to extensive interactions with the neighbouring S subunit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of RNA (RNA free assembly shown in the top half of the diagram), C-terminal cleavage is slow, and eVLP particles are produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After time, the C-terminal extension is lost from the eVLP, suggesting that once an extensive protein:protein interaction network is formed in the capsid the eVLP structure is stable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the presence of genomic RNA (assembly with genome shown in the bottom half of the diagram), assembly follows a different path.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, pentons are formed in the same way as in the eVLP, using the C-terminal extension for stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two pentons interact to form a twofold axis, and thus the RNA-binding site appears to exist at that position.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model shows genomic RNA (represented as an orange rectangle) initially binds to the two pentons at this twofold axis, the first step in genome encapsidation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following stepwise addition of pentons, the C terminus is rapidly cleaved implying that RNA occupancy is allosterically communicated through the structure to the outside of the capsid.Full size image', 'In the presence of genomic RNA, however, assembly takes a very different path.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the C terminus stabilizes the CPMV penton, then the next step in building a capsid is the interaction between two pentons, which forms the first twofold axis of the growing particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is precisely the position at which our EM density suggests there is the strongest interaction with the genomic RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest therefore that the C-terminal extension promotes the formation of the RNA-binding site itself, the first step in encapsidating the genomic RNA (Fig 8; see asterisk).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to previous models of BPMV assembly where RNA binding is proposed to occur at particle threefold axes39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the rapid cleavage of the C terminus in such conditions suggests that RNA binding must be allosterically communicated through the structure to the binding site of the C terminus on the outside of the capsid.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the lack of obvious mixed electrophoretic forms that would reveal a mixture of cleaved/uncleaved subunits suggests that cleavage is strongly cooperative within a particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precise details of this communication remain unresolved, but the network of interactions is clearly complex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutation of residues on the inside of the capsid that directly interact with RNA prevent capsid assembly (for example, W190F in the large subunit).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, residues on the outside of the capsid that were predicted to disturb protein:protein interactions allow capsid assembly but prevent RNA encapsidation (for example, F192W).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further structural studies on these mutants will likely help to elucidate the fine detail of these interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'All members of the Comoviridae have a similar, cleavable C-terminal extension to their small coat protein subunit, although its length and sequence are highly variable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, in BPMV the sequence is strongly negatively charged in contrast to the positive charge found in CPMV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structures presented here help to explain this diversity, because sequence changes in the C-terminal extension could easily be compensated for by surface mutations on the small subunit itself, as we show in the viability of the R193D/E147R mutant, which makes CPMV more BPMV-like in this regard.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This idea is also consistent with observations that replacing the CPMV extension with the equivalent region from BPMV results in a virus with similar properties to one from which the C-terminal residues have been deleted11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although our studies provide an excellent view of capsidRNA interactions in assembled particles, they do not, as yet, provide insights into how the specificity of RNA packing is achieved; this remains a goal of future structural studies in this system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevailing view in Picornavirales research is that RNA encapsidation is tightly linked to RNA replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The paradigm is thus that specificity is a function of protein:protein rather than proteinRNA interactions, and that nucleotide sequence specificity is apparently unimportant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that the C-terminal 24 amino acids of the S subunit are involved in stabilizing the coat protein penton fits into this paradigm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stabilization of the penton and the resulting promotion of interactions between pentons explains how this region can promote RNA encapsidation despite this sequence lying on the external surface of the assembled particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar sequences are not found in other plant RNA viruses, perhaps because they commonly interact with their genomes via charged N-terminal arms that are missing in the comoviruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, conceptually the role of the C-terminal sequence may be similar to the effect seen in Hepatitis A, an animal picornavirus, where the uncleaved 2A peptide at the C terminus of VP1 strongly promotes capsid assembly29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also offers an explanation as to why this sequence can act to suppress RNA silencing when part of the S subunit11 but not when it is fused to other proteins such as green fluorescent protein (Cañizares and Lomonossoff, unpublished), as the C-terminal extensions role is in chaperoning the formation of the silencing-active surface rather than silencing itself.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that the presence of the RNA accelerates the rate of C-terminal cleavage, it is plausible that both the C terminus and the genomic RNA may co-chaperone the assembly of the nascent virus particle.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
