Actin stress fiber organization promotes cell stiffening and proliferation of pre-invasive breast cancer cells  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Studies of the role of actin in tumour progression have highlighted its key contribution in cell softening associated with cell invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using a human breast cell line with conditional Src induction, we demonstrate that cells undergo a stiffening state prior to acquiring malignant features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This state is characterized by the transient accumulation of stress fibres and upregulation of Ena/VASP-like (EVL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EVL, in turn, organizes stress fibres leading to transient cell stiffening, ERK-dependent cell proliferation, as well as enhancement of Src activation and progression towards a fully transformed state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, EVL accumulates predominantly in premalignant breast lesions and is required for Src-induced epithelial overgrowth in Drosophila.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While cell softening allows for cancer cell invasion, our work reveals that stress fibre-mediated cell stiffening could drive tumour growth during premalignant stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A careful consideration of the mechanical properties of tumour cells could therefore offer new avenues of exploration when designing cancer-targeting therapies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Breast cancer is a major cause of death in women worldwide1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The multistep process of breast cancer progression results from the acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations in oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, which confer growth and/or survival advantage to mammary cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent molecular alterations may convert these premalignant cells into malignant ones, with invasive and metastatic abilities2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The viral non-receptor tyrosine kinase v-Src and its cellular homologue c-Src are the most investigated proto-oncogenes, implicated in many aspects of tumour development, including proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, invasion and metastasis3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Src protein levels and, to a greater extent, Src protein kinase activity are frequently elevated in malignant and non-malignant breast tissues and significantly associated with decreased survival of breast cancer patients4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Src induces tumour metastasis mainly by reducing adhesiveness and by regulating the actin cytoskeleton3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The semi-flexible polymers of filamentous actin (F-actin), which are assembled from monomeric actin subunits (G-actin), exert or resist forces to drive a large number of cellular processes, including changes in cell shape, cell mobility, cytokinesis and intracellular transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, actin filaments translate external forces into biochemical signalling events that guide cellular responses6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been largely studied in the context of tumour invasion and malignancy, where mechanical signals from the tumour microenvironment impact the metastatic cascade7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, metastatic breast cells have lower stiffness than their healthy counterparts, which is largely determined by the cytoskeleton8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To perform these different functions, actin filaments organize into distinct architectures through the control of a multitude of actin-binding proteins (ABPs) strongly conserved between species10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ena/VASP (enabled/vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein) family proteins, including protein-enabled homologue (Mena), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and Ena-VASP-like (EVL), associate with barbed ends of actin filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They appear to have different effects on F-actin, including favouring actin filament elongation through their anti-capping activity, inhibiting the formation of branched actin networks and promoting F-actin bundling11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, Ena/VASP family members have distinct effects on cancer cell migration and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While EVL suppresses cell migration12, the Mena variant Mena (INV) drives invasion, intravasation and metastasis13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other ABPs inhibit actin polymerization or stabilize actin filaments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, some ABPs organize actin filaments into higher-order networks, by cross-linking actin filaments, or use F-actin as a scaffold, physical support or track, to promote contractility and generate tension10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have previously reported that the pro-growth function of Src is controlled by the actin cytoskeleton in Drosophila epithelia14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this report, we investigate the role of F-actin in supporting the expansion of cancer precursors downstream of Src.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a breast cell line with conditional Src induction, we demonstrate that prior to cells acquiring malignant features, they undergo a transient stress-fibre-dependent stiffening state leading to cell proliferation and the progression towards a fully transformed state.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Src sustains proliferation prior to inducing migration', 'The main transformation events that occur upon overactivation of the Src oncogene can be studied in cell culture, using the mammary MCF10A epithelial cell model with conditional Src induction, which contains a fusion between v-Src and the ligand-binding domain of the Oestrogen Receptor (ER-Src), inducible with tamoxifen (TAM) treatment15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ER-Src cells treated with the vehicle EtOH, but not TAM-treated MCF10A cells carrying an empty vector (PBabe; Supplementary Fig 1), showed basal levels of phosphorylated ER-Src (ER-pSrc), indicating that ER-Src displays some degree of leakiness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, treating ER-Src cells with TAM potentiated ER-pSrc levels (Fig 1a), which increased in a stepwise manner during the 36 h of TAM treatment (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, TAM treatment triggered the phosphorylation of endogenously expressed Src (pSrc) (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In two-dimensional (2D) cultures, this untransformed cell line undergoes morphological transformation features 36 h after TAM treatment with progressive cell detachment (Fig 1c and Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in contrast to ER-Src cells treated with the vehicle EtOH (Fig 1c and Supplementary Movie 1) or PBabe cells treated with TAM (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In three-dimensional (3D) cultures of reconstituted basement membrane, TAM but not EtOH treatment triggered transformed features, characterized by the extrusion of cells from the spherical acinar-like structure that invaded the Matrigel 45 h after treatment (compare Supplementary Movies 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: ERK sustains proliferation of TAM-treated ER-Src cells at 12 h.(a) Western blots on protein extracts from ER-Src cells treated with EtOH or TAM for 4, 12, 24 or 36 h, blotted with anti-pSrc, which reveals ER-pSrc or endogenous pSrc or anti-GAPDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Ratio of ER-pSrc levels between TAM- and EtOH-treated ER-Src cells for the same time points, normalized to GAPDH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Images by phase contrast microscopy of ER-Src cells, treated with TAM or EtOH for 4, 12, 24 or 36 h.

levels of F-actin or stress fibre formation have been associated with increased cell stiffness, whereas a reduction in F-actin or stress fibre disassembly correlates with lower cell stiffness8,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based indentation measurements revealed that ER-Src (but not PBabe) cells were significantly stiffer between 4 and 14 h after TAM treatment compared to EtOH-treated cells (Fig 2f and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, between 36 and 38 h, when TAM-treated ER-Src cells displayed morphological transformation features, they were more deformable than control cells (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, ER-Src cells isolated from TAM-treated 3D cultures showed a transient increase in cell stiffness at 12 h (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, cell stiffness was similar between TAM- and EtOH-treated cells at 36 h (Fig 2g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be due to the fact that phenotypic transformation could take longer in 3D cultures (Supplementary Movie 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with AFM experiments, real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) measurements on suspended cells confirmed that ER-Src cells were stiffer 12 h after TAM treatment (Fig 2h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ER-Src cells treated with TAM for 12 h accumulated higher levels of phospho-myosin light chain (pMLC) compared to cells treated with EtOH for the same period of time (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, we conclude that Src-induced cellular transformation involves a transient increase in actin fibres associated with cell stiffening and the acquisition of self-sufficiency in growth properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Common ABPs are deregulated by Src and in DCIS', 'To further characterize the mechanisms leading to the transient increase in F-actin and cell stiffness, we searched for ABPs involved in building these F-actin structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Microarray profiling identified 35 ABPs deregulated during the 36 h of Src-induced cellular transformation (Fig 3a)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test which of these ABPs would be relevant for breast cancer progression, we analysed the expression signature related to the actin cytoskeleton in premalignant atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using cancer expression data sets available from the GEO database, we collected microarray data for 255 normal breast tissues and 903 neoplastic breast lesions, from which the available information relative to the diagnosis, histological grade and ER status was extracted (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After normalization of the raw data and statistical comparison of breast lesions with normal breast tissues, we sorted all genes significantly deregulated (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, classification of genes into functional categories using Pathway Express indicated that most of the significantly affected biological processes were associated with cancer (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton was among the top 10 pathways significantly deregulated in both premalignant lesions (ADH and DCIS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, while IDCs upregulated many ABPs previously implicated in cancer cell mobility23 (Supplementary Data 2), the category regulation of the actin cytoskeleton had a lower impact factor in these malignant lesions relative to other misregulated pathways or was not being significantly affected (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, classification of these ABPs into functional categories based on their role in F-actin dynamics (Supplementary Data 2) showed that only malignant lesions were enriched for inhibitors of polymerization (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, major alterations in the expression of ABPs are predominantly found in premalignant ADH and DCIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure

3 (FHOD3) and Tropomyosin beta chain (TPM2) were also deregulated in TAM-induced ER-Src cells (Fig 3a)18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ABPs may therefore affect the expansion of TAM-treated ER-Src cells by regulating the transient accumulation of actin fibres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ABPs deregulated by Src impact tissue growth in Drosophila', 'To investigate the effect of these ABPs in Src-induced proliferation, we first screened for those that affect the pro-growth function of Src in Drosophila, as this organism contains only one family member for each of these ABPs (Supplementary Table 2), reducing the risk of gene redundancy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, distal wing discs overexpressing Drosophila Src oncogene at 64B (Src64B) together with the Caspase inhibitor p35 and Green fluorescent protein (GFP) using the the Nubbin-Gal4 (Nub-Gal4) driver were significantly bigger than control discs expressing GFP only (Fig 4a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, replacing UAS-GFP by a UAS construct expressing double-strand RNA (dsRNA) directed against EVL/Ena in Nub greater than Src/p35 wing discs fully suppressed tissue overgrowth (Fig 4a,b and Supplementary Table 2).

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this manuscript, we show that early during cellular transformation, low Src activity promotes stress fibre assembly and upregulates EVL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stress fibre organization by EVL leads to cell stiffening, ERK activation, Cyclin D1 upregulation, sustained cell proliferation, as well as, enhanced Src activation and the progression towards a fully transformed state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later during transformation, higher Src activity, in addition to a reduction in EVL levels would disassemble stress fibres to facilitate cell migration (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 9: Model by which stress fibre and cell stiffening sustain proliferation.Early during cellular transformation, low Src activity promotes stress fibre assembly and upregulates EVL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Organization of these fibres by EVL leads to cell stiffening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both EVL and myosin II-dependent cell stiffening potentiates ERK activity, sustains cell proliferation, as well as enhance Src activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Later during transformation, higher Src activity, in addition to a reduction in EVL levels, would disassemble stress fibres to facilitate cell migration.Full size image', 'In agreement with previously observations25, Src triggers stress fibre disassembly that would allow for cell migration and invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like in 3D, the acquisition of migrating abilities in monolayer cultures may require the presence of activated Src for 45 h. Alternatively, migrating TAM-treated ER-Src cells could be those that detached from the substratum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Like in invasive cancer cells8,26, this reduction in F-actin is associated with higher mean deformability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our work also reveals that earlier during transformation, Src has opposite effects on stress fibre assembly and cell stiffening, which correlate with the upregulation of Cyclin D1 by ERK activation and the acquisition of proliferative abilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These cells assemble larger FAs and transient associated-acto-myosin stress fibres, reminiscent to the accumulation of actin-containing microfilament bundles previously reported in chick embryo fibroblasts with conditional Src induction27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, Src is known to activate the Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK), which promotes acto-myosin contractility28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The apparently opposite effects of Src on stress fibres and cell stiffening correlates with a stepwise increase in Src activity levels and the successive acquisition of premalignant and malignant features in ER-Src cells, as well as in some cancers, such as those of the colon29,30,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while low Src activity would promote stress fibre-mediated cell stiffening accompanying tumour growth, higher levels would have the opposite effect, allowing for cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While Ena/VASP proteins have been proposed to act as anti-capping proteins to permit filament elongation11, we show here that EVL restricts F-actin accumulation in untransformed ER-Src cells or localizes at the tip of the transient Src-dependent stress fibres to organize them into polarized actin networks and to promote cell stiffening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, EVL may have distinct effects on F-actin depending on the cellular context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, several reports describe additional mechanisms by which Ena/VASP proteins regulate F-actin, including preventing branching by the Actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3), promoting bundling and recruiting profilin-G-actin complexes11,33,34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In untransformed ER-Src cells, EVL may therefore limit Arp2/3 recruitment to F-actin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, Src-activated cells undergoing transformation may use EVL to cluster stress fibre barbed ends, favouring their bundling along actin filament length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we cannot exclude that EVL-dependent nucleation of a sub-population of actin filaments promotes stress fibre organization and cell stiffening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations also argue that stress fibre accumulation per se, or an increase in F-actin content, is not sufficient to predict an increase in cell stiffness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously proposed37,38,39, cellular contractility is also dependent of the spatial organization of stress fibres, with EVL being a key player in this context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We propose that by supporting acto-myosin contractility, EVL provides a proliferative advantage to cell undergoing transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we show that EVL and Myosin II activity potentiates ERK activation, which, in turn, upregulates Cyclin D1 and sustains cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ERK overactivation and Cyclin D1 overexpression have been observed in several cancers, including those of the breast, and act as important regulators of tumour cell proliferation20,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, EVL accumulates predominantly in premalignant breast lesions and its upregulation has been associated with the proliferation of mesothelial cells by glucose degradation product41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, tumours are frequently detected as rigid masses with cells showing an increase in the elastic modulus resulting from an altered cytoskeleton42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the growth of uterine sarcoma, prostate, lung and breast tumour cells can be prevented using a ROCK inhibitor43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Forces applied to stress fibres could directly alter ERK conformation, favouring its activation via phosphorylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, integrin-mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton regulates ERK nuclear translocation and activity44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, mechanical stretch transmitted along the actin cytoskeleton can activate Src46, justifying the stepwise increase in ER-pSrc levels potentiated by EVL and Myosin II activity and the increase in endogenous pSrc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This positive feedback mechanism on Src would be expected to cause the subsequent decrease in stress fibre-dependent contractility allowing for cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we cannot exclude that the effect of inhibiting Myosin II activity on ERK-dependent cell proliferation is independent of the polarized stress fibres by EVL, as Myosin II activity controls several essential cellular processes47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our observations also show that in the presence of serum and growth factors, EVL is required for the growth of untransformed ER-Src cells and suggest that the failure of these cells to proliferate in the absence of growth factors could be due, in part, to the lack of EVL expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upregulation of EVL by Src activation would therefore assure that cells acquire self-sufficiency in growth properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, how EVL promotes the growth of untransformed ER-Src cells is unclear, as EVL do not appear to control stress fibres organization, nor cell stiffening in these cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to EVL, other ABPs might be involved downstream of Src to sustain cell proliferation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DST, FHOD3 and TPM2, may limit tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, a large number of cancers, including those of the breast, downregulate TPM2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  48).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, restoration of TPM1 and 2 expression in Ras-transformed cells suppresses the transformed phenotype49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, while the Arp2/3 complex is known for promoting cancer cell mobility and invasiveness50, ACTR3 and ARPC5L restrict Src-induced tissue overgrowth in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As Arp2/3 controls a multitude of cellular functions51, it may have opposite functions in tumour growth and invasion/metastasis, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further studies would be required to confirm the role of these ABPs in tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mouneimne and collaborators have proposed that low EVL levels are predictive of highly invasive tumours and poor prognosis12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, EVL restricts the migratory ability of MCF10A and untransformed ER-Src cells, as well as SUM159 breast cancer cells12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would justify the need for reducing EVL levels in TAM-treated ER-Src cells that acquire invading abilities16, as well as in IDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our observations also reveal that high EVL levels could be a significant predictor of Src-induced breast tumour expansion at earlier stages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mena11a, another Ena/VASP variant, is also overexpressed in a subset of benign breast lesions associated with HER2 positivity, while downregulated in invasive cells and increases the proliferation rate of MCF-7 cells52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, several members of the Ena/VASP family could have similar functions in tumour progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, while Src correlates with ER and HER2 expression and triple negativity54, EVL is associated with the absence of HER2, the expression of ER and with the luminal A molecular subtype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, EVL may only be required for the growth of a subset of breast tumours that contain high Src activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether in non-Luminal A breast tumours, Src promotes tumour expansion via other ABPs, such as Mena11a is an interesting possibility to be tested in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our work places actin regulation and cell rigidity as central contributors to all stages of in the evolution of breast cancer, which opens new avenues of exploration when designing cancer-targeting therapies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
