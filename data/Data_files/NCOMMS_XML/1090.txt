Experimental neutron scattering evidence for proton polaron in hydrated metal oxide proton conductors  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hydration of oxygen-deficient metal oxides causes filling of oxygen vacancies and formation of hydroxyl groups with interstitial structural protons, rotating around the oxygen in localized motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thermal activation from 500 to 800 K triggers delocalization of the protons by jumping to adjacent oxygen ions, constituting proton conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report quantitative analyses of proton and lattice dynamics by neutron-scattering data, which reveal the interaction of protons with the crystal lattice and protonphonon coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The motion for the proton trapped in the elastic crystal field yields Eigen frequencies and coupling constants, which satisfy Holsteins polaron model for electrons and thus constitutes first experimental evidence for a proton polaron at high temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Proton jump rates follow a polaron model for cerium-oxygen and hydroxyl stretching modes, which are thus vehicles for proton conductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confirms that the polaron mechanism is not restricted to electrons, but a universal charge carrier transport process.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The proton is a structural element in hydrocarbons, metal hydrides and water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is an elusive charge carrier1 and the energy carrier in the hydrogen economy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a structural element it is in a localized state; whereas as a mobile ion and as an energy carrier it should have a delocalized nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Numerous metal oxides have proton-conducting properties and many rare earth transition metal oxides with perovskite structure are good proton conductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of them are prospective solid electrolytes at temperatures from 500 to 800 K2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature-dependent proton conductivity is paralleled by substantial changes of the chemical and molecular structure3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental studies show that the proton conduction is an Arrhenius-type thermal activated process, phenomenologically reminiscent of a polaron-type electronic conductivity4, which is observed in many 3d transition metal oxides with perovskite structure5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Therefore, a proton can be pictured as a trapped charge in an elastic crystal field and thus at least conceptually satisfy the definition of a polaron, which has been proposed and mathematically exercised specifically by theorists Samgin6 and in more general terms by Krasnoholovets et al.7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observations on the elastic properties made by experimenters Slodczyk et al.8 with vibration spectroscopy made them speculate over the potential polaronic nature of the proton conductivity: The question of the vibrational signature of isolated proton (for example, the ionic proton, a proton sharing its interaction with more than two acceptors) and its dynamic nature (proton gas, polaron and so on) is open8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, such a proton polaron was not identified so far in hard inorganic matter such as metal oxides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we determine the proton jump times of hydrated yttrium substituted barium cerate with neutron-scattering and electroanalytical methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proton jump times follow a temperature dependence that fits the mathematical model of a polaron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, comparison with our vibration spectroscopy data suggest that it is the cerium-oxygen and hydroxyl stretching modes that propel the protons as charge carriers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

potential if the OO separation was lower than 2.9 Å, with the result that the proton would transfer between the energy minimum sites18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They derived the activation energy for this

polaron concept was originally introduced by Landau for the description of charge transport in crystal lattices24, in particular for electrons, and developed further by other researchers7,19,25.

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The proton with small ionic radius may have strong bonds with the lattice vibrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When a proton is introduced into an ionic crystal and moves through the crystal lattice, because of their electrostatic interactions, the lattice ions respond to the proton motion by local lattice relaxation (polarization)32 as sketched in Fig 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The term polaron implies that complete assessment of the problem would therefore include the effect of the ionic character on the pressure dependence of vibration frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Direction of

oxide host lattice as a damped harmonic oscillator.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, the relative displacement u between a proton with mass mH and an oxygen ion with mass mO in an electric field with strength E0 is', '', 'Because of the inverse relation u  1/TO, higher optical phonon frequency TO will mandate a smaller relative displacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming that proton hopping with activation energy Ea is assisted by a large vibration displacement of the oscillator, the activation energy scales parabolic with the optical phonon frequency:', '', 'Therefore, we expect pressure dependence for the transversal optical (TO) and also longitudinal optical (LO) modes, and the different contribution of the vibration displacements for the high- and low-energy modes on the polaron transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The former gives different pressure dependence on the LO modes and TO modes as we would expect from the magnitudes of the Grüneisen parameters for the modes, and the latter gives different influence on the mobile proton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A change of the crystal unit cell volume will affect the phonon frequencies, the relationship of which is given by the Grüneisen parameter .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electronic polarization, which is in principle the optical dielectric tensor, affects the frequencies TO and LO of the TO modes and LO modes, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, this yields different magnitudes on the Grüneisen parameters for the LO and TO modes, LO and TO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wakamura35 has demonstrated how different pressure dependencies arise for TO and LO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an ionic crystal, LO assumes a lower value than TO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the polaron works stronger by the LO mode than by the TO mode, the LO mode must contribute dominantly to the activation energy Ea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may clarify the difference of parabolic and linear relations of vibration frequency on Ea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong contribution of electronic polarizability on Ea is obvious from the relationship between optical dielectric constant and Ea values as seen in references33,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our EIS studies at high temperature and high pressure13,14 confirm the influence of pressure on the activation energy Ea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the molecular level, the relation between activation energy and mechanical pressure can be rationalized as the consequence of the shift in the prominent Raman mode v3, which represents the CeO stretching15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the frequency of certain phonon modes can affect the amplitude of the proton motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At pressure, the spring constant (here not being constant anymore) of the CeO stretching bonds increases, which can result in smaller vibration amplitude of the protons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pressure may keep the protons in the CeO6 octahedral cage and raise therefore the energy barrier, that is, Ea for the proton transfer9,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'OCeO bending modes were also observed in the Raman spectra of BCY at lower frequencies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation in frequencies for these modes upon pressure, however, was not as significant as the CeO stretching modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the pressure-dependent variation for these bending modes was suppressed upon hydration37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, although the OCeO bending modes may contribute to proton transport via the vibration displacement18, the effect of these modes is not considered due to its insignificance here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In summary, our experimental observation that the proton jump times  are accurately described by Samgins proton polaron model lends credibility to the suggestion6,7,8 that the protonphonon coupling in an ABO3 perovskite structure such as BCY20 can be considered the origin for a genuine polaron.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the thermally activated CeO stretching mode is the dominant driving force for the coupling of the low-energy phonon mode with the proton diffusion, and thus the physical origin of the proton conductivity in ceramic proton conductors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coupling strength of this system is within the range of intermediate coupling and yields a polaron mass of virtually exactly m*=2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this result looks fortuitous, the suggestion that this could be an indication for a process, which is based on protons that move in pairs rather than individually, deserves attention and should warrant further experimental and theoretical investigation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
