Single-cell tracking of flavivirus RNA uncovers species-specific interactions with the immune system dictating disease outcome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Positive-sense RNA viruses pose increasing health and economic concerns worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our limited understanding of how these viruses interact with their host and how these processes lead to virulence and disease seriously hampers the development of anti-viral strategies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate the tracking of (+) and () sense viral RNA at single-cell resolution within complex subsets of the human and murine immune system in different mouse models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide insights into how a prototypic flavivirus, yellow fever virus (YFV-17D), differentially interacts with murine and human hematopoietic cells in these mouse models and how these dynamics influence distinct outcomes of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We detect () YFV-17D RNA in specific secondary lymphoid compartments and cell subsets not previously recognized as permissive for YFV replication, and we highlight potential virushost interaction events that could be pivotal in regulating flavivirus virulence and attenuation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Infection by positive-sense RNA viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or flaviviruses such as dengue (DENV), Zika (ZIKV) and yellow fever viruses (YFV), remains a challenging global health issue1,2,3,4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For most of these pathogens, specific treatments or vaccines are unavailable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One major barrier to generating novel anti-viral strategies is our limited understanding of the nature, complexity and dynamics of interactions between these pathogens and the human host.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, it is incompletely understood how hostvirus interactions regulate the molecular processes leading to virulence and disease or, conversely, immunogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Disease outcome is largely influenced by the dynamic interactions between a virus and the host immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventional experimental infection systems, specifically cell culture models, poorly reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of interactions that are also highly dependent on non-immune tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although analysing immune responses in humans has provided important insights into virushost biology, such clinical studies have multiple shortcomings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Usually only peripheral tissues, that is, blood, can be routinely accessed and perturbations, such as genetic alterations, are not possible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, there is considerable intra- and inter-experimental variability due to heterogeneity of the study cohort and critical parameters like exposure time, dose and specific viral strain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vitro, analysis is often limited to a few isolated human immune cell subsets as many lymphocytes require distinct conditions and cannot be maintained as a complex population in culture over sufficiently long periods to model the dynamics of an immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, experimental animal models to delineate hostpathogen interactions remain critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetically modified mice have been generated to evaluate the impact of multiple host factors on viral replication and pathogenesis7,8, and humanized mice, that is, mice engrafted with a human immune system (HIS)9, have emerged as a powerful platform to investigate viral interactions with the HIS (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tracking viral antigen longitudinally in a complex, heterogeneous cell population can provide important insights into the interactions between a virus and the immune system, as well as how the spatio-temporal dynamics of such interactions might correlate with infection outcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly relevant for studying pathogenesis and diseases that are, or are suspected to be, linked to active infection of HIS components by viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus11, HIV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12), DENV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  13) or YFV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Conventionally, fluorophore-labelled antibodies targeting viral proteins and immune cell proteins have been used to track viral antigens within the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using flow cytometry, a large number of single-cell events can be analysed at high-resolution in the context of heterogeneous cell populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, such an approach remains limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generating reliable and highly specific antibodies that target viral proteins similarly across multiple viral strains is a considerable challenge, especially in the context of emerging viruses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, even when reliable antibodies are available, low in vivo expression of the targeted viral proteins and lack of signal amplification result in poor signal sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, targeting only viral proteins gives an incomplete picture as viral RNA molecules, independent of translation, can be involved in multiple interactions with components of the host immune system15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, novel detection approaches, independent of viral proteins and applicable to multiple cell populations in vivo, are needed to more accurately characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of virus interaction with cells of the immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent development of a novel flow cytometry application16, Prime RNA flow (RNA-flow), now allows the detection of RNA molecules by flow cytometry through strong signal amplification, opening new avenues for multiplex detection of RNA and proteins by flow cytometry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that RNA-flow can be harnessed to track in a spatio-temporal manner positive (+) and negative () strand viral RNA within multiple cell subsets of the murine and human immune system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A prototypic flavivirus, YFV is a positive-stranded RNA virus that causes a broad spectrum of symptoms in humans, ranging from subclinical manifestations to severe multi-organ dysfunction and death17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the live-attenuated form of YFV, YFV-17D, which differs from its parental, highly pathogenic strain YFV-Asibi by only 32 amino acids18, represents one of the most efficient vaccines ever developed19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the molecular determinants regulating YFV pathogenesis or attenuation remain unknown, multiple lines of evidence suggest the immune system plays an important role21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disease severity has been shown to correlate with high-levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in fatal YFV cases22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The production and action of these cytokines, combined with the action of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, are thought to be responsible for the severe clinical manifestations observed during YFV infection21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YFV pathogenesis has also been shown to be both host and virus strain dependent17,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these observations suggest that differential interactions between YFV and the immune system influence the outcome of infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Discerning the spatio-temporal dynamics of YFV within the immune system will provide insights into how YFV interacts with the host immune system in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we successfully applied RNA-flow technology to detect YFV-17D (+) and () strand RNA (YFV RNA-flow) within the murine and human immune system in different mouse models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide proof-of-concept for using this approach to analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics of viral RNA within complex immune cell populations during YFV-17D infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these mouse models, we document distinct differences in the virus ability to infect human and mouse hematopoietic cells with intact cell-intrinsic antiviral signalling capacity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that YFV-17D infection is antagonized by type I and III interferon (IFN) dependent antiviral defenses within the murine hematopoietic compartment, but the virus is able to overcome these innate defenses in human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we detect YFV-17D replication in specific immune compartments and cell subsets not previously described as supporting YFV-17D replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses highlight particular virushost interaction events as potential regulators of the mechanisms of YFV-17D pathogenesis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Detecting (+) and () sense YFV-17D RNA by vRNA flow', 'To harness RNA-flow for the detection of YFV-17D (+) and () strand RNA (henceforth referred to as viral RNA flow or vRNA flow), we designed two sets of probes targeting a 1,700â€‰bp region of either the (+) or () strand of YFV-17D RNA (henceforth referred to as (+) and () probe sets).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following cell permeabilization and probe hybridization, pre-amplifier and amplifier bind, respectively, the target probes and the pre-amplifier, generating multiple binding sites for fluorescent-labelled probes on a single target probe (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This amplification step enables sensitive detection of target probe hybridization to viral RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the (+) and () probes are conjugated to different fluorophores (Alexa (AL) 647 and AL488, respectively), (+) and () viral RNA, indicative of viral replication, can be simultaneously detected at the single-cell level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Harnessing flow cytometry application to profile viral RNA dynamics within complex cell populations.Schematic representation of the vRNA flow procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An Alexa 647-probe set was designed to target a 1753, bp sequence of the YFV-17D (+) RNA strand, located within the NS5 coding region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, an Alexa 488-probe set was designed to target a 929 and 840â€‰bp sequence of the YFV-17D () strand, located, respectively, downstream and upstream of the 1,753â€‰bp region targeted by the YFV-17D (+) RNA probe set on the (+) strand.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following hybridization of the probes to the (+) and () RNA, amplification of the fluorescence signal occurred via the use of PreAmplifier and Amplifier that bound the initial probes and served as binding sites for the fluorescent probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fluorescence signals of bound (+) and () YFV-17D RNA probe sets can then be detected by flow cytometry using the AL647/APC and AL488/FITC channels, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a strategy thus allows simultaneous detection of both (+) and () strand YFV-17D RNA at a single-cell resolution within cell lines or within heterogeneous, primary cell populations.Full size

sequence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Six hours post-transfection, cells were processed following the vRNA flow procedure and incubated with both (+) and () probe sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probe sets were highly specific for their respective targets with no noticeable cross-reactivity (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further ascertain the specificity of the assay, we generated a replication-deficient YFV-17D strain (YFV-17D pol) by mutating the residues 3172 and 3173 (GDD to GSA) in the catalytic site of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) as previously described26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mutation rendered YFV-17D unable to replicate and propagate in vitro as evidenced by RT-qPCR (Fig 2c and Supplementary Fig 1a) and the absence of a cytopathic effect (Supplementary Fig 1b) following parallel electroporation of human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells with either YFV-17D or YFV-17D pol RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we assessed our (+) and () strand probe sets following electroporation of in vitro transcribed RNA of these two genomes into Huh7.5 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells transfected with the replication incompetent YFV-17D genome, only (+) RNA was detected at 10â€‰h and, to a lesser extent, 36â€‰h post electroporation (Fig 2d,e and Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, cells transfected with the unmodified YFV-17D genome, which produces a () strand intermediate to generate more viral genomes, both RNA species were detected 36â€‰h post electroporation (Fig 2d,e), confirming the specificity of our probe sets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we applied vRNA flow to assess the dynamics of (+) and () viral RNA in an infection context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In Huh7.5 cells infected with YFV-17D, we observed an increasing frequency of Huh7.5 cells bearing (+) alone, or both (+) and () strand YFV-17D RNA over three days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frequency of cells carrying (+) viral RNA scaled with the increasing level of intracellular YFV-17D RNA across the whole

response25,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, whole-body knockout of the type I and II IFN receptors renders mice highly susceptible to infection with YFV-17D (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A considerable caveat of this knock-out strain is the strong impairment of both adaptive immunity and cell-intrinsic innate immunity across all tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of evidence that interactions between YFV and immune system components dictate disease outcome and the fact that the murine IFN response is critical for controlling YFV-17D infection, we hypothesized that blunting IFN signalling in immune cell compartments would suffice to render mice susceptible to viral infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To create mice with impairment of IFN signalling specifically in hematopoietic cells, we intercrossed mice harbouring a floxed Stat1 allele (stat1loxP/loxP) with mice expressing a Cre recombinase under the control of a Vav promoter (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice were highly susceptible to YFV-17D infection, indicated by rapid weight loss (Fig 3b), progressively worsening clinical appearance (Supplementary Fig 2a) and death within two weeks of infection (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, wild-type mice (WT) and mice harbouring a stat1-specific knock-out in hepatocytes (stat1loxP/loxP/Alb-cre in which Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of an albumin promoter), did not show any overt clinical phenotype or mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that depletion of IFN signalling in the hematopoietic compartment recapitulates the clinical features observed in germline type I/II IFN knock-out mice, thus highlighting the hematopoietic compartment as a critical regulator of YFV infection in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the observed clinical phenotype, stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre, but not WT and stat1loxP/loxP/Alb-cre mice, displayed a sharp increase in YFV-17D RNA in the serum 3 days post infection followed by a decline in viremia between days 3 and 7 post infection (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This viremia profile was confirmed in independent cohorts (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated serum viremia at day 3 post infection correlated with a strong increase in the serum concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-, MCP-1, IP-10, IL-6 and

antibodies, we tracked YFV-17D replication complexes (presence of both (+) and () viral RNA) within immune cell subsets isolated from the blood and spleen of infected WT and stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following infection of WT and stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice with YFV-17D, we analysed which murine immune cell subsets are the primary reservoir of YFV-17D replication intermediates in the blood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 3 post infection, stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice displayed a significant increase of CD45+ cells carrying YFV-17D replication intermediates, correlating with the levels of viremia at this time point (Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among all murine CD45+ cells, macrophages (MPH), cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CTL) and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were the main sites of YFV-17D replication when stat1 was knocked-out in the hematopoietic compartment (Fig 5b and Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This burst of YFV-17D replication in hematopoietic cells was transient in nature as YFV-17D replication intermediates could not be detected at day 11 post infection in either WT or stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An increase in CD8+ T cells carrying viral replication complexes in the periphery was associated with a drop in peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at day 3 post infection (Fig 5d), suggesting viral replication in the periphery might affect T cell proliferation and activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, mRNA transcripts of the IL-12 receptor and numerous cytokines, including MCP-1, IP-10, IL-6, IFN- and GM-CSF, were significantly lower in CD8+ T cells enriched from the blood as compared to non-CD8+ cells of stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice at day 3 post infection (Fig 5e,f and Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As CD8+ T cells appeared to be major cytokine producers among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice (Supplementary Fig 4c), our results suggest an exacerbated cytokine response could be triggered in a PBMC-independent manner to counteract the defect in the response of peripheral T cells to infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then sought to determine whether an increased viral load in the spleen of stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice correlates with an increased level of viral RNA-bearing cells in spleen-resident immune cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At day 11 post infection, we observed a significant increase in the frequency of cells bearing (+) and () strand YFV-17D RNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both YFV-17D RNA complexes were significantly increased in spleen-resident CD19+ B cells, CD3 CD161+ NK cells and in the total CD11b+ cell population (that comprises NK cells) of stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice in comparison to WT (Fig 5g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these subsets, only NK cells in which YFV-17D was replicating experienced a significant increase between days 3 and 11 post infection in contrast to the number of YFV-17D replicating-B cells that had a more stable level during this period (Supplementary Fig 4d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in viral replication observed in the total CD11b+ population was mainly due to NK cells, as the CD11b+ CD161 cell fraction harbouring both (+) and () YFV-17D RNA was similar between WT and stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data suggest a link between an

stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice, highly immunocompromised NRG mice, which lack functional NK, B, and T cells, did not succumb to YFV-17D infection, demonstrating that cell-intrinsic antiviral defenses are more important for control of the live-attenuated virus in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data suggest these observed differences in the course of disease can be attributed to the

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Flaviviruses are a cause of major health concern worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mosquito-mediated transmission of these pathogens, combined with their rapid genetic co-evolution with their host, strongly impacts the incidence of cyclical outbreaks that increase in frequency with climate and environmental changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our lack of knowledge regarding the interactions between these pathogens and their hosts strongly hampers our ability to effectively respond to these outbreaks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recent outbreaks attributed to ZIKV (refs 36, 37) and YFV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2), both isolated and identified several decades ago, illustrate such concerns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Today, there is an urgent need to harness novel experimental approaches in order to shed light on the interactions between these pathogens and their hosts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, characterizing interactions between flaviviruses and the immune response, the major defence system against infection, is of great interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we applied a flow-cytometric approach to track flavivirus RNA at the single-cell level in different immune systems and functional contexts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrated how YFV-17D distinctively interacts with cells of the murine and human immune system in different mouse models and how these dynamics are affected by blunted innate immune responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our results provide a broad picture of how the interactions between YFV-17D and the immune system are connected to different outcomes of infection in these experimental models (Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified components of the immune system that are key players in these dynamic changes and potentially involved in the mechanisms of pathogenesis or immunogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we identified previously undescribed immune cell subsets permissive to viral replication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it should be noted that immune responses in human patients and vaccinees likely differ from those in our experimental mouse models due to the incomplete humanization of the hematopoietic cell compartment in our humanized

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral replication was not observed in immune cell subsets found in the peripheral blood of WT mice, and serum viremia was low or non-detectable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although viral clearance seemed to occur in the periphery, cell-associated viral replication was observed in several immune cell subsets of the spleen of WT mice at day 11 post infection, suggesting YFV-17D remained constrained by the immune system in the spleen before complete viral clearance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stat1 knock-out in the hematopoietic compartment rendered multiple peripheral cell-subsets permissive to viral replication early during the course of infection before peripheral clearance, presumably due to the rise in various pro-inflammatory cytokines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the murine spleen, viral replication was enhanced in B cells and NK cells in the absence of Stat1, and replication in NK cells showed the strongest increase over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, our findings represent the first evidence of YFV-17D replicating in murine B cells and NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the increased interactions between YFV-17D and murine immune components and the modified viral replication dynamics triggered by the blunting of innate immunity highlight a potential signature of YFV-17D pathogenesis (Fig 8 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viral replication in the NK

junction disruption and increased vascular permeability39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to our observations, elevated levels of specific cytokines such as MCP-1, IL-6 or IP-10 have been observed in patients with fatal YFV infection23, in YFV/YFV-17D-infected mice deficient for type I and/or II IFN (refs 27, 28) and in rhesus macaques infected with YFV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  41).  #@NEW_LINE#@#

viral infections39,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Failure of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to control viral infection can lead to severe immune dysregulation and immunopathology due to overproduction of cytokines like TNF- or IFN- (refs 39, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed a significant downregulation in the expression of several cytokines and the IL-12 receptor in peripheral CD8+ T cells at day 3 post infection associated with a depression in the frequency of peripheral T cells at the same time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at the same time point could aid in overcoming the defect in T cell response, reducing peripheral viremia to background levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, aberrant lymphocyte proliferation in the periphery after day 3 post infection, as well as histopathologic manifestations in the spleen and liver tissues, suggests that this cytokine storm, along with increased viral replication in particular spleen immune cell subsets, might ultimately lead to a detrimental immunopathogenic process in infected stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, our data point towards a unique link between viral replication in CD8+ T cells, the impairment of a CD8+ T cell-mediated immune response and the induction of a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether fatal cases of YFV infection in humans are also associated with extensive replication in CD8+ T cells remains to be determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'YFV has a very narrow host tropism25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disease, as well as protective immunity, is restricted to humans and some non-human primate species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we sought to harness vRNA flow in a human immune context to assess how YFV-17D replication dynamics are associated with immunogenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we characterized YFV-17D infection in humanized mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain human immune cells were highly permissive to YFV-17D infection,

defenses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of (+) viral RNA in the periphery of NRG-HIS mice at day 3 post infection was similar to stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice, suggesting that mice lacking IFN signalling mimic human features of YFV infection, as previously described27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, YFV-17D has been reported to inhibit human Stat1 and Stat2 signalling in infected cells45,46 but our data suggest that the same viral evasion mechanisms are ineffective in murine cells, as Stat1 sufficient mice were largely resistant to YFV-17D infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only, when Stat1 signalling was inhibited, as in stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice, was YFV-17D able to robustly replicate in immune cell subsets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite these similarities, YFV-17D replication in NRG-HIS mice presented two specific features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell-associated virus was not observed in the blood of WT and stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice at later time points, but human immune cells bearing replicating viral RNA persisted in the blood of NRG-HIS mice despite a significant drop in replication between days 3 and 11 post infection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the periphery, viral replication was largely restricted to pDCs, B cells and MPHs, but persisted only in the latter two (Fig 8 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although MPHs and DCs were also major cell types targeted by YFV-17D in the periphery of stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice, no viral replication was observed in peripheral T cells at any time point, underlining that replication in this cell type might be important in pathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, while the frequency of cells harbouring (+) viral RNA was initially low in the spleens of NRG-HIS mice, it gradually increased over time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication was only detected at day 11 post infection and was mostly restricted to cell subsets previously identified in the periphery: B cells, MPHs and pDCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Replication was also observed to a lesser extent in cDCs and NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, viral replication in the spleen of WT or stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice did not show a restricted cell tropism, and a high amount of cells bearing (+) viral RNA were detected in these mice at all tested time points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YFV-17D replication thus displayed a specific spatio-temporal signature in NRG-HIS mice, where the blood and the spleen represent, respectively, an early and late replication reservoir containing immune cell subsets similarly targeted within both compartments (Fig 8 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, the higher level of cell-associated virus in the spleens of WT as compared to NRG-HIS mice also suggests host-specific interactions modulate YFV-17D immunogenicity, viral replication and tropism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The perturbation of these interactions, as in the spleen of stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice, might be detrimental for the host and contribute to immunopathogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, investigating how the genetic differences between YFV-17D and YFV virulent strains affect the viral replication signature in the immune system and perturb host-specific interactions could provide important insights into the mechanisms of YFV pathogenesis in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our in vivo data are consistent with previous results demonstrating

NRG-HIS mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a major type I IFN producer, pDCs have been shown to be critical in controlling the initial phase of infection48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, YFV-17Ds replication in pDCs has been shown to stimulate type I IFN production, hence initiating the immune response47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results are consistent with these reports as YFV-17D displayed high and early replication in pDCs during the course of infection before a drop in replication at a later time point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increase of human IFN- in humanized mice blood but not in YFV-17D-infected WT and stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice, and the detection of spleen-resident activated T cells are additional markers of an induced immune response in NRG-HIS mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Furthermore, replication of YFV-17D in human B cells and MPHs suggests a link between replication in these subsets and the induction of an adaptive immune response in NRG-HIS mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, it was recently reported that replication of YFV-17D in human monocyte-derived MPHs stimulate the IFN and IL-2 production of CD4+ T cells14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sustained replication in NRG-HIS mice of YFV-17D in human MPHs and the presence of IFN in the serum are consistent with this report and strengthen the idea that NRG-HIS mice may develop human-like features of the immune response against YFV-17D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, viral replication in spleen-resident B cells could enhance MHC II-mediated antigen presentation, resulting in the activation and migration of B and helper T cells in the peripheral blood49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'YFV-17D replication in spleen-resident NK cells represents an important difference between NRG-HIS mice and stat1loxP/loxP/Vav-cre mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the level of YFV-17D replication in human NK cells remained low over time, but with a dramatic increase in murine NK cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  YFV-17D vaccination in humans induces a strong NK cell response, as evidenced by their activation and proliferation shortly following vaccination51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This strong NK cell response was dependent on type I/III IFN signalling51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, increasing evidence indicates an important role for NK cells in mediating memory-like responses and effective vaccine responses52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the presence of type I/III IFN signalling, along with low-levels of viral replication in humans, could be involved in the development of an immunogenicity process (for instance, through Th1 priming and CD8+ T cell response).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Altogether, there is increasing evidence from ex vivo studies in patients, in vitro experiments and our present study that the human immune system provides a replication reservoir for YFV-17D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that infection is controlled in a species-specific manner and promotes the induction of a strong immunogenicity process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we have demonstrated that tracking viral RNA in a complex cell population is a powerful approach when combined with multiple in vivo systems and humanized models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach uncovered a broad, yet detailed, overview of flavivirus replication dynamics within multiple immune systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, it permitted the association of such dynamics with specific outcomes of infection and identification of mediators and events that potentially regulate the attenuation of YFV-17D.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although conventional humanized mouse models are unable to develop long-lived, antigen-specific responses or antibody responses53, these mice represent a valuable platform for observing the primary adaptive immune response to infection and the mobilization of the different arms of this response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, taking advantage of novel humanized models able to develop strong antigen-specific responses will be of further interest to more deeply characterize the interplays between YFV-17D and the components of the adaptive immune response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the future, the tracking of viral RNA in novel humanized mice models, combined with the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies, could further reveal the immune signatures and molecular mechanisms that define viral pathogenicity or attenuation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
