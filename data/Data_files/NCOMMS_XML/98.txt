DNA repair factor BRCA1 depletion occurs in Alzheimer brains and impairs cognitive function in mice  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Maintaining DNA integrity is vital for all cells and organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defective DNA repair may contribute to neurological disorders, including Alzheimers disease (AD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found reduced levels of BRCA1, but not of other DNA repair factors, in the brains of AD patients and human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amyloid- oligomers reduced BRCA1 levels in primary neuronal cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild-type mice, knocking down neuronal BRCA1 in the dentate gyrus caused increased DNA double-strand breaks, neuronal shrinkage, synaptic plasticity impairments, and learning and memory deficits, but not apoptosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low levels of hAPP/Amyloid- overexpression exacerbated these effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Physiological neuronal activation increased BRCA1 levels, whereas stimulating predominantly extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors promoted the proteasomal degradation of BRCA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that BRCA1 is regulated by neuronal activity, protects the neuronal genome, and critically supports neuronal integrity and cognitive functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pathological accumulation of A depletes neuronal BRCA1, which may contribute to cognitive deficits in AD.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Effective repair of DNA damage is essential for the survival of cells and most individual organisms and species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ineffective repair can result in cell death, cancer and neurological disease1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alzheimers disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders are associated with excessive neuronal DNA damage3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have shown that physiological increases in brain activity transiently increase neuronal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) without causing neuronal apoptosis4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In wild-type (WT) mice, the DSBs were rapidly repaired after neuronal activity returned to baseline.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice from line J20, which simulate key aspects of AD5, had higher levels of neuronal DSBs at baseline and abnormal persistence of activity-induced neuronal DSBs4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In principle, these alterations could result from excessive formation or defective repair of DSBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because DNA repair is defective in several neurodegenerative diseases1,2, we hypothesized that the abnormal accumulation of DSBs in neurons of hAPP mice is caused by alterations in their DNA repair machinery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We show that the levels of a specific DNA repair factor are decreased in brains of hAPP-J20 mice and of patients with AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Knocking down this factor in the dentate gyrus (DG) of mice increased neuronal DSB levels in this brain region and caused behavioural deficits without causing neuronal loss.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

4be).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The BRCA1 signal ratio of transduced to nontransduced neurons was 40% lower in sh1-injected WT and hAPPlow mice than in scr-injected WT and hAPPlow mice (Supplementary Fig 4ce).

sh1-expressing WT mice (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, expression of either of two shRNAs targeting BRCA1 mRNA effectively lowered BRCA1 levels, and A-dependent reductions in BRCA1 may require a certain threshold level of A expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine whether neuronal knockdown of BRCA1 affects DNA integrity, we measured nuclear DNA fragmentation in a comet assay at neutral pH17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We isolated cell nuclei from DG and determined the proportion of nuclei with comet tails and the length of the tails (Fig 3d and Supplementary Fig 5a,b), which reflect the prevalence and extent of DSBs, respectively17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRCA1 knockdown increased the proportion of nuclei with comet tails in hAPPlow mice and was associated with a trend in this direction in WT mice (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The severity of DNA damage, reflected in the length of comet tails, did not differ significantly among the groups (Supplementary Fig 5b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also immunostained brain sections with antibodies against 53BP1 and H2A.X, which form nuclear foci around DSBs (Fig 3e)4,11. sh1-injected mice had 1.6-fold (WT) to 2-fold (hAPPlow) more cells with

scr-injected controls (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Baseline numbers of cells with H2A.X-positive foci in scr-injected mice were slightly higher than those we previously observed in uninjected WT mice4, possibly due to the viral infection per se or the co-expression of eGFP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  hAPPlow expression increased both the number of cells with foci and the percentage of cells with 3 H2A.X-positive foci in sh1-injected mice (Fig 3g,h), suggesting that even low levels of hAPP/A overexpression can exacerbate the severity of DNA damage when BRCA1 levels are reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained with sh2 (Supplementary Fig 5ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these findings suggest that BRCA1 critically contributes to DSB repair in central neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The increase in DSBs caused by sh1 expression in WT and hAPPlow mice was smaller than the threefold increase in DSBs detected by comet assay and 53BP1 immunostaining in uninjected hAPP-J20 mice, as compared with uninjected WT controls4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference probably reflects a BRCA1 dose effect, as levels of BRCA1 in the DG were lower in uninjected hAPP-J20 mice (Fig 1a) than in sh1-injected WT and hAPPlow mice (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Physiological increases in neuronal activity transiently increase neuronal DSBs in WT mice4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the role of BRCA1 in the repair of DSBs generated in response to physiological activation, we let sh1- or scr-injected WT mice explore a novel environment for 2 h. In all mice the number of dentate granule cells with 53BP1 foci increased immediately after the exploration (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When replicate groups of mice were analysed 24 h after the exploration, the number of neurons with 53BP1-positive foci had returned to baseline levels in scr-injected mice but not in sh1-injected mice (Fig 3i), suggesting that BRCA1 contributes to the repair of activity-induced DSBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Knockdown of BRCA1 does not cause neuronal apoptosis', 'Since physiological increases in neuronal activity transiently increase neuronal DSBs in WT mice, it is unlikely that moderate increases in DSBs cause neuronal loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, hAPP-J20 mice have decreased hippocampal BRCA1 levels (Fig 1a,b) and an increased proportion of neurons with DSBs4, but no overt neuronal loss7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with these observations, we found no increases in TUNEL-stained dentate granule cells in sh1-injected WT and hAPPlow mice (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Since neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the DG continues into adulthood and newly born granule cells appear to be more sensitive to DNA damage than

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our study shows that BRCA1 critically contributes to DSB repair in central neurons and that neuronal reductions in BRCA1 cause increased persistence of DSBs, abnormal chromatin remodelling, cellular dysfunction and cognitive deficits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also identifies depletions of BRCA1 in brains of patients with MCI or AD, and provides evidence that these depletions are caused by the pathological accumulation of A, which may promote the proteasomal degradation of BRCA1 through overactivation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In our experimental models, we reduced BRCA1 expression specifically in the DG for several reasons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although dentate granule neurons are relatively resistant to cell death in AD, there is plenty of evidence for their dysfunction in this condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies showed profound alterations in the DG of patients with MCI or early AD28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, patients with AD have several molecular abnormalities in dentate granule cells that are also found in hAPP-J20 mice, including depletion of BRCA1 (this study), reduction of calbindin and increased expression of collagen VI, metenkephalin and group IV phospholipase A2 (refs 5, 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Degeneration of the perforant path, the main afferent input to the DG, is a well-established feature of AD31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DG also shows the greatest increase in neuronal DSBs in hAPP mice4, and can readily be transduced with lentiviral vectors6,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, several sensitive behavioural assays exist to evaluate its function and dysfunction21,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, knockdown of BRCA1 in both DG caused deficits in spatial learning and memory in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In exploring the mechanisms that may underlie these abnormalities, we discovered that the size of cell bodies and dendritic arbours was reduced in neurons expressing low levels of BRCA1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in dendritic complexity, including length and branching, also occur in AD patients35, AD-related animal models36 and other neurodegenerative diseases37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The reductions in the size of cell bodies and dendritic arbours were associated with an increase in cell excitability, consistent with results from computational modelling39,40 and experimental studies40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, neuronal BRCA1 reduction impaired long-term synaptic plasticity, which is involved in hippocampus-dependent associative spatial learning and memory41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies are needed to determine whether these neuronal alterations result from faulty DSB repair or from reductions in other functions BRCA1 fulfils in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notwithstanding this uncertainty, the alterations in synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability we observed after BRCA1 reduction may well contribute to the circuit and network dysfunctions that underlie cognitive deficits and behavioural alterations in AD and related animal models5,30,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The fact that select manipulations in the DG caused behavioural deficits in the MWM may seem at odds with reports that complete removal or destruction of both DG does not prevent mice from solving this task45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, diverse lines of evidence suggest that solving this task actively engages the DG46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other molecular manipulations of both DG also altered performance in this or other tasks requiring the encoding of spatial contexts6,34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceivably, compensatory mechanisms in the remainder of the brain are engaged more effectively when a brain region is eliminated than when it is dysfunctional but still connected to the network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, individual neurons can affect global network activity34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BRCA1 is critical for DNA repair in dividing cells, in which BRCA1 deficiency leads to cell death9,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If it had a similar role in mature neurons, A- and sh1-induced BRCA1 reductions might impair cognitive functions through neuronal apoptosis resulting from accumulating DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, despite having impaired learning and memory, WT and hAPPlow mice with reduced BRCA1 levels showed no evidence for neuronal apoptosis or loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, BRCA1 reduction impaired the repair of neuronal DSBs elicited by physiological brain activity in WT mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is tempting to speculate that much of the neuronal DNA damage that accumulates in brains with reduced BRCA1 levels represents these circumscribed activity-induced DSBs4 and that chronic accumulation of such DSBs could ultimately contribute to neuronal degeneration, for example, by dysregulating gene expression24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'BRCA1 knockdown tended to reduce the number of newborn granule cells in the DG, but this trend was not statistically significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, sh1-injected WT mice and scr-injected hAPPlow mice had the same level of doublecortin-positive neurons in the DG (Supplementary Fig 7), but only the former group had significant deficits in the MWM probe trial and novel place recognition task (Fig 4), suggesting a dissociation between neurogenesis and sh1-induced behavioural deficits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, even profound suppression of neurogenesis appears to cause only limited cognitive impairments48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It therefore seems most likely that the effects of BRCA1 knockdown on learning and memory reflect changes in neuronal structure and function rather than neuronal loss and impaired neurogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is tempting to speculate that BRCA1-dependent alterations in neuronal structure and function involve chromatin remodelling and changes in gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the functions and roles of neuronal activity-associated formation and repair of DSBs may relate to chromatin remodelling, coordinated transcription or silencing of gene clusters, or movement of transposable elements24,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By preventing effective repair of activity-dependent DSBs, neuronal depletion of BRCA1 may dysregulate these dynamic processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In many non-neuronal cell types, DSB formation is associated with increased dimethylation on lysine 9 (K9) of histone 3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that this association also exists in mature post-mitotic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In dividing cells, me2H3(K9) formation is critically involved in BRCA1-dependent repair processes26 and mediates gene repression51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although transient me2H3(K9) formation in neurons is linked to memory acquisition52, abnormal persistence of this modification in neurons has been implicated in behavioural and neuropsychiatric disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, BRCA1 reduction increased neuronal me2H3(K9) levels in vitro and in vivo, possibly because of the increased persistence and accumulation of neuronal DSBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, me2H3(K9) levels in the DG were higher in scr-injected hAPPlow mice than scr-injected WT mice, even though these groups had comparable numbers of neurons with DSBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conceivably, it may take less A elevation and BRCA1 reduction to cause dimethylation of lysine 9 on core histone 3 than to promote the accumulation of DSBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the detection of me2H3(K9) by western blot analysis may simply be more sensitive than H2A.X immunohistochemistry or the comet assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also worth noting in this context that irradiated WT mice had many more me2H3(K9) punctae in the DG than H2A.X-positive foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dissociation could also reflect differences in the sensitivity of the methods used to detect the alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may also suggest that, although me2H3(K9) is clearly related to the formation of DSBs, it also forms part of additional processes that are engaged by pathologically elevated A levels and -irradiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The finding that BRCA1 critically contributes to DSB repair in central neurons was unexpected, as BRCA1 is presumed to be involved primarily in DNA repair by homologous recombination, which is not known to occur physiologically in non-dividing cells; in mature neurons, DSBs appear to be repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to our knowledge, the role of BRCA1 in NHEJ has been studied only in mitotic cells, where it is important for the fidelity of the canonical NHEJ repair pathways11,53,54,55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRCA1 also participates in non-classical NHEJ pathway: microhomology-mediated end joining and alternative NHEJ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These pathways allow for genomic stability-conserving repair and require the functions of BRCA1 and 53BP1 (refs 56, 57, 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies are needed to determine the exact pathway(s) through which BRCA1 contributes to the repair of DSBs in mature post-mitotic neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Another intriguing question our study raises is whether mutations in BRCA1 that increase the risk for certain cancers by impairing DNA repair in highly proliferating cells9 also change the function of BRCA1 in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, unlike the AD-associated depletion of BRCA1 in ageing brains and the experimental knockdown strategy used here, BRCA1 mutations are present from early stages of embryonic development and thus, might allow for the compensatory implementation or activation of alternative DNA repair factors and mechanisms, at least in neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, BRCA1 is a complex protein that may have functions in the nervous system distinct from those it has in DNA repair and chromatin remodelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional studies are needed to address these possibilities and explore the therapeutic potential of enhancing DNA repair in AD and related conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
