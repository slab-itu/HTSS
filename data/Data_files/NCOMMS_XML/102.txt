The epigenomic landscape of African rainforest hunter-gatherers and farmers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The genetic history of African populations is increasingly well documented, yet their patterns of epigenomic variation remain uncharacterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the relative impacts of DNA sequence variation and temporal changes in lifestyle and habitat on the human epigenome remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we generate genome-wide genotype and DNA methylation profiles for 362 rainforest hunter-gatherers and sedentary farmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that the current habitat and historical lifestyle of a population have similarly critical impacts on the methylome, but the biological functions affected strongly differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, methylation variation associated with recent changes in habitat mostly concerns immune and cellular functions, whereas that associated with historical lifestyle affects developmental processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, methylation variationparticularly that correlated with historical lifestyleshows strong associations with nearby genetic variants that, moreover, are enriched in signals of natural selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work provides new insight into the genetic and environmental factors affecting the epigenomic landscape of human populations over time.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Africa is the birthplace of modern humans and a region of extensive genetic, cultural, environmental and phenotypic diversity1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over the past years, the increasing amounts of genomic data available have provided significant insight into African evolutionary history, including the origins of hunter-gatherers, population structure, and patterns of migration and admixture2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these studies have reported evidence of selection targeting gene functions related to the changes in environment, diet and exposure to infectious disease11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adding an additional layer of complexity, the study of epigenetic variation can inform the interplay between the environment and the genome, yet the epigenomic landscape of African populations remains unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DNA methylationan important epigenetic mark that serves as biomarker for variation in gene regulation12,13can be affected by both inherited DNA sequence variation and a broad range of environmental factors, such as nutrition, exposure to toxic pollutants and social environment14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accumulating evidence indicates that a substantial portion of DNA methylation variation is accounted for by genetic variation (methylation quantitative trait loci, meQTLs)16,18,19,20,21,22, which could affect methylation levels through impaired transcription factor (TF) binding12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the role of DNA methylation in gene regulation (active or passive) and the mechanisms involved remain controversial, DNA methylation data offer a rich source of information about ongoing gene activity, and thus it can provide insight into gene functions that contribute to phenotypic variation12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have shown that DNA methylation differences exist between major ethnic groups20,23,24,25, highlighting the potential contribution of epigenetic modifications to human phenotypic variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these studies have mostly compared urban populations of different continental ancestries, so the relative impacts of DNA sequence variation and temporal changes in lifestyle and habitat on the human DNA methylome remain unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The Central African belt provides an ideal setting in which to address this issue, as it hosts the worlds largest group of active hunter-gatherersthe rainforest hunter-gatherers (RHGs, traditionally known as pygmies)as well as populations that have adopted an agrarian lifestyle (AGRs) over the last 5,000 years26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to differing in their subsistence strategies, these two groups differ in other historical and recent aspects of their evolutionary history.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The historical factors relate to the differences in demography and habitat.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ancestors of the RHGs and AGRs diverged 60,000 years ago7,8,28,29,30 and subsequently experienced population contractions and expansions, respectively10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These groups have also historically occupied separate ecological habitatsthe ancestors of RHGs the equatorial rainforest while those of AGRs open spaces, such as savannah and grasslands27,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recent changes in the lifestyles and habitats of these groups are also apparent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many RHG groups still live in the rainforest as mobile bands, whereas AGR populations now occupy primarily rural or urban deforested areas, though some AGR groups have settled in the rainforest over the last millennia27,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, we define the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in blood of various populations of RHG and AGR inhabiting the Central African belt to first assess the degree of inter-population variation in DNA methylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then explore the genomic and functional features of differentially methylated genes to obtain insight into the putative phenotypes involved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we assess the contribution of genetic variation to the DNA methylation levels observed, and search for signals of positive selection targeting genetic variants associated with methylation variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we show that while both recent changes and historical differences in the habitat and lifestyle of RHG and AGR have had a critical impact on their patterns of DNA methylation variation, the biological functions affected strongly differ.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that DNA methylation variation that correlates with historical lifestyle shows strong associations with nearby genetic variants that, moreover, are enriched in signals of natural selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The integration of these results allow us to propose a comprehensive framework of how temporal differences in lifestyle and habitat, together with the genetic variation, have impacted the epigenomic landscape of human populations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Population samples and genetic structure', 'We investigated genome-wide genotype and DNA methylation data from a total of 362 individuals, including a group of RHGs (w-RHG, n=112), AGR groups occupying nearby urban deforested habitats (w-AGR, n=94), and an AGR group that lives and regularly practices hunting in a forested region (f-AGR, n=61) of the Gabon/Cameroon area (Fig 1a; Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To compare our results with an independent set of samples, we also studied RHGs and AGRs living in the eastern part of the Central African belt (e-RHG, n=47 and e-AGR, n=48, from Uganda).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first investigated the global genetic structure of the studied populations using genome-wide SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Principal component analysis (PCA) clearly reflected their history of population divergence7,8,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest differences were observed between RHG and AGR populations, regardless of their geographic location, followed by the more recent split between the western and eastern Central African RHG groups (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Study design and genetic structure of rainforest hunter-gatherers and farmers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Geographic location of the sampled rainforest hunter-gatherer (RHG) and farmer (AGR) populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Principal component analysis (PCA) of the genotype data for the study populations, based on 456,507 independent genome-wide SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tree presented at the top right of the panel represents the branching model for these populations7,8,28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Schematic representation of the different population comparisons, indicated by arrows, used for the detection of differentially methylated sites (DMS) between groups.Full size image', 'Table 1 Description of historical modes of subsistence and current habitat of populations in the study.Full size table', 'Processing genome-wide DNA methylation data', 'We characterized DNA methylation variation in whole blood-derived samples using the Illumina 450 K array, which interrogates more than 485,000 sites across the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After normalization and filtering, including the removal of probes containing genetic variants at a frequency higher than 1% in the populations studied, we retained 365,886 probes in 352 individuals (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples showed both high reproducibility and expected DNA methylation profiles across genomic regions, with sites near gene promoters being less methylated than those located in gene bodies and intergenic regions (Supplementary Note 1; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next sought to correct methylation values (M-values) for known biological and technical potential confounders, including gender, age and heterogeneity in blood cell composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus estimated ages for all samples, and compared predicted and declared ages for individuals in which chronological age was reliably ascertained (N=256, Pearsons R=0.84; Supplementary Fig 2; Supplementary Note 2), confirming the accuracy of the epigenetic clock model32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, we estimated the proportions of different blood cell types in all samples, using a predictive model based on a subset of DNA methylation probes33, which were removed from all subsequent analyses, yielding a final set of 365,401 probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These predicted values showed strong correlations with observed proportions of blood cell subtypes, which were determined in a subset of samples (N=66) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Pearsons R: 0.480.57; Supplementary Fig 3; Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, gender, estimated ages and cell subtype heterogeneity across populations were used to adjust M-values for all subsequent analyses, including PCA, the estimation of differentially methylated sites and the mapping of methylation quantitative trait loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Population differences in DNA methylation profiles', 'When performing PCA using all samples, while age and cell counts strongly correlated with the first 10 PCs using unadjusted M-values, the subsistence strategy (RHG versus AGR) and geographic location (western versus eastern Central Africa) of the populations were the only factors associated with the first 10 PCs using adjusted M-values (Supplementary Fig 4; Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of technical variables associated with differences in sample collection and DNA processing between the western and eastern African samples, one cannot entirely rule out that the observed geographic differences are due to technical factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the relationship between DNA methylation variation and differences in subsistence strategies and habitat, we thus performed all subsequent population comparisons within each geographic region separately.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We compared DNA methylation variation between populations differing in genetic background, historical lifestyle and current habitatthe RHG and AGR groups living in the rainforest and rural/urban areas, respectively (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PCA clearly separates the RHG and AGR groups on PC1, in both western (P=9.9 × 1015) and eastern (P=5.7 × 1011) Central Africa (Fig 2a,b;

Fig 2c), highlighting the important role of current habitat in determining global DNA methylation profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found 5,716 DMS (located across 3,550 genes) between the two groups, which we termed recent DMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The differential methylation in the same direction of 3,304 of these recent DMS (corresponding to 99% of the overlapping DMS, resampling P less_than 107; 2,146 genes) between the more distantly related w-RHG and w-AGR provided strong evidence in favour of the methylation status at these shared DMS being determined by recent changes in habitat independently of genotypic differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Focusing on populations with different historical lifestyles and genetic backgrounds but with the same current habitat (f-AGR and w-RHG in the Central African rainforest, Fig 1c), PCA also tended to separate the samples with respect to their population identity (PC1 P=2.4 × 105; Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found 4,049 DMS (located across 2,128 genes) between these groups, which we termed historical DMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, historical DMS presented larger absolute differences in mean DNA methylation levels between populations (||, using here -values instead of M-values, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34) than recent DMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the proportion of DMS for which || values are  greater than 5% was higher for historical than for recent DMS (P less_than 1016; Supplementary Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These historical DMS showed no significant overlap with the recent DMS described above (only 52 DMS were shared).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The set of historical DMS identified thus reflects DNA methylation variation related to the historical differences in lifestyle and habitat characterizing the RHG and AGR groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genomic features of differentially methylated regions', 'To understand the putative functional implications of DMS, we first localized them across distinct genomic regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that recent DMS were enriched in sites located in gene bodies and distal promoters, while historical DMS were preferentially located around the transcription start sites (TSS), 5-UTR (untranslated region) and first exon regions (Supplementary Fig 7a,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next mapped DMS to histone modification peaks from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as mapped by the ENCODE project35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that both recent and historical DMS mapped in excess to H3K4me1 modification peaks (32% for both DMS sets versus 20% expected) (Supplementary Fig 7b,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the recent DMS that were hypermethylated in f-AGR were further enriched in H3K4me3 peaks (57% versus 27%), while the historical DMS that were hypermethylated in w-RHG were enriched in H3K27me3 (32% versus 12%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we explored the colocalization of DMS with TF-binding sites (Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that recent DMS were significantly enriched in binding sites of TFs related to cell differentiation, proliferation and development, but also to immune regulation (NFIL3, IRF1 and GATA3), and fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism (HNF1A, RORA and NR1H2::RXRA) (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, historical DMS, particularly those that were hypermethylated in RHG, were preferentially overlapping binding sites of TF involved in developmental processes (TFAP2A and NHLH1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings indicate that recent and historical DMS not only represent independent sets, but also are located in distinct genomic regions that contain different TF-binding sites, suggesting that they are associated to regulatory features related to different biological functions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Biological functions of recent and historical DMS differ', 'We investigated the relevance of recent and historical DMS for explaining phenotypic diversity by exploring whether differentially methylated genes in each set were enriched in gene ontology categories or in genes reported to be associated with traits or diseases by genome-wide association studies (GWAS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that genes containing recent DMS were enriched in categories largely associated with immune response, hostpathogen interactions and various cellular processes (Fig 2e; Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistently, recent DMS genes were enriched in genes reported by GWAS (FDR-corrected resampling P less_than 8.1 × 103), including autoimmune disorders, such as vitiligo (20 genes associated versus 10.1 expected, P=0.045) and systemic lupus erythematosus (19 genes associated with versus 9.2 expected, P=0.028).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Conversely, genes overlapping historical DMS were enriched in functions almost exclusively related to developmental processes, including multicellular organismal development, anatomical structure development, or growth factor binding (Fig 2f; Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to recent DMS, historical DMS genes were not enriched in genes reported by GWAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also found that 1,302 historical DMS (699 genes) overlapped with the DMS detected in western (w-AGR versus w-RHG) and eastern (e-RHG versus e-AGR) comparisons, in the same direction (corresponding to 99% of the overlapping DMS, resampling P less_than 107), despite the splitting of the RHG groups 20,000 years ago8,28,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This common set of historical DMS was again enriched in functions primarily related to development (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus identified a gene set in which epigenomic variation reflected differences in the lifestyle and habitat, as well as in genetic background, of RHGs and AGRs, regardless of their geographic location.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Because recent DMS were found to be particularly enriched in functions related to immune processes, we next evaluated the extent to which potential variability in blood cell proportions, despite our adjustments for cell count heterogeneity (Supplementary Note 3), may still affect our findings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No major differences in immune cell counts were observed between the populations compared (Supplementary Fig 8; Supplementary Note 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, when using a filtered data set, in which we removed a set of 51,386 probes that have been shown to correlate with cell counts by an independent study36, we found that the biological functions associated with recent and historical DMS clearly differed and were primarily associated with hostpathogen interactions/cellular processes and development, respectively (Supplementary Table 5; Supplementary Note 4), confirming the results obtained using the global data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic contribution to DNA methylation variation', 'To assess the contribution of genetic variation to the DNA methylation levels, we mapped meQTLs, focusing our analyses on SNPs located in cis within a 200-kb window around the target site (Methods; Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified 45,916 DNA methylation sites (13% of all sites) associated with a nearby meQTL, in at least one population, with a FDR set to 1%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The majority of meQTLs (90%) were shared across populations, with only 1,283 and 500 meQTLs detected exclusively in the RHG and AGR groups, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such extensive sharing of meQTLs reflects the closer genetic proximity of the populations studied here and the use of a different cellular model, with respect to previous studies23,25 (Supplementary Fig 10; Supplementary Table 6; Supplementary Note 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next tested the potential enrichment of differentially methylated regions in associations with genotype variants, with respect to all DNA methylation sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a moderate enrichment in DMS characterizing the western (16%, (odds ratio) OR=1.5, s.e.=0.02; resampling P less_than 107) and eastern comparisons (12%, OR=1.1, s.e.=0.02; resampling P=1.2 × 102), where populations differ in both historical and recent lifestyles and habitats (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, historical DMS were strongly enriched in meQTLs (30%, OR=3.5, s.e.=0.03; resampling P less_than 107), whereas recent DMS were depleted in these associations (9%, OR=0.80, s.e.=0.05; resampling P less_than 107).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings were replicated using the filtered data set (Supplementary Note 4), indicating that the potential presence of blood cell heterogeneity is unlikely to account for these observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Contribution of genetic variation to the DNA methylation levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Proportion of methylation sites that are associated with a nearby genetic variant (in grey) and among different DMS sets (in colour).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The numbers in the bars correspond to the total number of DMS per population comparison.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P values were calculated by resampling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Proportion of the variance of DNA methylation explained by nearby genetic variants (R2) for the various meQTL sets, in each population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The P values (MannWhitney U-test) obtained indicate a significant skew in the R2 distribution of the various meQTLDMS sets (in colour) with respect to that of all meQTLs (in grey) in the corresponding population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R2 values are higher for meQTLs associated with historical DMS (11.5% (10.712.3%) and 10.0% (8.911.2%) in w-RHG and f-AGR, respectively) than for those related to recent DMS (6.5% (5.77.2%) and 6.8% (6.17.4%) in w-AGR and f-AGR, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NS, not significant, *P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01, ***P less_than 0.001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (cf) Examples of meQTLs detected in this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The three boxplots on the left represent the distribution of M-values as a function of genotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The minor allele frequency of each meQTL is presented for each population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Red lines indicate the fitted linear regression model for M-value  genotype for each population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The forest plots on the right represent the estimated , corresponding to the slope of the linear regression, for each population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ce) meQTLs detected in all populations but presenting different allelic frequencies between RHG and AGR groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean FST values between w-RHG and f-AGR/w-AGR groups for the SNPs concerned were higher (0.15, 0.19 and 0.10, respectively) than that observed genome wide (FST less_than 0.03).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Population-specific meQTL, where the SNP rs1534362 is associated with methylation differences in the enhancer region at 6p12.3 only in RHGs.Full size image', 'We also found that the proportions of DMS associated with meQTLs were systematically higher in historical than in recent DMS, irrespective of the mean differences in DNA methylation levels between populations (Supplementary Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the proportion of the variance of DNA methylation accounted for by meQTLs (R2) was higher for meQTLs associated with historical DMS (11%) than for meQTLs related to recent DMS (6.6%), the R2 values obtained being significantly higher and lower, respectively, than for all meQTLs (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with all our previous observations, historical DMS were more strongly associated with genotypic differences, which had also a larger effect, than the remaining sets of DMS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Two scenarios can explain the observed associations between historical DMS and DNA sequence variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the large majority of cases (96%), DNA methylation differences were accounted for by meQTLs detected in all populations but with differences in allelic frequency between the RHG and AGR groups (Fig 3ce;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Dissecting the means by which populations have responded, and conceivably adapted, to environmental cues associated with changes in subsistence strategies and ecological habitats is key to understand the mechanisms underlying natural phenotypic variation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies of genetic adaptation of African populations, including hunter-gatherers such as pygmies, Hadza, Sandawe and San, have detected selection signals in genes related to morphology, diet and immune response, and shown that most of these signals are unique to each population group1,5,7,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies have increased our knowledge of how populations might have genetically adapted to their respective environments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the impact that temporal changes in subsistence strategies and habitat, together with genetic diversity, have on epigenetic variation remains unexplored, despite it can inform about additional mechanisms of human responses to environmental challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings show that recent and historical changes in habitat and lifestyle have both critical impacts on DNA methylation variation, with differences in the functions affected and the degree of genetic control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'One possible limitation of our study is the measurement of DNA methylation from whole blood36, which could reflect population differences in the abundance of cell types, particularly when it comes to compare populations being exposed to different environmental challenges (that is, those used to detect recent DMS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a diverse set of environmental factors, including air pollution, exposure to carcinogens and socioeconomic status, have been shown to affect DNA methylation in blood cells16,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Environmental variables can also alter blood cell proportions, but it remains unclear whether changes in DNA methylation are the cause or the consequence of such cellular patterns15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we cannot completely rule out a partial effect of cell composition, we adopted stringent measures to control for it (Supplementary Notes 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These analyses support the conclusion that variability in blood cell subtypes should not have a major effect on our findings (for example, replication of both the differences in biological functions between recent and historical DMS and enrichment in genetic control of historical DMS), and suggest a series of important biological implications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, we show that recent changes in habitat, such as those experienced by agriculturalist populations living in urban/rural areas or in the rainforest, can substantially alter the methylome of genetically homogeneous populations, indicating that most of their divergence in DNA methylation is unlikely to be explained by underlying genetic differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such epigenetic alterations affect principally immune functions and processes involved in hostpathogen interactions and cellular metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with previous findings based on gene expression variation in Moroccan populations, where immunity is the most altered function in urban populations, as compared with rural and nomadic groups45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also find that differentially methylated regions between urban and forest-based farmers are particularly enriched in genes associated with autoimmune disorders, suggesting that urbanization likely has an influence on susceptibility to immunity-related disorders, as previously hypothesized for allergies and inflammatory bowel disease46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown, highlighting the need of additional studies of DNA methylation variation using purified cell types and tissues, our results suggest functional links between DNA methylation variation and environmentally triggered phenotypes, owing to a combination of biotic, abiotic and cultural factors associated with increasing urbanization and modern lifestyles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Second, when comparing rainforest hunter-gatherers and farmers who share the same forest environmenta setting that minimizes the effects that recent environmental changes have had on methylationwe find that DNA methylation differences related to historical factors mostly reside in genes with functions in developmental processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, such differences in DNA methylation profiles are strongly associated with nearby genetic variants, the frequency of which differs between hunter-gatherer and farmer groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the case, for example, for meQTLs in genes such as IGF2BP2, HOXC6 and ZNF492 (Fig 3ce), which have been associated with height, age at menarche, type-2 diabetes, bone mineral density and genediet interactions48,49,50,51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observe cases of population-specific effects of DNA methylation variation, such as that of the 6p12.3 enhancer region that was hypomethylated in rainforest hunter-gatherers and under genetic control only in this group (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our analyses identify a gene set showing extensive methylation differences between human groups that started to diverge at least 45,000 years agoa division corresponding to the second deepest divergence among African populations7,8,28,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In specific cases, we provide a link between DNA methylation variation, genetic diversity and phenotypic traits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the SNP-meQTL detected for IGF2BP2 (Fig 3c), as well as those detected at nine other loci, have been directly identified as presenting the strongest association signals for various phenotypes, including height, by GWAS (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In doing so, our study motivates further work to understand the mechanistic links between the patterns of epigenetic variation observed and the extensive phenotypic diversity characterizing African populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Third, we show that genetic variants associated with DNA methylation variation are enriched in signals of positive selection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  That these signals appear to be more pronounced among agriculturalist populations, both in the western and eastern settings, suggests the occurrence of increased local adaptation targeting regulatory variation in these human groups.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One of the most iconic phenotypes distinguishing rainforest hunter-gatherers and farmers is small body size26, the genetic and adaptive bases of which are increasingly recognized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent studies have reported several independent loci with adaptive alleles that appear to correlate with height, supporting a scenario of convergent evolution related to the African Pygmy phenotype5,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the candidate loci proposed, the CISHMAPKAPK3DOCK3 region in chromosome 3 presents both signals of selection and association with height40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, genetic variation at DOCK3 has been associated with height in Europeans52 and, together with CISH, which is involved in the human growth hormone pathway, presents a suggestive association in a combined RHGAGR sample40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, variants of CISH have been associated with susceptibility to infectious disease, including tuberculosis and malaria, in several African populations53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, we find that CISH, MAPKAPK3 and DOCK3 are differentially methylated between populations, owing to meQTLs that show strong population differentiation between rainforest hunter-gatherers and farmers (FST=0.170.23, with longer branch lengths among RHG, among the 5% highest of the genome).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, the height-associated SNP rs16860216 at IGF2BP2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52), which we also find to control methylation variation, presents strong allele frequency differences between groups (FST=0.15, with longer branch length among AGR, among the 5% highest of the genome).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these results provide new insight into how DNA methylation variation might have participated, through its association with genetic variants, to adaptive phenotypes, including the Pygmy phenotype, broadening our understanding of hunter-gatherer and farmer evolutionary ecology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, this study substantially increases our understanding of the relative impacts that population genetic variation and differences in lifestyles and ecologies have on the human epigenome, and illustrates the utility of DNA methylation as a marker to track variation in regulatory activity following environmental change.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our findings suggest that populations can initially respond to environmental challenges via epigenetic changes, uncoupled from variation in the DNA sequence, with the adaptive phenotype increasingly being achieved via genetic changes as time passes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus provide a basis for further experimental and theoretical studies assessing the role of epigenetic mechanisms in human adaptation over different time scales.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
