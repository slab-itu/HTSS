Mapping synaptic glutamate transporter dysfunction in vivo to regions surrounding A plaques by iGluSnFR two-photon imaging  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Amyloid- (A) plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimers disease (AD), are surrounded by regions of neuronal and glial hyperactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use in vivo two-photon and wide-field imaging of the glutamate sensor iGluSnFR to determine whether pathological changes in glutamate dynamics in the immediate vicinity of A deposits in APPPS1 transgenic mice could alter neuronal activity in this microenvironment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In regions close to A plaques chronic states of high spontaneous glutamate fluctuations are observed and the timing of glutamate responses evoked by sensory stimulation exhibit slower decay rates in two cortical brain areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GLT-1 expression is reduced around A plaques and upregulation of GLT-1 expression and activity by ceftriaxone partially restores glutamate dynamics to values in control regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the toxic microenvironment surrounding A plaques results, at least partially, from enhanced glutamate levels and that pharmacologically increasing GLT-1 expression and activity may be a new target for early therapeutic intervention.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and, with no cure available, it imposes a major burden on society.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The pathological hallmarks of AD include the extracellular accumulation of amyloid plaques and intracellular protein inclusions known as neurofibrillary tangles1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Positron emission tomography imaging using Pittsburgh compound B has shown that cerebral A plaque deposition is an early and predictive marker for the progression of preclinical to symptomatic AD5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent publications have revealed many interesting aspects of cell dysfunction in relation to A deposits7,8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A current working hypothesis is that soluble A adheres and combines with resident A plaques leading to progressive plaque growth13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although plaques consist of insoluble A, each plaque may create a toxic microenvironment because soluble species continuously bind and unbind from its surface7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The toxic microenvironment hypothesis is supported by observations of neuronal dysfunction and decreased spine density in the immediate regions surrounding A plaques15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, hyperactive neurons, microglia and astrocytes with elevated intracellular calcium levels have been reported in the close proximity of A plaques9,10,12,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A shortcoming of the amyloid cascade hypothesis is that there are no clear connections between the onset of plaque deposition and the progression of cognitive impairment and neuronal loss19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there are stronger correlations with the levels of soluble A species21,22,23 and cognitive impairment as well as neuronal loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study we investigated whether changes in glutamate dynamics in the microenvironment surrounding A deposits could contribute to neuronal dysfunction preceding the onset of neuronal death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may establish an early link between A toxicity and neuronal dysfunction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A genetically encoded fluorescent glutamate indicator, iGluSnFR, was used to detect the presence and time course of glutamate dynamics in vivo with two-photon and wide-field fluorescence microscopy24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It allows for unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution of local glutamate concentration on a subsecond timescale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rapid glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft, principally by the astrocyte glutamate transporter excitatory amino-acid transporter 2 (EAAT2 in humans or the homologue glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) in mice)25 permits precise and fast synaptic transmission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Impairment of glutamate clearance in the extracellular space in AD26,27,28 might underlie the reported upregulation of Ca2+signalling in neurons and astrocytes in the microenvironment of A deposits and could contribute to excitotoxicity, which eventually leads to cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EAAT-2 activity has been reported to be significantly reduced in early stages of AD correlating well with cognitive decline in AD patients29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, studies of a heterozygous GLT-1 knockdown in an AD mouse model showed exacerbated cognitive decline further supporting the theory that dysfunction of the astrocyte glutamate transporter is involved in AD pathogenesis30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent in vitro results suggest that A species are responsible for the loss of GLT-1 expression as a part of their toxicity to astrocytes32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we treated APPPS1 mice with ceftriaxone to determine whether GLT-1 expression and/or transporter activity could be upregulated around plaques and whether this would restore normal glutamate dynamics in this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that ceftriaxone helps to partially restore glutamate dynamics and chronically elevated levels of glutamate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it reduces the pathological impact of A deposits and surrounding prefibrillary forms of A.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Wide-field imaging of glutamate dynamics', 'We first ensured that changes in iGluSnFR fluorescence in mouse brains injected with iGluSnFR (Fig 1a) were due to evoked synaptic release by examining the transient changes in fluorescent intensity evoked by visual or hindlimb stimulation (APPPS1 mice n=9; wild-type (WT) mice n=9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b shows iGluSnFR expression in the hindlimb area of the somatosensory cortex.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The complete cranial window (Fig 1c, 3.5 mm diameter) was used to analyse the stimulus-evoked signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Wide-field imaging of the prestimulus baseline controls followed by the increase in iGluSnFR fluorescence on hindlimb stimulation and subsequent recovery to baseline levels is shown in Fig 1df.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The respective trace of the alterations in F/F0 shows a clear increase on stimulation of the hindlimb (Fig 1g, for video see Supplementary Video 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Wide-field imaging of glutamate dynamics do not show significant changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Intracortical injection of AAV.hSynapsin.iGluSnFR in somatosensory cortex area coding for hindlimb (n=9 transgene positive animals, 7 age-matched WT animals) followed by a cranial window surgery and mechanical hindlimb stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Animals were head fixed and anaesthetized with isoflurane (1%) during imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Pattern of iGluSnFR expression in the somatosensory cortex after viral injection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The complete cranial window (3.5 mm diameter) was used for the analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A stimulus-locked response was detected on hindlimb stimulation (e) with baseline levels shown before and after stimulation (d,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The respective trace of F/F also displaying the response on stimulation is shown in g.

A plaque (ROI4), which was not significantly different from the responses detected in WT animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (s) A significant difference in the area under the response between ROI3 and ROI4 was detected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No difference for the area under the response was found when comparing ROI4 with WT animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (tv) The decay rates of glutamate calculated for ROIs 3 and 4, as

magnitude of signal fluctuations at each pixel over time and by calculating the root mean square (r.m.s.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of the iGluSnFR signals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alterations in r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  signals representing glutamate fluctuations in different regions around the plaques were compared and r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  variations are illustrated as colour-coded heat maps (Fig 2ik,m,n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  R.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  heat maps from APPPS1 animals in imaging locations adjacent to plaques show clear regional differences (Fig 2k,m,n).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The highest fluctuations in glutamate dynamics and thus the highest average r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  were measured in the direct vicinity of the plaque (within a distance of 20 m from the outer edge of the plaque, Fig 2k,m,n) indicating that the r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  signals are greater the closer the region is to the plaque border.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This region also exhibited the highest values within the obtained r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  maps and iGluSnFR fluctuations of F/F0 indicating the highest spontaneous glutamate levels (Fig 2m,o).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to these local alterations in glutamate dynamics, WT animals display a low and relatively homogeneous average r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  throughout the imaged field of view (Fig 2i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that no prolonged presence of extracellular glutamate transients could be detected in WT animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, when spontaneous glutamate fluctuations were imaged over time at locations in APPPS1 mice in which there were no amyloid deposits, a low and homogeneous average r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  was measured, similar to that observed in WT animals (Fig 2j).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the largest dynamic changes in spontaneous glutamate concentrations are locally restricted to areas adjacent to amyloid deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Glutamate transients evoked by sensory stimulation also showed marked differences in the regions close to amyloid deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hindlimb stimulation evoked a transient glutamate signal from synaptic release that had similar characteristics in somatosensory cortex in WT mice and in APPPS1 mice in regions distant from plaques (compare ROI4 with WT in Fig 2o,u).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary lower amplitude glutamate peak observed broadly in the wide-field imaging was not usually apparent in two-photon imaging around plaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source of this difference is unknown but might be caused by imaging different volumes of tissue as mentioned in the Methods section.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to ensure that the differences between wide-field imaging and tplsm were not due to the difference in scan speed we selected a smaller region of 16 × 128 pixels to reach a scan speed of 57 Hz.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found no differences in the rate of glutamate decay, r.m.s., area under the response or maximum response in comparison with the slower scan speed of 5.92 Hz (Supplementary Fig 2AF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the response curves also only show one primary response peak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Discrete regions of interest (ROI) at increasing distances from the boundary of methoxy_X04-stained A plaques were analysed separately to characterize the response alterations with respect to the distance from the plaque.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greatest fluctuations in spontaneous glutamate transients quantified as r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  were observed in ROI1 in comparison with all other ROIs (Fig 2p).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, hindlimb stimulation did not evoke glutamate transients in ROI1 or 2, whereas time-locked transients were observed in ROI3 and ROI4 (Fig 2o,r,t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude the possibility that a stimulus-evoked response of glutamate is hidden in the high fluctuation in ROI1, the hindlimb stimulation was repeated using 100 trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The average r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  of F/F was still significantly higher in ROI1 in comparison with all other ROIs and the mean of all measured glutamate traces still did not result in a stimulus-locked response in ROIs 1 and 2 (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the high degree of spontaneous glutamate dynamics measured as r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  signals in ROI1 was likely due to chronic but spontaneous elevations in glutamate within this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we measured the baseline fluorescence of iGluSnFR in ROI1 and 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ROI1 showed significantly higher baseline fluorescence in comparison with ROI4 supporting the hypothesis that the detected fluctuations are the result of chronically higher levels of glutamate (Fig 2q).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first stimulus-locked response was detected in ROI3 that is located 4060 m from the edge of a given amyloid deposit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum stimulation-evoked glutamate response in ROI3 was lower and the area under the response was larger than in ROI4 (Fig 2r,s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, ROI4 did not show any significant differences in these parameters in comparison with WT animals (=0.28 s, s.e.m.=0.02; Fig 2r,s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characteristic decay time constant (tau) of the stimulation-evoked glutamate response decay in ROI3 (=0.66 s, s.e.m.=0.04) was significantly slower from the response obtained in ROI4 (=0.23 s, s.e.m.=0.02; Fig 2t).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The decay time constant in ROI4 (80100 m plaque distance) did not differ from that of WT (Fig 2u).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the characteristics of the sensory stimulation-evoked glutamate transients progressively changed closer to the plaque until evoked signals were lost in ROI1 and 2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increased decay time constant (tau) of the iGluSnFR signal in ROI3 versus the more distal ROI4 (Fig 2t,v) suggested that glutamate transients were prolonged and clearance reduced within this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly demonstrate that the characteristics of glutamate dynamics varied depending on distance from the plaque.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is important to note that even in the negative animals the iGluSnFR response to stimulation is not uniform throughout the field of view even in the region of the peak response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, to ensure that the observed local differences in the pattern of the responses was not obtained simply by chance due to the non-uniform nature of the iGluSnFR signal we randomly generated a position to serve as the plaque location and placed the four ROIs at the correct distance from the plaque location on transgene negative animal recordings (also chosen at random from amongst our data set).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process was repeated for 500 artificial plaque locations and the ROI responses were then averaged (Supplementary Fig 4D, n=9 animals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We measured the average responses in all ROIs and found no difference between the maximum response amplitudes or the decay constants between ROIs (Supplementary Fig 4B,C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis demonstrates that plaques are indeed surrounded by ROIs with altered response amplitudes and decay times in APPPS1 animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The observed spontaneous and stimulus-evoked fluctuations of extracellular glutamate might also cause fluctuations of intracellular calcium concentrations in neurons in close proximity to amyloid deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this hypothesis, we combined glutamate and calcium recordings by co-expressing iGluSnFR with the red calcium indicator jRGECO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-excitation of the two reporters was possible using an excitation wavelength of 950 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  iGluSnFR responses to hindlimb stimulation remained similar in the combined experiment and are shown in Supplementary Fig 5D (n=3 animals, 34 imaged brain regions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again no stimulus-locked iGluSnFR responses were observed in ROI1 or ROI2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The return to baseline of the signal in ROI3 is notably longer than ROI4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Calcium transients recorded in the same field of view simultaneously with the iGluSnFR signal showed responding cells (somas) in all regions (Supplementary Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such sensory-evoked calcium signals have been reported by others7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it should be noted that the lowest proportion of responding cells was observed in ROI1 and that the fraction of responding somas increased with increasing distance from the plaque.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We counted the numbers of responding versus non-responding cells and grouped them into four groups corresponding to the distances of ROIs 14 based on the distance between the plaque and the soma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is shown in Supplementary Fig 5E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ROI1 20% of cells responded compared with 65% in ROI4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Glutamate dynamics around A plaques in awake APPPS1', 'We examined the characteristics of glutamate release evoked by sensory stimulation in awake animals to ensure that alterations in glutamate uptake around amyloid deposits were not due to anaesthesia (APPPS1 mice n=7, WT mice=7; 37 brain areas per mouse).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examined the visual cortex in awake animals, as this would avoid interfering signals from constant limb movement, which would obscure somatosensory stimulation-evoked changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tplsm of iGluSnFR was repeated in the primary visual cortex of awake state APPPS1 and WT controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Light stimulation was used to evoke glutamate transients in the visual cortex and the same analysis that was done in the somatosensory cortex was repeated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar disruptions in glutamate dynamics were observed close to A plaques even though larger maximum responses to stimulation and higher r.m.s.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  values of F/F0 were observed in awake

from visual stimulation at increasing distances from a given amyloid deposit (Fig 3fj, ROIs 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum response (Fig 3h) and the smallest area under curve of the stimulation-evoked response (Fig 3i) were again measured in ROI4 and were not significantly different to data from WT animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ROI3 displayed a smaller maximum response and a significantly larger area under the peak response in comparison with ROI4 or WT animals (Fig 3h,i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, changes in decay constant were observed such that in ROI3 (=0.64 s, s.e.m.=0.07) there was a significantly longer decay constant of the iGluSnFR signal in comparison with ROI4 (=0.25 s, s.e.m.=0.07) or WT animals (=0.14 s, s.e.m.=0.03; Fig 3jl).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results provide a clear insight into a synaptic mechanism contributing to disturbances in glutamate signalling in a model of AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tplsm imaging of extracellular glutamate dynamics detected using iGluSnFR revealed impaired glutamate uptake from somatosensory or visual evoked responses in regions adjacent to visualized A plaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These synaptically evoked glutamate transients showed reduced glutamate clearance rates close to amyloid deposits, and chronic states of prolonged and elevated glutamate levels were detected in the direct vicinity of amyloid plaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The regions adjacent to plaques also showed reduced expression of the major glutamate transporter, GLT-1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Treatment of APPPS1 mice with ceftriaxone restored GLT-1 expression in the plaque microenvironment almost to control levels and the plaque-associated disturbances in glutamate clearance leading to chronically elevated glutamate concentration were significantly reduced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that A plaques are correlated to a regional reduction and dysfunction of GLT-1 that causes impaired glutamate clearance rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Functional changes to glutamate dynamics and thus possibly GLT-1 activity were detected and rescued at a distance of 4060 m (ROI3) from the A plaque edge by ceftriaxone treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that mechanisms unrelated to overall protein levels, such as the dysfunction or mislocalization of GLT-1, may also contribute to the observed pathological alterations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detailed mechanistic insights thus remain to be investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, alterations to glutamate signalling could be an important contributor to synaptic disruption and cognitive impairment in early AD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and the rapid kinetics of release and clearance from the extracellular space are critical for precisely timed synaptic communication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The principal pathway for glutamate clearance is uptake via the GLT-1 pathway that is expressed in astrocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uptake by astrocytes is essential for glutamate homeostasis that, when disrupted, leads to high levels of glutamate in the extracellular space causing neuronal excitotoxicity and cell dysfunction11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reduction of EAAT2 (the human homologue of GLT-1) activity in the early stages of AD has been reported to be correlated with the cognitive decline seen in AD patients29, and studies of heterozygous GLT-1 knockdown mouse models of AD showed exacerbated cognitive decline30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we re-visited this potential therapeutic candidate with improved scientific methods providing real-time measurements of extracellular glutamate dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'APPPS1 mice develop amyloid plaques by 2 months of age in the neocortex and A42 levels are at least five times higher than those of A40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Though they are associated with neuronal dystrophy and robust astro-and microgliosis42 an overall or plaque-associated loss of neurons could not be shown in APPPS1 mice43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our findings and those of others suggest that we are looking at an early stage of dysfunction in various cell types in the microenvironment of amyloid deposits in this mouse model rather than a model for neuronal loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes the APPPS1 model a valuable tool to mimic early stages in AD in which detrimental downstream events can still be rescued.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that the soluble material, known to be mainly A42 in the case of APPPS1 mice, is present in relatively high concentrations in the microenvironment of amyloid deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our staining results with hFTAA support this hypothesis since prefibrillar forms of A were detected in the microenvironment of A deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is likely that these known toxic oligomeric species of A contribute to the reported alterations in in vivo glutamate dynamics as has previously been shown in acute brain slice experiments44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To examine alterations in glutamate dynamics in APPPS1 transgenic mice we assessed region-specific alterations in relation to plaque deposition in vivo using anaesthetized and awake animals in wide field and tplsm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our data show that glutamate dynamics are changed in regions surrounding plaques, and the degree of change increases the closer the tissue is to the edge of the plaque.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time constant of glutamate clearance rates is slower when approaching amyloid deposits, and chronic states of high, fluctuating glutamate concentrations are reached in the direct vicinity of amyloid plaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we investigated whether there was a reduction in GLT-1 expression that could lead to a reduction of glutamate reuptake in this area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Histological staining of GLT-1 showed a significant reduction in the immediate vicinity of amyloid deposits adding evidence to the imaging data that the chronically higher levels of glutamate within ROI1 are due to a reduction in glutamate uptake.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other mechanisms unrelated to overall protein levels of GLT-1 such as receptor dysfunction were investigated by using iGluSnFR as a functional read-out.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beta-lactam antibiotic, ceftriaxone has been widely used to upregulate GLT-1 transporters up to fivefold and also has been shown to alter GLT-1 function and activity independent of overall protein levels34,37,40,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus aimed at reversing higher extracellular glutamate levels and slower glutamate decay rates by increasing glutamate reuptake via GLT-1 transporters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatment of APPPS1 animals with ceftriaxone resulted in an increase in GLT-1 in histological staining in ROI1 and a partial rescue of the observed glutamate alterations measured by tplsm of iGluSnFR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The treatment reduced the prolonged decay rates in ROI3 significantly to levels comparable to those in ROI4 and WT animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence we conclude that glutamate dynamics were restored within this region by the treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though we could not detect a stimulus-locked response in ROI1, we were able to reduce the high average glutamate fluctuations in the direct plaque vicinity to WT levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The continued lack of a stimulus-locked response in ROI1 might be caused by neuronal dysfunction, which is already also prevalent within this area7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that a large number of neurons (up to 50%) in the primary visual cortex can display functional impairment without obvious behavioural deficits in transgenic mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This hints towards possible compensatory mechanisms that are able to sustain physiological activities even in circuits that contain a large number of dysfunctional neurons7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is thus important to note that when using wide-field imaging to record glutamate dynamics on a more global level no significant differences between APPPS1 and WT animals were found (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This comparison indicates that the changes are very region specific and subtle and will be lost if not analysed with the necessary spatial resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, Zumkehr et al.32 conducted behavioural tests in 3xTg-AD mice after ceftriaxone treatment of 2 months and found a significant cognitive improvement in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall, these findings point towards a contribution of high glutamate concentrations to the reported excitotoxic microenvironment surrounding amyloid deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High levels of extracellular glutamate could mediate the reported upregulation of Ca2+signalling and overall hyperactivity in the microenvironment of A deposits and could contribute to the progressive synaptic disruption and cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, early changes in glutamate dynamics could be used to detect the early development of detrimental excitotoxic downstream effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, studies in patients would require spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to determine changes in the environment around plaques.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary we could show that changes in glutamate dynamics in the early stages of AD are part of a dysfunctional microenvironment that is directly linked to plaque deposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though we cannot conclude that higher levels of glutamate precede hyperactive states in different cell types it certainly contributes to the overall pathomechanism and excitotoxic effects described in the microenvironment of amyloid deposits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It could thus be used as a novel biomarker to indicate cellular dysfunction aiming at early intervention that has the potential to stop or delay detrimental downstream effects caused by excitotoxicity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

decreased the resolution of the image to gain scanning speed, which was necessary to track changes in relative glutamate fluorescence on sensory stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our tplsm was always performed at the same depth and thus only detected signals generated in layer 2/3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To image the area of maximum evoked responses using tplsm all animals were mapped with wide-field imaging before tplsm data acquisition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The area of the highest response was marked by using surface vasculature, which was subsequently easily identifiable using a low-magnification objective on the tplsm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This way we ensured that the responses that were detected with tplsm came from the primary response area seen in wide-field imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',
