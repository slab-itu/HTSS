Edge mixing dynamics in graphene pn junctions in the quantum Hall regime  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Massless Dirac electron systems such as graphene exhibit a distinct half-integer quantum Hall effect, and in the bipolar transport regime co-propagating edge states along the pn junction are realized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, these edge states are uniformly mixed at the junction, which makes it a unique structure to partition electrons in these edge states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although many experimental works have addressed this issue, the microscopic dynamics of electron partition in this peculiar structure remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we performed shot-noise measurements on the junction in the quantum Hall regime as well as at zero magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, in sharp contrast with the zero-field case, the shot noise in the quantum Hall regime is finite in the bipolar regime, but is strongly suppressed in the unipolar regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation is consistent with the theoretical prediction and gives microscopic evidence that the edge states are uniquely mixed along the pn junction.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Quantum Hall (QH) edge states are an ideal platform to investigate how chirality manifests itself in electron transport.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have been extensively studied in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEG) in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures, where electronic beam splitters1,2 and interferometers3,4 were demonstrated by using circulating edge states.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to the conventional conductance measurement, the shot noise was measured in these studies to microscopically address the edge transport, as it provide information on how electrons are transmitted or reflected at potential barriers; for example, those formed by quantum point contacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By virtue of the sensitivity of the shot noise to this partitioning process, researchers have clarified several fundamental facts about the edge states, such as the fermionic properties of electrons1 and the unique elementary excitation in the fractional QH regime5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as shown in Fig 1a, only a specific chirality can be realized in a conventional 2DEG at a given direction of the magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Edge states in the unipolar and bipolar regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Behaviour of the QH edge states at a junction is schematically shown for the conventional 2DEG case or for the unipolar graphene case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The edge state in the left region and right region circulates in the same direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Behaviour of the QH edge states in the bipolar graphene junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The edges counter-circulate in the n and p regions and co-propagate along the junction10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shot noise reveals how the edges mix along the junction.Full size image', "Graphene7,8 is now providing new insight into edge transport; reflecting the massless Dirac electrons and the resulting half-integer QH state, both edge chiralities can coexist in a single graphene device when p and n regions are formed there (namely, the bipolar regime).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In reality, the lateral pn junctions shown in Fig 1b are realized in locally gated graphene, and the unique QH edge transport was clarified experimentally9 and theoretically10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It was found in the bipolar regime that the QH edge transport at the junction shows a peculiar fractional quantized conductance in the units of conductance quantum e2/h, where h is Planck's constant9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exotic observation was phenomenologically attributed to the peculiar electron partition caused by uniform mixing of the QH edge states that co-propagate along the pn junction9,10, which has been supported by intensive experimental works11,12,13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, shot-noise measurements could directly provide a deeper insight into the microscopic dynamics of the electron partition process on the pn junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theory predicted that the noise is expected to be finite in the bipolar regime, whereas it should disappear in the unipolar regime10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments in this direction, however, have been lacking so far.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ", 'Here we present noise measurements in graphene pn junctions in the QH regime and at zero magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The shot noise in the QH regime is finite in the bipolar regime, but is strongly suppressed in the unipolar regime, contrasting sharply with the zero-field case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The deduced Fano factors are consistent with the theoretical prediction10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observation unveils the microscopic partition dynamics of electrons in co-propagating QH edge states along pn junctions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Experimental set-up', 'Using the conventional exfoliation method18, we fabricated a monolayer graphene device.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A back-gate electrode is used to tune the carrier density of the whole area, whereas a top-gate electrode can locally tune the density, so that a pn junction is formed there9,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The insulating layer for the top gate is a crosslinked polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)17,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optical picture of the device is shown in the upper panel of Fig 2a, while the lower panel of Fig 2a represents the one before deposition of the metallic electrodes on graphene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen from the picture, the length of the junction is 9.6 m.

centre of each resistance plateau.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red circles and blue circles in Fig 3c are the typical SI as a function of the bias voltage Vsd at (Vtg, Vbg)=(2.5 V, 4 V) and (0.5 V, 16 V), which correspond to (tg, bg)=(6, 2) and (2, 2), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SI is defined as the excess noise, where the thermal noise is already subtracted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While the noise at (tg, bg)=(6, 2) (bipolar regime) shows the V-shaped behaviour characteristic of shot noise, the noise at (tg, bg)=(2, 2) (unipolar regime) is strongly suppressed to zero, regardless of Vsd.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, there is a fundamental difference in the transport mechanism between the unipolar and bipolar regimes, which cannot clearly be seen by just looking at the source-drain voltage dependence of the differential resistance (Supplementary Fig 2 and Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of the shot noise directly indicates that there is no partition process in the unipolar regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reflects the fact that some edge states are connected to both reservoirs, while the others are coupled to only one of the reservoirs as shown in Fig 1a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the finite shot noise in the bipolar regime is a signature of peculiar partition in this regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is a microscopic evidence of an intermode scattering at the junction (shown in Fig 1b) as theoretically proposed10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Fano factors in QH regime', 'To be more quantitative, we deduce the Fano factor F from SI on each resistance plateau by using the following relation20:', '', "where kB and T are the Boltzmann constant and the electron temperature of the device, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Fano factor was extracted with a precision of ±0.01, unless specifically stated otherwise.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the numerical fitting to this equation of the data at (tg, bg)=(6, 2) is shown in a solid red curve in Fig 3c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clearly, equation (1) reproduces well the experimental result with F=0.18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental Fano factors obtained in the same way are compiled in Fig 4a as a function of tg and bg.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the experimental results and theoretical predictions of the two-terminal resistance are also compiled in Fig 4c,d, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The values of Vtg and Vbg where we performed the noise measurement are given in Supplementary Fig 3, Supplementary Table I and Supplementary Note 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the unipolar regime, the obtained Fano factors are F=0.00, 0.00, 0.02 and 0.07 at (tg,bg)=(2, 2), (2, 2), (2, 6) and (2, 6), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Except the (2, 6) case, which is also well below 0.1, the observed values are very close to zero.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This absence of shot noise directly proves that the transport at the junction is dissipation-less in the unipolar regime10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result also guarantees that the shot noise between the graphene and the contacts, if any, would have no influence on the shot noise in the QH regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the situation is essentially different in the bipolar regime since F is clearly enhanced, for example, F=0.19, 0.15, 0.18 and 0.18 for (tg, bg)=(2, 2), (2, 2), (2, 6) and (6, 2), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although they are finite, the obtained F's are smaller than those expected for a usual quantum point contact with the same conductance20, which suggests that a partition peculiar to this case occurs (Supplementary Note 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that the Fano factor is exceptionally as large as 0.42 for (tg, bg)=(2, 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this condition, the resistance does not reach the expected value of  as seen in the curve of Vbg=22 V in Fig 3b and also in Fig 4c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be due to the existence of the local regions where bulk of the QH state is not insulating enough.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ",

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Now going back to the QH regime, we compare our experimental results with the theoretical prediction10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The theory argued that, when the electron energy does not relax along the junction and the edge mixing process is incoherent, the shot-noise mechanism is analogous to that in a chaotic cavity, and therefore, the Fano factor in the bipolar regime is given by', '', 'while it should be zero in the unipolar regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The theoretically predicted Fano factors are compiled in Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the Fano factor in (tg, bg)=(6, 2) and (2, 6) region is 3/16=0.1875, which perfectly reproduces the experimental observation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This consistency could be a microscopic proof that the electron partition takes place on the whole region along pn junction9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The QH edges mix to cause equilibration incoherently along the junction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the other hand, the experimental results for (tg, bg)=(±2, ±2) and (6, 2) are smaller than the theoretical results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several possible reasons that the experimental value deviates from the theoretical one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, it was discussed that the quantum coherence effect and the presence of the energy relaxation may affect the Fano factor10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in both cases, the Fano factor is expected to be slightly enhanced, and therefore our observation of the reduced values cannot be explained at least by these possibilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also note that due to the symmetry reason the same Fano factors are expected between (tg, bg) and (tg, bg) and for the exchange of tg and bg as seen in Fig 4b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Fig 4a, this is not always the case; for example, F=0.18 and 0.12 are obtained for (tg, bg)=(6, 2) and (6, 2), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may indicate that the Fano factor is also sensitive to the detailed geometry of the junction along which the edge mixing occurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we discuss the role of the device mobility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the graphene device has high mobility, the Zeeman splitting and/or the valley splitting of the Landau levels should be considered26, and therefore, it is no more obvious that the present theory10 is still applicable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding this point, our device has a low mobility similar to those in the previous works9,11 so that the energy fluctuation of the Dirac point is larger than the energy of these splittings at 8 T; therefore, the uniformly mixing picture is expected to hold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In high-mobility devices, such splitting26 was recently observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shot-noise study for these devices will further clarify the unique mixing dynamics in the pn junction in graphene bipolar QH regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To conclude, by using our high-precision shot-noise measurement, we have successfully established the microscopic dynamics of the peculiar electron partition on the pn junction in graphene that the edge mixing occurs when the graphene device is in the bipolar QH regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our achievement not only confirms the theoretical prediction but also paves the road toward further exploring the nonequilibrium edge dynamics in wide classes of materials, such as graphene and topological matters.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
