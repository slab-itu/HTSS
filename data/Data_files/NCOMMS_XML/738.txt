A large carnivorous mammal from the Late Cretaceous and the North American origin of marsupials  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Marsupial mammal relatives (stem metatherians) from the Mesozoic Era (25266 million years ago) are mostly known from isolated teeth and fragmentary jaws.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report on the first near-complete skull remains of a North American Late Cretaceous metatherian, the stagodontid Didelphodon vorax.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that marsupials or their closest relatives evolved in North America, as part of a Late Cretaceous diversification of metatherians, and later dispersed to South America.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to being the largest known Mesozoic therian mammal (node-based clade of eutherians and metatherians), Didelphodon vorax has a high estimated bite force and other craniomandibular and dental features that suggest it is the earliest known therian to invade a durophagous predatorscavenger niche.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results broaden the scope of the ecomorphological diversification of Mesozoic mammals to include therian lineages that, in this case, were linked to the origin and evolution of marsupials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Marsupial mammals are today overshadowed by placentals in diversity and geographic extent1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, before the CretaceousPalaeogene mass extinction 66 million years ago (Myr ago), metatherians (the stem-based clade of living marsupials and their closest relatives2) ranged widely across northern landmasses; they also surpassed eutherians (the stem-based clade of living placentals and their closest relatives3) in both taxonomic and morphological richness4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although studies of comparative development7 and physiology8 have shed light on constraints that might have influenced this clade changeover, critical gaps in our understanding of early metatherian evolution can only be addressed with more anatomically complete fossils of these taxa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unfortunately, skulls of early metatherians are scarce and distributed unevenly across time, space and phylogeny.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of the 69 Cretaceous species, relatively complete skulls have been described for only four Asiatic taxa, all phylogenetically distant from the origin of marsupials4,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 60 species from North America (NA) are known almost exclusively from teeth and fragmentary jaws4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, previous phylogenetic analyses of early metatherians have either relied on mostly dental data6,10 or excluded most NA Late Cretaceous stem metatherians11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Their results have implied that the clade of NA Late Cretaceous stem metatherians diverged early ( greater than 100 Myr ago) from the lineage leading to marsupials and the latter predominantly evolved in South America (SA) (but see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12 for an opposing non-cladistic viewpoint).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until now, it has been unclear whether this scenario reflects (i) a meaningful evolutionary pattern, in which NA Late Cretaceous metatherians had only minor influence on the origin of marsupials or (ii) an artefact of incomplete fossil data and/or inadequate analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The four specimens described herein, a near-complete skull (NDGS 431), a snout (UWBM 94084) and two maxillae (UWBM 94500, SCNHM VMMa 20) from the Hell Creek Formation (upper Maastrichtian, 6966 Myr ago) of Montana and North Dakota, are assigned to the stagodontid metatherian Didelphodon vorax on the basis of cheek-tooth features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This taxon has long captivated palaeontologists13,14,15 as the largest Cretaceous metatherian with shearing molars and bulbous premolars, leading to the hypothesis of its specialized role in Late Cretaceous food webs, perhaps as a predator or scavenger capable of crushing hard objects (for example, bone, shell)5,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Postcranial elements attributed to D. vorax have spurred further speculation that this taxon was semiaquatic17 (but see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We incorporate new anatomical data from these four specimens of D. vorax into a phylogenetic analysis that show that marsupials or their closest relatives evolved in NA, as part of a Late Cretaceous diversification of metatherians, and soon thereafter dispersed to SA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show that D. vorax is the largest known Mesozoic therian mammal and has a high estimated bite force and other craniomandibular and dental traits that suggest it is the earliest known therian to evolve durophagous predatorscavenger behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results indicate that the ecomorphological diversification of Mesozoic mammals18 extended to therian lineages, including those near the origin of marsupials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

a lower molar with (ii) talonid subequal to wider than trigonid and (iii) entoconid subequal to larger than hypoconid and/or hypoconulid; and presence of (iv) a lacrimal tubercle and (v) postpalatine torus (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homoplasy is prevalent within Marsupialiformes (low consistency index) and dental features in particular seem prone to homoplasy; for example, the Gurlin Tsav skull+SA stem marsupialiforms and the Stagodontidae convergently evolved features, such as a well-developed upper-molar postmetacrista, presumably as adaptations for carnivory15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the relatively high retention index implies that homoplasies often serve as synapomorphies in our analysis and contribute to the moderately resolved consensus tree.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Phylogenetic relationships of D. vorax.The strict consensus tree of 18 equally parsimonious trees (tree length 601;

it overlaps or exceeds the RPS of extant carnivorans and dasyuromorph marsupials with crushing capabilities (RPS=3.003.90)25,26, and the RPS of the early Palaeocene archaic ungulate Periptychus carinidens (body mass=10.1 kg; p4 width=9.6 mm; RPS=4.44), which is also a putative hard-object feeder27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The canine bending strength estimates of D. vorax are proportionally greater than those for extant canids and more similar to those for extant felids and hyaenids (Supplementary Fig 12 and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bending strength estimates about the mediolateral axis (Sy) of the canine suggest that D. vorax generated proportionally greater bite forces at the canines compared with canids28, corroborating the BFQ results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high estimates about the anteroposterior axis (Sx) suggest that the canines of D. vorax likely could have withstood substantial oblique or mediolateral stresses induced from either contact with bone during a deep bite, struggling prey during a killing bite or bone crushing performed by adjacent teeth28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mandibular bending strength estimates of D. vorax are greater than those of the Virginia opossum Didelphis virginiana but less than those of the Tasmanian devil Sarcophilus harrisii (Supplementary Fig 13 and Supplementary Table 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Loads in the dorsoventral plane (Zx/L, Supplementary Fig 13a) generally correspond to bite forces, which tend to scale with body size29; thus, these results are also consistent with results from our bite force analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dorsoventral buttressing in D. vorax specifically increases below the ultimate premolar and molars, likely to accommodate larger stresses induced by crushing hard objects with its premolars.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The capacity to withstand large labiolingual loads, as seen in the mandible of D. vorax (Zy/L, Supplementary Fig 13b), often reflects the need to resist lateral movements of a prey animal struggling under the bite of a predator or from torsional stresses induced by hard-object feeding (for example, bones and shells)29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative force profile (Supplementary Fig 13c) shows that while the mandible of D. vorax was adapted to withstand large bite forces posteriorly, it also maintained strong buttressing against labiolingual forces to deal with the torsional stresses noted above (Zx/Zy less_than 2.00).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The results of the dental microwear analysis (Supplementary Fig 14 and Supplementary Tables 1215) show that all specimens of D. vorax cluster together and that the range of variation is similar to that observed within many extant taxa (for example, Bassariscus astutus).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D. vorax clusters with extant specimens with high numbers of puncture pits and hypercoarse scratches, low numbers of pits and average numbers of scratches (that is, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) 1 scores near average and negative PCoA 2 scores).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the presence of numerous puncture pits on the enamel surface of D. vorax is consistent with a hard-food diet, similar numbers of puncture pits are also found in animals that do not have a hard-food diet (for example, Ondatra zibethicus) and the number of pits is lower than that expected in a durophagous taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microwear signature of D. vorax overlaps those of omnivorous taxa (for example, Procyon lotor), as well as carnivores and animal-dominated omnivores (for example, Genetta tigrina and Lontra canadensis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also overlaps with the microwear signatures of two plant-dominated omnivores: Procyon cancrivorus, which consumes hard-shelled crustaceans and arthropods as well as small vertebrates, and O. zibethicus, a semi-aquatic rodent that feeds on aquatic vegetation but also crayfish, molluscs and fish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microwear signature of D. vorax differs from that of taxa that primarily feed on insects, spiders and annelids (Antechinus stuarti, Tupaia glis and Elephantulus rufescens), which are characterized by a higher number of pits.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite clustering near some of the extant taxa analysed, the diet of D. vorax cannot be tightly matched with the diet of any specific extant taxon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microwear results suggest that D. vorax was an omnivore that likely consumed a range of vertebrate, plant and hard-shelled invertebrate resources but few insects, spiders and annelids.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our results show that five major marsupialiform lineages, the Glasbiidae, Pediomyidae, Stagodontidae, Alphadontidae and marsupials (including MimoperadectesPeradectes+Herpetotherium), diverged in NA by the AlbianCenomanian (100 Myr ago) to late Santonian (85 Myr ago).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accompanying this taxonomic radiation, and consistent with other recent findings30, were increases in marsupialiform body size (up to 5.2 kg) and dietary diversity, from insectivory to omnivory, frugivory and carnivory, consuming a range of soft to hard food items5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This ecomorphological expansion was broadly coincident with and perhaps related to the onset of adaptive radiations in multituberculates and flowering plants31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most of this NA marsupialiform diversity, however, was lost gradually from the late Campanian to Maastrichtian (7966 Myr ago)6 and then abruptly during the CretaceousPalaeogene mass extinction (66 Myr ago)5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, the focus of marsupialiform evolution shifted to SA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Palaeocene SA stem marsupialiforms represent their own monophyletic radiation, rather than successive outgroups to crown marsupials, with implied ghost lineages that stretch back to at least the early Campanian (8481 Myr ago) in Asia and presumably NA, considering its intermediate position between Asia and SA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, our results push the origin of crown marsupials back to the early Palaeocene (65 Myr ago), based on the age of the oldest known fossils of Peradectes6,32, and possibly to the late Campanian (7974 Myr ago), depending on the herpetotheriid affinities of certain fossils6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter age would be at least 20 Myr ago older than the earliest definitive marsupial fossils not in the Peradectidae or Herpetotheriidae (Itaboraian of Brazil, ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5452 Myr ago)33, but would be congruent with recent molecular estimates34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NA roots for multiple, successive outgroups also constrain marsupials or a recent ancestor to a NA origin and dispersal to SA during the Late Cretaceous or earliest Palaeocenean inference corroborated by other biotic connections (multituberculates and hadrosaurines) and geological evidence of a land connection between NA and SA33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Novel morphology from the specimens reported herein broadens the ecological diversity of NA Cretaceous metatherians.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The new specimens support the hypothesis that D. vorax was a powerful predatorscavenger5,14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New body mass estimates show that, among Mesozoic mammals, D. vorax was larger than all other therians and rivaled by only a few non-therians35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The body mass estimate of 5.2 kg for UWBM 94084 (Supplementary Table 4) is comparable in size to the Virginia opossum D. virginiana (1.96.0 kg) and American badger Taxidea taxus (4.012.0 kg).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing in part to energetic constraints, small- to medium-sized extant predators ( less_than 15 kg) mostly feed on small vertebrates and invertebrates that are a small fraction of their own body mass36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, an adult D. vorax would have preyed on mainly small Late Cretaceous molluscs, fish, amphibians, lizards, turtles and mammals; however, its maximum prey size is estimated to have been 5.0 kg (95% confidence intervals of 2.211.4 kg; Supplementary Table 5), which would have included some small and juvenile dinosaurs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Analysis of skull biomechanics points to an even wider predatory range for D. vorax than would be expected from its body size alone.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its relatively short, broad and robust skull conferred mechanical advantages via shorter jaw out levers, more space in the temporal region for jaw adductor musculature and increased resistance to torsional loadings8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its estimated maximal bite force at the canines (CBS=218 N) is greater than that of most small- to medium-sized extant mammals ( less_than 15 kg) and only slightly less than that of the river otter L. canadensis (233 N) and European badger Meles meles (244 N; Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The canine BFQ of D. vorax (BFQ=201) indicates that its pound-for-pound relative bite force exceeded that of all other measured extant and fossil mammals, including the marsupial lion Thylacoleo carnifex (193), Tasmanian devil S. harrisii (166), dire wolf Canis dirus (157), African lion Panthera leo (116) and spotted hyaena Crocuta crocuta (114; Supplementary Table 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BFQs greater than 100 typically only occur in bone-cracking specialists and taxa that occasionally hunt or scavenge on prey larger than themselves, such as the honey badger Mellivora capensis, striped hyaena Hyaena hyaena and spotted hyaena C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  crocuta23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Other craniodental features strengthen our inference that D. vorax was durophagous and possibly osteophagous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Its broad, convex premolars with the protocone as a stress concentrator closely approximate an ideal crushing form37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They require less force than concave shapes to induce crack formation in prey items and are more resistant to tooth fracture than tall- or narrow-cusped shapes37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even the flat premolars of later wear stages, while not as effective at crushing, incur lower strain values37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the RPS25 of D. vorax (RPS of P3=3.274.99; Supplementary Table 8) matches or exceeds those of extant carnivorans and dasyuromorph marsupials with crushing capabilities (RPS=3.003.90)25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rounded cross-sectional shape of the canines of D. vorax resembles those of extant hyaenids and extinct bone-crushing dogs (borophagines) and dire wolves28 (Supplementary Fig 12 and Supplementary Tables 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This canine shape resists bending in all directions, for example, from deep bites contacting bone or from stresses incurred from adjacent premolars crushing hard objects28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D. vorax also has a robust lower jaw that exhibits strong dorsoventral buttressing below the ultimate premolar and molars, likely to accommodate large stresses induced by crushing hard objects with the premolars29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Anteriorly, the cross-sectional shape of the lower jaw is more rounded and likely reflects strengthening of the symphysis for crushing with the anterior teeth and/or for handling torsional stresses of struggling prey29 (Supplementary Fig 13 and Supplementary Table 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antemortem canine tooth breakage, such as in UWBM 94084 and NDGS 431, is also significantly more common in durophagous mammals than in carnivores, insectivores or omnivores38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, the skull of D. vorax differs from those of highly specialized bone crackers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While its reconstructed cranial profile is relatively tall at the snout, as in the molluscivorous sea otter Enhydra lutris, it lacks the characteristic vaulted forehead of hyaenids, percrocutids and borophagines that dissipates the large forces generated from cracking bones39,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that (1) D. vorax was an early-stage bone-cracking specialist39 that had relatively little time (10 Myr)15 to evolutionarily diverge from its late Campanian sister genus (Eodelphis) with smaller, trenchant premolars and a gracile lower jaw15; (2) the evolutionary constraints that shaped the cranial morphology of the metatherian D. vorax differed from those of eutherian bone-cracking specialists8; or (3) akin to non-bone-cracking canids (for example, wolves)24,40, D. vorax did not regularly deploy its high bite force because its skull was not well adapted for very high stresses; instead, D. vorax had a broad dietary range that included hard-object food items as well as other vertebrate and invertebrate material and vegetation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dental enamel microwear of D. vorax favours this last explanation: analysed specimens show lower frequencies of pits than in other osteophages42 and are spread across the microwear space defined by extant mammals, from durophagous carnivores and omnivores, like the river otter L. canadensis and crab-eating raccoon P. cancrivorus, to small vertebrate and insect predators, like the ring-tailed cat B. astutus, and taxa that mainly feed on plants, like the kinkajou Potos flavus and muskrat O. zibethicus (Supplementary Fig 14 and Supplementary Tables 1215).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results perhaps also reflect that as the skull shape of D. vorax varied with ontogeny, as in extant marsupials43, so too did skull function and diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, our data indicate that D. vorax was a powerful predatorscavenger in Late Cretaceous ecosystems with considerable faculties for cracking bone, invertebrate shell and/or turtle shell, but lacked some modifications of larger, more advanced osteophages, and D. vorax likely supplemented its diet of small vertebrates, carrion and/or molluscs with insects and plant matter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our study adds to a growing body of exceptional fossil discoveries18 and innovative quantitative analyses31,44 that has revealed an unexpectedly rich ecomorphological diversity of Mesozoic mammals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This recasting of mammals from the Age of Dinosaurs, however, has previously focused on dead-end non-therian lineages18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Until recently30, there has been little evidence that therians, which comprise 99.9% of all living mammals, underwent significant ecomorphological radiation during their more than 100 Myr of Mesozoic evolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  D. vorax highlights a previously under-appreciated radiation of Late Cretaceous NA stem marsupialiforms and its direct link to the origin and evolution of living marsupials.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Constraining the timing of the origin of Marsupialia', 'Marsupialia is a crown clade formed by the most recent common ancestor of extant metatherians, plus all of its descendants2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to our phylogenetic analysis, MimoperadectesPeradectes and Herpetotherium are included along with extant marsupials (Dromiciops, Didelphis and Marmosa) in Marsupialia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The origin of crown group marsupials is thereby constrained by the age of the oldest fossils attributed to Marsupialia: the oldest known species of Peradectes (for example, P. minor) are from the early Palaeocene (middle Puercan, ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  65.1 Myr ago)32, whereas the oldest known species of Herpetotherium (for example, H. comstocki) are from the earliest Eocene (early Wasatchian, ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  55 Myr ago).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because Herpetotherium is a member of the monophyletic Herpetotheriidae6,57, we can further extend its lineage back to at least the oldest member of this clade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Williamson and Lofgren58 placed Golerdelphys stocki, which is known by four isolated molars, in the Herpetotheriidae.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These specimens are from the middle Tiffanian-age Goler Formation in California (middle Palaeocene, ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  60 Myr ago).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, Case et al.12 proposed the late Maastrichtian (Lancian) Nortedelphys as a herpetotheriid, but phylogenetic analyses have not supported this claim6,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The V-shaped upper-molar centrocrista shared by Nortedelphys and herpetotheriids appears to have convergently evolved in these taxa57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In recent phylogenetic analyses by Williamson et al.6,57, the late Campanian (Judithian, ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7974 Myr ago) taxon Ectocentrocristus foxi falls among the herpetotheriids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, because this taxon is based on a single tooth that some have argued is not a molar but a deciduous fourth premolar of Turgidodon6, we cautiously interpret these data: the oldest herpetotheriids went back to at least the middle Palaeocene (Fig 3, grey star), as represented by Golerdelphys, and possibly the late Campanian (Fig 3, grey star with query), as represented by Ectocentrocristus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, according to our results, the origin of crown marsupials extends back to at least the early Palaeocene (age of Peradectes minor) and possibly the late Campanian (age of E.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  foxi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'If additional sampling of the Australidelphia leads to a revised phylogenetic placement of Dromiciops such that MimoperadectesPeradectes and Herpetotherium are sister taxa to rather than members of Marsupialia, then the origin of crown marsupials would be early Eocene (5452 Myr ago)33 based on the oldest undisputed crown marsupial fossils from the Itaborai local fauna of Brazil59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In turn, the origin of stem marsupials would be constrained by the age of the ghost lineage implied by the age of the oldest member of the sister taxon, the Herpetotheriidae or Peradectidae (early Palaeocene or possibly late Campanian).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A last alternative to consider is that some have argued, on the basis of dental similarity, that Glasbius from the late Maastrichtian (Lancian) of NA is sister taxon to the SA Polydolopimorphia60, which in turn has been allied with either the extant Caenolestidae or the extant Microbiotheria53,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If correct, this would expand the membership of Marsupialia and push back its origins well into the Cretaceous (100 Myr ago or older).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we remain unconvinced of this hypothesis because it has not been rigorously tested in a phylogenetic analysis that utilizes a broad sample of taxa and anatomical characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, we follow Clemens16 in arguing that the dental similarities of these taxa are likely the result of convergent evolution toward a frugivorous/granivorous diet, not shared recent

#@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate body mass in D. vorax, we chose to use formulae developed from an all-dasyuromorphian data set22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We deemed this data set as most appropriate for the task because dasyuromorphians are a restricted taxonomic group of marsupials and they adequately approximate the craniodental morphology of Didelphodon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This equation also provided reasonable body mass estimates for a sample of D. virginiana with tag mass data (data not presented here).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We estimated body masses of four specimens of D. vorax: (1) the relatively complete skull of a young adult (NDGS 431); the snout of a more mature individual (UWBM 94084); the near-complete dentary of young adult (UWBM 102139); and the more fragmentary dentary of a young adult (UCMP 159909).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For NDGS 431, we used the formulae that use TSL and upper-molar-occlusal-row length (UMORL).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For UWBM 94084, we estimated TSL based on the scaling relationship between length of the snout tip to P3M1 embrasure and TSL in NDGS 431.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the dentaries, we used the formulae for lower-molar-row length and lower-molar-occlusal-row length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These body mass estimates are shown in Supplementary Table 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the body mass estimate for NDGS 431 from the UMORL because it has a lower prediction error (14%) than that for TSL (19%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UMORL measurements are not available for UWBM 94084, so we used the body mass estimate from the scaled TSL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Estimate of maximum prey size of D. vorax', 'Predator body size constrains the maximum body size of prey that it can kill.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For energetic and biomechanical reasons, small- to medium-sized predators ( less_than

maximum prey size from a predators body mass, using a large data set of extant predators and their largest known prey items.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To correct for logarithmic transformation bias65, Meers23 calculated a Ratio estimator (RE) correction factor according to the method of Snowdon66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because that RE correction factor was not reported, we reconstructed it from the regression

force vector about the temporalmandibular joint (TMJ), and the length of the outlever; or distance from the TMJ axis to the bite point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our bite force calculations are based on the contributions of the temporalis muscle and the combined masseter and pterygoid muscles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To estimate temporalis PCSA, the skulls were digitally positioned in Geomagic Studio using four points on the skull to define the plane of posterodorsal view: the most posterior points of the left and right zygomatic arches, and the most lateral points of the left and right postorbital
