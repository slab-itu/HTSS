Connecting genetic risk to disease end points through the human blood plasma proteome  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with intermediate phenotypes, like changes in metabolite and protein levels, provide functional evidence to map disease associations and translate them into clinical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, although hundreds of genetic variants have been associated with complex disorders, the underlying molecular pathways often remain elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Associations with intermediate traits are key in establishing functional links between GWAS-identified risk-variants and disease end points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe a GWAS using a highly multiplexed aptamer-based affinity proteomics platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We quantify 539 associations between protein levels and gene variants (pQTLs) in a German cohort and replicate over half of them in an Arab and Asian cohort.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fifty-five of the replicated pQTLs are located in trans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our associations overlap with 57 genetic risk loci for 42 unique disease end points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We integrate this information into a genome-proteome network and provide an interactive web-tool for interrogations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide a basis for novel approaches to pharmaceutical and diagnostic applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with intermediate phenotypes, such as metabolite and protein levels, can reveal variations in protein abundances, enzymatic activities, interaction properties or regulatory mechanisms, which can inform clinical applications1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies with aptamer-, immunoassay- and mass-spectrometry-based proteomics (Supplementary Table 1) have shown that protein levels are strongly modulated by variations in the nearby cis regions of their encoding genes4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, proteomics-based genetic association studies have been limited by small protein panels or cohort sizes, and thus, have not systematically addressed associations across multiple chromosome locations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These trans-associations are key in establishing functional links between different risk-variants, because they reveal the downstream effectors in the pathways between cis-encoded risk-variants and disease end points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use a highly multiplexed, aptamer-based, affinity proteomics platform (SOMAscan)10 in a GWAS to quantify levels of 1,124 proteins in blood plasma samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigate samples from 1,000 individuals of the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) study1,11 and replicate the results in 338 participants of the Qatar Metabolomics Study on Diabetes (QMDiab) with participants of Arab and Asian ethnicities12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We identify 539 independent, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-protein associations, which include novel inter-chromosomal (trans) links related to autoimmune disorders, Alzheimers disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer and many other disease end points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study represents the outcome of over 1,100 new GWAS with blood circulating protein levels, many of which have never been reported before.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that up to 60% of the naturally occurring variance in the blood plasma levels of essential proteins can be explained by two or more independent variants of a single gene located on another chromosome, and identify strong genetic associations with intermediate traits in pathways involved in complex disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'A GWAS with blood circulating protein levels', 'We used linear additive genetic regression models, adjusted for relevant covariates, to analyse 509,946 common autosomal SNPs for genome-wide associations with 1,124 protein levels measured in 1,000 blood samples from the KORA study (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We grouped association signals with correlated SNPs (r2 greater than 0.1) into single-protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) and identified 539 pQTLs (284 unique proteins, 451 independent SNPs) with a conservative Bonferroni level of significance (P less_than 8.72 × 1011=0.05/509,946/1,124; unless otherwise stated we report uncorrected P values for the reported traits from linear regression models).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For 21% of the assayed proteins we detected a cis-pQTL at a more liberal significance cutoff of P less_than 5 × 108.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full list is available as Supplementary Data 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then fine-mapped our associations with variants imputed from the 1,000-Genomes project database.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we attempted replication of 462 associations that had a suitable genotyped tag SNP (r2 greater than 0.8) in samples from 338 participants of the QMDiab study12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of those, 234 associations (50.6%) were replicated at a Bonferroni level of significance (P less_than 1.08 × 104=0.05/462), and an additional 150 (totalling to 83.1%) showed nominal significance (P less_than 0.05) in the replication sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed directional consistency between primary and replication sample for 215 of the 234 replicated SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discrepancy for the remaining 19 SNPs may be explained by changes in major and minor allele coding between the two cohorts and ethnic differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What is more, out of 208 associations that had 95% replication power (determined by sampling), 171 (82.2%) were replicated and 198 (95.2%) were nominally significant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we replicated several associations previously reported in aptamer-, immunoassay- and mass-spectrometry-based studies, which demonstrated concordance among these technologies (Supplementary Tables 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interconnectedness and annotation of the plasma proteome', 'The SOMAscan aptamers were generated to bind specifically to proteins implicated in numerous diseases and physiological processes and to target a broad range of secreted, intracellular and extracellular proteins, which are detectable in blood plasma (Supplementary Fig 1, Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To identify interrelations between these proteins, we used Gaussian graphical modelling (GGM) to connect 1,092 proteins through 3,943 Bonferroni-significant partial proteinprotein correlation edges (Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Then, we added all 451 genetic pQTL variants as nodes, and connected them to the protein network through the 539 SNP-protein associations (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This network is freely available online, and it can be navigated via an interactive web interface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, we found that given our study power the blood plasma levels of over 20% of all assayed proteins were under substantial genetic control, and in some cases, this control resulted in nearly total protein ablation (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additionally, a wide-spread feature was the convergence of multiple association signals to impact the levels of key proteins of biomedical and pharmaceutical interest (Supplementary Fig 2): with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis database (IPA, Qiagen Inc.), we annotated 50 proteins as clinical or pharmaceutical biomarkers (Supplementary Table 6) and 43 as drug targets (Supplementary Table 7), and all of these had at least one replicated pQTL.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: The genome-proteome-disease network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Data sources integrated into the network, indicating the number and type of the

annotated putative causative and disease-relevant variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the SNiPA web-tool13 to retrieve variant-specific annotations for all SNPs from the 1,000-Genomes project that were in linkage disequilibrium with an identified pQTL (linkage disequilibrium r2 greater than 0.8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The annotations included primary effect predictions, SNPs in experimentally identified regulatory elements (ENCODE), expression QTLs (eQTLs) and disease associated variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of 384 annotated cis-pQTLs, 228 had a variant in the gene coding region, whereof 74 were protein-changing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Eighty-eight had a variant in a regulatory element, and 179 had an eQTL that matched the associated protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We complemented the pQTL annotation with

trans-pQTLsFull size table', 'In this study, the pleiotropic ABO blood group gene exhibited the most promiscuous protein association signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This locus displayed six independent genetic variants that were associated with 14 different proteins through replicated trans-pQTLs; three of these associations had been published previously (VWF, SELE, SELP, Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The other eleven associations were new, to our knowledge (BCAM, CD200, CD209, CDH5, FLT4, INSR, KDR, MET, NOTCH1, TEK, TIE1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic variance in ABO has been associated with coronary artery disease, stroke14, and diabetes15 (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-O blood group is one of the most important genetic risk factors for venous thromboembolism16, pancreatic cancer17 and susceptibility to infectious diseases18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we lack a full understanding of the proteins and pathways involved in the pathogenic effects of these genetic variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the pQTLs reported here, we found support for the following three new hypotheses: First, the association between ABO and levels of circulating insulin receptor (INSR) reflects the previously reported associations between the ABO locus and diabetes and the insulin receptor and diabetes15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between ABO and the insulin receptor suggests that INSR-mediated insulin signalling may be involved in the ABO-diabetes association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, rs651007 associated here with P-selectin (SELP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SELP-positive platelets were previously reported to be associated with blood pressure19, and rs651007 was associated in a GWAS with angiotensin converting enzyme activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This variant was further identified as an mQTL for a number of dipeptides in blood20, which may be produced by the dipeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest a potential role for the SELP pQTL in the GWAS association between ABO and cardiovascular disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, several of the 14 proteins associated here with ABO have been shown to interact or form complexes in relation with angiogenesis and vascular maturation processes: The angiopoietin-1 receptor (TEK) has a role in embryonic vascular development and phosphorylates the tyrosine kinase TIE1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TIE1 overexpression in endothelial cells upregulates selectin E (SELE)22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strain induced angiogenesis is mediated in part through a Notch-dependent, Ang1/Tie2 signalling pathway that implicates NOTCH1 and TIE1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin (CDH5) is required for normal development of the vasculature in the embryo and for angiogenesis in the adult, and it is associated with VE growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 (KDR) on the exposure of endothelial cells to VEGF24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Heterodimers of KDR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (FLT4) positively regulate angiogenic sprouting25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGF directly and negatively regulates tumour cell invasion through enhanced recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) to a hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET)KDR hetero-complex26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  VEGF also synergistically increased tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced E-selectin messenger RNA (mRNA) and shedding of soluble E-selectin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Synergistic upregulation of E-selectin expression by VEGF is mediated via KDR and calcineurin signalling27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that genetic variance in ABO has major effects on a network of proteins involved in cell adhesion, angiogenesis and neo-vascularization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the here reported trans-pQTLs indicate novel pathways that may explain ABO-mediated cancer susceptibility through regulation of vascular metabolism28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Post-translational modifications', 'To follow up on the many hypotheses generated by the pQTLs reported here, expert knowledge and experimentation will be required.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the fact that several of the proteins identified in our pQTLs were glycoproteins, we performed plasma protein glycoprofiling (see Online Methods) to investigate whether some of our pQTLs were involved in posttranslational protein modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For instance, SNP rs3760775, located at the FUT3 gene locus, was associated with plasma levels of the there encoded galactoside3(4)-L-fucosyltransferase protein.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that this same variant was strongly associated with the N-glycan GP33 (P=1.4 × 1015) (see Fig 3a for the GP33 glycan structure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a previous GWAS, SNP rs3760775 was reported to be associated with the glycan antigen, CA19-9 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  29), a widely used cancer biomarker, which is present on multiple proteins30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nearly 20 years ago, studies demonstrated a similar association between CA19-9 and the FUT3 gene dosage31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This previously reported association between variance in the FUT3 locus and the expression of cancer antigen, CA19-9, and our observation of a similar association with GP33, suggest that both glycans may be involved in a same pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Genotype-dependent co-associations of the plasma proteome and the plasma N-glycome.Bee swarm plots of total plasma N-glycans GP19 and GP33 (% of total N-glycan

the strong, genotype-dependent correlation between complement factor C4 and the N-glycan, GP19 (P=2.0 × 1027) (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that SNP rs8283 was associated with both C4 and GP19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GP19 is composed of nine mannose moieties (M9 glycan structure), and it was previously reported to be attached to C4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  33).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, M9 glycans are the principal target ligand for mannose-binding protein (MBL), which binds to C4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  34), and subsequently, activates the complement system through the lectin pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MBL has been implicated in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis in many studies, including a recent meta-analysis, which confirmed the association between functional MBL variants and rheumatoid arthritis risk35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rs8283 variant was also associated with rheumatoid arthritis (P=3.8 × 1051) (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36), but is not in linkage disequilibrium with the top reported rheumatoid arthritis-risk variants in the HLA region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, SNP rs8283 appears to be an independent signal, possibly mediated through MBL binding to C4 glycans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Biomedical relevance', 'A major challenge in conducting a disease GWAS is the difficulty in identifying causative variants in the pathophysiological pathways that lead to the observed clinical manifestations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generally, hypotheses about the identity of the disease-causing genes are based on biological arguments, such as the presence of SNPs in the regulatory or coding regions of functionally plausible genes, which may be supported by co-associated eQTLs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a much stronger argument is provided by the co-association with a pQTL, which constitutes firm experimental evidence that the blood levels of disease-associated proteins vary in response to changes in the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, partial correlations to functionally related proteins, as reported here, may further substantiate and extend hypotheses generated from pQTLs (see example in Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the following sections, we show how pQTLs identified

vesicles and present in the extracellular space39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we found that the two previously identified ankylosing spondylitis-risk variants were associated, in an additive manner, with increasing levels of circulating ERAP1 protein (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, mRNA sequences isolated from lymphoblastoid cells showed that ERAP1 mRNA expression also increased with increasing numbers of ankylosing spondylitis-risk alleles (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous work concluded that the association between ERAP1 and ankylosing spondylitis was mainly driven by genetic differences in how ERAP1 enzymatic activity shaped the HLA-B27 peptidome40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our findings suggest that the auto-immunogenic effects of different ERAP1 protein variants may in addition be modulated by genotype-dependent regulation of protein expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation may have broader implications for treatment approaches to autoimmune disorders that depend on

#@NEW_LINE#@#  The CardiogramPlus consortium GWAS data confirmed that association (P=1.66 × 108).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, we replicated the IL6R-pQTL (rs4129267, r2=0.94 with rs7529229).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we identified a second SNP in IL6R, rs11804305, which tags an independent and causative variant, since rs4129267 was already established as functional.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, these two SNPs could be used to investigate doseresponse curves in the huge data set available from the IL6R-Mendelian randomization consortium49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar approach is now feasible for all other protein drug targets that were associated here with multiple pQTLs (for examples see Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  What is more, the aptamers that were used in this study to target these proteins can readily be used as intermediate readouts in assessing drug responses and in optimizing the efficacy of lead components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Application to disease GWAS', "Genetic associations with intermediate traits are generally much stronger than associations with disease end points, due to their proximity to the causative variant, as shown in our previous GWAS with metabolic traits50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, pQTLs can serve as proxies to fine-map genetic disease associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This approach can be used to identify potentially causative genes and additional independent genetic signals at a locus identified in a disease-GWAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, pQTLs can be used to identify true positive associations among associations that do not reach genome-wide significance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, rs12146727 was associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD; P=6.18 × 105) in CardiogramPlus and with AD (P=3.10 × 105 in the discovery cohort (st1), and P=8.27 × 106 in a combined analysis of a larger cohort (st12comb)) in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A true positive association requires that the association signal must be strengthened with increasing sample numbers, which was the case for the st1 and st12comb cohorts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, rs12146727 was replicated as a cis-pQTL for complement C1r subcomponent (C1R), and it was replicated as a trans-pQTL for complement C1q subcomponent (C1QA/C1QB/C1QC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These associations support growing evidence that suggests that the complement system has a role in both, AD and CVD51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This example also shows how variants that associate with a disease end point could generate new hypotheses about the role of the co-associated proteins in the disease aetiology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that even when these variants have small effect sizes or odds ratios, the related pathways may show large responses to pharmaceutical alteration of these proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypotheses generated with this approach can be directly tested in animal models, and the existing aptamers can be potentially used as intermediate functional readouts in the drug development process."  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genetic studies with yeast52 and lymphoblastoid cell lines53,54,55 have indicated that cellular protein levels are under strong genetic control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This control was confirmed by the discovery of many cis-acting genetic variants in the human blood proteome4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we described the first large-scale proteomics GWAS on blood plasma proteins derived from a human population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This GWAS represented over 1.1 million individual aptamer binding experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By design, our panel of more than 1,100 aptamer targets was highly enriched in biomedically relevant blood circulating proteins, which was reflected in the large overlap of pQTLs with risk loci identified in disease-GWAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data generated from this study can be used in future investigations to identify and validate causative variants identified in disease GWAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, aptamer-based read-outs can be used as intermediate traits in CrispR-based experiments, as exemplified with the FTO-obesity association described by Claussnitzer et al.56,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Surprisingly, we found that up to 60% of the naturally occurring variance in the blood plasma levels of essential proteins could be explained by two or more independent variants of a single gene located on another chromosome (trans-associations).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identified strong genetic associations with intermediate, and most likely functional, traits related to proteins involved in complex disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While many of our associations connect these proteins to disease pathways through shared associations, it should be borne in mind that confounding is always a possibility and needs to be ruled out by further experimentation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data can be used in future studies to establish dose-response curves for drug-target validation48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A greater understanding of the genetic control of circulating levels of protein drug targets and biomarkers may improve pharmaceutical interventions and clinical trials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because all the aptamers used in this study were synthetically generated and are well defined, they can be readily developed into specific assays for precise clinical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the SLAMF7-binding aptamer identified here, which revealed a potential genetic effect on Elotuzumab, may be developed directly into a clinical assay for identifying differential responders to immunotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, this concept can be generalized to other drug targets and biomarkers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Despite the variable baseline conditions among the participants of the replication cohort (not fasting, high prevalence of diabetes and multiple ethnic backgrounds), we replicated 82% of all sufficiently powered associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result emphasized the robustness of the replicated associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also suggests that many of the Bonferroni-significant associations that could not be replicated in our QMDiab cohort may be replicated in future studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  About 20% of all assayed proteins had a significant pQTL association.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This number is expected to increase in future more highly powered studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Genetic variance in a protein sequence may affect its higher order structure, and thus, its aptamer-binding affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, alterations in protein structure may affect binding and specificity in immunoassay-based methods and protein mass in targeted mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These issues remain to be addressed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we showed that structural-based epitope effects on a particular pQTL may be identified or ruled out in several ways, including: allele-specific transcription analysis (for example, CPNE1, Supplementary Fig 5), co-associated eQTLs, particularly when they include multiple genetic variants (for example, ERAP1, Fig 4), the absence of correlated SNPs that alter the protein structure (for example, based on SNiPA-annotated 1000 Genomes data), and replication on different platforms (Supplementary Tables 2, 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not directly follow up on our results using mass spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Ngo et al.58 recently showed that response curves for selected aptamer-enriched proteins were linear over a wide dynamic range of spiked protein concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most importantly, trans-associations, which were a central focus of this study, are not affected by this type of potential artefact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our GWAS demonstrated the power of linking the genome to disease end points via the blood proteome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As we have shown in the examples, mining of our data can reveal a plethora of new insights into biological processes and provide a wealth of functional information that is beyond the focus of a single publication.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we have provided additional interpretations of selected loci in Supplementary Note 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our complete results are freely accessible for further analyses of pQTL associations with past and future disease GWAS, on an integrated web-server
