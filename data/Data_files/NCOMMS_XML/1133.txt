Multifunctional nanoparticles as a tissue adhesive and an injectable marker for image-guided procedures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tissue adhesives have emerged as an alternative to sutures and staples for wound closure and reconnection of injured tissues after surgery or trauma.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to their convenience and effectiveness, these adhesives have received growing attention particularly in minimally invasive procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For safe and accurate applications, tissue adhesives should be detectable via clinical imaging modalities and be highly biocompatible for intracorporeal procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, few adhesives meet all these requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we show that biocompatible tantalum oxide/silica core/shell nanoparticles (TSNs) exhibit not only high contrast effects for real-time imaging but also strong adhesive properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the biocompatible TSNs cause much less cellular toxicity and less inflammation than a clinically used, imageable tissue adhesive (that is, a mixture of cyanoacrylate and Lipiodol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of their multifunctional imaging and adhesive property, the TSNs are successfully applied as a hemostatic adhesive for minimally invasive procedures and as an immobilized marker for image-guided procedures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tissue adhesives have various advantages over sutures and staples, including a simpler implementation procedure, more immediate sealing, less pain to patients, lower infection rates, and less trauma on operated tissues1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, their clinical demands have grown significantly, and consequently, a number of tissue adhesives based on proteins and synthetic polymers including fibrin, gelatin, polyurethanes, and polyethylene glycol have been developed to accommodate various surgical situations5,6,7,8,9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The convenience of tissue adhesives is particularly noticeable in minimally invasive procedures and image-guided surgeries because they are very effective for treating a confined region of interest that is inaccessible with other wound closure methods, which can greatly reduce postoperative complications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since minimally invasive procedures are typically guided by real-time imaging modalities, such as X-ray fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, and fluorescence imaging, it is useful that the applied tissue adhesives are visible with such imaging modalities for accurate and safe applications11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, radiotherapy or minimally invasive procedures to soft organs can also be aided by the tissue adhesives with imaging contrast effects for efficient recognition and follow-up of the target areas along the physiological movement of the organ14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nanoparticles have been incorporated with tissue adhesives or hydrogels to enhance their mechanical properties, adhesive strength and electrical conductivity and to provide unique functions such as antibacterial effects4,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, it was reported that the nanoparticle solution itself can act as an adhesive for hydrogels and biological tissues19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to its large surface area and the high adsorption energy between biological tissues and the nanoparticle surface, the adhesive property of nanoparticles is sufficient for various applications, such as hemostasis, wound closure, and scaffold-attachments20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, nanoparticles have also been employed as biomedical imaging probes owing to their unique physical properties and capability of conjugating functional moieties via surface modification21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have been used with various molecular imaging modalities for the sensitive diagnosis of lesions30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these two different medical applications of nanoparticles, they may be a promising candidate for multimodal image-guided procedures38,39,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we design core-shell structured tantalum oxide-silica nanoparticles as tissue adhesives in image-guided surgery.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Designed synthesis and characterization of TSNs', 'We employ silica (SiO2) as the shell material to endow the nanoparticles with a tissue adhesive property, because its surface offers high adhesive strength to hydrogels or tissues19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Radiopaque tantalum oxide (TaOx) is selected as the core material to provide contrast enhancement on X-ray fluoroscopy and CT (Fig 1a)41,42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TaOx nanoparticles combined with various organic and inorganic moieties have been applied to multimodal imaging and/or theranostics29,45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the current study, the high density of the TaOx core and the facile modification of the SiO2 surface allow for ultrasound (US) and fluorescence imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Design and multifunctionality of TSNs.

using this material, and exhibits adhesive property similar to that of a mixture of cyanoacrylate and Lipiodol (CA-Lp) used in clinical practice (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyanoacrylate adhesive, a frequently used tissue adhesive in human, has to be mixed with radiopaque iodized oil (Lipiodol) to be administered under the guidance of fluoroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, compared to the clinically used CA-Lp, TSNs are highly biocompatible, as evidenced by dramatically reduced cytotoxicity and inflammation reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also demonstrate that TSNs can work as tissue adhesives with the assistance of multimodal imaging modalities in a liver puncture model to stop internal bleeding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of their adhesive property and multimodal imaging capability, TSNs are used as an injectable immobilized anatomical marker to aid image-guided surgery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TSNs were synthesized by the sol-gel reaction of tantalum(V) ethoxide in nanometer-sized microemulsion41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After TaOx nanoparticles were generated, the SiO2 shell was grown on the TaOx core by sol-gel reaction of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images show uniform nanoparticles of an overall size of 8.5±0.8 nm with a SiO2 shell thickness of 1.3±0.2 nm (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shell thickness is easily controllable from 1 to 5 nm by changing the amount of TEOS added (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, and EDS line scanning show overlapped signals from tantalum and silicon elements, suggesting a core-shell structure (Fig 1df, Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The core/shell structure is also confirmed by the contrast difference between TaOx and SiO2 in the TEM images of TSNs with varying SiO2 shell thickness (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also noteworthy that no separate formation of either silica or tantalum oxide nanoparticles occurred.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After the nanoparticles were purified by centrifugation, they were treated with acid to remove any residual adsorbed surfactants that may interfere with the interactions between the nanoparticle surface and biological tissues, leading to the loss of the adhesive property.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removal of the surfactants was confirmed with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy by the disappearance of peaks related to Igepal CO-520 (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without the SiO2 shell, the reactive TaOx surface causes a severe aggregation of tantalum oxide nanoparticles after the removal of surfactants (Supplementary Fig 4b), generating micrometer-sized agglomerates (Supplementary Fig 4b,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the SiO2 shell successfully protects TSNs from irreversible agglomeration, resulting in the number-average hydrodynamic diameter of 20.4 nm (Supplementary Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is crucial that the TSNs should be well dispersed as nanoparticle form because the adhesive property of the nanoparticles is affected by surface adsorption with biological tissue, which will be discussed below.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To utilize TSNs for optical image-guided surgery, fluorescent TSNs were prepared by covalent attachment of tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) onto the TSN surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photoluminescence of the TRITC-conjugated TSNs reveals a typical peak of TRITC at 576 nm (Supplementary Fig 3l).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tissue adhesive property and hemostatic capability', 'To evaluate the suitability of the TSNs for image-guided procedures, their adhesive property was examined with internal tissues containing biological fluids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Liver is an appropriate substrate because it contains abundant biological fluid and blood vessels which have to be sealed inside and it has rather uniform structures among the internal organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissue adhesive property of TSNs was evaluated using a lap joint shear test of liver ribbons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two liver ribbons were adhered together by gently pressing with a fingertip after spreading 15 l of the glue solutions (TSNs, SiO2 nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs), TaOx NPs, CA-Lp, and TSNs coated with Igepal CO-520).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, CA-Lp was used as a positive control group because it is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved tissue adhesive form with a contrast effect and one of the most commonly used glue in image-guided procedures for human.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the upper ribbon was lifted with forceps, it held the lower ribbon without slipping (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Force-displacement curves were obtained using a universal test machine (UTM) as shown in Fig 2b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To account for the large deviation of failure forces due to tissue heterogeneity, nine samples were measured for each type of glue (Fig 2c and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adhesive strengths of all applied adhesives exceeded the intrinsic adhesion strength of biological tissues (Supplementary Fig 5b).

enough contrast effect to be visualized in X-ray fluoroscopy (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SiO2 NP solution also shows similar strength with that of CA-Lp and TSNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the TSNs show much lower adhesion strength than that of commercial CA, the CA is not detectable in X-ray imaging modalities, and unable to be used by itself in image-guided procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine the optimal concentration of TSN for adhesive properties, the adhesive strengths were measured with various TSN concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the adhesive force increases with increasing nanoparticle concentration (Supplementary Fig 7), the highest 40 wt% TSN solution was used for hemostasis or markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The force-displacement curves of TSNs (Supplementary Fig 5a) show a similar pattern to that of SiO2 NPs, indicating that the adhesion characteristics of TSNs originate from nanoparticle adsorption onto the biological tissue surface and corresponding energy dissipation from the hydrogel-like soft tissues, as previously proposed19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Gluing biological tissues with nanoparticles mainly depends on the ability of nanoparticles to adsorb onto tissues, which involves the interaction between the nanoparticle surface and biological molecules on tissues19,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To investigate the adhesive mechanism of TSNs, we prepared various types of TSNs that are surface-functionalized with primary amine, carboxylate, and polyethylene oxide group (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All of these surface grafted TSNs exhibit no adhesive property (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, TSNs covered with Igepal CO-520 show fourfold reduced adhesive property than that of bare TSNs that are obtained by the complete removal of Igepal CO-520 by the acid treatment (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Meanwhile, agglomeration of TaOx NPs leads to the decrease of adhesion strength by half compared with TSNs (Fig 2c and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results clearly demonstrate that the silica surface is mainly responsible for the adhesive property of TSNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, silica coating imparts colloidal stability of TSNs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Adsorption of TSNs was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SEM and TEM images of the liver samples show localization of TSNs near hepatocytes and leaked subcellular vesicles from the damaged cells by the adsorption of TSNs near lipid layer (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, entangling and adsorption interactions between fibrin fibers and TSNs confirm that the adsorption and spontaneous network formation of TSNs on biological tissues enables the adhesion of cut liver tissues (Fig 2d and Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'After confirming their adhesive property, TSNs were applied to hemostasis in a liver puncture model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since it is difficult to suture a highly vascularized liver wound, either tissue adhesives or sealants are necessary for the warranted closure of hepatic wounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Puncture injuries were prepared by making a track with a sterile 18-guage needle in the livers of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequently, TSNs, SiO2 NPs, or CA-Lp mixture was applied to each track as a hemostatic agent, or direct pressure was put onto the stab wound as a control.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because it is almost impossible to impose pressure in a minimally invasive procedure, no pressure was applied at the sites where the adhesives were treated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 2e, both TSNs and CA-Lp successfully stopped bleeding immediately after their application.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, severe blood loss occurred in the control without any adhesives, even though direct pressure was exerted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of bleeding was measured by the weight difference of a filter paper before and after absorbing the blood (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant decrease in the amount of blood was observed when TSNs, SiO2 NPs or CA-Lp was applied, and their hemostatic effects were similar (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Contrast enhancement in various medical modalities', 'The contrast effects of TSNs on fluoroscopy, CT and ultrasonography were compared to those of SiO2 NPs, CA-Lp, and a commercially available iodine contrast agent (iopamidol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since X-ray absorption of the contrast agents results in signal attenuation on fluoroscopy, their contrast effects were assessed by signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray fluoroscopic image reveals that TSNs significantly attenuate incident X-ray beam, showing a contrast efficiency comparable to that of iodine-containing CA-Lp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SNR of TSNs is 15 times higher than that of SiO2 NPs, demonstrating that the TaOx core is responsible for the high X-ray attenuation31,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To evaluate the detection limit of TSNs on CT, we compared the CT numbers (Hounsfield unit, HU) of serially diluted solutions with different TSN concentrations (Supplementary Fig 12a,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast effect increases linearly as the concentration increases, and both TSNs and iopamidol are distinguishable from water down to a concentration of 12.5 mg ml1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast efficiencies of TSNs and iopamidol, calculated from the slopes of X-ray fluoroscopy SNR versus concentration, are 0.18 mg1 ml and 0.17 mg1 ml, respectively, while SiO2 NPs exhibit a negligible contrast enhancement effect (1.8 × 104 mg1 ml).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CT contrast enhancement effect of TSNs was also evaluated by the slope of CT number versus concentration and compared with those of iopamidol and SiO2 NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast enhancement of TSNs is 18.6 HU mg1 ml, which is 1.5 and 150 times higher than those of CA-Lp (12.9 HU mg1 ml) and SiO2 NPs (0.12 HU mg1 ml), respectively (Fig 3b, and Supplementary Fig 12b,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stronger contrast effect of TSNs in CT can be attributed to the higher X-ray photon energy used in CT (applied voltage is 140 kV) compared to that used in fluoroscopy (60 kV), and the well-matched K-edge value of tantalum (67.4 keV) compared with that of iodine (33.2 keV)31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Contrast enhancement of TSNs on various imaging modalities in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Contrast enhancement on X-ray fluoroscopy.

allowing for the use of TSNs in ultrasonography-guided procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The contrast enhancements of TSNs and SiO2 NPs were investigated using an agarose phantom loaded with different concentrations of the nanoparticles (Fig 3c and Supplementary Fig 12c,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The US signal of TSNs is distinguishable from the background starting from a nanoparticle concentration of 8 mg ml1, and the signal enhancement of TSNs is three times higher than that of SiO2 NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well known that the back-scattered US generated from Rayleigh scattering is affected by the material size, compressibility and density difference from environment49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, not only a larger hydrodynamic size of TSNs (20.4 nm) than that of SiO2 NPs (16.4 nm) but also a high density of the TaOx core (8.18 g cm3) contributed to the more intense US signals in comparison to those of SiO2 NPs, enabling a much lower detection limit (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The in vivo contrast enhancement of TSNs in different imaging modalities was assessed using the aforementioned liver puncture model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the contrast effects of TSNs and CA-Lp on fluoroscopy are similar, the liver columns filled with each glue exhibit almost identical contrast in the fluoroscope images (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the glues are clearly distinguished from the ribs with a similar thickness, which can be advantageous in clinical situations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, CT imaging reveals that the mean HU value of TSNs is 1.8 times greater than that of the vertebrae and slightly higher than that of CA-Lp (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since it is hard to compare directly the contrast enhancements on ultrasonography in a rat due to the small size of its liver, the contrast enhancement of TSNs, CA-Lp, and SiO2 NPs was investigated using the calf liver injected with each glue at a depth of 4 cm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bright mode (B-mode) ultrasonography imaging shows that the signals from SiO2 NPs and TSNs are bright enough to be distinguished from the background liver tissue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the reflection of US waves from the CA-Lp applied tissue could be detected, its difference from background is insignificant (Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Biocompatibility', 'One of the major hurdles for intracorporeal use of CA-Lp is its severe toxicity and the inflammatory reactions caused by the by-products of CA-Lp such as formaldehyde5,50,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent reports, however, have shown that both SiO2 and TaOx nanoparticles are highly biocompatible23,27,41,52,53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, tantalum-based stents and implants, and tantalum powder-containing embolic materials (Onyx; Covidien, Irvine, CA) are frequently used in clinics thanks to their biocompatibility54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure the biocompatibility of TSNs, their cytotoxicity was evaluated using cell morphology analysis and viability assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To mimic in vivo glue application conditions, a small drop of glue-gel was placed at the bottom center of a culture dish, on which a cell suspension was added.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After 24 h, most of the cells incubated with the TSNs were attached to the plate surface regardless of their distance from the gel, while the cells near CA-Lp failed to attach to the plate surface and exhibited a round shape (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Methylthiazole tetrazolium (MTT) assay shows that the viability of the cells incubated with CA-Lp decreases in a dose-dependent manner while those cells incubated with TSNs exhibit little cytotoxicity up to a concentration of 800 g ml1, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility of TSNs (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SiO2 NPs have a lower cytotoxicity than CA-Lp, but they still show a significant cytotoxicity at a high concentration of 800 g ml1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since SiO2 NPs are known to induce hemolysis, the hemolysis effects of TSNs were investigated55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4c, most of the red blood cells were lysed at a SiO2 NP concentration of 100 g ml1, but the hemolysis rate by TSNs was much lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Evaluation of in vitro

100 m.Full size image', 'Because both TSNs and SiO2 NPs have similar silica structure, the observed difference in their hemolytic effect is unexpected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the difference of their hemolysis effect, we evaluated the influence of the nanoparticle size, the amount of fluorescent dye, and the thickness of silica shell on hemolysis rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hemolysis rate of silica nanoparticles with sizes of 22, 30, and 105 nm reveals that the largest 105 nm-sized NPs exhibit lower hemolysis rate than that of the 22 nm- and 30 nm-sized silica nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig 13c), which is consistent with the previous report55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of incorporated dye does not affect the hemolysis rate of TSNs and SiO2 NPs (Supplementary Fig 13df).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Most strikingly, TSN-5 with 5 nm-thick silica shell show much higher hemolysis rate than TSNs with 1 nm-thick silica shell and TaOx NPs without silica shell (Supplementary Fig 13h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the previous reports, hemolysis by silica nanoparticles was attributed to the direct interaction between the cell membrane and silanol groups on the nanoparticle surface, and the mesoporous silica nanoparticles are known to exhibit lower hemolytic effect than dense silica nanoparticles55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microporous structure of TSNs seems to be responsible for their lower hemolysis rate compared to that of the dense silica nanoparticles (see the gas adsorption data in Supplementary Fig 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In vivo biocompatibility of TSNs was assessed by histologically analysing the tissues after applying TSNs or CA-Lp in a liver puncture model (Fig 4d and Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A significant difference in the level of tissue inflammation was observed between the biological tissues treated with TSNs and those with CA-Lp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the previous reports, an immediate immune reaction was identified around the CA-Lp applied regions within 3 days, and this response developed to a severe inflammation in and around the adhesives at 14 days, and persisted over 56 days51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the TSN was observed to be innocuous, which is consistent with the previous report on the inertness of tantalum54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the tantalum oxide is a chemically stable material, the degradation of TSNs is slow compared to that of polymer adhesives as shown in histological analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The inertness of the tantalum oxide in TSNs was also supported by the extremely slow dissolution of tantalum in body fluid (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only little portion spreads to other organs including liver, spleen, and lung, and most of the nanoparticles ( greater than 99.5%) remains in the applied position (Supplementary Fig 17).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over six weeks, there was no adverse effect in our blood test, proving their long-term biocompatibility in vivo (Supplementary Fig 18).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the intracorporeal use of adhesives for image-guided procedures, their low cellular toxicity, low inflammatory reaction derived from the chemical stability of oxides, and proved long-term biocompatibility can be crucial advantages over CA-Lp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Real-time image-guided procedures', 'To investigate the potential of TSNs for image-guided surgery, we conducted two surgical demonstrations to show their utility not only as an adhesive for medical intervention with real-time imaging modalities but also as an anatomical marker to guide resection and/or radiotherapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The liver puncture model was performed in a rabbit without abdominal incision under the guidance of fluoroscopy and ultrasonography (Fig 5ad, Supplementary Fig 19 and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using dynamic X-ray fluoroscopic imaging, we could distinguish TSNs from other organs including vertebrae, in spite of low X-ray

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Due to the recent development of medical imaging techniques and interventional devices, many surgeries have been aided by image-guided and minimally-invasive procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, conventional surgeries for vessel occlusion, bleeding control, internal organ biopsy, spondylosis, and some early-stage tumours (for example, hepatocellular carcinoma) are being replaced by percutaneous angioplasty, catheter-directed embolotherapy, needle biopsy, vertebroplasty and radiofrequency/microwave ablation, respectively, all of which are conducted under the guidance of medical imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'However, nanomaterials relevant to the image-guided procedures are rarely suggested for use in medical practice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ideally, they should be identifiable on clinical imaging (for example, X-ray fluoroscopy, CT, US and magnetic resonance imaging), convenient to apply percutaneously with a catheter or needle, biocompatible to minimize adverse reactions in body, and able to achieve surgical goals (for example, hemostasis, tissue adhesion and tissue marking).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the unique possibilities of nanomaterials, including high image contrasting effects, adhesive properties, and dispersibility in various fluids, biocompatible NPs have enough potential to replace the conventional materials used in image-guided procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, TSNs can be a representative material that satisfies various requirements for medical applications by providing imaging capability, convenient administration, biocompatibility, and effectiveness.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The inertness of tantalum oxide not only provides good biocompatibility, but also hinders its biodegradation in body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike typical imaging studies by systemic intravenous administration of contrast agents, image-guided procedures usually require a very small quantity of NPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with the required amount of tantalum used as an intravenous CT contrast agent (840 mg kg1)41, our study utilized less than one fiftieth of tantalum (15 mg kg1), which accounted for only 0.020.05 ml.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, almost all TSNs are remained in the target areas without severe adverse reactions, suggesting that the systemic effects of TSNs can be minor, when administered locally with image guidance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a fiducial marker before a surgery, poor biodegradability hardly causes a problem because both the index tumour and the marker will be removed all together (en bloc).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In radiotherapy, persistent marking of an index tumour facilitates the consistent targeting and follow-up during serial treatments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a non-degradable tissue adhesive and a fiducial marker, TSNs exhibit substantially ameliorated inflammatory reactions compared with the clinical adhesive mixture, CA-Lp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we designed and synthesized multifunctional and biocompatible tantalum oxide/silica core/shell nanoparticles (TSNs) composed of radiopaque tantalum oxide core with multimodal imaging capability and silica shell with a strong tissue adhesive property.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As designed, the TSN glue is clearly visualized by clinical imaging modalities including X-ray fluoroscopy, CT, and ultrasonography and exhibits adhesive property similar to that of the CA-Lp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the TSNs cause much less cellular toxicity and less inflammation than the clinically used CA-Lp, which is very important for intracorporeal use of adhesives for image-guided procedures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we demonstrated the applications of TSNs to hemostatic adhesive for minimally invasive procedures and as immobilized marker for image-guided procedures by combining their multifunctional characteristics and tissue adhesive property.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the needs of various tissue adhesives in medicine, our results give additional insights on biomedical applications of designed multifunctional nanoparticles, which can be expanded to image-guided procedure and regenerative medicine as well as drug delivery and cancer diagnosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
