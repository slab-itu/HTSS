The interactions between a small molecule and G-quadruplexes are visualized by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Guanine-rich oligonucleotides can fold into quadruple-stranded helical structures known as G-quadruplexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mounting experimental evidence has gathered suggesting that these non-canonical nucleic acid structures form in vivo and play essential biological roles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, to date, there are no small-molecule optical probes to image G-quadruplexes in live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we report the design and development of a small fluorescent molecule, which can be used as an optical probe for G-quadruplexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the fluorescence lifetime of this new probe changes considerably upon interaction with different nucleic acid topologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, longer fluorescence lifetimes are observed in vitro for G-quadruplexes than for double- and single-stranded nucleic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cellular studies confirm that this molecule is cell permeable, has low cytotoxicity and localizes primarily in the cell nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, live-cell imaging suggests that the probe can be used to study the interaction of small molecules with G-quadruplexes in vivo.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The dynamic nature of DNA enables a range of non-canonical structures to potentially form in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  G-quadruplexes, in particular, have received increasing attention having been implicated in biologically important roles such as genomic instability, telomerase dysfunction and the regulation of gene expression1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet there still remains considerable debate as to whether these structures form in vivo; given that G-quadruplexes arise from non-covalent interactions, isolating them in their native form from live cells is a very challenging task.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, many studies have focused on fixed cells where the structural dynamics of nucleic acids can be more readily controlled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encouragingly, in this context, G-quadruplexes have been visualized using antibodies4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, questions remain as to whether these observations are the result of artefacts from chromatin fixation7,8, or if the high affinity of the antibodies induce G-quadruplex formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, dynamic relationships between G-quadruplex formation and its cellular consequences are precluded from these studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of these points, cell-permeable small-molecule optical probes would provide an ideal means of monitoring these structures in live cells and in real-time overcoming the limitation of fixed cell artefacts9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, such probes would provide invaluable insight into the criteria required for drugability of G-quadruplexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While a number of optical probes for G-quadruplexes have been reported over the past few years, to date none of these has been convincingly used to image them in live cells11,12,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High levels of selectivity for G-quadruplexes over duplex DNA have been achieved in vitro by designing molecules that have the appropriate shape and size to fit on top of the G-tetrad15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Typical ligand features include large aromatic surfaces for end-on  stacking with G-tetrads, a central positive charge to favourably polarize the aromatic system and steric bulk that prevents intercalation into double-stranded (ds) DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, establishing the extent to which these features translate to target engagement in live cells is not a trivial process16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, the development of probes that can incorporate these features while possessing photophysical properties that can be monitored in vivo could provide crucial information regarding quadruplexligand interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Highly stable planarized triarylmethyl carbocations named trianguleniums provide an ideal platform for such a probe (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These compounds have suitable structural features to interact with nucleic acids, they can be functionalized18,19,20,21 and, more importantly, they have intrinsic fluorescence that arises from the aromatic core22,23 Yet, surprisingly, no DNA binding studies have been reported for variants of the first reported triangulenium, namely TOTA24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is probably due to the limited number of non-alkyl modifications reported to date together with the modest affinity of TOTA for DNA (Ka104).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as is typical of small-molecule optical probes, nucleic acids quench the emission of TOTA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, it was envisaged that, first, subtle alteration of the electronic and in turn redox properties of the aromatic core would enable a fluorescence turn-on system to be obtained; and that, second, the affinity of triangulenium core for nucleic acids (in particular G-quadruplexes) could be significantly enhanced by the addition of appropriately placed substituents to the core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Synthetic route to trianguleniums.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) nBuLi, TEMED, Et2O, 0 °C to rt then (EtO)2CO, 18 h; (ii) HBF4·Et2O, Et2O, rt, 5 min; (iii) RNH2, NMP, room temperature, 2 h then NH4PF6 (aq); (iv) RNH2, NMP, 110 °C, 2 h then NH4PF6(aq); (v) Py·HCl, 200 °C, 1 h.Full size image', 'Herein we present the synthesis and photophysical characterization of new triangulenium derivatives ADOTA-M and DAOTA-M2 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate a turn-on fluorescence enhancement for DAOTA-M2 in the presence of nucleic acids as well as significant dependence of its fluorescence lifetime on nucleic acid topology using a wide range of in vitro DNA and RNA models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After showing that it is possible to detect G-quadruplexes even in the presence of other competing nucleic acid topologies, we also report fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) studies of this probe in live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data show that this probe has a great potential to study the interaction between small molecules and G-quadruplexes in live cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Synthesis of optical probes', 'The new compounds ADOTA-M and DAOTA-M2 were prepared following procedures previously reported for analogous mono- and bis-substituted trianguleniums (Fig 1)20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both compounds show the expected resonances in the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra where the integration between the core aromatic protons and the aliphatic substituents are consistent with mono- and bis-substituted trianguleniums for ADOTA-M and DAOTA-M2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The formulations were confirmed by mass spectrometry and elemental analyses (Supplementary Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Photophysical properties of TOTA, ADOTA-M and DAOTA-M2', 'Trianguleniums have interesting photophysical properties, which can be used for sensing and imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet the incorporation of tertiary amines covalently linked to the fluorophore can significantly alter these properties26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, before studying their interaction with nucleic acids, the response of the compounds to changes in the local aqueous environment (for example, oxygen concentration, polarity, viscosity and pH) was investigated and the main changes observed are summarized in Fig 2 and Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As will be discussed later, this information provides important clues regarding the photophysical changes the probes undergo upon their interaction with nucleic acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: The effect of the local aqueous environment on the fluorescence of TOTA, ADOTA-M and DAOTA-M2.pH 1.0 (red) and 7.3 (green) measurements were recorded in 0.1 M HCl and 10 mM lithium cacodylate buffer containing 100 mM KCl (pH 7.3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements in 50% 1,4-dioxane (blue) were recorded at pH 7.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For TCSPC traces, raw data and the IRF are coloured black and grey, respectively.Full size image', 'Table 1 Photophysical properties of TOTA, ADOTA-M and DAOTA-M2 in different local aqueous environments.Full size table', 'Under physiological conditions (10 mM lithium cacodylate (pH 7.3) and 100 mM KCl), the quantum yields of ADOTA-M and DAOTA-M2 are 0.042 and 0.032, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neither variation of ionic strength (0220 mM KCl) nor deoxygenation of the solutions, have any significant effect upon fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, simultaneously decreasing solvent polarity and increasing viscosity by the addition of 1,4-dioxane results in 0.3-fold reduction of fluorescence and a red shift in emission maxima.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The time correlated-single photon counting (TCSPC) fluorescence lifetime data show that bi-exponential decays (or tri-exponential in the case of 1,4-dioxane/water mixtures) are necessary to adequately describe the above systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that at least two emitting species are present in solution for ADOTA-M and DAOTA-M2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An excited state equilibrium between the carbocation and carbinol forms of the compounds can be excluded due to the mono-exponential decay of TOTA, which has the lowest pKR+ (a measure of carbocation stability) for triangulenium compounds reported to date27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, protonation of the morpholino group(s) was explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Steady-state emission pH titrations reveal the excited pKa* to be 4.68±0.10 and 4.54±0.13 for ADOTA-M and DAOTA-M2 (±values=s.d., n=3; Supplementary Fig 5), respectively, while TOTA, which has no amines, shows no such pH dependence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the spectra at pH 7.3 and 1.0 shows that protonation of the amines results in a substantial enhancement of fluorescence (1015-fold) and long-lived mono-exponential fluorescence decays (Fig 2 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, at pH 7.3, the fluorescence intensity decay of DAOTA-M2 is not concentration dependent (0.250 M; Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, as is well established in the literature28, this indicates that the shorter fluorescence lifetime component at pH 7.3 is due to intramolecular photo-induced electron transfer (PET) interaction between a donor amine and excited state acceptor fluorophore.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is also interesting to note that at pH 7.3, ADOTA-M retains a substantial proportion of the long-lived fluorescence component, whereas for DAOTA-M2 this value is significantly lower.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that in addition to protonation, conformational changes at the nanosecond time scale may be of importance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of DAOTA-M2, the number of morpholino groups incorporated in the molecule most likely enhances the probability of PET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interactions of trianguleniums with DNA', 'Having established the key photophysical properties of these molecules, the effect of different DNA topologies on the steady-state emission of the three trianguleniums under study was investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These investigations showed that irrespective of topology, DNA strongly quenches the emission of TOTA (as previously reported24) and ADOTA-M. Interestingly, this was not the case with DAOTA-M2, which displayed fluorescence enhancement on the addition of DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This enhancement is unlikely to be associated with changes in protonation since a red shift (14 nm) in emission was observed on binding to DNA rather than the blue shift associated to protonation (Fig 2 and Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also unlikely to be associated with the local environment inside DNAwhich has low polarityas the photophysics in low polarity 1,4-dioxane/water mixtures (see above) suggests that fluorescence should be quenched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of this unexpected DNA binding-dependent behaviour, the potential of the compound to be a turn-on probe for different DNA topologies was explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, emission titrations were conducted to determine the affinity of DAOTA-M2 to single-stranded (ss) DNA (ss17), dsDNA (CT-DNA and ds17) and G-quadruplex DNA containing two, three or four guanine tetrads (that is, TBA, myc2345 and PDGF-A, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All binding isotherms, calculated association constants and errors are shown in Supplementary Fig 7 (as well as absorption titrations that were used to determine compoundDNA stoichiometries).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies show that DAOTA-M2 binds with reasonable affinity (log Ka between 5.7 and 6.1) to all the DNA structures under study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Moreover, while fluorescence enhancement in the presence of G-quadruplex structures is greater than those of other DNA models (G-quadruplex=3.34.9; ssDNA/dsDNA=2.02.8; initial quantum yield 0.032), these differences by steady-state intensity alone would be insufficient for cellular imaging of DNA topologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is owing to possible differences in uptake/intracellular localization altering the effective concentration of the probe and, in turn, the intensity observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, fluorescence lifetimes are concentration independent, and therefore fluorescence lifetime measurements with DAOTA-M2 have the potential for high-contrast measurements to distinguish between different nucleic acid topologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, TCSPC-FLIM was used to measure the emission lifetime of DAOTA-M2 in the presence of a broad range of DNA (dsDNA or ssDNA, 13 models), RNA (dsRNA or ssRNA, 6 models) and G-quadruplex structures (RNA or DNA based, 6 models, see Methods section for comprehensive list of all models).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interesting trends in the lifetime measurements for different nucleic acid topologies were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A bi-exponential decay was necessary to describe the time-resolved data for DAOTA-M2 in the presence of the different nucleic acid structures under study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that more than one species or conformation of the fluorophore exists in these samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that these traces were measured in the presence of at least a twofold excess of nucleic acid compared with the end point of steady-state emission titrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the concentration of free compound should be negligible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, while the goodness of fit  is between 0.8 and 1.3 in all cases, it was anticipated that there would be some correlation of the lifetime and amplitude for each component to achieve the best overall fit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, for each nucleic acid topology, two-dimensional plots of 1 versus 1 and 2 versus 2 were created (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 8).

lifetime components, 1/1 offers no contrast between different nucleic acid structures (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This short and similar lifetime component (1=17 ns) indicates that DAOTA-M2 resides in an environment independent of the nucleic acid topology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, the longer 2 offers a broad spectrum of lifetimes (616 ns), progressing from shorter lifetimes for dsDNA and ssDNA to significantly longer lifetimes for RNA and G-quadruplexes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, when 2 is also considered, DNA, RNA and G-quadruplex models can be clearly resolved despite partial overlap of their 2 values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To ensure that our observations are independent of the fitting model, all data were analysed using the phasor approach29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This involves plotting the real versus imaginary components of a Fourier transform of the decay for each pixel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centroids of the resultant phasor transform clouds are shown in Fig 3b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All points lie inside the universal circle (red line) indicating that a multi-exponential model is required to analyse the original decay data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the separation of DNA, RNA and G-quadruplex signals is comparable to that of the 2 versus 2 plots (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This clear separation supports our previous assertion that ss/ds DNA, RNA and G-quadruplexes can be distinguished by the lifetime of bound DAOTA-M2 and the observed correlation is fitting model independent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In a cellular context, more dynamic mixtures of nucleic acids should be expected as opposed to regions of only DNA, RNA or G-quadruplex models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the ability of DAOTA-M2 to detect G-quadruplexes (myc2345 was used as an example) in the presence of dsDNA (CT-DNA) was determined by titrating duplex DNA into a solution of G-quadruplex DNA containing DAOTA-M2 (Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gradual shifts to shorter 2/2 values were observed on increasing CT-DNA concentration as DAOTA-M2 relocated from a G-quadruplex to duplex environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ability of a non-emissive G-quadruplex ligand to displace DAOTA-M2 from G-quadruplexes was also explored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the addition of increasing amounts of pyridostatin (a well-established G-quadruplex binder17,30) to a mixture of G-quadruplex DNA, duplex DNA and DAOTA-M2, progressive shifts of 2/2 to lower values were observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is indicative of DAOTA-M2 being displaced from G-quadruplex DNA by a more selective binder (pyridostatin), and binding to duplex DNA instead (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Live-cell imaging with DAOTA-M2', 'The observed difference in fluorescence lifetimes between nucleic acid models suggested that DAOTA-M2 could be used as an optical probe to study the interactions between a small molecule and G-quadruplexes in live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To explore this, cytotoxicity of DAOTA-M2 was first established in the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS (Supplementary Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Encouragingly, DAOTA-M2 did not display significant cytotoxicity with an IC50100 M over 24 h (in comparison with TOTA with an IC50=12.7±2.1 M over 24 h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, using confocal microscopy, cellular uptake was investigated using a wide range of DAOTA-M2 incubation times (424 h) and non-toxic concentrations

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'There is increasing experimental evidence suggesting that G-quadruplexes play essential roles in key biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, there has been a growing demand for tools to study these non-canonical DNA structures in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While antibodies have been successfully used to image G-quadruplexes in fixed cells, live-cell studies are of vital importance in rigorously addressing the dynamic cause and effect of these structures in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the development of cell-permeable small-molecule optical probes for use in real-time live-cell imaging is highly desirable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this paper, we have shown that the triangulenium core provides a versatile platform for the design of fluorescent probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through the incorporation of essential design features of a good G-quadruplex binder, a novel DNA turn-on probe DAOTA-M2 has been developed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A key feature of this probe is that its emissive lifetime changes considerably upon interaction with different nucleic acid topologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, significantly higher 2/2 values were observed upon interaction of DAOTA-M2 with a wide range of G-quadruplexes, compared with dsDNA or ssDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note that there is some overlap of the probes 2/2 values upon its interaction with G-quadruplexes and RNAalthough the values for G-quadruplexes are still consistently higher.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this is not idealand will indeed need to be optimized in the futurethe differences are large enough to be detectable.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While a two-component model accurately describes all our data, the origin of 1 and 2 is not clear for each nucleic acid structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two equally plausible explanations for these observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first is that the compound resides in two distinct binding pockets with distinct local environments (for example, groove binding and intercalation/ stacking).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The second is that the compound itself has different excited state lifetimes, and resides in one or more highly similar binding pockets that can be adequately described by 1 and 2 (for example, two G-tetrads in the same G-quadruplex, intercalation between different base pairs in duplex DNA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter interpretation correlates well with the intramolecular PET transfer quenching observed in purely aqueous systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The favourable nuclear localization and minimal toxicity of this new compound also enabled us to carry out FLIM studies in live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our FLIM data suggest that DAOTA-M2 does interact with G-quadruplexes in live cells, as evidenced by high 2/2 values observed for this dye in the nuclei of live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by preliminary data that demonstrate a real-time decrease in DAOTA-M2 2/2 values upon addition of pyridostatina stronger G-quadruplex binder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To confirm that these observations are due to G-quadruplex interactions as opposed to DNA damage subsequently induced by pyridostatin, a control experiment was performed using cisplatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even after 24 h incubation with this non-specific nucleic acid damaging agent, no significant change in the 2/2 values of DAOTA-M2 was observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates that DNA damage is not responsible for the 2/2 changes observed upon pyridostatin treatment, and suggests that our methodology could potentially be used to probe the dynamics of small-molecule/G-quadruplexes interactions in live cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This work builds on the growing evidence that small molecules can indeed interact with G-quadruplexes in cellulo, and shows that a useful degree of binding is achievable based on current G-quadruplex ligand design paradigms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our future efforts will concentrate on designing fluorescence lifetime-based probes that are capable of achieving greater signal differentiation between G-quadruplex- and RNA-binding sites.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
