Variants near CHRNA3/5 and APOE have age- and sex-related effects on human lifespan  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Lifespan is a trait of enormous personal interest.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Research into the biological basis of human lifespan, however, is hampered by the long time to death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a novel approach of regressing (272,081) parental lifespans beyond age 40 years on participant genotype in a new large data set (UK Biobank), we here show that common variants near the apolipoprotein E and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 5 genes are associated with lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects are strongly sex and age dependent, with APOE 4 differentially influencing maternal lifespan (P=4.2 × 1015, effect 1.24 years of maternal life per imputed risk allele in parent; sex difference, P=0.011), and a locus near CHRNA3/5 differentially affecting paternal lifespan (P=4.8 × 1011, effect 0.86 years per allele; sex difference P=0.075).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rare homozygous carriers of the risk alleles at both loci are predicted to have 3.33.7 years shorter lives.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Being alive is the simplest, summary measure of overall health.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the genomics of longevity offer the prospect of illuminating system-wide components of health that are not related to disease and biological systems involved in both frailty and healthy ageing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic factors are suggested to account for up to 1625% of the variation in long-livedness1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, whereas studies in model organisms have revealed signalling pathways with profound influences on lifespan3, only one locus has consistently been associated with human survival: APOE4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Efforts to discover additional age-related genetic loci are impeded by difficulties in recruiting very large prospective cohorts with lifespan and genomic data that are required to give sufficient power to detect the expected small effects associated with this complex trait.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although many population cohorts can capture family history, subjects recruited in middle age will have aged or deceased parents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UK Biobank7 (UKB) is a particularly rich resource in this context: half a million people were recruited aged 4069 years and genome-wide genotypes are presently available for 152,732 subjects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first genetic association analysis in UKB for lung function has recently been published8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hundreds of thousands of parents of UKB participants were deceased at the time of baseline measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of phenotyped (but not genotyped) relatives of subjects who have been genotyped to conduct association analyses between phenotype and probabilistically inferred genotype, generalizes the approach of Wacholder et al.9 from Mendelian traits to quantitative traits and provides a step change in power, applicable to all late onset conditions, where direct genotyping may be problematic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use this approach to show that common variants near the apolipoprotein E and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 5 genes are associated with lifespan in a sex- and age-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The APOE 4 allele differentially influences maternal lifespan (P=4.2 × 1015, effect 1.24 years of maternal life per imputed risk allele in parent), and a locus near CHRNA3/5 differentially affects paternal lifespan (P=4.8 × 1011, effect 0.86 years per allele).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 0.3% of Europeans who are homozygous carriers of the risk alleles at both loci are predicted to have 3.33.7 years shorter lives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the major genetic determinants of lifespan are both very pleiotropic disease susceptibility genes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Discovery cohort', 'In the discovery phase genome-wide association (GWAS), using rank-normalized Martingale residuals of survivorship for 116,425 UKB subjects of unambiguous British genetic ancestry, we discovered 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Supplementary Table 1) with a P value  less_than 106 for association in meta-analysis of paternal and maternal lifespans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, only two loci reached genome-wide significance (P less_than 5 × 108), on chromosome 15 and 19 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several SNPs are associated with lifespan in each region, the most significant being rs429358 in APOE at chromosome 19q13 and rs10519203 in a locus including HYKK, PSMA4, CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 at chromosome 15q24 (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the chromosome 15 association, which we refer to hereafter as CHRNA3/5, appears much stronger in men than in women and conversely the APOE association is much stronger in women than men (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  QQ plots (Supplementary Fig 1ac) show no inflation, suggesting that there are no issues with relatedness, population structure or other confounding factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conditioning on both sentinel SNPs removed all other signals in these regions and the distribution of P values appeared consistent with chance (Supplementary Fig 1d); there was also no evidence of associations at FOXO3 and 5q33, recently associated with nonagenarian subjects6,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Genome-wide association with parental lifespan.Manhattan plots are presented for the discovery analysis in genetically British individuals (a) for fathers, (b) for mothers, (c) for meta-analysis of parents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In each case the trait is the Martingale residuals of the Cox proportional hazards model of parental lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  rs429358 and rs10519203 explain, respectively, 0.026/0.068% and 0.042/0.012% of the variance of the Martingale residuals in fathers/mothers.Full size image', 'Figure 2:

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have shown that common variants at two loci are associated with lifespan, and these effects are strongly age- and sex-related.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The APOE* 4 allele increases in particular the risk of mortality for older females, whereas a variant near CHRNA3/5 has stronger effects on young to middle-aged men.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Apolipoprotein E is a receptor-binding ligand on the surface of chylomicrons, intermediate and low-density lipoprotein particles, and is involved in uptake and redistribution of lipids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is widely expressed, most strongly in the liver, brain and retina.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The signal we observe is driven by rs429358, a non-synonymous Cys112Arg variant, which defines the 4 allele and which has not previously been shown to be the causal variant influencing lifespan.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous findings of association of longevity with rs4420638 near TOMM40 (refs 5, 6), appear to arise from linkage disequilibrium with rs429358 (not genotyped in the prior work).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The APOE locus and in some cases specifically the 4 allele have been associated with an array of age-related conditions and traits, including Alzheimers dementia11, age-related cognitive decline12, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides13, C-reactive protein14, coronary disease risk15 as well as centenarianship16 and survival to 90 years5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association we observe with lifespan is potentially due to the combined impact of the cognitive and cardiometabolic effects on mortality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There has been debate as to whether APOE primarily influences mortality across the spectrum of ages at death (frailty) or survival to old age (longevity).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In stratified analyses for parental deaths before and after 75 years, we see a much stronger effect of 4 on dying after 75 years, for both mothers and fathers, providing strong additional evidence for an effect on survival to  greater than 90 years4,5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Whereas APOE influences the lifespan of fathers and mothers, we observe robust evidence for a stronger effect in mothers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No sex-specificity has been reported for the effects on lipids, but there is evidence for a stronger effect of APOE on Alzheimers risk in females17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect on cognitive function is also much stronger in females18 and longitudinal analyses confirm the mortality effect is strongest for female lifespans of about 7095 years19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Smoking is the single-most important cause of premature death in the developed world, increasing the risk of many diseases including lung cancer, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 locus encodes various nicotinic acetyl choline receptor subunits, ion channels that mediate fast signal transduction at synapses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various SNPs in our associated interval have been associated with smoking quantity20, nicotine dependence20, lung cancer21, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease22, peripheral arterial disease20, alcohol dependence (independent of smoking status23) and schizophrenia24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The region is modestly associated (P=1 × 104) with airway obstruction in never smokers25, and the effects on lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remain after adjusting for self-reported smoking intensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus it remains unclear if these effects are mediated entirely by smoking behaviour, if they also involve an increased vulnerability to the harmful effects of smoking or if there is a smoking-independent effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The recently discovered association with exhaled carbon monoxide levels26 suggests aspects of cigarette smoke exposure not captured by common measures of smoking quantity and thus the residual associations may still be due to genetic effects on smoking exposure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly a potential association (P=6 × 107) has been reported for serum albumin levels in a large meta-analysis27, a known biomarker of all-cause mortality after 5-year follow-up28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the sentinel SNP are also associated with cotinine29 (the principal metabolite of nicotine), 1-methylurate29 (a major metabolite of theophylline, used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and lathosterol29 (an indicator of whole body cholesterol synthesis).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is no reported evidence of sex differentiation in the known associations but we observe a much stronger effect of rs10519203 for younger paternal deaths, consistent with the higher prevalence of smoking among men of that generation30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The relative importance of frailty genes, affecting the age-specific susceptibility to death, versus longevity genes, which promote long life, has been much debated31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CHRNA3/5 locus is the first true frailty gene to be identified, as the mortality of carriers of the risk variant decreases to nearly that of non-carriers with advancing age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be explained by the longer-lived carriers of the G allele at rs10519203 possessing other genetic or environmental factors that compensate for the risk (for example, never smoked).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast APOE has a stronger effect on mortality for the older deaths.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We did not replicate the recently published chromosome 5q33 or FOXO3 associations with survival to 90 years of age6,10 with P values over 0.02 for 87 SNPs across 400 kb, despite considerable power to do so.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possible explanations include that these loci influence longevity in a way that is diluted when considering deaths from 40 onwards, or that they are false positive associations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In spite of the similar magnitude of effects for CHRNA3/5 and APOE in our analysis of  greater than 190,000 parental deaths, the CHRNA3/5 association was not seen in the largest published nonagenarian analyses6,10, probably because the association with death is very weak after 75 years, and is driven mostly by younger male deaths, many of which might have already occurred before participation in the population-based studies analysed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The adverse effects on lifespan of the two associated loci have both likely been hidden from natural selection, CHRNA3/5 because its effect is mediated through the modern risk of nicotine dependence and APOE, because its effect occurs long after child-bearing age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absence of evidence for other loci affecting lifespan (either in terms of more genome-wide significant associationsFig 1 or an enrichment of suggestive associations beyond that expected by chanceSupplementary Fig 1d), is difficult to interpret as rarer variants or those with weaker effects might be discovered in even larger analyses, such as with the entire UKB sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Nonetheless, we have shown that even a trait as complex as parental lifespan is amenable to GWAS using the power provided by hundreds of thousands of data points.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two lifespan loci discovered here both contain very pleiotropic disease susceptibility genes, influencing risk for multiple disorders that cause most deaths in the developed world.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The major genetic risk factors for dying appear to represent the sum total of genetic effects on mortality mediated by the different diseases they influence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large number of parental lifespans analysed provide robust evidence for large sex- and age-differentiated effects of both APOE and CHRNA3/5 variants, which merit further investigation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, whereas parental traits may be of interest in diverse spheres of biology, lifespan, as the ultimate trait, benefits more than any other from using the kinship between offspring and parent to increase power for association.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Outline', 'Our study closely followed standard methods for GWAS meta-analysis studies of a quantitative trait (GWAMA)32, with human lifespan as the phenotype, with the following exceptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the phenotyped subjects were parents of participants in UKB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parental phenotypes were regressed on offspring genotypes, in effect imputing parent genotype from offspring.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effects measured are thus of offspring genotype on parental phenotype and the expected allelic doses in the parental generation are thus half the measured doses (in offspring).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Effect estimates per parental allele are thus twice that of offspring allele, which is what we report unless otherwise stated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, as all subjects were genotyped on only two highly overlapping arrays, focus was on array, rather than imputed genotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'UK Biobank', 'UKB participants were recruited from the general UK population across 22 centres between 2006 and 2010 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subjects were aged 4069 at baseline, underwent extensive phenotyping by questionnaire and clinic measurements, and provided a blood sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All participants gave written informed consent and the study was approved by the North West Multicentre Research Ethics Committee.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UKB has Human Tissue Authority research tissue bank approval, meaning separate ethical approvals are not required to use the existing data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genotyping is in progress, with a wave 1 public release in June/July 2015.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data access to UKB was granted under MAF 8304.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Phenotypes and genotypes were downloaded direct from UKB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In total, 502,664 subjects had phenotypic information available, of whom 152,732 had been genotyped.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parental ages and whether they were alive at time of interview were reported in the UKB questionnaire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Estonian biobank', 'The Estonian Biobank33 is the population-based biobank of the Estonian Genome Center at the University of Tartu (EGCUT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 51,380 volunteer participants (aged 18103) were recruited between 2002 and 2011.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cohort included 5% of the population from all counties of Estonia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At recruitment, the participants completed an extensive questionnaire on health, lifestyle and genealogy and provided a blood sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A broad informed consent enables regular linkage of

effect allele count of the sentinel SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three models were fitted, a sex-stratified model and sex-specific models for males and females.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the data structure, where an excess number of mortalities were included in the genotyped set compared with the full cohort, baseline hazard and survival estimates are not valid, but hazard ratios are.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a sensitivity analysis, a casecohort analysis was performed43, resulting in identical effect estimates and P values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The replication cohorts results (Estonian Biobank, self-declared British and self-declared non-British) were then combined using inverse variance meta-analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, for the unambiguously genomically British samples only (the discovery phase), we looked at the effect of the risk SNPs over two separate age ranges 4075 and  greater than 75 (approximately the mean age at death).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this, the same Cox models were rerun, but for the first age range, upper age was truncated at 75, and subjects who lived past aged 75 were recorded as survivors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the second age range, only subjects who had survived to age 75 were entered into the analysis, survival to age 75 was thus complete, and the analysis only examined survival beyond age 75.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The expected allelic effect of one allele in offspring is 0.5 alleles in parents.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This can be seen, for an allele (A1) with frequency p, because', '

if the offspring is homozygous for the other allele (A0), the expected dosage of A1 in a parent is p (that is, the probability that the non-inherited allele is A1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  if the offspring is homozygous A1 the expected dosage in the parent is 2q=1+p.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  if the offspring is heterozygous, the expected dosage in a parent is the average of the previous two values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Measured effects of offspring genotypes, other than the variances explained in Fig 1 have therefore all been doubled, to give measurement on the natural scalethe effect on parents lifespan of one allele in parents.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
