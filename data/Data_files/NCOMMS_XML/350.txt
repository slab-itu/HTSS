Radiocarbon constraints on the extent and evolution of the South Pacific glacial carbon pool  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'During the last deglaciation, the opposing patterns of atmospheric CO2 and radiocarbon activities (14C) suggest the release of 14C-depleted CO2 from old carbon reservoirs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although evidences point to the deep Pacific as a major reservoir of this 14C-depleted carbon, its extent and evolution still need to be constrained.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use sediment cores retrieved along a South Pacific transect to reconstruct the spatio-temporal evolution of 14C over the last 30,000 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In 2,5003,600 m water depth, we find 14C-depleted deep waters with a maximum glacial offset to atmospheric 14C (14C=1,000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a box model, we test the hypothesis that these low values might have been caused by an interaction of aging and hydrothermal CO2 influx.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe a rejuvenation of circumpolar deep waters synchronous and potentially contributing to the initial deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings constrain parts of the glacial carbon pool to the deep South Pacific.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The deep ocean contains the largest carbon reservoir within the global carbon cycle that might interact with the atmosphere on glacial/interglacial timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2 by 90 p.p.m.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1) was probably linked to significant modifications in oceanic circulation that resulted in increasing rates of CO2 outgassing2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, in order to sequester large amounts of atmospheric CO2, the deep glacial ocean must have been effectively cut off from gas exchange with the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Throughout a glacial period, the isolation of deep waters from the surface, and hence the atmosphere, leads to an accumulation of carbon (CO2) and nutrients in the deep ocean, which is accompanied by a progressive depletion of radiocarbon (14C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, the older a water mass gets, the more enriched in 14C-depleted CO2 it becomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'So far, only isolated occurrences of old glacial water masses have been identified in the North and South Pacific, as well as in the South Atlantic, which suggests that the storage of CO2 occurred in the deep glacial ocean4,5,6,7,8 (Supplementary Fig 1 and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the overturning circulation of the Southern Ocean (SO), where nowadays 65% of all deep waters make first contact with the atmosphere9, controls the ventilation of the oceans interior.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the surface residence time of upwelled waters before re-subduction is an important factor controlling the efficiency of airsea gas exchange.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changes in the climate system of the SO, such as the intensification or weakening of stratification or westerly winds have the potential to significantly alter the oceanic uptake or release of CO2 (refs 2, 3 and 10) and likewise the radiocarbon budget of deep waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the circum-Antarctic upwelling region is considered the most likely deglacial pathway of stored old carbon from the abyss to the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this oceanic window, carbon-rich deep waters like Pacific Deep Water (PDW) are mixed and upwelled and provide a major source for Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW), formed close to the Subantarctic Front (SAF)11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, AAIW is able to propagate the circulation- and outgassing signals into the major ocean basins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this context, numerous intermediate-water records have been analysed to track the timing and pathways of SO deep water upwelling12,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spatial and temporal dimension of the glacial reservoir itself as well as the pathway, magnitude and process of the deglacial CO2 release remain elusive, although evidence for carbon storage in the deep glacial southwest Pacific is increasing5,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, to better constrain the glacial carbon pool, its vertical extent and evolution, we use 14C-records from six sediment cores at the New Zealand Margin (NZM; Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 2), covering the major South Pacific water masses AAIW and Upper Circumpolar Deep Water/Lower Circumpolar Deep Water between 830 and 4,300 m water depth (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To assess the lateral extent of the glacial carbon pool, we have additionally analysed an open-ocean sediment core from the East Pacific Rise (EPR; PS75/059-2; 3,613 m) located more than 4,000 km east of the NZM (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our NZM depth transect is well suited for the analysis of SO water mass ventilation as we can record 14C-depleted deep waters on their way to the upwelling region further south, as well as recently subducted intermediate waters moving towards the north (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Overview of the NZM showing core locations and water masses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Map of the Southwest Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red bar represents the lateral area covered by our sediment core transect at the NZM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yellow circleposition of our sediment core from the EPR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue circlesprevious studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  U938 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5), MD972120 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15), MD972121 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Green lineSubtropical Front.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue lineSubantarctic Front66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Map created using GeoMapApp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Water mass section of modern South Pacific 14C-concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sediment cores (red and yellow dots) projected into WOCE line P16 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AABW, Antarctic Bottom Water;

Building on the hypothesis of increased glacial outgassing of volcanic CO2 along mid-ocean ridges (MORs)17,18,19, we use a simple box model to highlight that the most extreme 14C-depletion between 2,500 and 3,600 m water depth might be explained by a combination of aged 14C-depleted waters and the additional admixture of 14C-dead hydrothermal CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the end of the glacial period, our deep water 14C-values increase throughout the water column in unison to rising atmospheric CO2-values1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these patterns, we conclude that the deep South Pacific was an important contributor to the deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Throughout the water column, the observed glacial 14C-range in our cores exceeds the modern and Holocene values by a factor of 5 and indicates strong age differences and therefore enhanced stratification of the intermediate and deep glacial South Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Along its pathway in the global thermohaline circulation PDW is fed into circumpolar waters and constitutes todays oldest water mass.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 14C-depleted PDW presently extends to 2,0002,500 m north of the Chatham Rise close to New Zealand25 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From our transect, we are able to show that during the LGM, significantly 14C-depleted and aged water masses occupied depths between 2,000 and 4,300 m in the Southern Westerly (SW) Pacific (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data locate the core of the 14C-depleted water mass at the NZM in a of 2,500 m (PS75/100-4; modern depth of Upper Circumpolar Deep Water; Fig 4), yielding a maximum deep water to atmosphere offset in radiocarbon activities (14C) of approximately 1,000.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysing 14C corrects for any impacts of changes in 14C production26 as well as for variable oceanatmosphere exchange rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A corresponding apparent ventilation age, based on benthic minus reservoir-corrected planktic 14C ages would equate to 8,000 years (Supplementary Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar glacial 14C depletion of about 870 was reported from sediment core U938, which was recovered at the NZM in a water depth of 2,700 m (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  5) (Figs 1a and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesize that these extremely low 14C-values might be the result of the admixture of 14C-dead hydrothermal CO2 into a water mass with an initial high ventilation age, which was estimated to at least 2,700 years6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upper and lower boundary of this old water mass are marked by higher 14C-values of 550 to 600 indicating a highly stratified water column (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar 14C-values were reported at the NZM north of Chatham Rise at 2,314 m (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This confines the most radiocarbon-depleted waters to a depth below 2,300 m. The observed trend of 14C between 830 and 4,300 m parallels the highest glacial nutrient concentrations off New Zealand, between 2,000 and 3,000 m (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27) (Fig 5), likewise indicative for the presence of aged, nutrient rich (low 13C) and radiocarbon-depleted waters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, the 13C reconstructions might yield a certain bias, as endobenthic (Uvigerina) instead epibenthic (Cibicidoides) foraminifera were used27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Comparison of oceanic and atmospheric proxy records.14C-values (oceanatmosphere) of (a) the intermediate Pacific region; PS75/104-1 and SO213-84-1 (this study); MD972120 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15) (green line: Bounty Trough); MV99-MC19/GC31/PC08 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  12) (black line: Northeast Pacific); (b) CDW 14C; PS75 and SO213 records (this study); MD972121 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6) (light blue line: north of Chatham Rise); U9385 (red square: Bounty Trough); Coral dredges8 (red line: Drake Passage); MD07-3076 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4 (brown line: South Atlantic); and Modern SW-Pacific UCDW 14C (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  67) (pink triangle).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Atmospheric CO2 concentrations1 (red line); WAIS 18O record69 (orange line) and atmospheric 14C-values20 (black line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  UCDW, Upper Circumpolar Deep Water.Full size image', 'Figure 5: Vertical distribution of carbon isotopes off New Zealand throughout the LGM.Orange line14C (this study).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Green line 13CUvigerina27.Full size image', 'We traced the 14C-depleted glacial carbon reservoir off New Zealand to the central South Pacific (EPR) 4,000 km east of the NZM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this location, 14C-values are as negative as 900 at 3,600 m (PS75/059-2; Figs 1a and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, we are confident that this water mass was not only restricted to the NZM but seems to have occupied large parts of the South Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further off, in the Drake Passage and the South Atlantic, glacial water masses have been identified in CDWs with 14C-values as low as 330 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8) and 540 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6), respectively (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In their timing and amplitudes, these records are similar to our Pacific radiocarbon signature characterizing the upper and lower boundary of the old carbon pool (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our intermediate-water record (SO213-84-1; modern depth of AAIW) shows the highest glacial 14C-values of our transect (approximately 90).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suggest that the 14C-depleted deep waters represent the very old return flow from the North Pacific (PDW), similar to the modern circulation pattern (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of radiocarbon in our reconstruction might indicate a floating carbon pool instead of a stagnant bottom layer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several records from the North Pacific might corroborate this assumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Gulf of Alaska28 (MD02-2489) and off Kamchatka29 (MD01-2416), as well, the glacial mid-depth water mass (Kamchatka) shows a considerable higher benthic to planktic 14C offset than the deeper water mass off Alaska.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional data from the northwest Pacific suggest the lowest glacial 14C values in a water depth of 2,300 m with better ventilated waters above and below21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Atlantic Ocean as well, Ferrari et al.30 and Burke et al.31 observed a mid-depth (floating) radiocarbon anomaly.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A floating carbon pool might furthermore explain why no sign of old carbon was found in the deep equatorial Pacific below 4,000 m (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, this record might have missed the old, mid-depth carbon pool above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Any explanation for the pronounced glacial radiocarbon-depletion of the deep SO has to involve a limited oceanatmosphere exchange due to strengthened ocean stratification under glacial boundary conditions3 (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Northward-expanded Antarctic sea ice and SW Winds33 contributed to reduced airsea gas exchange and upwelling of deep-waters30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface freshening by melting sea-ice in the source regions of intermediate waters34 and enhanced formation of highly saline Antarctic Bottom Water35 may have set a density structure that led to reduced mixing and the encasement of old PDW (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the shoaling of North Atlantic Deep Water30 might have reduced the contribution of freshly ventilated waters into South Pacific CDW below 2,000 m. These interacting key processes may have significantly contributed to the low radiocarbon values and are consistent with an enhanced glacial storage of carbon in the deep ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Schematic representation of South Pacific overturning circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Glacial pattern: northernmost extent of sea ice and SWW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased AABW-salinity by brine rejection favours stratification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased dust input promotes primary production and drawdown of CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Deglacial pattern: upwelling induced by southward shift of Antarctic sea ice and SWW.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The erosion of the deep-water carbon pool releases 14C-depleted CO2 towards the atmosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following airsea gas exchange, the outgassing signal is incorporated into newly formed AAIW (light blue shading).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blue shading: poorly ventilated old and CO2-rich waters; Darkest shading 2,5003,600 m: water level influenced by hydrothermal CO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Green arrows: intermediate water; orange arrows: deep-water; light-blue areas: sea ice; SWW: Southern Westerly Winds; coloured circles: sediment cores (colour coding according to Fig 2); black circle: SO213-79-2no glacial data; and circular arrows: diffusional and diapycnal mixing.Full size image', 'Old water masses of 5,0008,000 years are expected to be strongly oxygen depleted36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Sarnthein et al.7, water masses with 14C values lower than 350 would be completely anoxic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, pronounced anoxia have not been documented in the deep South Pacific between 2,500 and 3,600 m. Therefore, an admixture of 14C-dead carbon via submarine tectonic activity along MOR18 into a an old water mass in the deep South Pacific might have contributed to the extremely low radiocarbon values of the water mass at 2,5003,600 m. During the LGM, sea floor eruption rates along tectonically active plate boundaries may have intensified due to the lower glacial sea level17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process might have released significant amounts of 14C-dead CO2 into the water column.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a simple 1-box model (Methods), we tested our hypothesis and calculated if the injection of hydrothermal CO2 into the deep Pacific has the potential to amplify the 14C minimum throughout the LGM (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To overcome the influence of the variable atmospheric 14C-levels26,37, we compared our simulated 14C to our reconstructed 14C values (deep ocean-to-atmosphere offset).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The probably time-delayed response of submarine volcanism to changes in sea level complicate our flux calculations19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A crucial prerequisite for our hypothesis of the admixture of hydrothermal CO2 is the presence of an already aged water mass with high nutrient concentrations and low 14C levels (Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the record of MD972121 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6) (2,314 m), the glacial ventilation age off New Zealand is at least 2,700 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, radiocarbon values might have been even lower as the MD972121 record lacks any data points between 25 kyr and 18 cal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ka (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our 14C record of SO213-82-1 (2,066 m;
