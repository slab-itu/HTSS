Direct observation of mineralorganic composite formation reveals occlusion mechanism  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Manipulation of inorganic materials with organic macromolecules enables organisms to create biominerals such as bones and seashells, where occlusion of biomacromolecules within individual crystals generates superior mechanical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Current understanding of this process largely comes from studying the entrapment of micron-size particles in cooling melts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, by investigating micelle incorporation in calcite with atomic force microscopy and micromechanical simulations, we show that different mechanisms govern nanoscale occlusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By simultaneously visualizing the micelles and propagating step edges, we demonstrate that the micelles experience significant compression during occlusion, which is accompanied by cavity formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This generates local lattice strain, leading to enhanced mechanical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results give new insight into the formation of occlusions in natural and synthetic crystals, and will facilitate the synthesis of multifunctional nanocomposite crystals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Soluble additives are widely used to control crystallization processes, providing an experimentally simple and versatile strategy to generate crystals with defined polymorphs, morphologies and sizes1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Significant insights into additive-directed crystallization, and the effects of these additives on crystal properties, have come from in vitro studies of biomineralization processes2,3, where the use of advanced characterization methods have demonstrated that the macromolecules active in controlling crystallization become occluded within the crystal structure, modifying crystal texture and lattice strain4,5,6,7,8, causing local disorder9 and enhancing mechanical properties10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tomography-based studies have even succeeded in revealing atomic-scale structural11 and chemical12 characteristics of interfaces between the crystal lattice and occluded organic materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Translation of this strategy to synthetic systems promises the ability to control crystal properties and to generate composite structures5,13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, implementation of this approach is currently limited by a poor understanding of the mechanisms by which nanoscale additives are incorporated within single crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much of our knowledge comes from in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies supported by computational models, in which changes in crystal shape and step speed (growth rate) are used as indirect probes of additive/crystal interactions17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without the ability to image the individual additives, this process cannot be fully characterized or understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we profit from recent demonstrations that high densities of functionalized nanoparticles can be occluded within inorganic crystals5,15,16 to reveal the mechanisms that govern the adsorption and occlusion of organic additives within single calcite crystals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Based on our experimental data, micromechanical simulations and previous transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data, which show that the occluded micellesand any associated cavities that may be retainedare ellipsoidal in form, we can now reconstruct the entire incorporation process for both large (Fig 3b) and small micelles (Fig 3d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Following micelle binding to step edges (Fig 3b,d, stage 1), the passing steps begin to compress the micelles (Fig 3b,d, stage 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each layer, the steps stop when the increase in bending energy of the micelle balances the chemical potential that drives step advancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bending resistance of the micelle thus strains the surrounding crystal, which reduces the driving force for crystallization around the micelle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This then contributes to the formation of a gap (Fig 3b,d, stage 3) in a manner similar to the creation of hollow cores in the strain field of a dislocation20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the micelle becomes approximately half buried, the difficulty of extending the crystal steps over the surface of the underlying micelleand thus creating an overhangmay also contribute to gap formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the growth front passes beyond the micelle, the gap develops into a channel (Fig 3b,d, stage 4), which ultimately closes over as the strain field of the compressed micelle recedes behind the advancing growth front (Fig 3b,d, stages 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These data do not enable us to determine whether cavities are retained or eliminated during the growth process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Either scenario should be possible depending on the supersaturation and particle size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A simple extrapolation to biomineralsin which similar sized occlusions are observed by TEMsuggests they may be a combination of cavities and proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, this is consistent with a previous TEM study of the aragonite plates in nacre21, and would also explain why occlusions can far exceed the sizes expected for individual proteins22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, previous studies of a wide range of calcite/particle composite crystals using scanning electron microscopy and TEM have not reported evidence for retained cavities14,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is particularly clear for occluded gold nanoparticles, which should be easily distinguished from an associated cavity using TEM by virtue of their high electron density.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cavities observed upon dissolution of the composite crystals suggest that the cavities may remain; however, these might also be attributable to the high lattice strain present in the vicinity of the micelles, which renders these regions more soluble than strain-free regions (Fig 2k and Supplementary Fig 4di).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This study provides significant new insights into additive-controlled crystallization processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering first the calcite/micelle system, the previous study of Kim et al.5 concluded from a purely structural analysis that the ellipsoidal occlusions seen in TEM corresponded to occluded micelles that were incorporated as a result of their affinity for adsorption to the crystal face with a morphology determined by that interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanistic understanding obtained from our current in situ observations refines this picture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Micelles actually bind to advancing steps and undergo a morphological change during occlusion as a result of compression by the steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kim et al.5 also showed that the calcite/micelle crystals are harder than pure calcite, where this change was associated with a large compressive strain gradient in the crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The current work implies this local strain is a direct result of the chemical driving force behind the step advancement, which ensures that the steps will continue to compress the micelle until the resulting lattice strain energy equals the solution chemical potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Much of our current understanding of additive occlusion derives from optical and theoretical studies on incorporation of large particulates within crystals during their freezing transitions23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under those conditions, particle entrapment occurs only above a critical growth velocity of the solidliquid interface23,24, and depends on many factors including the thermal diffusivity of the particle and melt, wetting of the crystal face by the particles, the size and buoyancy of the particles, and the melt viscosity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Particle entrapment during growth from solution, in contrast, has received considerably less attention14, although it has been suggested that similar factors may be important.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The model that emerges here stands in stark contrast to those previously proposed23,24,25, in which particles are incorporated either because of the slow diffusive velocity of the liquid towards the crystal surface relative to the interface growth velocity or because of hydrodynamic forces that correlate with crystallization speed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead the particles become entrapped because they bind specifically to steps, enabling successive steps to close around them.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, the increase in incorporation efficiency at higher growth rates is a consequence of the greater rate of step generation with increasing supersaturation18, rather than the enhanced growth front velocity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results therefore provide a new understanding of the dynamics of additive/crystal interactions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with the insight they provide concerning evidence on the strain-induced toughening of minerals, these findings will inform the synthesis of novel composite crystals through the optimization of variables, such as adsorbatestep interactions, bending rigidity and supersaturation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
