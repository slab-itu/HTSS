Observing the overall rocking motion of a protein in a crystal  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The large majority of three-dimensional structures of biological macromolecules have been determined by X-ray diffraction of crystalline samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-resolution structure determination crucially depends on the homogeneity of the protein crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall rocking motion of molecules in the crystal is expected to influence diffraction quality, and such motion may therefore affect the process of solving crystal structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, so far overall molecular motion has not directly been observed in protein crystals, and the timescale of such dynamics remains unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we use solid-state NMR, X-ray diffraction methods and s-long molecular dynamics simulations to directly characterize the rigid-body motion of a protein in different crystal forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For ubiquitin crystals investigated in this study we determine the range of possible correlation times of rocking motion, 0.1100 s. The amplitude of rocking varies from one crystal form to another and is correlated with the resolution obtainable in X-ray diffraction experiments.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'X-ray crystallography is the quintessential method for macromolecular structure determination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method provides atomic coordinates along with atomic displacement parameters, which are generally expressed as B-factors and reflect the coordinate uncertainty around the mean positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coordinate precision in X-ray structures is limited by several factors, including model errors and invalid restraints1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The precision is also adversely affected by protein dynamics and static disorder, which together contribute to the blurring of electron density maps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Motion has therefore long been treated as a nuisance limiting the effective resolution at which a crystallographic structure can be solved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent methodological advances have shown, however, that useful dynamical information can be extracted from X-ray diffraction (XRD) data2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, provided that high-resolution structural information is available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several investigators pointed out the importance of rigid-body motions, which limit the achievable resolution in XRD experiments4,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Overall motion is routinely modelled from XRD data using translation-libration-screw (TLS) analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, refined TLS parameters offer only a simplified view of rotational and translational dynamics in the crystal lattice, meaning that some ambiguity remains regarding the physical nature of the modelled motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, diffraction data cannot provide insights into the timescale of motions, making it difficult to distinguish between static disorder and molecular motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, it is not possible to ascertain that the dynamics modeled from XRD data accurately reflect the overall motion of the molecules in the crystal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy provides atomic-level-resolution access to crystalline proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MAS NMR is complementary to XRD in the sense that it can provide atom-specific insights into reorientational motions at a large number of sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of NMR observables, in particular relaxation rate constants and dipolar couplings, probe exclusively the angular motion as sensed at each individual site while being unaffected by static disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, NMR measurements can provide direct access to the timescale at which dynamics occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been hypothesized before that rocking motion in crystals might be observable through spin relaxation parameters in MAS NMR11, yet no experimental evidence has to date been produced.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rotational diffusion and its effects have been investigated for membrane proteins embedded in lipid bilayers12,13,14,15, but reorientational fluctuations in protein crystals remain largely unexplored.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report on the combined use of MAS NMR, XRD and microsecond-long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of explicit crystal lattices to characterize the overall rocking motion and the local internal dynamics of the protein ubiquitin in three different crystal forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide direct insight into the amplitudes and timescales of rocking motion in the three crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They illuminate the possibly general relationship that exists between crystalline rocking motions and the experimental resolution achieved in XRD and MAS NMR experiments.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'MAS NMR and XRD of three different ubiquitin crystals', 'Disentangling overall rigid-body motion (herein referred to as rocking motion) from internal dynamics is a challenge, regardless of whether XRD or MAS NMR is used as an experimental tool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because both types of motion contribute to the dynamics-related observables, that is, to B-factors in XRD and to relaxation and dipolar-coupling parameters in MAS NMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the present study, these complications were circumvented by using different crystal forms of the same protein, allowing us to assume that the internal dynamics are similaran assumption that we verify belowand thus to focus on differences in overall motion of the protein in the crystal lattices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We prepared three different crystal forms of the 8-kDa globular protein ubiquitin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These crystals are henceforth referred to as MPD-ub, cubic-PEG-ub and rod-PEG-ub, reflecting the different precipitation agents (methyl-pentanediol (MPD) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), respectively) and the morphology of the crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Structures for the three crystal forms have been solved before and correspond to Protein Data Bank entries 3ONS (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  16), 3N30 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  17) and 3EHV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  18), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that our crystals were consistent with the previously reported structures, XRD data were collected on the three crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the two types of PEG crystals, we collected diffraction data at 100 K and solved the structures by molecular replacement, confirming the identity to the two already reported sets of coordinates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our MPD-ub crystals appeared too thin for conventional structure determination when crystallized under the conditions that yield high-quality MAS NMR spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, a powder pattern obtained by rotating a scoop of MPD-ub crystals into the X-ray beam yielded a distribution of Bragg peaks similar to that calculated from the previously deposited structure (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our crystals display the same space group as crystals previously obtained in the same crystallization conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used MAS NMR to further study the three crystal forms and obtain information about their dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1 shows MAS NMR 1H15N correlation spectra recorded on the three crystal forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A first interesting observation concerns the number of peaks found in the three spectra.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MPD-ub, which has been extensively characterized before19,20,21, one set of well-resolved 1H15N cross-peaks is observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cubic-PEG-ub many residues give rise to two peaks, as exemplified in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In rod-PEG-ub we findfor several instances of well-isolated regions of the spectrumthree peaks per residue.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This peak multiplicity is in good agreement with the number of non-equivalent molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystals, i.e.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  one (MPD-ub), two (cubic-PEG-ub) and three (rod-PEG-ub), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, similar peak duplication has been reported previously in NMR spectra of ubiquitin crystals (prepared under slightly different conditions and resulting in different NMR spectra) and polymorphs of GB1 crystals22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We obtained residue-specific assignments of a majority of HN resonances in cubic-PEG-ub, using a set of 1H- and 13C-detected three-dimensional correlation spectra (assignments are reported in Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the higher spectral complexity arising from the three non-equivalent molecules, we did not assign the spectra of rod-PEG-ub.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: High-resolution solid-state NMR spectra of three different crystal forms of ubiquitin.1H15N NMR

study dynamics in MPD-ub and cubic-PEG-ub.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In what follows, we rely on three different experimental observables that concurrently probe a wide range of timescales at each amide site in the protein and are informative of both amplitudes and timescales of the dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first parameter, 1H15N dipolar-coupling derived squared order parameter S2, report on the amplitude of motion of HN bond vectors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The value of S2 can range from 1 for a completely rigid bond to 0 for fully dynamically disordered peptide planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dipolar-coupling derived order parameters reflect the net effect from all reorientational motions occurring on timescales shorter than about 100 s. The second parameter, the 15N R1 spin relaxation rate constant, is sensitive to both the amplitude and the timescale of 1H15N bond vector motions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This relaxation parameter is particularly sensitive to dynamics on timescales from tens of picoseconds to 100 nanoseconds (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The third parameter, the 15N R1 spin relaxation rate constant, is also sensitive to both the amplitude and timescale of the motion, but mainly to slower motion, occurring on the nss timescale (see Supplementary Fig 5 and discussion below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysing these three experimental observables therefore provides good insight into motional properties of individual protein residues over a wide range of timescales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2ad shows a comparison of site-specific amide 15N R1 rate constants and NH order parameters in MPD-ub and cubic-PEG-ub, obtained at 300 K sample temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data reveal that the local dynamics in the two crystal forms are generally similar, with few differences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, residues located in secondary structure elements have high order parameters S2 and low R1 relaxation rate constants, indicating that these residues are motionally restricted in both crystal forms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies of MPD-ub showed that low-amplitude motions in the secondary-structure elements occur primarily on the picosecond timescale20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Certain details of local dynamics are reproduced in both crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, an alternating pattern of low/high motional amplitudes in strand 2 is observed in both MPD-ub and cubic-PEG-ub (residues T12V17, dashed outline in Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern arises from alternation of amides which are hydrogen bonded or otherwise exposed to solvent26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarities between the two crystals are also found in several loop regions, such as the 13 loop and the 34 loop, which show similarly increased flexibility (as reflected in the increased R1 and decreased S2 values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, distinct differences in dynamic behaviour are observed at certain sites, as evident from Fig 2a,b.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, high R1, low S2 and high R1 (see further below, Fig 3) values in the 12 loop in MPD-ub are indicative of extensive ns-timescale motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, this loop appears rigid in cubic-PEG-ub, displaying similar dynamics to residues in the secondary-structure regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another prominent example is residue Q62 located in the 25 loop, which displays significant flexibility in cubic-PEG-ub but seems relatively stiff in MPD-ub.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also worth noting that the order parameters in MPD-ub are overall slightly higher than in cubic-PEG-ub.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When applying an overall scaling factor of 1.04 to the S2 values from cubic-PEG-ub, the agreement with MPD-ub data is significantly improved (see Supplementary Fig 6 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed further below, this offset can be explained by the rocking motion of ubiquitin within the crystal lattice of cubic-PEG-ub.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Site-resolved HN dynamics parameters in two different crystal forms from NMR experiments and MD simulations.Per-residue dynamics data obtained from MPD-ub (black), cubic-PEG-ub (red) and ubiquitin in solution (green) as observed by NMR experiments (ad) and MD simulations (eh).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Experimental 15N R1 rate constants and (b) dipolarcoupling derived squared order parameters, S2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cases where two data points per residue could be obtained in cubic-PEG-ub, corresponding to the pair of non-equivalent molecules, these are represented by two distinct symbols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of the spectral overlaps in spectra of cubic-PEG-ub, it was not possible to unambiguously assign all signals to chain A or B;

 #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3c shows that this is indeed the case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Wilson B-factor in cubic-PEG-ub is almost fourfold higher than in MPD-ub and the resolution is significantly lower, which we propose to arise from differences in the respective rocking dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This correlation between NMR 15N R1 relaxation data and XRD resolution is further substantiated by the third crystal form, rod-PEG-ub, which displays lower 15N R1 rates, suggesting that rocking motions are of low amplitude (blue bars in Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Correspondingly, these rod-PEG-ub crystals display a lower Wilson B, and they diffract to high resolution (blue bars in Fig 3c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Similar conclusions can also be reached if a TLS model is used to account for rigid-body motion of proteins in the crystals9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In XRD refinement, TLS modelling is one of the ways by which collective and local motions can be separated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, cubic-PEG-ub shows the highest librational as well as translational amplitude among the three crystal structures (Supplementary Fig 9), in good qualitative agreement with our NMR and MD data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At this stage, it should be reminded that the TLS model is based on certain simplifying assumptions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If a protein molecule experiences a series of small rotations with different pivot points (a likely scenario in the protein crystal lattice), the TLS model may interpret this dynamics as translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this sense, the information content of the TLS parameters is not very different from that of the Wilson B-factor insofar as it is difficult to disentangle libration and translation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is interesting to examine why the same molecule, with overall identical structure and internal dynamics, exhibits more rocking motion in one of the examined crystals than in others.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A direct influence on rocking of the precipitating agent used for crystallization can be excluded on the basis that both cubic-PEG-ub and rod-PEG-ub crystals crystallize in essentially the same condition (sometimes even in the same crystallization drop).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amplitude of the rocking motion is likely to be influenced by the crystal packing densityincreased contact surface area is generally expected to offer more resistance to rocking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our case, the packing density is indeed lowest for the crystal with the most pronounced rocking motion, with solvent content Vs of 58% for cubic-PEG-ub, 49% for MPD-ub and 40% for rod-PEG-ub, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values follow the expected trendlower packing density allows for more overall motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given the small size of this data set, the correspondence of rocking motion and packing density may as well be fortuitous.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus performed a wider analysis seeking to determine whether there is a correlation between packing density and rocking dynamics (as manifested in XRD resolution and B-factors).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A comprehensive search of the Protein Data Bank indeed shows that high solvent content correlates with low resolution and high Wilson B, with correlation coefficients of 0.39 and 0.36, respectively (Supplementary Fig 10a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, these dependencies are subject to strong scatter, reflecting the intricate and complex nature of the crystallization process and the large diversity of the shapes and properties of the analysed structures43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have also repeated this analysis for the subset of crystallographic structures in the Protein Data Bank that have been solved at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results prove to be very similar (cf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supplementary Fig 10a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although not a direct proof, this finding suggests that the spread of orientations observed at cryo-temperatures (typically 100 K) reflects qualitatively the amplitudes of rocking motions at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the disorder associated with rocking motion also persists under cryo-cooling conditions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have shown here that three independent and complementary techniques, NMR, MD and XRD, all provide evidence for an overall rocking motion in protein crystals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rocking motion is (i) observed by NMR, through the increased R1 rates, as well as a slight decrease of order parameters; (ii) reproduced by MD in all-atom crystal lattice simulations; and (iii) confirmed by XRD through the decreased resolution and increased atomic displacement factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have been able to provide for the first time a measure of the timescale at which this motion takes place at room temperature, which turned out to be hundreds of nanoseconds to tens of microseconds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data suggest that rigid-body motion is an important determinant for the resolution achieved in X-ray crystallography and may explain at least partly why visually perfect crystals do not always produce high-resolution XRD data45.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
