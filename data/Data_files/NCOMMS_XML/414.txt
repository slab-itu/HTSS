Beta 1-integrinc-Met cooperation reveals an inside-in survival signalling on autophagy-related endomembranes  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and integrins cooperate to stimulate cell migration and tumour metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that an integrin influences signalling of an RTK, c-Met, from inside the cell, to promote anchorage-independent cell survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, c-Met and 1-integrin co-internalize and become progressively recruited on LC3B-positive autophagy-related endomembranes (ARE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cells growing in suspension, 1-integrin promotes sustained c-Met-dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation on ARE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This signalling is dependent on ATG5 and Beclin1 but not on ATG13, suggesting ARE belong to a non-canonical autophagy pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This 1-integrin-dependent c-Met-sustained signalling on ARE supports anchorage-independent cell survival and growth, tumorigenesis, invasion and lung colonization in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RTKintegrin cooperation has been assumed to occur at the plasma membrane requiring integrin inside-out or outside-in signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results report a novel mode of integrinRTK cooperation, which we term inside-in signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting integrin signalling in addition to adhesion may have relevance for cancer therapy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'c-Met, overexpressed or mutated in cancer, represents a major therapeutic target1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding to its ligand (hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)), triggers cell proliferation, survival and migration1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  c-Met signalling post-internalization3,4,5 is required for cell migration, tumour growth and metastasis3,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, c-Met mutations in the kinase domain are oncogenic not only because they activate c-Met, but also because they promote signalling from endosomes6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mechanisms regulating c-Met/RTK (receptor tyrosine kinase) signalling post-endocytosis, are poorly understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integrins, extracellular matrix transmembrane receptors, also control tumour cell migration/invasion proliferation and survival7,8,9 via bi-directional signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ligand binding in the extracellular matrix (ECM), induces integrin outside-in signalling; involving receptor clustering and activation, evoking intracellular signalling and cellular responses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, signals from other receptors, including RTKs, can trigger inside-out-signalling, where intracellular proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic face of integrins alter their activity, increasing affinity towards the matrix7,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrin trafficking, involving constant plasma membrane-endosomes shuttling facilitating the dynamic regulation of cell adhesion, plays a vital role in regulating cell migration10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'IntegrinRTK cooperation plays a major role in cellular outcome7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mechanisms, especially how the cooperation is spatially orchestrated, are poorly defined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Integrins can bind RTKs directly, promoting their activation14,15,16 or internalization17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, RTKs can increase integrin expression18,19, activation20 and recycling21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is no evidence that integrins and RTKs can cooperate on endomembranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show, in several models including breast and lung cancer cells, that 1-integrin positively regulates the endocytosis of activated c-Met as well as c-Met signalling post-endocytosis, unexpectedly from autophagy-related endomembranes (ARE), likely part of a non-canonical autophagy pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This 1-integrin cooperation, occurs in cells grown in suspension and leads to increased anchorage-independent cell survival/growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We report a novel mode of integrinRTK cooperation, which we term inside-in signalling.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our study reveals a novel non-adhesive function of 1-integrin in cooperation with the RTK c-Met that we call an inside-in signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pathway leads to c-Met-dependent cell anchorage-independent survival/growth, in vivo tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It occurs on LC3B-positive endomembranes, belonging to a non-canonical autophagy pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These AREs represent novel RTK signalling platforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We show for the first time that 1-integrin is a major regulator of the c-Met pathway at two levels: (i) determining optimal internalization of activated c-Met (as shown for PDGFR17) with co-internalization of the two molecules; (ii) post-internalization, on ARE, 1-integrin promotes c-Met-dependent sustained p52Shc and ERK1/2 signalling, likely through acting as a scaffold linking c-Met to p52Shc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'This novel 1-integrin-dependent c-Met signalling occurs in detached cells and is independent of integrin adhesive properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, 4-integrin was reported to mediate RTK signalling by acting as a scaffold, independently of ligand binding, though no known link with trafficking, of either the RTK or 4-integrin44, was reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An active 1-integrin conformer, as triggered by the absence of the endogenous 1-integrin inhibitor SHARPIN or incubation of cells in MnCl2, appears to be required, as c-Met-sustained ERK1/2 signalling is enhanced in these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, trafficked active 1-integrin was shown to reside significantly longer on the endosomes compared with the fast recycling inactive 1-integrins28, consistent with our notion of sustained signalling of c-Met from the ARE.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The classical function of autophagosomes, through fusion with lysosomes, is to promote degradation of intracellular materials and organelles, maintaining cellular homoeostasis40,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently however, phosphorylated Src was shown to localize on autophagosomes in FAK/ cells, leading to its degradation and cell survival46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon EGF stimulation, ERK1/2, and its upstream kinase MEK, localize to pre-autophagosomes and autophagy proteins promote ERK1/2 phosphorylation41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We propose that ARE represent novel platforms for efficient spatial coordination of signalling cascades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that although c-Met1-integrin form a complex independently of their localization on ARE, the complex needs to localize to ARE to allow the 1-integrin scaffolding function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore our data indicate that c-Met activation and c-Met and 1-integrin stability are not influenced by autophagy while c-Met activity, or 1-integrin expression and NXXY domain, have no role on autophagy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1-integrin-LC3B co-localization has been reported previously47, however, this is the first report of c-Met localization on LC3B and Beclin1-positive endomembranes, together with 1-integrin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, c-Met and 1-integrin co-internalize, and progressively accumulate on LC3B and Beclin1-positive vesicles, ARE (optimal enrichment at 120 min of HGF stimulation).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although ARE require further characterization, our results suggest that these endomembranes belong to a recently described non-canonical autophagy pathway, which was so far shown associated with macroendocytic engulfment processes34,35,36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This highlights a novel and unexpected intracellular localization for c-Met signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Metastatic epithelial cancer cells detach from the ECM and survive, due to their anchorage-independent properties, for sufficient time to facilitate distal colonization48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that, in detached cells, c-Met uncouples survival from adhesion and uses 1-integrin as an adaptor to amplify c-Met signalling to ERK1/2, on ARE, leading to increased survival (see model in Fig 8e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, this signalling may occur during specific time-windows of the metastatic process in addition to the classical adhesive property of 1-integrin, which also likely cooperates with c-Met during the metastatic process such as during cell invasion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Integrins are considered to be important cancer therapy targets and several inhibitors, which alter the adhesive property of integrins49,50,51,52,53, are being tested in the clinic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented here suggest that 1-integrin also contributes to cancer metastasis using signalling properties independent from its adhesive function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that alternative therapies to fully alter integrin functions are needed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting integrin signalling in addition to adhesion may have relevance for cancer therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Present models of integrin inside-out and outside-in signalling may need to be refined to encompass the potential contribution of inside-in signalling.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
