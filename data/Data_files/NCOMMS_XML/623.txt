ISGylation controls exosome secretion by promoting lysosomal degradation of MVB proteins  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Exosomes are vesicles secreted to the extracellular environment through fusion with the plasma membrane of specific endosomes called multivesicular bodies (MVB) and mediate cell-to-cell communication in many biological processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posttranslational modifications are involved in the sorting of specific proteins into exosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify ISGylation as a ubiquitin-like modification that controls exosome release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ISGylation induction decreases MVB numbers and impairs exosome secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using ISG15-knockout mice and mice expressing the enzymatically inactive form of the de-ISGylase USP18, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that ISG15 conjugation regulates exosome secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ISG15 conjugation triggers MVB co-localization with lysosomes and promotes the aggregation and degradation of MVB proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, inhibition of lysosomal function or autophagy restores exosome secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, ISGylation of the MVB protein TSG101 induces its aggregation and degradation, being sufficient to impair exosome secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results identify ISGylation as a novel ubiquitin-like modifier in the control of exosome production.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Exosomes are vesicles secreted to the extracellular environment by most cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are key mediators of cell-to-cell communication in many different contexts, including the immune response1,2 and tumour progression3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exosomes originate in endosomal compartments called multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which are late endosomes containing multiple intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) formed by the invagination of the endosomal membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane, ILVs are released as exosomes5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, MVBs can fuse with the lysosomal compartment, resulting in degradation of their content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Exosome composition is not a mere copy of cytosolic content; rather, specific proteins and nucleic acids are selectively sorted into exosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount and content of exosomes can moreover change in response to different stimuli6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such changes in exosome composition determine the final outcome of exosome-mediated communication8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The mechanisms that control exosome composition and content are still not well understood10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Posttranslational modifications such as ubiquitination may play an important role in the sorting of proteins into exosomes11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) recognizes ubiquitinated proteins and sorts them into ILVs14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ESCRT complex is essential for the sorting of proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor into MVBs that are degraded through fusion with lysosomes15, but is also involved in the regulation of exosome composition and secretion16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) that can modify exosomal proteins is SUMO, whose conjugation to hnRNPA2B1 is essential for the sorting of microRNAs into exosomes18, and enhances the secretion of -synuclein into extracellular vesicles (EVs) in an ESCRT-dependent manner19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ISG15 is an interferon (IFN)-/-induced UBL20, which exerts its functions in two distinct states: as a free molecule (intracellular and extracellular)21 or conjugated to target proteins (ISGylation)22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analogous to ubiquitin, ISG15 conjugation is mediated by the consecutive action of an E1-activating enzyme (Ube1L), an E2-conjugating enzyme (UbCH8) and E3 ligases (mHERC6/hHERC5)24,25,26, and counteracted by the specific isopeptidase USP18 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ISGylation was shown to occur in a co-translational process favouring modification of viral proteins in infected cells, which, in turn, interferes with virus assembly or function28,29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, cellular proteins involved in antiviral defense or export of viral particles have been shown to be ISGylated, supporting the antiviral function of ISG15 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  28).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies in mice have demonstrated a role for ISG15 in antiviral immunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, mice lacking ISG15 exhibit a higher susceptibility to several pathogens including virus31 and bacteria32, and this is reverted in USP18-mutant mice, in which high levels of ISG15 conjugation are observed33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, human ISG15 seems to have critical immune functions but not in antiviral immunity; unlike mice, ISG15 deficiency increased viral resistance in humans34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, free extracellular human ISG15 is important in IFN--dependent anti-mycobacterial immunity21, whereas free intracellular ISG15 is involved in USP18-mediated downregulation of IFN-/ signalling35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ISG15 expression blocks the process of virus-budding by different mechanisms such as the blockage of ESCRT machinery in HIV-infected cells36, or in the case of Ebola and other enveloped virus infections, inhibiting the Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, exosomes and viruses share many features, and some viruses have been shown to exploit exosome and microvesicle secretion pathways38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, exosomes are enriched in ISGylation targets, such as TSG101 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  40) and heat-shock proteins41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we show that IFN-I inhibits exosome secretion by inducing protein ISGylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that the ISGylation of the MVB protein TSG101 induces its aggregation and degradation, and this is sufficient for impairing exosome secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the ISGylation-induced defect in exosome secretion is rescued on inhibition of lysosomal function or autophagy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'ISGylation inhibits exosome secretion', 'To analyse the role of ISGylation on exosome production, we first treated Jurkat T cells with IFN-I, to induce ISG15 expression and conjugation (Supplementary Fig 1A), and purified the secreted EVs from their culture supernatants by a serial ultracentrifugation protocol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFN-I treatment inhibited the secretion of the classical exosome markers CD63, TSG101 and CD81 in the purified EVs (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A concomitant decrease in the exosomal markers on IFN-I treatment was also observed after an additional purification step by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient (Supplementary Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the few EVs secreted by IFN-treated cells were recovered in different fractions than the EVs from non-treated cells, suggesting that they might be of different nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the function of ISGylation in controlling EVs secretion, we next overexpressed ISG15 and the machinery responsible for ISGylation (E1, E2 and E3) in HEK293 cells, which mimics the activation of the ISG15 pathway (Supplementary Fig 1A)24,28 without activating other pathways induced by IFN-I treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ISGylation induction inhibited the secretion of EVs containing CD63, TSG101 and CD81 (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To dissect whether the inhibition in exosomal markers secretion was due to ISG15 overexpression itself or to increased ISG15 conjugation to proteins, we overexpressed the ISGylation machinery together with an ISG15 mutated at the carboxy-terminal (ISG15MUT), thus disabling protein conjugation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells overexpressing ISG15MUT showed higher levels of exosomal markers in comparison with ISG15WT (Fig 1c), demonstrating that ISG15 conjugation to proteins, but not free ISG15, is required for the inhibition of exosomal markers secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) showed a decrease in the number of particles secreted on ISG15WT overexpression in comparison with ISG15MUT-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig 1C), indicating that ISGylation is not causing a mere decrease in the sorting of exosomal markers in EVs, but an actual decrease in exosome secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, NTA did not reveal any significant decrease in the secretion of nanoparticles on IFN-I treatment (Supplementary Fig 1D).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: ISGylation inhibits exosome secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Western blot analysis of EVs purified by serial ultracentrifugation from cell culture supernatants from equal numbers of Jurkat T cells untreated (Cont) or treated with 1,000 U ml1 IFN-I for 16 h.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cells secrete a variety of EVs including shedding vesicles, coming from the direct evagination of the plasma membrane, and exosomes, coming from endosomal compartments called MVBs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membrane of MVB invaginates to form ILVs, which are secreted to the extracellular environment on MVB fusion with the plasma membrane5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MVBs can also fuse with the lysosomal compartment for the degradation of their content.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is evidence that different types of MVB co-exist in cells59, although the differences in their composition and the mechanisms that control their biogenesis and final fusion with the lysosome or plasma membrane are not well understood10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, on specific stimuli such as starvation or rapamycin treatment, MVBs can be re-routed to promote their fusion with the lysosomal compartment and thus avoid their fusion with the plasma membrane and the concomitant secretion of exosomes56 demonstrating that the final fate of MVBs is not immutable but can change under specific conditions60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The role of the ESCRT complex in the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins into ILVs for their degradation in the lysosome is well known61 and some of the ESCRT complex components are also involved in the secretion of exosomes and other EVs12,17, although their precise role in the biogenesis of the different types of EVs is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other ubiquitin-like modifiers have been shown to control the composition of EVs, for example, SUMOylation of hnRNPA2B1 promotes the sorting of specific microRNAs into exosomes18, and also controls the sorting of -synuclein into EVs19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15 as a novel regulator of the exosome pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that ISGylation induction by ISG15 machinery overexpression or IFN-I decreases the secretion of exosomal markers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, experiments with the non-conjugable ISG15MUT and with primary cells from mice with defective function of the specific ISG15 de-ISGylase USP18 demonstrated that this effect is mediated by ISG15 conjugation to proteins and not by free ISG15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ISGylation induction by ISG15 overexpression induces a decrease in microparticle secretion, indicating that ISGylation is not merely decreasing the sorting of certain exosomal markers into ILVs but is actually decreasing exosome secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ISGylation induction by IFN-I does not induce a significant decrease in the number of secreted microparticles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could be due to the induction of the secretion of other types of EVs by IFN-I and this is in agreement with previous reports showing that IFN-I can promote the secretion of EVs loaded with antiviral components that are transferred to other cells62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, on ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, the few EVs secreted by IFN-treated cells are recovered in different fractions than the EVs from non-treated cells, suggesting that they might have a different nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the absence of effect of IFN on global particle secretion may indicate that only the EVs derived from MVBs are affected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We also show that ISGylation decreases the numbers of MVBs, but does not prevent the formation of ILVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secretion of exosomes is recovered when the fusion of MVB with lysosomes or autophagosomes is inhibited, indicating that the observed inhibition of exosome secretion is mainly mediated by the induction of MVB degradation by the lysosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance, we show that ISGylation promotes the aggregation and degradation of proteins by the lysosome, and this is in agreement with previous reports in which ISG15-linked proteins associated with the proteins p62 and HDAC-6 involved in the autophagic process52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have observed that ISGylation decreases the number of HRS+ structures without preventing the formation of ILVs, possibly reflecting an accelerated degradation of endosomes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, ISGylation increases the co-localization of the lysosome marker LAMP-1 with HRS, which is usually absent from LAMP-1-positive structures44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether ISGylation of MVB proteins induces the rapid fusion of MVB with lysosomes in an earlier stage of maturation, or whether it directly impairs HRS dissociation from endosomal membranes is not known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A number of ISG15 target proteins are typically present in exosomes and MVBs41, including several components of the ESCRT complex such as TSG101, CHMP2A, CHMP4B and CHMP6 (refs 40, 63, 64).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore conceivable that ISG15 is recruited to MVB by conjugating endosomal proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There, it may promote protein aggregation and enhance MVB degradation by the autophagosomelysosome compartment, thus preventing their fusion with the plasma membrane and the secretion of exosomes (Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have validated the ISGylation of TSG101, which has been previously shown to control the secretion of viral particles40, and we show that TSG101 ISGylation is sufficient to impair exosome secretion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other endosomal proteins are being ISGylated and also contribute to the inhibition of exosome secretion induced by ISG15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TSG101 depletion has been previously shown to inhibit MVB formation65 or to modify the size of MVBs and/or the number of ILVs48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there are significant differences between depletion and ISGylation of TSG101.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ISG15 may be directed to endosomes in a later stage of their maturation and here modify MVB proteins such as TSG101, and promote their aggregation and subsequent degradation by the lysosome without impairing ILV biogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we could not completely rule out any effect of ISGylation on MVB biogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 6: Proposed model for the role of ISGylation in the regulation of exosome secretion.IFN-I induces ISG15 expression and conjugation to MVB proteins such as TSG101.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ISGylation of MVB proteins promotes MVB fusion with lysosomes and degradation, thus inhibiting exosome secretion.Full size image', 'ISGylation has been previously shown to exert an antiviral activity by blocking the exit of viral particles36,40,64,66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ISGylation of multiple MVB proteins and the consequent inhibition of exosome secretion induced by IFN-I would prevent the spreading of viruses that exploit the MVB pathway for their way out the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, exosomes play important roles in cell-to-cell communication during the immune response, tumour progression, neuron survival and many other contexts1,3,4,67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, ISGylation induction by different stimuli such as viral infection, IFN, ischaemia68 or ageing69 can be an important mechanism to regulate exosome-mediated communication in many different situations.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
