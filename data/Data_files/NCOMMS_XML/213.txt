Hypothalamic leptin action is mediated by histone deacetylase 5  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hypothalamic leptin signalling has a key role in food intake and energy-balance control and is often impaired in obese individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we identify histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) as a regulator of leptin signalling and organismal energy balance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Global HDAC5 KO mice have increased food intake and greater diet-induced obesity when fed high-fat diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of HDAC5 activity in the mediobasal hypothalamus increases food intake and modulates pathways implicated in leptin signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show HDAC5 directly regulates STAT3 localization and transcriptional activity via reciprocal STAT3 deacetylation at Lys685 and phosphorylation at Tyr705.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, leptin sensitivity is substantially impaired in HDAC5 loss-of-function mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothalamic HDAC5 overexpression improves leptin action and partially protects against HFD-induced leptin resistance and obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our data suggest that hypothalamic HDAC5 activity is a regulator of leptin signalling that adapts food intake and body weight to our dietary environment.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Over the 20 years since leptins discovery, much has been learned about its downstream targets in the central nervous system and the complex regulatory network controlling food intake, body weight and systemic metabolism1,2,3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Diverse metabolic and genetic approaches have identified the hypothalamus as the primary location for leptin-responsive signalling cascades responsible for controlling energy homeostasis, particularly acting through the melanocortin system3,8,9,10,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Centrally projecting neurons such as proopiomelanocortin (POMC) or Agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons within the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) are primary leptin targets and stimulate or inhibit second-order neurons via GABAergic and glutamatergic projections to numerous brain areas and hypothalamic nuclei, respectively14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  POMC neurons also secrete several bioactive peptide fragments cleaved from POMC including MSH, which activates MC receptors 3 and 4 (MC3r/MC4r) to elicit hypophagia1,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons within the ARC secrete AGRP, which directly competes with MSH as an inverse MC3r/MC4r agonist to promote hyperphagia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The failure to activate leptin signalling in AGRP- and POMC neurons is a key feature of leptin resistance and represents a pivotal event in the development of diet-induced obesity and its comorbid sequelae8,9,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leptin resistance may be in part a heritable trait, but even siblings often display large variations in the propensity to develop leptin resistance despite similar genetics and a comparable socioeconomic environment16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exactly how gene-environment interactions predispose an organism to aberrant leptin signalling remains elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We here pursued the hypothesis that deleterious post-translational modifications of leptin signalling components occur in response to diets and predispose to obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A key mechanism to modulate geneenvironment interactions is the acetylation of lysine residues in histone and non-histone proteins, tightly controlled by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacyetylases (HDACs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC class III family members such as SIRT1 or SIRT3 are well known regulators of energy and glucose metabolism16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Class IIa family members HDAC 4, 5, 7 and 9 excert partially redundant activity in hepatic glucose control17, adipogenesis and adipose tissue (dys)function19,20,21 and muscle differentiation22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Class IIa family members were further shown to be expressed in hypothalamic AGRP and POMC neurons23,24, but a central function in metabolic control and leptin signalling has not been established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We here aimed to assess whether class IIa family member HDAC5 plays a role in the central control of metabolic homeostasis and leptin signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our specific interest in HDAC5 was triggered by the following observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC5 expression is relatively restricted, with highest expression observed in muscle, heart and brain25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC5 is expressed in POMC and AGRP neurons and regulated by the dietary environment23,24, and HDAC5 is shown to be the central epigenetic integrator of an animals adaptive response to short-term and long-term emotional stress26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We here report that HDAC5-mediated deacetylation of STAT3 is an important regulator of hypothalamic leptin signalling and appropriate central nervous system (CNS) control of energy homeostasis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'HDAC5 expression is regulated by dietary lipids and leptin', 'We first aimed to delineate whether the expression of epigenetic regulator HDAC5 is affected by nutrient availability and the metabolic state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothalamic Hdac5 expression was reduced in high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice when compared with chow-fed lean controls (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the relevance of HDAC5 for CNS leptin action, we assessed hypothalamic Hdac5 expression in leptin-deficient (Lepob) mice with and without leptin replacement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Rescue of leptin deficiency normalized hypothalamic Hdac5 expression, which indicates that the state of leptin sensitivity directly affects hypothalamic Hdac5 gene expression (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concomitant non-significant increase of Hdac5 expression in saline-treated Lepob mice that were pair fed to leptin-treated Lepob mice (Fig 1b) prompted us to assess a direct impact of dietary nutrients on hypothalamic Hdac5 gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice subjected to prolonged fasting revealed a decrease in Hdac5 gene expression and an increase after acute refeeding with high-fat diet (HFD; Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because refeeding with fat-free diet did not elevate hypothalamic Hdac5 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, the data suggest that dietary lipids are important for the regulation of HDAC5 in the CNS (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Hypothalamic histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) expression is regulated by nutrient availability and leptin sensitivity.Hypothalamic Hdac5 mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR in (a) lean versus diet-induced obese (DIO) male mice (n=7) and (b) male Lepob mice treated subcutaneously for 6 days with either saline or 1 mg kg1 leptin (n=56).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Saline-treated mice were fed ad libitum (ad lib) or pair-fed to the lower food consumption of the Leptin ad lib group.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Hypothalamic Hdac5 expression was assessed in male C57BL/6J mice that were subjected to 12, 24 or 36 h of fasting as well as refeeding for 6 h with fat-free diet (FFD) or high-fat diet (HFD; n=68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC5, total STAT3, p-STAT3 and ACTIN immunoblots and densitometric analyses of HDAC5 /ACTIN ratios in CLU177 cells (d,e) and primary neurons (f,g) treated for 24 h with leptin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values are means±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were done by two-tailed unpaired Students t-test (a,e,g) or by One-Way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni (b) or Dunnet (c) post hoc tests.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  *P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01 and ***P less_than 0.001 versus Control; #P less_than 0.05 versus 36-h fasting.Full size image', 'HFD-induced obesity did not affect hypothalamic expression levels of HDAC class IIa family members Hdac4 and 9 (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CNS leptin action but not pair-feeding induced the expression of hypothalamic Hdac4 but not Hdac9 (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothalamic Hdac4 and 9 mRNA levels were increased slightly with short-term food deprivation but decreased after prolonged fasting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Refeeding with fat-free diet and HFD decreased hypothalamic Hdac4 mRNA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, hypothalamic Hdac9 levels were slightly increased with refeeding of HFD, and Hdac7 mRNA levels remained unaffected by changes in nutrient availability (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, Hdac5 emerged as the most consistent nutrient-responsive member of the HDAC IIa family within the hypothalamus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next used the hypothalamic cell line CLU177 and primary hypothalamic neurons to delineate the impact of direct leptin action from nutrient availability on HDAC5 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leptin treatment significantly increased HDAC5 protein levels in CLU177 cells treated with 1 g ml1 (Fig 1d,e) and hypothalamic primary neuron with 100 ng ml1 leptin (Fig 1f,g) for 24 h. The increase in HDAC5 levels was paralleled by a 1.4-fold increase in phosphorylation of the known leptin target STAT3 in CLU177 cells and primary neurons, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In summary, hypothalamic Hdac5 expression selectively and specifically responds to leptin signalling, to the availability of dietary lipids, and, possibly, body adiposity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HDAC5 ablation enhances responsiveness to HFD', 'Both male and female global HDAC5 knock-out (KO) mice displayed greater body weight gain than wild-type (WT) littermates when fed HFD for 15 weeks (Fig 2a;

female mice: Supplementary Fig 2b), likely reflecting the lower, but still considerable, fat content of the standard chow diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Male HFD-fed HDAC5 KO mice displayed larger epididymal white adipose tissue and combined interscapular fat pads consisting of white and brown adipose tissue (BAT;

Supplementary Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A correlation of energy expenditure with food intake suggested that HDAC5 KO mice expend more calories to partially compensate for the increase in calorie intake (Supplementary Fig 3f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in energy expenditure was not due to hyperactivity, as revealed by comparable locomotor activity between the two genotypes (Fig 3d), or due to BAT activity, as revealed by unchanged BAT weight (Supplementary Table 1) and unchanged gene expression of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), Ucp2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Ppargc1a) and cell death-inducing dffa-like effector A (Cidea), a BAT-specific regulator of UCP1 activity, thermogenesis and lipolysis31 (Supplementary Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, fuel preference (nutrient partitioning) was similar between genotypes (Fig 3e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that food intake is a causative factor for the obese phenotype and the perturbed compensatory response to consuming HFD of HDAC5 KO mice, implicating the CNS, and particularly the hypothalamus, rather than peripheral sites of action for the role of HDAC5 in the control of energy homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Hypothalamic disruption of HDAC5 activity causes hyperphagia in lean mice and rats.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Feed efficiency was calculated from male HDAC5 KO compared with WT littermates subjected to chow or HFD for in total 8 weeks (n=68).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acute effects of HFD exposure on (b) daily food intake, (c) energy expenditure, (d) locomotor activity and (e) respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were assessed in male HDAC5 WT and KO littermates for a total of 6 days (n=78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Increased food intake in male rats subjected to a single third ventricular injection of HDAC IIa inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid (4PB) compared with vehicle controls (n=67).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) Weekly food intake over 10 weeks of HFD feeding in male C57BL/6J mice with lentiviral shRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC5 or non-silencing shRNA in the MBH (n=1213).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Values represent means±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Statistical analyses were done by either two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc tests (a,b,f,g) or two-tailed unpaired Students t-test (ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) *P less_than 0.05 versus WT-HFD, (be,g) *P less_than 0.05, **P less_than 0.01 and ***P less_than 0.001;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The present experiments demonstrate for the first time that hypothalamic HDAC5 is an important component of leptin signalling and the control of food intake and body weight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothalamic leptin action is of particular importance as a functional unit regulating energy metabolism3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leptin-responsive circuitry in the hypothalamus originates primarily in the arcuate nucleus, an area in close proximity to the median eminence, which has a fenestrated bloodbrain barrier allowing easy access to circulating nutrients and peripheral hormones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, hypothalamic leptin circuitry is positioned to integrate multiple stimuli to orchestrate an adaptive response to changes in the environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leptin is secreted in direct proportion to adipose tissue mass and activates leptin receptors (Lep-R) residing on melanocortin circuitry, transmitting the overall metabolic status and availability of energy stores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In obese individuals, leptin-resistance blocks this feedback loop and leads to a chronically positive energy balance and excessive fat storage8,11,12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  How environmental challenges such as HFD interfere with these complex and sensitive endogenous circuits has been the subject of intense research worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We show here that HDAC5 activity is a component of hypothalamic leptin action and essential for the normal physiological response to a HFD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When challenged with exogenous supraphysiological levels of leptin, HDAC5 KO mice are leptin resistant, while hypothalamic overexpression of HDAC5 increases leptin sensitivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, there is reduced HFD-induced leptin resistance in mice with hypothalamic overexpression of HDAC5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, selective HDAC5 activation is a novel and promising approach to counteract leptin resistance and obesity by targeting the primary interactions between dietary challenges and the CNS control of metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that HDAC5 has a role in the development of leptin resistance is corroborated by a considerable series of findings revealing impaired leptin signalling following loss of HDAC5 function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leptin receptors located on hypothalamic POMC neurons play a pivotal role in central leptin action39,40,41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we also observed that mice lacking HDAC function have a consistent decrease in hypothalamic gene expression of Pomc, a peptide precursor that mediates leptins anorexigenic effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic ablation of Pomc markedly increases food intake and body weight in mice35,36,43, and mutations in POMC induce severe early-onset obesity in humans38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice with Pomc haploinsufficiency display significant increases in food intake and body weight when exposed to a high-fat high-calorie environment45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the reduction in Pomc gene expression, we found increased body adiposity and food intake in HFD-fed HDAC5 KO mice, and partial protection from diet-induced obesity in mice with hypothalamic overexpression of HDAC5 relative to the appropriate controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By counting the number of POMC-expressing cells in the arcuate nucleus of HFD-fed WT and KO mice, we could conclude that changes in food intake and body weight in HDAC5 KO mice are not mediated via a loss of POMC neurons3,35,36,38,43, but rather via signalling cascades upstream of POMC.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding of a normal physiological response of HDAC5 KO mice towards pharmacological activation or inhibition of melanocortin receptor 3 and 4 signalling further suggests that leptin resistance could be mediated at the level of the leptin receptor or via downstream Jak/Stat3 and Pi3k gene expression in first-order neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In mice with lentiviral knockdown of HDAC5 in the MBH, we observed altered expression of Pi3k and Jak/Stat3, signalling molecules mediating leptin effects on Pomc gene expression and food intake27,28,29,33,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, STAT3 phosphorylation was induced in the arcuate nucleus of WT mice after leptin administration, but blunted in leptin-treated HDAC5 KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'STAT3 phosphorylation is a crucial event that directly links STAT3 transcriptional activity with leptin action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct interactions between HDAC5 and STAT3 and a potential role for HDAC5-mediated STAT3 activation have not previously been described.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with our principal hypothesis, a single report suggested STAT3-mediated recruitment of HDAC5 to the Ptpn13 promoter30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate here for the first time that HDAC5 directly associates with STAT3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we did not use HDAC5 or STAT3 overexpression or protein tagging for co-IP experiments, thus precluding false-positive artifacts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Direct interaction of STAT3 has been reported for other HDAC family members such as Sirt1 (refs 33, 34, 36) and HDACs 1, 2 and 3 (refs 34, 37), but the overall impact of those HDACSTAT3 interactions for the transcriptional activity of STAT3 remains controversial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, STAT3 acetylation at Lys685 by the histone acetyltransferase p300 was considered critical for STAT3 dimerization and full transcriptional activity, and STAT3 deacetylation by HDACs was linked with decreased transcriptional activity34,36,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a positive role for STAT3 acetylation stands in stark contrast to our results and several other reports that collectively and compellingly imply transcriptional repression by STAT3 acetylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, in our hypothalamic HDAC5 KD cell model STAT3 hyperacetylation at Lysine 685 concurred with hypophosphorylation at Tyr705, decreased STAT3 binding to the Pomc promoter, and decreased Pomc expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other reports found that STAT3 activity decreased in renal cells after pharmacological HDAC class I inhibition37,44 and that knockdown of HDAC3 and subsequent STAT3 Lys685 hyperacetylation impaired STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation and decreased overall cell survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma43,48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to our findings on STAT3, STAT1 activation and translocation was very recently linked with HDAC4-mediated deacetylation in podocytes44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Exact mechanisms linking the interplay of STAT3 acetylation with phosphorylation and transcriptional activity thus appear complex, and may involve multilayered and tissue-specific processes such as differential interaction partners and differential (de)acetylation kinetics48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Site-directed mutagenesis of lysine residue 685 to an inactive arginine had no effect and triple mutation of lysine residues 49, 87 and 685 only slightly dampened leptin-induced STAT3 transcriptional activity50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The enhancement of leptin sensitivity by the transcriptional regulator Nur77 was nevertheless abolished when all three lysine residues were inactivated, potentially via differential binding of Nur77-STAT3 dimers to distant sites of the Pomc promoter50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Acetylation of Lys685 was further shown to be critical for gene expression driven by unphosphorylated STAT3Tyr705 (U-STAT3Lys685) but not by STAT3 phosphorylated on Tyr-705 (pSTAT3Tyr705)51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In hypothalamic CLU177 cells with stable knockdown of HDAC5, we observed a shift towards nuclear translocation of acetylated STAT3Lys685 but diminished binding of STAT3 to the Pomc promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC5-mediated STAT3 deacetylation may thus control the availability of STAT3 within the nucleus, and the transactivation of genes specific for either pSTAT3Tyr705 or U-STAT3Lys685.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low intrinsic enzymatic activity of HDAC5 may further require interaction with another class I HDAC family member to catalyse STAT3 deacetylation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For hypothalamic neurons, we nevertheless conclude that direct HDAC5 action on STAT3via reciprocal STAT3 deacetylation at Lys685 and phosphorylation at Tyr707presents a critical step in STAT3 transcriptional activation and leptin signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stat3 deacetylationalthough not a classical epigenetic phenomenonthus represents an important mechanism to convey environmental stimuli into the temporal and spatial control of gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previous reports linked hepatic HDAC class IIa family members with the regulation of systemic glucose metabolism17,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mihaylova et al.17 showed that the simultaneous liver-specific knockdown of HDAC4, 5 and 7 in mouse models of diabetes type 2 could decrease gluconeogenic gene programs, increase hepatic glycogen accumulation, and improve systemic hyperglycemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In primary murine hepatocytes, Wang et al.49 showed that the concomitant depletion of HDAC4 and HDAC5 by RNA interference could disrupt the glucagon-mediated induction of gluconeogenic gene programs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data from global HDAC5 KO mice do not support a specific and systemic role for HDAC5 in glucose homeostasis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The discrepant findings might be explained by redundant and compensatory action of class IIa family members 4, 7 or 9, which seem to prevent beneficial glucoregulatory effects of HDAC5 disruption in our global HDAC5 KO mouse model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, it should be noted that adenoviral overexpression of non-phosphorylatable constitutively nuclear HDAC5 in the liver modestly increased blood glucose in chow-fed C57Bl6 mice17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be determined whether global class IIa HDAC inhibitors can indeed confer beneficial changes on hepatic glucose metabolism and whether the obesogenic impact of global HDAC5 inhibition overrides any beneficial glucoregulatory effect of hepatic class IIa HDAC inhibitors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'HDAC5 is recognized as an important mediator of epigenetic changes via histone deacetylation and chromatin remodelling25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histone deacetylation occurs at various sites within the histone proteins and can determine DNA packing and chromatin accessibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, silencing of HDAC5 should alter the histone code and open up chromatin, allowing for increased gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  HDAC overexpression should in turn decrease gene expression by condensing chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a targeted approach, we were not able to identify upregulated expression of leptin signalling genes in HDAC5 KO mice compared with WT controls.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Intriguingly, our data go beyond the classical model of epigenetic HDAC action, at least with respect to having a direct impact on leptin signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The possibility that modification by HDAC5 may convey additional, classically epigenetic, effects on the systemic control of metabolic homeostasis and potentially even affect metabolic programming of offspring, is a subject for future research.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ideally, such studies should involve tissue-specific HDAC5 knock-out mice to further delineate the mechanistic underpinnings of HDAC5 action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, our results identify the hypothalamic class IIa family member HDAC5 as novel regulator of metabolic homeostasis and important component of leptin signalling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hypothalamic Hdac5 expression is regulated by nutrient availability and leptin action, revealing a fully functional feedback loop at the molecular interface that connects CNS control of metabolism with dietary challenges.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Genetic and pharmacological manipulations of hypothalamic HDAC5 activity had profound effects on food intake and body-weight control in our studies and overall suggest a beneficial role for selected HDAC5 activation against leptin resistance and obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mechanistically, we document for the first time a direct interaction of HDAC5 with STAT3, suggesting a STAT3 acetyl-phospho switch regulated by HDAC5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a switch may offer therapeutic opportunities with the potential to fine-tune leptin signalling in direct response to metabolic changes and environmental stimuli.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
