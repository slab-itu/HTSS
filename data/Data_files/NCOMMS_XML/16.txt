A tunable azine covalent organic framework platform for visible light-induced hydrogen generation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hydrogen evolution from photocatalytic reduction of water holds promise as a sustainable source of carbon-free energy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) present an interesting new class of photoactive materials, which combine three key features relevant to the photocatalytic process, namely crystallinity, porosity and tunability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we synthesize a series of water- and photostable 2D azine-linked COFs from hydrazine and triphenylarene aldehydes with varying number of nitrogen atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electronic and steric variations in the precursors are transferred to the resulting frameworks, thus leading to a progressively enhanced light-induced hydrogen evolution with increasing nitrogen content in the frameworks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that by the rational design of COFs on a molecular level, it is possible to precisely adjust their structural and optoelectronic properties, thus resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is expected to spur further interest in these photofunctional frameworks where rational supramolecular engineering may lead to new material applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The past decade has witnessed the synthesis of a diverse collection of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) resulting from reversible condensation reactions1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By virtue of their light weight, high porosity and presence of organic chromophores, these COFs find applications in areas such as gas storage4,5,6,7, catalysis8 and sensing9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural regularity in COFs leads to long-range order, which has also encouraged the exploration of these materials as supramolecularly engineered organic semiconductors with a diverse set of optoelectronic properties10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the optical and electronic properties of the resulting framework materials can readily be tuned by tailoring the organic precursors13,14,15,16,17, photofunctional COFs present an interesting area of research with a wide scope of potential applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Photocatalytic water splitting presents a promising method of producing clean energy from water by generating hydrogen using sunlight.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although continuing efforts are on to develop new materials as catalysts, the majority of them contain transition metals18 or rely on extended solids that offer little room for active-site engineering.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New catalysts are usually investigated for their potential for photocatalytic water splitting by looking at hydrogen or oxygen evolution with a sacrificial electron donor or acceptor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is widely regarded as the first step towards full water splitting19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent success in the synthesis of COFs that are not only air stable but also possess very good stability in acids and bases9,21,22 allows the exploration of these materials for applications such as photocatalytic water splitting where water and photostability are key requisites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we show that as a direct consequence of molecular engineering, a triphenylarene platform can readily be tuned for photocatalytic water reduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a series of triphenylarylaldehydes with the central aryl ring containing 03 nitrogen atoms as building blocks, two-dimensional (2D) azine-linked COFs were synthesized, which reflect the structural variations of the triphenylarene platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Investigation of these COFs as a new generation of polymeric photocatalysts show progressively enhanced hydrogen evolution with increasing nitrogen content in the frameworks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work demonstrates the potential of organic materials in solar energy conversion where a vast array of organic building blocks and bond-forming reactions provide an extensive toolbox for the systematic fine-tuning of their structural and physical properties23, thus making way for the application of COFs in photocatalytic water splitting24.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Synthesis and characterization of COFs', 'A progressive substitution of alternate carbons in the central aryl ring of the triphenylaryl platform (Fig 1a, green dots) by nitrogen atoms leads to a change in the electronic and steric properties of the central ring, that is, N=0 (phenyl), N=1 (pyridyl), N=2 (pyrimidyl) and N=3 (triazine).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of the substitution of the CH moiety with nitrogen atoms, a change in dihedral angle between the central aryl ring and the peripheral phenyl rings is expected, which in turn leads to varied degrees of planarity in the platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the PBE0D3/Def2SVP level as evident by the decreasing dihedral angles in the energy-minimized structures of precursor aldehydes NxAlds (Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, this results in a progressive decrease in electron density in the central aryl ring of the COF platform (Fig 1a) as the number of nitrogen atoms increase from 0 to 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Design and synthesis of the NxCOFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) A tunable triphenylarene platform for photocatalytic hydrogen

chemical and structural variation in the precursors to the overall order and optoelectronic properties of the resulting COFs, with the consequent influence on photocatalytic hydrogen production.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The precursor aldehydes (NxAlds) were synthesized as described in the Supplementary Methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NxAlds as well as their precursors were characterized using 1H and 13C spectroscopy (Supplementary Figs 215).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NxCOFs were synthesized in quantitative yields by a condensation reaction between the corresponding trialdehydes with hydrazine in the presence of 6 M acetic acid using 1:1 mesitylene/dioxane as solvent at 120 °C for 72 h (Fig 1b; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the NxCOFs were compared with the corresponding aldehydes and hydrazine (Supplementary Figs 1619), and show the disappearance of aldehydic CH and C=O stretches and the appearance of the azine C=N stretch at 1,622 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations were further corroborated by the complementary Raman spectra (Supplementary Fig 20), which showed characteristic Raman signals at 1,0001,010 cm1 for the (NN) stretch, 1,5401,560 cm1 for the sym(C=N) stretch and at 1,6001,625 cm1 for asym (C=N) stretch26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The composition and local structures of the NxCOFs were further confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Supplementary Fig 80) and 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 2 and Supplementary Figs 50, 53, 56 and 59, the characteristic aldehyde carbonyl 13C resonance located at 190 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in the precursor aldehydes disappears with the concomitant appearance of the azine C=N peak at 160 p.p.m., thereby attesting the conversion of the precursors into the respective COFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular structure of the building blocks remains intact during COF formation as evident by the largely unchanged chemical shifts of the peripheral phenyl rings as well as the central aryl ring that shows characteristic peaks in the NMR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for example, the C3 symmetric carbon in the central triazine ring in the N3Ald at 171 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  shows minimal shift and appears at 168 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in N3COF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the characteristic 13C NMR peak of the central pyridine/pyrimidine ring in N1Ald and N2Ald at 119 and 112 p.p.m., respectively, can easily be spotted in the corresponding COFs due to their upfield nature (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The assignment of these peaks was done using 2D heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) NMR of N1 and N2 aldehydes (Supplementary Figs 8 and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning solid-state NMR of the NxCOFs.The azine C=N peak (marked a) appears at 160 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  while the phenyl peaks (marked b) and characteristic central aryl peaks (marked c,d,e) show minimal changes with respect to their precursor aldehydes.Full size image', 'Structural and morphological characterization', 'To gain insight into the structural details and morphology of the COFs, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), gas sorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses were performed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PXRD of NxCOFs indicated the formation of crystalline networks with 2D honeycomb-type lattices as evident by the presence of an intense 100 reflection at 2=3.52° and reflections at 6.0, 7.1 and 9.5° corresponding to the 110, 200 and 120 reflections, respectively (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed reflections match well with the calculated patterns (Supplementary Figs 4245) obtained from structural simulations performed for an AA eclipsed layer stacking (Supplementary Figs 3441), using the Materials Studio v6.0.0 program (Accelrys).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that a slight lateral offset of the layers is expected for the stacked structures27, which however cannot be distinguished from the eclipsed topology by PXRD due to substantial peak broadening.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for practical reasons, the eclipsed structure is used as a simplified working model28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, as we traverse the series from N0 to N3COF, the PXRD peaks become sharper with the appearance of prominent stacking peaks for N2 and N3COF at 2=26° arising from the d-spacing between the 001 lattice planes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the variation in planarity in the precursor aldehydes as a function of the dihedral angles translates well into the crystallinity of the resulting COFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The unit-cell parameters were obtained by Pawley refinements for all COFs and the results are included in Supplementary Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Structure and stacking analysis of the NxCOFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) PXRD patterns of the NxCOFs compared with the

at 87 K (Supplementary Fig 46) reveal that the BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) surface area of symmetrical and unsymmetrical NxCOFs show a deviation from the trend expected from the increasing level of planarity from N0 to N3Ald.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, while PXRD shows a similar yet lower degree of crystallinity for N0 and N1COF in comparison to that observed for N2 and N3COF, a further demarcation is seen in the BET area of the symmetrical and unsymmetrical COFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the BET surface area of the symmetrical N0COF was found to be 702 m2 g1, which is significantly higher than that of the unsymmetrical N1COF with a BET area of 326 m2 g1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Likewise, in case of comparatively planar N2 and N3COF, the symmetrical N3COF showed a higher BET area of 1,537 m2 g1 as compared with the unsymmetrical N2COF with a BET area of 1,046 m2 g1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the lowering of symmetry leads to a lower degree of order and hence lower BET surface area.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, a narrow pore-size distribution for the most crystalline N3COF was calculated by the non-local DFT method with a peak maximum at 24 Å, which is in excellent agreement with the pore size established from the structural analysis and simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum at 24 Å is accompanied by a minor peak in the pore size distribution (PSD) at 16 Å, which becomes more prominent in the other NxCOFs (x=02; Supplementary Fig 47), likely resulting from an increasing degree of lateral layer offsets and stacking disorder in the less crystalline materials.

4ad; Supplementary Fig 21).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure and morphology of NxCOFs was further investigated by TEM analysis where hexagonal pores are clearly visible in N2 and N3COF (Fig 4e,f; Supplementary Figs 24 and 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Selected area electron diffraction along the 001 zone axis of the multilayers of N3COF is consistent with a nanocrystalline, hexagonally ordered in-plane structure composed of crystalline domains with sizes 50100 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TEM analysis of N0 and N1COF, however, did not show any crystalline domains, possibly due to instability in the electron beam (Supplementary Figs 22 and 23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: SEM and TEM images of NxCOFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) SEM images of N0COF, (b) N1COF, (c) N2COF and (d) N3COF indicating morphological

350 °C in argon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TGA analysis in air shows total decomposition of all the COFs at temperatures 550 °C, thus indicating the absence of any metal residues (Supplementary Figs 2633).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Optical properties and photocatalysis', 'The diffuse reflectance spectrum reveals that all the COFs absorb light in the ultraviolet and blue parts of the visible region and show similar absorption profiles with an absorption edge at 465475 nm (Fig 5a), thereby suggesting an optical band gap of 2.62.7 eV as determined by the Kubelka-Munk function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These values are red shifted by 4060 nm in comparison to the solid-state absorption spectra of the precursor aldehydes and can be attributed to the introduction of the azine group and a higher degree of conjugation resulting from delocalization along as well as across the plane in the extended frameworks29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As seen in Fig 5a, unsymmetrical N1 and N2Ald show a slightly red-shifted absorption in comparison to the symmetrical N0 and N3Ald.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DFT calculations performed on the precursor aldehydes also indicate a similar trend in the optical band gaps of symmetrical and unsymmetrical aldehydes (Supplementary Table 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the differences in absorption spectra of symmetrical and unsymmetrical aldehydes in the solid state, the absorption spectra of the precursors were additionally recorded in dilute (8 M) dichloromethane solutions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The absorption profiles (Fig 5b) are marked by a clear difference between the symmetrical N3Ald with one absorption band and the unsymmetrical N1 and N2Ald with twin absorption bands arising from the non-planar and hence non-fully conjugated phenylaryl ring systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The two bands in the absorption spectrum of N0Ald are rationalized by absorptions from the two types of ring systems that are essentially decoupled due to strong out-of-plane torsion of the peripheral phenyl rings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The increase in planarity leading to a higher degree of conjugation (hence red shift) along the series N0 to N3 is partly compensated by the increase in electron-deficient character of the central aryl ring (hence blue shift), thereby resulting in minimal changes in the optical band gap on network formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similar optical gap makes the NxCOF ensemble an ideal model platform for photocatalysis experiments, as their relative activities will not be governed by differences in their light-harvesting capability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

and irradiating with visible light (420 nm) at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hexachloroplatinic acid was added for the in situ formation of the platinum (Pt) co-catalyst30 to reduce the overpotential for hydrogen evolution, and triethanolamine (TEoA) was used as sacrificial electron donor31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, all COFs evolve hydrogen in the test period of 8 h (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly though, the NxCOFs show about fourfold increase in hydrogen evolution with each substitution of CH by N in the central aryl ring of the COF platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, at the end of 8 h the average amount of hydrogen produced by N0, N1, N2 and N3COF was 23, 90, 438 and 1,703 mol h1 g1, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The amount of hydrogen evolved from the most active N3COF is competitive with carbon nitride photocatalysts and outperforms benchmark systems such as Pt-modified amorphous melon (720 mol h1 g1)33, gC3N4 (840 mol h1 g1)34 or crystalline poly(triazine imide) (864 mol h1 g1)33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photocatalysis lasting up to 48 h using N3COF showed that the amount of hydrogen evolved was about four times higher than the amount of hydrogen present in the COF (Supplementary Fig 62), thus ascertaining that the primary hydrogen source is water rather than decomposition products of the COF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After photocatalysis, the COFs were isolated and checked for stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FTIR (Supplementary Figs 48, 51, 54 and 57) and ssNMR (Supplementary Figs 50, 53, 56 and 59) spectra of the NxCOFs obtained after photocatalysis did not show any significant structural change in the material, thus indicating the retention of molecular connectivity of the framework during photocatalysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The framework crystallinity was preserved to a large extent in the post-photocatalysis recovered COFs, although a partial loss of the long-range order was observed by PXRD (Supplementary Figs 49, 52, 55 and 58).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a decrease in long-range order has been attributed to the delamination of framework layers24,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the TEM images obtained from the post-photocatalysis sample (Supplementary Fig 61) clearly demonstrate the retention of hexagonally ordered crystalline domains in addition to the uniform distribution of platinum nanoparticles that are formed in situ during photocatalysis as observed in the SEM images (Supplementary Fig 60).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photocatalysis experiments performed in the absence of hexachloroplatinic acid did not show measurable amounts of hydrogen, thus underlining the role of platinum as electrocatalyst and microelectrode to mediate the electron transfer process30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Long-term studies performed with ascorbic acid as sacrificial electron donor revealed that the N3COF is stable in light for over 120 h, showing sustained hydrogen evolution (Supplementary Fig 63).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the spectral distribution of the photocatalytic activity of the four COFs, the photonic efficiency (PE) was calculated using four different band-pass filters with central wavelengths at 400, 450, 500 and 550 nm (Fig 5d; Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Figs 64 and 65).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These measurements clearly indicate that N3COF shows the best PE over the entire spectral range, with the maximum of 0.44% with a 450-nm band-pass filter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Theoretical calculations', 'To rationalize the observed trend and to provide insights into the change in band gaps and band positions along the Nx series,

lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy in these calculations for the NxCOFs with increasing nitrogen content suggests a decreased thermodynamic driving force for electrons to move to the

occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) along the Nx series may lead to an increase in the oxidizing power of the hole36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increase in thermodynamic driving force may therefore facilitate hole removal from the COF by the sacrificial electron donor most efficiently in N3COF37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, molecular orbitals for the model systems were extracted and compared for the extended COF systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although HOMOLUMO distributions are often invoked in the literature to rationalize exciton delocalization, charge separation and the location of potential charge-transfer sites38,39,40, it has to be stressed that orbitals are not observables and hence, such model considerations need to be taken with care.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, since DFTB+ orbitals did not always agree with orbitals from DFT calculations in the case of our 7-hexagon model systems, orbital data from DFTB+ calculations may be of limited use here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, unit cells of the NxCOFs were optimized on the DFTB+/mio-1-0 level of theory using periodic single-point calculations, and molecular orbitals were subsequently calculated on the same level of theory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Across the different NxCOFs, the HOMO is localized solely on the azine linker unit (Supplementary Fig 77), while the LUMO is delocalized across the conjugated -system of the framework (Supplementary Fig 78).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When associating the HOMO with the charge-transfer sites for holes, we may infer that efficient hole quenching is possible through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the sacrificial donor TEoA via the azine moiety for all COFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For smaller clusters calculated on a higher level of theory (PBE0D3/Def2SVP), we find that the HOMOs of hydrazone-terminated model hexagons are exclusively located at these terminations, while the LUMO is distributed along the hexagon with the maximum delocalization found for the planar N3HxHz model (Supplementary Figs 72 and 73).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To check the reliability of these model systems, even larger molecular clusters with 1,248 atoms were modelled for the N3 system to reduce the influence of terminating groups on the electronic structure of the innermost aryl core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the terminal hydrazone moieties still strongly localize the HOMO, whereas the LUMO in the 7-hexagon system is still centred on the innermost hexagon, despite the vicinal hexagons (Supplementary Fig 74).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests an efficient HOMOLUMO separation for oligomers with electron-rich terminal groups, which could assist the charge separation process on excitation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note, however, that the HOMO and LUMO do not necessarily correspond to the orbitals participating in the brightest transitions and further calculations are necessary to pinpoint the orbital contributions to the optical absorptions involved in the photocatalytic process.

roughly +10 eV in vacuum, thus rendering the formation of a radical cation during the photocatalytic process less likely.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the formation of a radical anion as the rate-determining step, which is most favoured for the N3 system and least facile for the N0 system, the observed energetics of the radical anion upholds the observed trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, this finding emphasizes the role of the sacrificial electron donor that needs to swiftly remove the hole from the COF leading to the formation of a radical anion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, it underlines the importance of the electron-poor character of the triazine building block, which is efficient at stabilizing the negative charge generated on the COF and at transferring it to the nearest platinum site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This trend is fully in line with the observed hydrogen evolution activity and we therefore reason that the formation of the radical anion is crucial for the photocatalytic process, as exemplified by NxCOFs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Although the above calculations are fully in line with the observed exponential increase in hydrogen production across the Nx-series, the latter cannot be pinpointed to a single property change of the COFs but rather has to be ascribed to a complex interplay of several factors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, an increase in surface area may play a key role in the photocatalytic activity by providing a greater number of exposed active sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the present case, only a weak correlation with the surface area of the NxCOFs could be established, thus suggesting that surface area is not the central factor determining the photocatalytic activity (Supplementary Table 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further, as observed earlier29, stacking likely plays a key role in the observed red shift of absorption spectra of the COFs as compared with the spectra of the aldehyde building blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, as a consequence of the decreased dihedral angle along the series and hence improved crystallinity, enhanced structural definition and layer registry, most facile exciton migration within the COF plane and also along the well-stacked aryl rings is expected for N3COF, which is in line with the observed trend in photocatalytic activity41,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the exciton dynamics in such materials is expected to be complicated and dependent on both structural and electronic factors, it is interesting that a logarithmic plot of dihedral angles obtained from the geometry optimized precursor aldehydes against hydrogen production of the respective COFs shows a linear relationship (Supplementary Fig 79).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regarding electronic factors, the computed increase in stabilization of the radical anions in the most nitrogen-rich COFs nicely correlates with the observed trend.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stabilization of the anion radical likely enhances the charge separation, thereby increasing the probability of successful electron migration to a nearby Pt co-catalyst.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relevance of the anion radical for hydrogen evolution likewise shifts the focus to the sacrificial electron donor, whose interaction with the COF likely determines how quickly the hole can be quenched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our results suggest that tuning the interfacial interactions between the COF and the electron donor may be a promising route to optimize the hydrogen evolution efficiencies further in such systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we have synthesized a new COF platform that can be tuned for visible light-induced hydrogen evolution from water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Systematic variation in the properties of our four structurally related COFs clearly indicates that tuning the electronic and structural properties of the precursors has a significant impact on the photocatalytic activity of the resulting COFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have thus shown that engineering the building blocks and, hence, the electronic properties of photofunctional COFs opens new avenues to tunable, tailor-made supramolecular photocatalysts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrogen evolution resulting from a crystalline COF that retains its structure during photocatalysis is an important stepping stone on the way to full water splitting by organic frameworks with embedded photophysical functions, and at the same time holds much room for further improvement through rational band gap and catalytic site engineering by tailoring the molecular building blocks.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
