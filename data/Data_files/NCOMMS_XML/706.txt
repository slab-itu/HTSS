Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The coding and decoding of information into synthetic molecules is one of the key challenges of contemporary macromolecular chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the course of evolution, nature has developed finely adjusted tools for information coding, decoding, translation and correction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the enormous progress made in the synthesis of defined macromolecular structures since the formulation of Staudingers macromolecular hypothesis almost 100 years ago, macromolecular chemists have just started to develop the tools required to mimic natures precision that is inherent to biomolecules such as DNA, proteins or glyco-sequences.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these key molecules execute specific functions in biological processesheredity and information storage for DNA1,2, enzymatic activity for proteins3 or cell communication for sugar motifs4it is evident that perfect sequence order in an ensemble of identical macromolecules is their common defining element.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Designing viable approaches to synthetic macromolecules with sequence-controlled (low dispersion coupled with some statistical fuzziness regarding the placement of the monomer units) or sequence-defined (no dispersion and 100% accurate placement of the monomers along the chain) order is thus the key to modern macromolecular chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthesis of sequence-defined macromoleculesas defined aboverepresents the far greater challenge than the generation of sequence-controlled species5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Generating an ensemble of perfectly sequence-defined identical macromolecules containing exactly the same chemical information at the molecular scalein contrast to existing avenues to disperse and irregularly coded species when compared with natural analoguesvia a simple process constitutes a key technological gate for data storage, biological and material applications, yet requires reaction concepts that provide perfect yields and orthogonality under equimolar reaction conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although solid-state peptide synthesis was introduced by Merrifield6the first example of a true synthetic sequence-defined peptidemacromolecular chemists have initially focused on and developed a diverse number of solution-based polymerization strategies for imparting a certain level of control over statistical polymerization processes and exploited these for controlling the order of the building blocks (sequence-controlled polymers)7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the advent of modular synthetic strategies21,22,23,24 has contributed significantly towards achieving a high level of control over macromolecular formation processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although these advances of limiting the statistical nature of polymerization processes are impressive and led to fine examples of sequence-controlled polymers7,11,13,15,16, only few sequence-defined examples have been reported that reach the precision level of nature25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Directly inspired by biologically accessible DNA systemsfor example, nucleobase-coded chainssequence-defined macromolecules have been synthesized employing template-based coding strategies26,27,28,29 or via the generation of regulated sequence alternating thymine hybrid polymers30, as well as the design of reactions with iterative protection/deprotection steps on supports31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, bulk reactions have been conducted in flow systems based on iterative synthesis33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, iterative exponential growth can lead to sequence-defined macromolecules34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In parallel, strategies involving the consecutive insertion of single monomer units (vinyl or acrylate) based on radical processes started to emerge for the synthesis of sequence-defined polymers37,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further, notable synthetic strategies towards sequence-defined polymers conducted in bulk include the use of thiolactones39,40,41 and multi-component reactions42,43,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitant to the development of new synthetic approaches to sequence-defined polymers, selected applications of such molecules are emerging, for example, bio-inspired structures for which high sequence definition is essential45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For potential data storage applications, solid support-based systems have emerged featuring monomer units with unreactive variable alkyl groups47 and block copolymer phase separation based on sequence-defined oligomers has been demonstrated as well36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The herein proposed synthetic strategy based on photoreactive synthons offers significant applications of the functional sequence-defined macromolecules ranging from mild bioconjugation to base materials for advanced precision photoresists for, for example, direct laser writing48 or precision network formation for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) orientation media49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Critically, photochemistry offers the opportunity to broaden the chemical diversity in the design of sequence-defined macromolecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we herein offer a proof-of-concept study, we submit that the synthetic protocols are amenable to scale up in photoflow systems51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The synthesis of sequence-defined macromolecules in bulk requires highly efficient reaction systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, most reports rarely describe a variation of the sequence order and/or the incorporated functionalities to generate highly diverse libraries of sequence-defined macromolecules and subsequently exploit this diversity to decode the coded chemical information52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Herein, we demonstrate how highly efficient photochemical reactions combined with a simple macromolecular design concept can lead to functional sequence-defined linear macromolecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this diversity, we built on our initial approach for photochemical sequence control53, simplifying the concept while concomitantly showing its power to generate an entire sequence-defined polymer library.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simplicity and versatility of the photoreactions are such that the sequence order and functionality within the chains can be arbitrarily varied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our approach rests on a sole photochemical reaction relying on benzaldehyde species, which when irradiated lead to reactive dienes (so-called photo-caged dienes)54 with an ortho-quinodimethane structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined with ene reactive functional molecules, we reach diverse decamers from a library of six monomers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evidence that the photochemical coding leads to a strictly monodisperse character after each synthetic step, evidenced via size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and mass-spectrometric tools (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime-of-flight mass-spectrometry, MALDIToF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Owing to the absolute control over the sequence order, the chemical historywhich the macromolecules experienced during the photochemical coding processcan be decoded via mass-spectrometric defragmentation experiments (MALDIToFToF).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such an in-depth characterization of selected macromolecules does not only evidence the successful synthesis of the desired structures but also constitutes a fundamental example of artificial sequence-defined macromolecules ability to be employed for coding and decoding chemical information.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Photochemical concepts for sequence-defined macromolecules', 'The photoreaction generating the sequence-defined macromolecules is based on a monomer library (Fig 1a), in which each monomer carries a photoreactive benzaldehyde function as well as an ene functionality required for the photochemically induced DielsAlder reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Contrary to our previous reportwhich employed two monomer types with separate diene and dienophile functions53the herein presented monomers entail a dual diene/dienophile character.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, monomer 1 (denoted M1) includes on the one hand the benzaldehyde moiety reacting as diene under ultraviolet irradiation from its ortho-quinodimethane state and on the other hand a furan-protected maleimide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lysine-derived methyl ester monomer 2 (denoted M2) and the poly(ethylene glycol) containing monomer 3 (denoted M3) follow the same concept as monomer 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monomers 46 (denoted M4, M5 and M6, respectively) introduce further functionalities for sequence-controlled coding, while resting on the same synthetic concept as monomers 1, 2 and 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The synthetic strategy to introduce the different monomer functionalities is based on a lysine precursor featuring orthogonal protecting groups, that is, fluoromethoxycarbonyl and tert-butyloxycarbonyl, in the - and -positions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After an initial condensation with the free carboxylic group of the protected amino acid with the corresponding amino derivatives, the different functional monomers are obtained with acceptable yields between 23 and 44% (refer to the Supplementary Methods section and the Supplementary Figs 132, as well as the caption of Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Strategies towards sequence-defined homopolymers and alternating block (co)polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Synthesized monomers with diverse spacers: 1 (hexyl chain), 2 (lysine-methyl ester function), 3 (poly(ethylene glycol (PEG) chain), 4 (lysine-based monomer with alcohol function), 5 (lysine-based monomer with adamanthyl function), 6 (lysine-based monomer with fluorobenzyl function).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Sequential synthesis of symmetrical dimers 7a and 10a, tetramers 7b (homopolymer), 9a and 10b (alternating polymers), and hexamers 7c (homopolymer) and 8a, 9b and 10c (copolymers).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Synthesis of dimer blocks 7d, 9c and 10d with locked/unlocked function for modular ligation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Synthesis of decamers as homopolymers 7 and copolymers 810 varying in composition and topology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i) dry DCM, =365 nm, 45 min;

1.021.03 for decamers), as well as further characterization conducted via NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (refer to Supplementary Figs 40115) confirms the success of the photochemical synthetic strategy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: SEC traces of successively synthesized sequence-defined polymers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Homopolymer 7;
