Compressional pathways of -cristobalite, structure of cristobalite X-I, and towards the understanding of seifertite formation  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In various shocked meteorites, low-pressure silica polymorph -cristobalite is commonly found in close spatial relation with the densest known SiO2 polymorph seifertite, which is stable above 80 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that under hydrostatic pressure -cristobalite remains untransformed up to at least 15 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In quasi-hydrostatic experiments, above 11 GPa cristobalite X-I formsa monoclinic polymorph built out of silicon octahedra; the phase is not quenchable and back-transforms to -cristobalite on decompression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are no other known silica polymorphs, which transform to an octahedra-based structure at such low pressures upon compression at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further compression in non-hydrostatic conditions of cristobalite X-I eventually leads to the formation of quenchable seifertite-like phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results demonstrate that the presence of -cristobalite in shocked meteorites or rocks does not exclude that materials experienced high pressure, nor is the presence of seifertite necessarily indicative of extremely high peak shock pressures.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The high-temperature, low-pressure polymorph of silica-cristobalitehas a subordinate and rather exotic terrestrial occurrence among silica phases (for example, quartz), but it is observed as the predominant SiO2 polymorph in various planetary materialsfor example, planetary dust1, various meteorites2 or lunar rocks3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The response of the -cristobalite found in meteorites to the high pressure (and high-temperature) conditions encountered during an impact still puzzles scientists because of its common spatial association with high-pressure mineral assemblages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the one hand, -cristobalite is found in meteorites that lack any high-pressure silica polymorphs albeit the rest of the minerals indicate peak shock pressures in excess of 10 GPa and high temperatures, at which coesite or stishovite are expected4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, it is documented alongside all the natural occurrences of seifertite, a post-stishovite high-pressure polymorph of SiO2 only found in heavily shocked (25 GPa or higher) meteorites5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to these observations, -cristobalite seems to be stable at variable pressure conditions (from ambient to more than 25 GPa), thereby not recording the peak transient pressure as the other associated phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triggered by this curious behaviour and later by interesting petrographic observations, particularly by the coexistence of seifertite and -cristobalite, the behaviour of -cristobalite at high pressures was examined by numerous experimental9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 and theoretical studies19,20,21 for more than two decades.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While they all indicated abundant polymorphism at elevated pressures, no consensus has emerged on what is the exact sequence of the pressure-induced transformations in -cristobalite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results are particularly discrepant when comparing different forms of starting materials (for example, powder or single crystal) and different levels of hydrostaticity9,10,12,13,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experiments9,12,13,16,17 carried out at non-hydrostatic conditions (that is, in solid pressure-transmitting medium or without any medium) using powders as starting material report the transformation of -cristobalite, via cristobalite-II and cristobalite X-I, to seifertitethe -PbO2-type silicanear 30 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, they provide evidence that seifertite can form at pressures much lower than expected from its thermodynamic equilibrium (in excess of 80 GPa22,23) thus bypassing the formation of thermodynamically expected stishovite and CaCl2 polymorph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar path (IIX-I) was observed on a single crystal studied in hydrostatic (liquid pressure medium) or quasi-hydrostatic (solidified but very soft, Ne particularly, pressure-transmitting media) experiments at lower pressures, up to 12 GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a single-crystal -cristobalite has not been studied at pressures exceeding the formation of cristobalite X-I (11 GPa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the structure of this bridging phase X-I that forms in either quasi- (for example refs 10, 18) or non-hydrostatic, (for example refs 12, 13) conditions remained elusive until now.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In terms of studying the structure and behaviour of materials at elevated pressures employing cutting-edge experimental procedures, silica remains one of the most challenging compounds due to its relatively low X-ray scattering factor, as well as its abundant polymorphism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The only way to address the curious coexistence of cristobalite and seifertite, as well as the large discrepancies regarding pressures estimates in shocked meteorites based on the presence of seifertite, is to systematically study the behaviour of -cristobalite under pressure with the focus on the formation of cristobalite X-I and -PbO2-type silica that is, seifertite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we examined the response of various forms of -cristobalite upon cold compression at different levels of hydrostatic stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results reveal that the mechanism which -cristobalite accommodates under compression is even more sensitive to stress conditions than previously anticipated9,10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By clarifying the stability field of cristobalite X-I and revealing its structure, we gained insight into the long disputed transition mechanism IIX-I-PbO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide clear evidence that the formation of seifertite at pressures much lower than its thermodynamic equilibrium is restricted to a non-hydrostatic environment (at room temperature).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains the seemingly controversial observations regarding its natural coexistence with -cristobalite.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'An overview of acquired data sets', 'High-pressure experiments were carried out on both single crystals and powders (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All single-crystal experiments were conducted in quasi-hydrostatic conditions, using a pressure-transmitting medium, whereas powders were also studied in non-hydrostatic environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Starting material in form of -cristobalite was compressed using diamond-anvil cells (DAC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ high-pressure data were obtained by Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron based single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimentally determined structure was then used in ab initio calculations to examine ordered structural models and to compute the Raman spectra and unit-cell parameters at various pressures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After performing high-pressure experiments, recovered samples were additionally investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Effect of hydrostaticity on cristobalite transformation path', 'We find that the mechanism which -cristobalite adopts as response to compression strongly depends on the stress conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The effect is illustrated in Fig 1: three -cristobalite single crystals of different size were loaded inside the same pressure chamber of a DAC in neon pressure-transmitting medium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon compression, the smallest and the thinnest crystal (10 m thickness, C3) that does not bridge between the anvils, remains fully surrounded by very soft neon experiencing (almost) hydrostatic environment, and thus retains the structure of -cristobalite up to at least 15 GPa (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the two thicker crystals (C1 & C2) that touch the diamond anvils upon compression, undergo a displacive phase transition to cristobalite-II near 1 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same crystals transform to cristobalite X-I just above 10 GPa, in agreement with earlier findings10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Raman spectra of cristobalite X-I can be followed at least up to 80 GPa under compression (the maximum pressures studied here, Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After recovering cristobalite X-I from high-pressure experiments, it transformed back to the initial -cristobalite, the structure of which was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, TEM and X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to single crystals, all compression experiments carried out on powders, regardless on the presence of the pressure-transmitting medium, showed identical transformation path, ultimately resulting in the formation of seifertite-like material (see below).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: In situ Raman spectra of cristobalite at high pressures.Spectra collected on two different single crystals of -cristobalite at 1.1, 4.6, 8.6 and 15.0 GPa and at room temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inset shows the DAC pressure chamber seen at 15.0 GPa: R stands for ruby;

(2) it is impossible to distinguish -cristobalite from cristobalite-II above 2 GPa solely based on the main Raman Ag mode position, because the doublet characteristic of cristobalite-II merges into one intense peak upon further compression, showing the same pressure band shift as that of the -cristobalite Ag; (3) compression of -cristobalite up to 15 GPa, far outside its stability field (overpressurized) in BA-DAC1, and in crystal C3 of BA-DAC2 is consistent with the observation by Dera et al.10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed II transition above 3 GPa (BA-DAC1), as well as the coexistence of -cristobalite with cristobalite-II and with cristobalite X-I (BA-DAC2) to at least 14 GPa strongly suggest that the main cause for the onset of the II transition is the change in stress conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test the hypothesis by Dera et al.10 that the overpressurization is accommodated by the very rapid compression far beyond the II transition pressure (1.5 GPa) we conducted an experiment (EXP 5, Supplementary Figs 1, 2 and 7) applying instant pressure-increase to 9 and then 12 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We still observed formation of cristobalite-II and X-I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, crystal C3 (experiment BA-DAC2) evidenced overpressurization of -cristobalite at the same rate of compression simultaneously with IIX-I transition occurring in C1 and C2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The X-ray diffraction analysis of the overpressurized -cristobalite was measured at 1.55 and 14.1 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It shows nice diffraction pattern of a single crystal with no indication of twinning, resulting in accurate structural refinement (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cristobalite X-I', 'Cristobalite-II is observed up to 11 GPa, after which it undergoes a first-order transition to cristobalite X-I, consistent with previous observations10,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abrupt change in Raman spectra suggests that the structure of the X-I phase is quite distinct from its - and cristobalite-II precursors (Fig 1 and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon compression the Raman spectra of cristobalite X-I can be followed up to 80 GPa and on decompression the Raman modes of cristobalite X-I can be followed down to 2 GPa, below which it transforms back to the starting -cristobalite (Supplementary Figs 3 and 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Even the most recent study regarding the formation and stability of cristobalite X-I18 was based on powder-diffraction data, which were insufficient for structure determination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our new single-crystal data reveal the structure of cristobalite X-I shown in Fig 2 (see also Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Structure and compressibility of cristobalite X-I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Third-order Birch-Murnaghan Equation of State fit to the PV data obtained in experiment (blue line) and in ab initio calculations (red line).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exact unit-cell parameters obtained experimentally and theoretically are given in Supplementary Tables 3 and 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) 010 projection of the structure of cristobalite X-I as obtained experimentally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The experimental structure contains half-occupied octahedral positions (Si3) shown by red spheres, and fully occupied octahedra (Si1 and Si2) represented by all other spheres, see Table 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blue and the green octahedra represent different levels in the structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A row of three fully occupied octahedra surrounded by two half-occupied octahedra at each side form the 5 × 2 × 2 skeleton.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) The ordered structure used for model in ab initio calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The theoretical structure contains 4 × 4 arrangement of the fully occupied octahedra (Supplementary Table 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The blue and the green octahedra represent different levels in the structure.Full size image', 'Table 1 Structure of cristobalite X-I at 14.1 GPa.Full size table', 'The polymorph cristobalite X-I belongs to the family of high-pressure silica phases comprising of a distorted hexagonal close-packed array of oxygen ions in which silicon atoms fully or partially occupy octahedral sites24,25,26, being sixfold coordinated to oxygen (Fig 2b and Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept of randomly distributed Si cations over half of the octahedral sites was proposed in 1978 by Liu et al.24 as the modified niccolite structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The existence of such a phase has been proposed in a powder diffraction study by Prakapenka et al.13, but it has never been observed by a single-crystal study that can reveal the critical details of its structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A unit-cell of cristobalite X-I contains three distinct octahedral sites (Table 1): Si1 and Si2 are fully occupied, with respectively 2 and 4 multiplicities; Si3 is half-occupied with multiplicity of 4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Si1 and Si2 are less distorted, with SiO bond lengths and SiO6 octahedral volume similar to stishovite at similar pressures (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SiO6 octahedron around Si3 is considerably larger and significantly more distorted than around Si1 and Si2 (Supplementary Table 2); it is similar to that of seifertite at ambient conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Earlier theoretical simulations19,20,21,25 did not predict the structure of cristobalite X-I observed in our study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molecular dynamics simulations on cristobalite supercells21 obtained a compact structure with SiO4 tetrahedra at high pressures, which eventually transformed into stishovite under further compression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metadynamics simulations starting with quartz yield metastable kinked octahedral chains under compression20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various other chain-like configurations have been proposed previously for the high-pressure forms of silica25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, our diffraction data suggest that the chains of octahedra in cristobalite X-I are linked by two pairs of neighbouring octahedra (Fig 2b and Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On average at the scale of a crystal, the arrangement can be described as 5 × 2 × 2 ordering of octahedra, containing five octahedra in a row being connected with two pairs, each with one half-occupied connecting octahedra (in this manner, seifertite would be described as 2 × 2 × 1 ordering).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, at the local scale only one of the two octahedral sites is occupied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting actual structure may be considered as random combination of 4 × 4 (Fig 2c and Supplementary Fig 4c) and 5 × 3 (Supplementary Fig 4b) octahedra in adjacent rows.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed the ab initio calculations using density-functional theory (DFT) in local-density approximation (LDA) to study these two ordered end-member configurations, as well as their random combination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculations show that the 4 × 4 end-member term is lower in enthalpy by 26 meV per formula unit at 10 GPa than the 5 × 3 one.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difference in enthalpy decreases almost linearly to 8 meV per formula unit at 100 GPa, but it is small enough to be overcome by the thermal energy at ambient conditions and could therefore explain experimentally observed disorder.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we compute the Raman spectra for several ordered supercells (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6) at several pressures (10, 40 and 100 GPa) and compare them with our experimental results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we consider the two end-member terms, 4 × 4 and 5 × 3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated Raman spectra for the supercell 4 × 4 arrangement show remarkable agreement with the experiment (within 5 cm1 or better) throughout the entire studied pressure range.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 5 × 3 arrangement has a series of mismatched peaks (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that in the disordered phase the 4 × 4 arrangement is dominant;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Most of cristobalite found in shocked materials is believed to form after pressure release due to high post-impact temperatures (for example, ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  30).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we propose that in shocked meteorites5,6,7 it can as well form as a product of cristobalite X-I back-transformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-pressure cristobalite X-I cannot be preserved at ambient conditions, although the reconstructive transition involving increase in coordination number of silicon from fourfold coordination in - or cristobalite-II to the sixfold coordinated polymorph crsitobalite X-I does not require any thermal activation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could explain why cristobalite can be found in impact-related rocks free of coesite and stishovite, but associated with other mineral assemblages formed at pressures exceeding 10 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Cristobalite was documented alongside and in close spatial relation with all the natural occurrences of the high pressure, post-stishovite silica polymorph seifertite7,8 found in heavily shocked Martian or Lunar meteorites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments show that at non-hydrostatic environment and at ambient temperature conditions cristobalite follows IIX-I transformation path; at sufficiently high pressures (3040 GPa)9,14,18 it will eventually transform to quenchable seifertite or seifertite-like phase, bypassing the equilibrium formation of stishovite and CaCl2-structured polymorph.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study has shown that applying moderate temperatures (700 K) can promote formation of seifertite at pressures as low as 1213 GPa when starting from cristobalite X-I18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding that 4-to-6 increase in coordination number of silicon in cristobalite X-I occurs as low as 10 GPa without requiring any heating, agrees well with the results by Kubo et al.18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Once the thermal energy is added, cristobalite X-I transforms to the more stable arrangementseifertite, and not to the thermodynamically stable stishovite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could also shade light onto coexistence of -cristobalite, formed from quenched cristobalite X-I that is only stable at high pressures, with seifertite, which is quenchable, in meteorites in which peak pressures are estimated not to have exceeded 2530 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is difficult to imagine that co-exiting, spatially related (sometimes as close as 200 nm6,7,8), particles of cristobalite and seifertite (and stishovite) were generated by differences in post-impact temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such temperature gradients/inhomogeneity is unrealistic31, hardly achievable even by laser heating; at the same time huge variations in stress conditions in shock process are well-documented32, and according to our observation could lead to very different transformation pathways of silica.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On the basis of our observation, we conclude that particularly in quasi-hydrostatic or non-hydrostatic conditions -cristobalite may occur on the decompression path of cristobalite X-I.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the presence of -cristobalite does not exclude the possibility that a rock has experienced high-pressure conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, our results show that neither cristobalite nor seifertite should be considered as reliable tracers of the peak shock conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Seifertite occurs as small crystals in meteorites (at nanometer or micrometre scale6,7,8) and usually needs to be identified using TEM.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results further suggest that seifertite may be misidentified as cristobalite, which can lead to erroneous interpretation of peak shock conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, the preservation of the cristobalite X-I structure under a broad pressure range and its survival at slightly elevated temperatures18, suggests that this phase can be accommodated in quasi- or non-hydrostatic environments where temperature is insufficient to form coesite or stishovite, for example, in cold subducting slabs33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We do not agree with the recently proposed model8 that densification of the fourfold coordinated cristobalite-II directly leads to an hcp arrangement of oxygen atoms representative of seifertite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observe intermediate sixfold cristobalite X-I in all our (quasi-hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic) experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Keeping in mind the similarity in structures of cristobalite X-I and seifertite, we conclude that if there were any phases intermediate between these two polymorphs, then they are formed by a simple rearrangement of the octahedra within the chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cristobalite X-I has so far the structure most similar to that of seifertite (containing kinked chains of octahedra) as deduced from precise single-crystal analysis and determination of exact atomic positions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Methods  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Starting material and high-pressure experiment set-up', 'For the experiments, we used synthetic cristobalite as well as the natural samples kindly provided by Harvard Museum (Ellora Caves MGMH Cristobalite 97849).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Composition of the starting material for synthesizing cristobalite was SiO2 glass of very low impurity content34.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Composition of natural cristobalite was measured using ICP-MS at Bayerisches Geoinstitut (BGI), and showed trace amounts of Al, Fe and Na of 1,000 p.p.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  at maximum, comparable to that reported before35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cristobalite was synthesized by heating the glass granules at temperatures of 1,650 °C for 3 h and then cooling down slowly over 15 h to 1,500 °C (that is, the temperature slightly above the cristobalite-tridymite transition), and then rapidly quenched.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This procedure allowed the growth of cristobalite crystals up to 100 m in linear dimension; however it was not possible to avoid twinning which occurs on cooling due to the transition from the cubic -cristobalite to the tetragonal -cristobalite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These crystals were of sufficient quality for Raman spectroscopy, but for single-crystal X-ray diffraction natural cristobalite had to be used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High-pressure experiments were carried out using both single crystals and powders as starting material (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All single-crystal experiments were conducted in quasi-hydrostatic conditions, using neon as pressure-transmitting medium, whereas powders were also studied in non-hydrostatic environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used piston-cylinder BX90 type DAC produced at BGI36 with 250 m culet size of the anvils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Samples were loaded together with a ruby sphere of 5 m in diameter into a cylindrical pressure chamber of 3040 m height and 125 m in diameter drilled in a pre-indented rhenium gasket.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neon, used as pressure-transmitting medium, was loaded into the DAC using the BGI gas loading system37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We chose neon as pressure-transmitting medium, because it had been shown that helium, providing slightly better hydrostaticity, could be easily incorporated in cavities of the cristobalite structure38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For Raman experiments, we used Ia type diamonds with low fluorescence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction we used Boehler-Almax diamond anvils39 and apertures of 80°, to allow for large reciprocal space coverage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Raman spectroscopy', 'Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed using a Dilor XY Raman spectrometer with Ar+ ion laser (514.5 nm, Coherent Innova 300).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectrometer is equipped with confocal optics, a CCD detector cooled by liquid nitrogen, and a double-stage spectrometer with a 1,800 g mm1 grating, resulting in spectral resolution of 1 cm1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The output power was varied according to the sample signal between 0.3 and 1.0 W.
