Antarctic last interglacial isotope peak in response to sea ice retreat not ice-sheet collapse  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Several studies have suggested that sea-level rise during the last interglacial implies retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevalent hypothesis is that the retreat coincided with the peak Antarctic temperature and stable water isotope values from 128,000 years ago (128 ka); very early in the last interglacial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, by analysing climate model simulations of last interglacial WAIS loss featuring water isotopes, we show instead that the isotopic response to WAIS loss is in opposition to the isotopic evidence at 128 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, a reduction in winter sea ice area of 65±7% fully explains the 128 ka ice core evidence.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our finding of a marked retreat of the sea ice at 128 ka demonstrates the sensitivity of Antarctic sea ice extent to climate warming.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'During the last interglacial (LIG; 130,000115,000 years ago) global climate was warmer than today1,2,3,4 and global mean sea level was 6-9 m higher5,6,7,8,9,10 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This LIG sea-level high stand was mainly driven by ice-sheet loss5,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent ice core results indicate that the Greenland ice sheet likely provided a modest 2 m contribution towards the global sea-level rise5, with estimates ranging from +1.4 m to +4.3 m12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) must have contributed to the LIG sea-level maxima: loss of the entire WAIS would contribute 34 m of global sea-level rise13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coral records from Western Australia indicate that the sea level rose late in the interglacial, 118,000 years ago (118 kyr ago)9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Seychelles coral has been interpreted as indication of a +5 m global sea level at 128 ka6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differing interpretations prevent constraint on the timing of WAIS loss, thus reducing the potential to use the LIG to inform the debate on the likelihood of future WAIS loss11,13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We therefore turn to the ice core records to push forward the WAIS loss debate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Time series of Antarctic ice core stable water isotope records and sea level during the last interglacial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Stable water isotope (18O and D) anomalies relative to the last 3 kyr ago from four deep ice cores16: Vostok (blue), Dome F (DF; red), EPICA Dome C (EDC; grey for D and purple for 18O) and EPICA Dronning Maud Land (EDML; orange).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Global sea level7 (purple curve; heavy line marks median projection, dashed lines the 16th and 84th percentiles, and dotted lines the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) and Red Sea relative sea-level10 records (brown curve; solid line shows maximum likelihood and shading represents 95% confidence limits).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Antarctic isotope peak at 128±2 kyr ago is shaded grey.Full size image', 'The recent ice core drilled at WAIS Divide15 does not extend back through the LIG; ice that may have been present during the LIG has since been lost through basal melt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, ice cores extending back throughout the LIG, at a resolution of  less_than 200 years per metre of ice16, are available from four locations on the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From west to east these are: EPICA Dronning Maud Land (EDML); Dome F (DF); Vostok; and EPICA Dome C (EDC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These four ice cores all record an isotopic maximum at 128 ka, associated with peak Antarctic warmth1,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Relative to the last 3 kyr ago, this LIG isotopic maximum is between 2 and 4 in 18O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been suggested that WAIS loss is required to explain the magnitude of this isotope maximum4,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, an alternative hypothesis exists; that reduced Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent provides an alternative explanation for the 128 ka isotopic maximum15,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both ice and ocean core evidence suggests that a large retreat of the Antarctic sea ice edge may have occurred at 128 ka21,22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We carry out a series of climate model experiments incorporating 18O (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We evaluate experiments including WAIS loss and Southern Hemisphere sea ice retreat at 128 ka against existing Antarctic ice core data (see Methods for full details and Supplementary Table 1 for a full list of experiments).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that a full WAIS collapse cannot explain the magnitude or the spatial pattern of the 128 ka 18O maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Removing the WAIS causes changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation seasonality that tends to reduce 18O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including WAIS, meltwater reduces 18O by freshening the surface ocean, resulting in cooling and sea ice expansion, which does not improve the modeldata agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major sea ice retreat of 65±7% increases 18O and does result in a good modeldata agreement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding will have consequences for sea ice projection in a future warmer climate.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have explored only complete WAIS loss, rather than WAIS reduction, scenarios here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results thus do not preclude some loss of the WAIS by 128 ka, or that the WAIS may have been lost later in the LIG, possibly preconditioned by the early retreat of Southern Hemisphere sea ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, loss of the WAIS between 128 and 125 kyr ago and a meltwater driven build-up of Southern Hemisphere sea ice may provide an explanation for the late LIG 18O drop observed in ice core records; the 18O trend throughout the early LIG, with a significant peak and subsequent drop, is distinct from the isotope record of the present interglacial (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that the LIG isotope trend may be consistent with a WAIS collapse and sea ice build-up in the following few thousand years of the isotope maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The difference between an isotope record from Mt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moulton and East Antarctic ice core records27 may also be consistent with a slow loss of the WAIS, which could have been mostly melted after another 2,000 years, by 126 kyr ago.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower isotope anomalies in the Mt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moulton record relative to isotope records from East Antarctica suggest a local cooling anomaly, which is consistent with climate model simulations of WAIS collapse driven by pre-industrial boundary conditions27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low isotope values in the Mt.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moulton record, relative to the other ice core sites, persists throughout the LIG, but the difference is greatest after 126 kyr ago, perhaps coinciding with maximum retreat of the WAIS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the reasonable agreement between the observed peak-to-trough 18O anomalies and those calculated between our sea ice retreat and the WAIS loss experiments (Supplementary Fig 5), we suggest that a large sea ice retreat best explains the early isotope maximum and a subsequent retreat of the WAIS, and sea ice build-up could provide an explanation for the observed pattern of isotope anomalies following the LIG maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The bipolar seesaw mechanism28 proposes that a slowdown in northwards ocean heat transport, particularly in the Atlantic, tends to warm the Southern Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism is consistent with a recent bipolar re-interpretation of the early LIG29, alongside a recent synthesis of sea surface temperature reconstructions between 40 and 60° S (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These all support Southern Ocean warming at 128 ka, providing a partial explanation for why Southern Hemisphere sea ice retreated at 128 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In future work, we will investigate whether the bipolar seesaw can provide the mechanism to cause a major Southern Hemisphere sea ice retreat and thus reconcile the 128 ka 18O maximum.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further simulations, including WAIS loss and North Atlantic meltwater input, could provide insight into the non-linear interactions between the bipolar seesaw, the WAIS and Southern Hemisphere sea ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Finally, we note the similarity between the wintertime sea ice reduction of up to 58% forecast for the end of the 21st century12 and our 5872% decrease suggested for 128 ka.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This implies that the 128 ka sea ice retreat may prove a crucial modeldata target for the sea ice modelling community.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Currently, the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 multi-model simulations2,12,30 do not simulate a reduction in September sea ice area  greater than 13% between the LIG and the present interglacial (Supplementary Discussion; Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the disagreement between modelled and observed Antarctic sea ice during the satellite era31, a number of studies have called for improvements in the modelling of climate and climate change in the Antarctic region31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether this recent discrepancy is a function of natural variability34 or represents a failing of current climate models is still a matter of debate31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the currently observed increase in Antarctic sea ice is robust, a major reduction at 128 ka could indicate a tipping point in the sea ice system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is clearly a need for more (and more robust) data for Antarctica and the surrounding sea ice edge during the LIG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If it is possible to correctly simulate the 128 ka sea ice reduction, it would improve the low confidence associated with future predictions of Southern Hemisphere sea ice change and, subsequently, improve projections of Antarctic temperature, precipitation and mass balance35.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

for an additional 50 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We adopt a clean method to force a sea ice retreat by prescribing a heat flux to the bottom of Antarctic sea ice at all longitudes and all latitudes south of 49° S, with no other effect to the model physics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sea ice forcing is held constant throughout the annual cycle, so the model can still calculate the seasonal cycle of sea ice growth and decay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the simulated sea ice evolution is only reduced from the coupled models equilibrium response, but still consistent with the internal model physics, and sea surface temperatures and sea ice in our simulations are always internally consistent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sea ice thus evolves with the coupled model, and the ocean and atmosphere respond to sea ice changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We perform a range of experiments, each with a different prescribed heat flux from 0 (no forcing) to 120 W m2 (see Supplementary Table 1 for a full list of experiments).

Hemisphere sea ice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is supported by Fig 2d and Supplementary Table 1, which suggest that the inclusion of meltwater from a WAIS collapse results in a 15% increase in sea ice area.
