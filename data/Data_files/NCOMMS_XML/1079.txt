Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Macromolecular diffusion in homogeneous fluid at length scales greater than the size of the molecule is regarded as a random process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mean-squared displacement (MSD) of molecules in this regime increases linearly with time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that non-random motion of DNA molecules in this regime that is undetectable by the MSD analysis can be quantified by characterizing the molecular motion relative to a latticed frame of reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our lattice occupancy analysis reveals unexpected sub-modes of motion of DNA that deviate from expected random motion in the linear, diffusive regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that a subtle interplay between these sub-modes causes the overall diffusive motion of DNA to appear to conform to the linear regime.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results show that apparently random motion of macromolecules could be governed by non-random dynamics that are detectable only by their relative motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analytical approach should advance broad understanding of diffusion processes of fundamental relevance.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Brownian motion, as famously explained by Albert Einstein in 1905, is a process during which tiny particles move randomly in a homogeneous isotropic fluid as they experience independent molecular collisions from the thermally excited fluid molecules1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This erratic particle motion has fascinated scientists for most of the last two centuries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Probing biomolecular interactions2, imaging of cell organelles and nanostructures in three dimensions3,4 and building molecular motors5 are among the major scientific applications of Brownian motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full molecular-scale context of Brownian motion occurs in three basic regimes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the first regime before any molecular collisions, the particle shows a ballistic-like motion6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second regime, which begins when the particle interacts with fluid molecules and the resulting friction creates local vortices that act on the particle, the molecular motion is affected by hydrodynamic forces of the fluid7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These ballistic and hydrodynamic regimes, therefore, deviate from the random Brownian motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the third regime during which the particle diffuses its own radius, statistically independent collisions dominate the motion, causing the overall motion of the particle to be random.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The random Brownian motion causes the random positions of the particle, and therefore, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of molecules increases linearly with time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Among the dynamics of particles in fluids6,7,8, those of DNA are rather unique9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DNA is a semiflexible polymer; its motion in a homogeneous isotropic medium and within its radius of gyration is governed by the constraints imposed by its chain connectivity and by various intramolecular hydrodynamic interactions10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dynamics, which complicate the hydrodynamic regime of DNA molecules, often cross over and partially affect their linear diffusive regime12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, at diffusion distances close to the radius of gyration, the motion of DNA molecules is non-linear and subdiffusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At longer diffusion distances and at long time scales, DNA molecules diffuse, following the expected behaviour of a polymer as a whole, and MSD is linear with time12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although slow conformational fluctuations have been observed within the time scale of the diffusive motion of DNA14, the physical origin of these fluctuations and whether they affect the diffusive motion of DNA have not been determined.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This fundamental understanding has thus far been hampered by a lack of both theory and analytical tools that give access to the diffusive regime of macromolecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report the development of new theoretical framework and analytical tool that can capture the motion of macromolecules in their diffusive regime by characterizing the motion relative to a latticed frame of reference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our new methodlattice occupancy analysisreveals unexpected sub-modes of motion of DNA molecules that deviate from the expected random motion in the linear, diffusive regime.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

a sub-diffusive profile, whereas MSD analyses of the SrAr (Fig 3h green line) and the SiAr (Fig 3h red line) replicates produced linear profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that the sub-diffusive behaviour of DNA observed in the hydrodynamic non-random regime (Fig 2c) results from the order of the directions of the steps of the DNA walk.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identification of the diffusion modes of DNA', 'Next, we investigated the origin of the hidden non-random motion of DNA molecules in the linear, diffusive regime as revealed by lattice occupancy analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to the random walk theory, statistical variations in step sizes and step directions yield trajectories that resemble by chance those of directed and confined modes of diffusion (Supplementary Fig 6af)24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The MSD-t profiles obtained from the trajectories with directed-like and confined-like modes of motion thus respectively exhibited concave and convex curves as described by equations (10) and (11) (see Methods; Supplementary Fig 6g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These apparent deviations from random motion arise from the limited length of the experimental trajectories.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because these apparent deviations are viewed as parts of the random fractal nature of the diffusive regime of Brownian motion, they are persistent at all time scales22,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the temporal fluctuations of the P25 value occurring at the time scale of the linear, diffusive regime are accounted for by both the non-random motion of DNA and the apparent deviations (directed-like and confined-like modes) from the random motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, lattice occupancy analyses of simulated trajectories displaying directed-like and confined-like modes of diffusion respectively yield a low lattice occupancy mode (high P25 value) and a high lattice occupancy mode (low P25 value) (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As a first step in distinguishing the apparent non-random diffusion caused by statistical variations intrinsic to Brownian motion and actual non-random diffusion of DNA, we compared the temporal profiles retrieved from the relevant analytical tool in each case.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we compared the temporal behaviour characterized by MSD analysis (apparent non-random diffusion) and the temporal P25 profile (actual non-random diffusion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first normalized the temporal profile between 0 and 1 and split the trajectory into high and low lattice occupancy modes at the mean (nP) (Fig 4a, Supplementary Data 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The characterization of the temporal behaviour by MSD analysis was conducted by first calculating the MSD-t plots at each time point by applying a sliding window with a 50t time width (see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The directed- and confined-like motions were quantified by drift velocity (, equation (10)) and the length of the confined area (L, equation (11)) and normalized to nP and 1 and nP and 0, respectively (Fig 4b, Supplementary Data 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We refer to these directed-like and confined-like modes that result from MSDs absolute measurement as absolute modes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then superimposed the normalized P25 and MSD (that is,  and L) temporal profiles for analysing the modes of diffusion qualitatively (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison of the two temporal profiles identified the time instances at which the correlation between the P25 and MSD profiles was positive (directed-like motion with low lattice occupancy (high P25) mode (d-LO sub-mode) and confined-like motion with high lattice occupancy (low P25) mode (c-HO sub-mode)) (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the temporal profiles also revealed that they are not always positively correlated with each other (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, the temporal profiles showed that the confined-like motion was sometime correlated with the low lattice occupancy mode (c-LO sub-mode) and that the directed-like mode was sometime correlated with the high lattice occupancy mode (d-HO sub-mode) (Fig 4c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ',

determine if any of these four sub-modes (d-LO, c-HO, c-LO and d-HO) causes the non-random motion of DNA, we devised a four-step analytical approach (Fig 5 and Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we split the normalized P25 and MSD temporal profiles (Fig 4a,b) into two mode-sets at nP (step A in Fig 5, Supplementary Note 3) and calculated the amplitudes of the local variations (ALV) between the two profiles (step B in Fig 5, Fig 6a) using the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm (Supplementary Data 5, see Methods for details) to quantify the deviations between the two time profiles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The DTW algorithm provided a negative ALV (ALV zone) when the amplitude in the P25 profile was larger than the amplitude in the MSD profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, the DTW algorithm provided a positive ALV (+ALV zone) when the amplitude in the P25 profile was smaller than the amplitude in the MSD profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, extremely negative ALV values in the first and second mode-sets reflect the c-LO and d-HO sub-modes, respectively, and extremely positive ALV values in the first and second mode-sets reflect the d-HO and c-LO modes, respectively

calculated MSD-t plots and step-size distributions to analyse the diffusion modes (step D in Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we compared these trajectories with their respective trajectories obtained

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Studying the relative motion of single molecules provides a means to extract essential information on non-random dynamics that has remained inaccessible via conventional theories of absolute measurements (Supplementary Fig 13).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the motion of DNA relative to a square lattice to unlock a subtle dynamic regime in the Brownian motion of DNA and to uncover that diffusion speed of polymer molecules and the mode of motion have unexpected effects on 2D lattice occupancy (that is, the presence of unexpected c-LO and d-HO sub-modes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our analytical approach is different from, yet complementary to, other analytical methods such as cumulative area tracking (CA tracking)16,17,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CA tracking method analyses the diffusion constant of single molecules by relating the mean cumulative area difference to the elapsed time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CA tracking has two major advantages.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, in contrast to our lattice occupancy analysis, which uses single-molecule localization algorithms to determine the position of the molecule, CA tracking circumvents the localization step of the molecule while employing simple tracking of a limited number of pixels (proxy pixels) that define the position of the molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, by controlling the number of proxy pixels, conformational dynamics can be simultaneously analysed by CA tracking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A major difference between our lattice occupancy algorithm and CA tracking is that the latter cannot be used to calculate 2D lattice occupancy because of the random shape of the proxy pixels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the effect of a change in the shape of the proxy pixels is averaged out during the calculation of the diffusion constant, a large error can be introduced in the time-dependent lattice occupancy profile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lattice occupancy analysis is therefore complementary to CA tracking because it allows us to characterize the relative motion of DNA and to correlate it with the conformational relaxation time of the molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By using lattice occupancy and MSD analyses, we found that the relative motion of DNA is dramatically affected by the distribution of its step sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, an increase in the step sizes during confined-like motion pushes the molecular positions apart, and the relative motion thus exhibits low lattice occupancy (c-LO sub-modes).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, a decrease in the step sizes during directed-like motion causes the relative motion to exhibit high lattice occupancy (d-HO sub-mode).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We termed the coincidence between specific distributions of step sizes and the modes of motion as step-to-mode matching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Validation of this matching was obtained by randomizing the step directions of the experimental trajectories to break the matching of the diffusional modes to the original step sizes (the SiAr simulated replicates).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that this breaking caused the HE profiles to have partial rather than full overlap with that of the experimental replicates (Fig 3g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another validation was obtained by altering the step-sizes of the c-LO or the d-HO sub-modes at a time to break the matching of the step sizes to the original diffusive modes (the csh-LO and the dlg-HO simulated trajectories).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that manipulating the step-sizes caused well-defined deviations from the linear MSD-time profile (Fig 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we conclude that the combined behaviour of these non-random dynamics, rather than a simple stochastic process, is essential for the overall single-molecule behaviour to conform to the linear trend of MSD.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This remarkable conservation of the linear trend suggests that these dynamics are in a subtle mechanistic balance, suggesting that they could be attributed to the same physical origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While this physical origin is still not entirely clear, the good agreement between c-LO and R is noteworthy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This agreement partially accounts for the non-random dynamics and suggests that they are related to the conformational relaxation dynamics of DNA in which the relaxed conformations diffuse with shorter step sizes than do the compact conformations that diffuse with longer step sizes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a similar yet fundamentally different behaviour was previously elucidated as autocorrelated fluctuations in step sizes, these fluctuations are caused by changes in the radius of gyration and are attributed to the internal conformational fluctuations of DNA11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These internal fluctuations relax by diffusion, and their characteristic time is defined as the time required by the molecule to diffuse a distance that equals its radius of gyration (tRg(Rg))29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative dynamics that we report in this study can be distinguished from these internal fluctuations because the time scale of the relative dynamics is much longer than the characteristic time scale of the internal fluctuations (c-LO Rg) (Fig 2c, Supplementary Fig 9b) and because of the characteristic step-to-mode matching that we observed in our analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Further to the above-mentioned rational for the mechanism of the relative dynamics, we believe these dynamics could be relatedin partto the anisotropic diffusion of DNA because of its transient relaxation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the time when the DNA molecule is relaxed, its shape is anisotropic, which can be modelled as an elongated ellipsoid where a (length)  b (width).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting anisotropic diffusion involves two components, Da, diffusion coefficient in directions parallel to the long axis (Da=kBT/a), and Db, diffusion coefficient in directions perpendicular to the long axis (Db=kBT/b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the friction coefficient a is smaller than b, Da is greater than Db and therefore the molecule is expected to show directed-like motion30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The time scale of this directed-like motion is determined by  (the time required for the ellipsoid to diffuse 1 rad by rotational motion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At time scales longer than , the rotation randomizes the motion and, eventually, results in a crossover from anisotropic diffusion to isotropic diffusion30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the elongation of the DNA occurs transiently during the conformational relaxation process, we cannot gather conclusive evidence on whether  is correlated with R and with c-LO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because of this uncertainty and the fact that shape isotropy/anisotropy cannot similarly explain the confined-like sub-mode motion, we argue that anisotropic diffusion couldonly partiallyexplain the directed-like sub-mode motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, we conclude that the conformational relaxation dynamics and the anisotropic diffusion partially elucidate the mechanism of the relative dynamics we describe here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Describing the full mechanism remains an open research question.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the diffusion mode to be reliably captured using lattice occupancy analysis, the time scale of the dynamics should be slower than the frame rate of the detector and faster than the diffusion of the molecule out of the focal plane of the microscope.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This limits the time scale of the dynamics that can be captured by lattice occupancy analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A detector with a faster frame rate31, stroboscopic laser excitation32 and 3D single-molecule tracking techniques33 may further expand the applicability of the analysis to wider time scales.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The results reported here demonstrate that studying the relative motion of single molecules provides information on the dynamics hidden in their diffusive motion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These dynamics, which we term conserved linear dynamics, were not previously observed in the motion of single molecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our identification of conserved linear dynamics suggest that the apparent random diffusive motion of molecules in nature could actually be governed by non-random dynamics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations and our analytical approach provide a new method for advancing our understanding of diffusion processes that are central to studies in diverse scientific fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, from studying anomalous diffusion processes in biophysics to studying dynamic disorder in polymer science, our analytical approach could uncover essential dynamics and hence could provide access to intriguing applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To that end, understanding the relative motion of molecules in terms of the specific modes of diffusion in the relevant fields (similar to what is shown in Figs 4, 8 and 9) is essential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such fundamental knowledge could also provide essential information on crucial diffusion-limited processes of the cell.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
