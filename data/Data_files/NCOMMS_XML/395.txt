Pairing in a dry Fermi sea  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In the traditional BardeenCooperSchrieffer theory of superconductivity, the amplitude for the propagation of a pair of electrons with momentum k and k has a log singularity as the temperature decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This so-called Cooper instability arises from the presence of an electron Fermi sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It means that an attractive interaction, no matter how weak, will eventually lead to a pairing instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in the pseudogap regime of the cuprate superconductors, where parts of the Fermi surface are destroyed, this log singularity is suppressed, raising the question of how pairing occurs in the absence of a Fermi sea.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report Hubbard model numerical results and the analysis of angular-resolved photoemission experiments on a cuprate superconductor.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to the traditional theory, we find that in the pseudogap regime the pairing instability arises from an increase in the strength of the spinfluctuation pairing interaction as the temperature decreases rather than the Cooper log instability.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Evidence that the pseudogap (PG) in a slightly underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ (Bi2212, Tc90 K) sample destroys the BardeenCooperSchrieffer (BCS) logarithmic pairing instability1 raises again the question of the role of the PG in the high-temperature superconducting cuprates2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The elimination of the BCS instability is consistent with the view that the PG competes with superconductivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as noted in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, the onset of superconductivity with a Tc90 K suggests an alternative scenario in which the PG reflects the formation of short-range pairing correlations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The superconducting transition temperature can be determined from the BetheSalpeter gap equation', '', 'Here G(k, n) is the dressed single-particle Greens function,  is the irreducible particleparticle pairing vertex, and k and n=(2n+1)T are the usual momentum and Matsubara frequencies, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The temperature at which the leading eigenvalue of equation (1) goes to 1 gives Tc and the corresponding eigenfunction (k, n) determines the symmetry of the gap.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In spinfluctuation theories, the pairing vertex is approximated by an effective interaction', '', 'with (q, m) the spin susceptibility and  a coupling strength.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Various groups have used experimental data to model (q, m), G(k, n) and , to determine whether a spinfluctuation pairing interaction is consistent with the observed Tc values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Dahm et al.3 used inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements for YBa2Cu3O6.6 to model the spin susceptibility (q, m) and a one-loop self-energy approximation to determine G.  was an adjustable parameter estimated from INS and angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the resulting G and Veff in equation (1), they concluded that a spinfluctuation interaction had sufficient strength to account for the observed Tc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nishiyama et al.4 used INS results for (q, ) and solved the Eliashberg equations for the heavy fermion compounds CeCuSi2 and CeIrIn3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For reasonable values of , they found Tc values, which were again consistent with the notion that antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations were responsible for pairing in these materials.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent paper, Mishra, et al.1 used ARPES data at T=140 K for a slightly underdoped Bi2212 (Tc=90 K) sample, to examine the effect of the PG on the superconducting transition temperature and to determine whether a spinfluctuation pairing mechanism could account for the observed Tc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They found that the usual BCS logarithmic divergence associated with the propagators in equation (1) was destroyed by the PG and the leading eigenvalue d(T) arising from the spinfluctuation interaction (equation (2)) remained small, and was essentially independent of temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the question of the interplay between the PG and superconductivity2 continues to be of interest5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we explore this question using numerical simulations for a Hubbard model and an analysis of ARPES data for a slightly underdoped Bi2212 sample in the superconducting state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The band parameters and filling of the Hubbard model are chosen so that it exhibits a PG as evidenced by a peak in the q=0 spin susceptibility, as the temperature decreases along with a gap, which opens in the antinodal region of the single-particle spectral weight A(k, ).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ARPES data for Bi2212 was taken in the superconducting state at 40 K and provides a comparison with the previous analysis1 based on ARPES data taken in the normal state at 140 K. From the numerical calculations we conclude that the PG, similar to the superconductivity, arises due to short-range AF correlations, and that contrary to the usual case in which the pairing instability is associated with the Cooper instability, here the strength of the spin fluctuations increases as the temperature decreases, leading to the pairing instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis of the 40 K Bi2212 ARPES data relative to the results of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, which were based on 140 K data on the same sample, shows an increase in the strength of the d-wave projection of the spinfluctuation interaction strength, consistent with the dynamic cluster approximation (DCA) results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this we conclude that contrary to the conclusion of ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1, spin fluctuations can account for the d-wave pairing in Bi2212.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Mishra et al.1 referred to as the pairing kernel.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as noted, they found that with this suppression, the spinfluctuation pairing interaction failed to give a superconducting transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on this, they suggested that the PG reflects the presence of short-range pairfield correlations, which grow below T* and become coherent at Tc.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour could be likened to the magnetic response of the large U half-filled Hubbard model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, the formation of local moments when the temperature drops below U/2 is seen

closely related to the formation of short-range AF correlations than to local pair correlations in agreement with earlier ideas of Johnston14 and more recent theoretical results5,6,7,8,21.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have used DCA calculations for an under (hole) doped 2D Hubbard model, which exhibits a PG, to see whether a spinfluctuation interaction provides a reasonable approximation of the irreducible pairing interaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these calculations, the dynamic mean-field cluster is such that charge density and striping instabilities are suppressed, leaving AF and d-wave pairing as the dominant correlations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the PG eliminates the usual BCS logarithmic divergence of the pairing kernel, we find that a pairing instability arises from an increase in the strength of the spinfluctuation interaction as the temperature decreases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that the PG suppresses the BCS logarithmic divergence is similar to the result reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the increase in the pairing strength of the spin fluctuations found in the DCA calculation is at odds with the results reported in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We believe that this disagreement reflects a failure of the approximation in which the single-particle spectral weight at a higher temperature is used to determine the single-particle Greens function at lower temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using a single-particle spectral weight constructed from ARPES data at 40 K, we find a significant enhancement of the d-wave projected spinfluctuation strength relative to that at 140 K. Thus, we find that the DCA results are consistent with the 40 K ARPES data and the increase in the strength of the spin fluctuations can lead to superconductivity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
