Annually resolved North Atlantic marine climate over the last millennium  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Owing to the lack of absolutely dated oceanographic information before the modern instrumental period, there is currently significant debate as to the role played by North Atlantic Ocean dynamics in previous climate transitions (for example, Medieval Climate Anomaly-Little Ice Age, MCA-LIA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present analyses of a millennial-length, annually resolved and absolutely dated marine 18O archive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We interpret our record of oxygen isotope ratios from the shells of the long-lived marine bivalve Arctica islandica (18O-shell), from the North Icelandic shelf, in relation to seawater density variability and demonstrate that solar and volcanic forcing coupled with ocean circulation dynamics are key drivers of climate variability over the last millennium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the pre-industrial period (AD 10001800) variability in the sub-polar North Atlantic leads changes in Northern Hemisphere surface air temperatures at multi-decadal timescales, indicating that North Atlantic Ocean dynamics played an active role in modulating the response of the atmosphere to solar and volcanic forcing.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The climate of the last 1,000 years is characterized by the gradual pre-industrial cooling of the Northern Hemisphere associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly-Little Ice Age (MCA-LIA) transition1 and the onset of modern warming2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Over these timescales, natural temperature variability has been linked to interactions between fluctuations in total solar irradiance (TSI)2,3, volcanic aerosols2,4 and internal climate system mechanisms (for example, ocean heat storage and transport5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With climate model simulations suggesting a significant slowdown in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, in response to anthropogenic forcing over the twenty-first century6, there is a pressing need to provide a more robust quantitative assessment of the role changes in the North Atlantic Ocean dynamics have played in the evolution of the climate system during the recent past.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our current understanding of past climate fluctuations is largely derived from instrumental time series7,8, numerical climate models (for example, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9) and robustly dated well-calibrated proxy archives (for example, dendrochronologies10,11, ice cores12,13, corals14 and speleothems15) at high frequencies (inter-annual) and ocean sediment archives at lower resolutions (multi-decadal to centennial)16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These records have highlighted the inherent complexities in the oceanatmosphere system with TSI3 and volcanic aerosols2,4,18 acting as topdown forcings driving ocean and atmosphere variability, coupled with internal variability and feedback mechanisms within the ocean acting as bottom-up drivers modulating the atmospheric climate response19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the interaction between ocean dynamics (such as sea surface temperature (SST), seawater density, surface circulation and overturning circulation strength) and atmospheric variability remain poorly characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The difficulty in constraining the role of coupled oceanatmosphere mechanisms in climate variability to a large extent results from the limited length of oceanographic instrumental time series7,8 and the low temporal resolution and dating uncertainties associated with marine sediment archives.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These issues hinder the identification of causal relationships through for example leadlag analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite these challenges, evidence derived from marine proxy records has indicated that there were broad scale changes in the North Atlantic dynamics over the last millennium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, during the MCA-LIA transition, analyses of foraminifera from the Straits of Florida indicate the strength of the Gulf Stream and associated heat transport reduced by ca.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  20).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, regional marine radiocarbon reservoir (R) determinations from long-lived bivalves suggest an increase in the proportion of Arctic water entrained onto the North Icelandic shelf21 at this time and reconstructions derived from coralline algae22 and sedimentary biomarker records23 suggest a synchronous increase in Arctic and Icelandic sea-ice extent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, radiocarbon determinations from deep sea benthic foraminifera also indicate changes in the deep-water composition of the Atlantic24, coincident with these upper ocean shifts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies demonstrate that variability across the North Atlantic marine environment was synchronous, within the temporal uncertainties, with the gradual reduction in Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature (NHSAT) over the MCA-LIA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the resolution and lack of absolute dating of all of these proxy records preclude the assessment of whether variability in the marine environment was playing an active role in driving the changes in NHSAT over the MCA-LIA transition, because they are not suitable for detailed leadlag analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These constraints present a clear challenge to understanding the role ocean dynamics play in the wider climate system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report a new 1,048-year precisely dated, annually resolved marine oxygen isotope record (18O-shell) that spans the entirety of the last 1,000 years (AD 9532000).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high-resolution record facilitates leadlag analysis of high-frequency climate variability occurring across the ocean and atmosphere beyond the observational era.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 18O-shell record is derived from the 18O composition of aragonite sampled from the annually formed growth increments in the shells of the long-lived marine bivalve mollusc Arctica islandica collected from the North Icelandic shelf (66° 31.59 N, 18° 11.74 W; shells collected from 80 m water depth25; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This location and water depth situates the shells within the inner North Icelandic Irminger Current (NIIC; Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This oceanographic setting is ideally situated for the examination of the role that ocean dynamics play in driving wider climate variability, reflecting the interplay between two distinct water masses: the relatively warm and saline Subpolar Mode Water (SPMW) and the cool and fresh Arctic Intermediate Water (AIW).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 510% of the 1019 Sv (1 Sv=106 m3 s1) of SPMW water and associated heat flux, transported north in the Irminger Current, flowing as part of the sub-polar gyre, separates in the southern Denmark Strait and forms the clockwise flowing NIIC (Fig 1 and refs 26, 27).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the NIIC flows along the North Icelandic shelf large amounts of polar AIW waters are entrained, increasing the net volume transport of the outermost branch of the NIIC from 1.1 to 2 Sv (55% SPMW/45% AIW)27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the somewhat weaker (0.3 Sv) inner NIIC retains its SPMW characteristics as it follows the inner North Icelandic shelf eastward at water depths of up to 100 m (Fig 1c)27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Maps of the modern surface currents of the North Atlantic and Icelandic shelf.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) North Atlantic circulation and (b) North Icelandic shelf circulation pattern.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrows shown in blue correspond to cool and relatively fresh Arctic-sourced waters;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Linear regression indicates a weakly significant correlation between variability in our 18O-shell record and the North Icelandic shelf regional marine radiocarbon reservoir ages (R)21 (r=0.39±0.29, P=0.056; Fig 2 and Supplementary Figs 4 and 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The R data represent the regional difference from the global mean ocean radiocarbon reservoir age, which on the North Icelandic shelf also reflects the degree of entrainment of relatively old (with respect to carbon) polar AIW into the younger SPMW transported by the NIIC21,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coherence between the North Icelandic shelf R21 and 18O-shell series indicates that during periods characterized by relatively older (younger) R values, due to a relative increase (decrease) in the proportion of AIW within the NIIC, the 18O composition of the shell aragonite increases (decreases), indicative of an increase (decrease) in the density of the ambient seawater bathing the site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It has previously been proposed that changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation are linked to variability in the degree of AIW entrainment into the NIIC and therefore the SPMW/AIW composition of the waters influencing the North Icelandic shelf21,31,32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although instrumental oceanographic observations are currently of insufficient length to evaluate this suggestion, evidence derived from an ensemble of 17 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) unforced pre-industrial control simulations suggests that changes in SST and SSS on the North Icelandic shelf correlate significantly with inter-annual and multi-decadal scale variability in North Atlantic barotropic and overturning stream functions (Fig 4 and Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stability of these correlations, irrespective of the smoothing function applied, indicates that the SST and SSS (along with the associated seawater density) variability on the North Icelandic shelf are sensitive to changes in Atlantic circulation dynamics (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Model analyses of the coherence between North Icelandic SST and SSS variability and North Atlantic circulation.Correlation between annual North Icelandic SSTs against (a) barotropic stream function and (c) overturning stream function, and SSS against (b) barotropic stream function and (d) overturning stream function, in the North Atlantic derived from an ensemble CMIP5 preindustrial control simulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The solid black lines show the time-mean stream functions.Full size image', 'To better constrain the uncertainties associated with the role that the ocean system plays within the wider climate system, it is necessary to assess quantitatively the degree to which ocean variability is related to external forcing mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To do this we compare the new 18O-shell record to millennial climate forcing time series (volcanics, TSI and modelled combined forcings), NHSAT, derived from a composite dendrochronological record11, and Greenland air temperatures, derived from an ice core stack13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Estimates of past TSI variability can be characterized into two distinct intervals, the observed period (AD 1750 to present) and the proxy-generated reconstruction period (years before AD 1750)2,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The proxy reconstruction of TSI, derived from radiogenic isotopes (10Be and 14C) is typically deficient in the high-frequency component of the solar variability spectrum (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed TSI period however captures both the longer-term trends, such as the gradual increase in TSI since the end of the Maunder Minimum in the early AD 1700s and high-frequency variability such as the 11-year sunspot cycle2,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We identify a significant correlation between the 18O-shell series and TSI over the last 1,000 years (annual resolution r=0.27, P less_than 0.05; decadal resolution r=0.34, P less_than 0.05).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlation is significantly stronger over the observed period of AD 17501997 (r=0.68 P less_than 0.05), suggesting that TSI variability may explain up to 47% of the variance in seawater density over this period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coherence spectra of the correlations show that the increase in correlation over the observed period is not likely to be due to low-frequency variability, as similar levels of coherence were identified across these portions of the spectrum for both the observed period and the entire millennium (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, over the observed period, significant correlations (r=0.39, P less_than 0.01) were identified within the high-frequency domains (using 50-year loess first-order high-pass-filtered data; Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This high-frequency component of the solar spectrum is unrepresented in the proxy reconstruction derived from radiogenic isotopes (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although these analyses and several previous studies (e.g.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  refs 16, 17) indicate that solar variability probably plays a role as a natural driver of marine variability, the presence of several large volcanic eruptions over the observed period and the lack of any reliable proxy for high-frequency solar variability over earlier parts of the last millennium complicates the interpretation of the role of solar variability in driving oceanographic variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 5: The 18O-shell series and climate forcings.Comparison between (a) the inverted 18O-shell anomalies (annually resolved and 50-year loess low-pass-filtered data shown by the pink and red lines, respectively) with (b) individual climate forcing indices (TSI and volcanics shown by the orange and green lines, respectively), and (c) combined natural forcings (solar and volcanics;

Fig 5c and ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  2) suggests that, even with the gradual 0.01% increase in TSI since the Maunder Minimum3, natural climate forcings alone cannot account for the significant change in 18O-shell values over the industrial period.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Given the precisely dated nature of the 18O-shell series and its sensitivity to sub-polar North Atlantic variability, these data present the first opportunity to assess quantitatively the previously untestable hypothesis that ocean circulation dynamics might have played an active role in driving the key climate transitions of the last 1,000 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have therefore examined the timing of variability in the absolutely dated 18O-shell series relative to reconstruction of NHSAT, derived from a composite dendrochronological series11 and individual tree ring series, and Greenland air temperatures, derived from an ice core stack13, over the last 1,000 years (Fig 7 and Supplementary Figs 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Leadlag correlation analysis, conducted between the normalized 18O-shell anomalies and NHSAT and Greenland air temperatures, indicates that over the pre-industrial period (AD 9531800) multi-decadal to centennial frequency atmospheric temperature variability lagged changes in the 18O-shell seawater density anomalies by 40±30 years (peak correlation r=0.27 and 0.29, P less_than 0.05 against NHSAT and Greenland air temperatures, respectively).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such a temporal offset is beyond the dating uncertainty of these records.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lead of North Icelandic shelf hydrographic variability over both the NHSAT and Greenland air temperature series strongly indicates that ocean variability played an active role in driving the major pre-industrial climate variability of the past 1,000 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The coincident variability observed in the Greenland air temperature and wider NHSAT records argues against the possibility that the ocean lead we observe is driven by regional changes in atmospheric circulation patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Lead-lag correlation analysis between the inverted 18O-shell anomalies and NHSATs.NHSATs derived from a composite dendrochronological series11 and Greenland air temperatures derived from a stack of Greenland ice cores13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Ten-year and (b) 50-year loess first-order low-pass-filtered 18O-shell anomalies (red lines), Northern Hemisphere air temperatures (green lines) and Greenland air temperatures (blue lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ch) Leadlag correlation plots calculated between the 18O-shell series and Northern Hemisphere air temperatures (green lines), the 18O-shell series and Greenland air temperatures (blue lines), and Northern Hemisphere air temperatures and Greenland air temperatures (grey lines).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The correlations are calculated over three periods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,f) Correlations calculated over the entire millennium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d,g) Correlations calculated over the pre-industrial period (AD 10001800).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e,h) Correlations calculated over the industrial period (AD 18001997).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data used in the correlations in plots ce were 10-year loess first-order low-pass filtered, whereas the data used to calculate the correlations in plots fh were 50-year loess first-order low-pass filtered.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dashed black and red lines in plots (ch) represent the respective 90 and 95% significance levels calculated using 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations using the Ebisuzaki method37.Full size image', 'The results of the leadlag analysis of the reconstructions are further validated using the available ensemble of CMIP5 unforced pre-industrial control simulations (Supplementary Fig 12).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CMIP5 preindustrial control simulations contain no external forcing;

see Supplementary Fig 11), probably driven by the faster response of the atmosphere to the warming influence of greenhouse gases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, examination of the high-frequency variability (20-year high-pass-filtered data; Supplementary Fig 11) implies a tighter coupling with high-frequency forcings/feedback mechanisms causing synchronous variability across both the ocean and atmosphere systems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that during the pre-industrial period internal variability and feedback mechanisms within the North Atlantic substantially mediate the response of the climate system to topdown forcing (TSI, volcanic, atmospheric aerosols and greenhouse gases).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, over the industrial period these data imply that internal oceanic mediation of topdown forcing has been overcome by the rate and nature of the NHSAT increase forced by increasing greenhouse gas concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These findings have implications for the interpretation of the modern climate system, as they highlight the problems that can result from using short modern oceanographic instrumental observations as a representative baseline of natural climate variability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such records, although capturing a component of natural variability, are probably dominated by the anthropogenic signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our data demonstrate shortcomings in methodologies that attempt to extend the modern instrumental ocean observations using absolutely dated records derived from terrestrial proxy networks (for example, see ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  36).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With the reconstructed reversal in the timing of oceanatmosphere coupling, these results question the ability of terrestrial archives alone to reconstruct ocean variability and highlight the need to use independent absolutely dated marine archives to characterize the role ocean dynamics play in the global climate system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The 18O-shell record presented here provides the first precisely dated annually resolved record of past marine variability that spans the entire last 1,000 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It provides a long-term baseline for the state of the North Atlantic coupled climate system and demonstrates that the role played by the ocean in naturally forced climate variability should be a key focus if we are to realise the societally crucial step forward in near-term climate prediction.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
