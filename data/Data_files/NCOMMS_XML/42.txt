Increasing water cycle extremes in California and in relation to ENSO cycle under global warming  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Since the winter of 20132014, California has experienced its most severe drought in recorded history, causing statewide water stress, severe economic loss and an extraordinary increase in wildfires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying the effects of global warming on regional water cycle extremes, such as the ongoing drought in California, remains a challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we analyse large-ensemble and multi-model simulations that project the future of water cycle extremes in California as well as to understand those associations that pertain to changing climate oscillations under global warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both intense drought and excessive flooding are projected to increase by at least 50% towards the end of the twenty-first century; this projected increase in water cycle extremes is associated with a strengthened relation to El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO)in particular, extreme El Niño and La Niña events that modulate Californias climate not only through its warm and cold phases but also its precursor patterns.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'As of mid-November 2014, the majority of the reservoirs in California were at extremely low levels: Lake Oroville, the second largest reservoir in California, lay at 26% of its full capacity, despite being at 90% in April 2013 ( http://cdec.water.ca.gov/).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A drought state of emergency was declared in California in January 2014 ( http://gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18379) in response to historic water shortfalls, as well as an increasing number of wildfires.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The total statewide economic cost of the 201320114 drought is estimated at $2.2 billion, with a total loss of 17,100 jobs1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given continuing drought conditions, a pressing question posed is whether the state of California will experience more frequent drought conditions in upcoming years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The effects of global warming on the regional climate include a hotter and drier climate2,3, as well as earlier snowmelt4, both of which exacerbate drought conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An understanding of the mechanisms that govern changes in extreme events at the regional scale is difficult, as they are likely caused by both anthropogenic CO2 emissions and natural variability5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) suggest a gradual increase in Californias precipitation in response to an increasing CO2 concentration6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Globally, increasing CO2 manifests in fewer occurrences of moderate rain but more light and heavy rain9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these changes in the mean state and characteristics cannot by themselves explain increasing drought severity as is the case for California or other similar extreme hydrological events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At face value, the CMIP5 projections of a wetter climate contradict the hot and dry conditions conducive to increased droughts at the regional scale, as was recently pointed out as an argument for discounting a global warming connection in the 20132014 California drought10.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Projected change in water cycle extremes in California', 'Given the significance of extreme events within California with respect to climate change forcing, we analyse here multiple projections made by the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1); this model has been shown to reasonably capture the variability of precipitation in California5, alongside multiple climate models that participated in the CMIP5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under the RCP8.5 climate change scenario, CESM1 projects a gradual increase in Californias precipitation accompanied with increasing surface warming from 1990 through 2070 (Fig 1a and Supplementary Fig 1); this is consistent with the CMIP5 ensemble6 (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A slight increase in precipitation occurs during boreal winter, yet temperature increases uniformly during all months (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We derive a metric of water cycle extremes, which is defined as the occurrence of both excessively wet and dry events per year in which the standardized precipitation index (SPI) exceeds ±2 in magnitude (see Methods section); this metric is designed to quantify the degree to which California experiences the alternation between extreme wet and extreme dry events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 1b shows that the occurrence of excessively dry events in California increases considerably, and Fig 1c indicates an even more pronounced increase in the occurrence of excessively wet events.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that future water cycle extremes will fluctuate more drastically between increasingly excessively wet and dry years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, extreme dry event occurrence increases from about 5 over the period of 19301939 to about 10 over the period of 20702079 (that is, twofold), while extreme wet event occurrence increases from about 4 during 19301939 to roughly 15 during 20702079 (that is, roughly threefold).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In essence, the rate of increase in extreme wet events is considerably higher than that of extreme dry events; this result is also consistent as realized from the multiple climate models in the CMIP5 ensemble (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We note a difference between CMIP5 and CESM1 that the increase in excessively dry event frequency is larger than that for wet events in CMIP5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, 30-year running variances of both annual precipitation (Fig 1d for CESM1 and Fig 2d for CMIP5 models) and the top 1-m soil moisture content (Fig 1e) mirror the water cycle extremes index, that is, continually increasing towards the end of the twenty-first century.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observed rainfall also shows an increase in the 30-year running variance (Supplementary Fig 3 and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Changing water cycle extremes in California simulated by CESM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Annual mean precipitation, (b) excessively dry events per year with 5-year running average (see text and Methods section), (c) excessively wet events per year with 5-year running average, (d) 30-year running variances of annual precipitation and (e) 30-year running variances of annual soil moisture in the top 1 m of soil layers averaged over California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Solid lines indicate a 30-member ensemble mean of CESM1, while shaded areas indicate model spread;

derived from the 200-hPa geopotential height; see Methods section) during the NovemberDecemberJanuary (NDJ) timeframe; this is when the GARENSO connection is most prominent in the beginning of the rainy season in California, following Wang et al16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combination of Niño-3.4 (Y) and Niño-3.4 (Y+1) represents an ENSO cycle as a whole including both its peak and precursor (see Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sliding correlations reveal a persistent increase in the association between the ENSO cycle and the GAR after 1995.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A similar correlation analysis using reanalysis data (red line in Fig 1f) indicates an even more pronounced increase up to 2012; this echoes the observational increase in the correspondence between the ENSO cycle and California droughts after the 1960s16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is of note that the CESM1 ensemble underestimates the level of increase in the ENSOGAR correlation; this is not surprising since each of the 30 members featured different internal variations and the model may not accurately represent historical variations in other forcing agents such as aerosols18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, Fig 1g and Supplementary Fig 4 show the association between simulated precipitation in California and the ENSO cycle in the NDJ season, and the correlations are in accordance with the ENSOGAR correlations, despite its seemingly slower increase in the CMIP5 models than the CESM1 ensemble (Supplementary Fig 5-6 and Supplementary Note 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Observational rainfall data set (red line in Fig 1g) exhibits large swings, which could be caused by the modulation of low frequency variability such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation12,19 (Supplementary Fig 3 and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taking everything into account, the results suggest a future of increased influence of the ENSO cycle on the North Pacific atmospheric circulation (including the GAR) and subsequent amplification in water cycle extremes over California20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, an increase in water cycle extremes over California due to increased greenhouse gases is consistently and robustly projected by the multi-ensemble of the CESM1 and the multiple climate models in the CMIP5 (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both extreme wet/dry and moderate wet/dry events increase, accompanied by a reduction in those that are coined as normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The result of an enhanced association between the precipitation probability and the ENSO cycle implies that the magnitude of ENSO itself may intensify in the future.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in contrast to previous finding of no change in ENSO amplitude and frequency due to greenhouse warming21,22,23, recent studies24,25 that took non-linear ENSO physics into account have found that extreme El Niño and La Niña events are projected to increase in frequency (see Supplementary Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  7-9 and Supplementary Note 3 for a summary about change in extreme El Niño and La Niña events simulated by CESM1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Uncovered here is the robust relationship between an increase of the water cycle extremes over California and that of extreme El Niño and La Niña events; this was found in the majority of the coupled climate models and most of the ensembles (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only three models in the CMIP5 ensemble and no CESM1 large-ensemble member exhibits a decrease in the number of extreme ENSO events, and only five CMIP5 models and two CESM1 ensemble members exhibit a decreasing number of water cycle extremes in California (Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nonetheless, atmospheric teleconnections associated with the ENSO cycle are more likely to intensify as a result of the Pacific warming21,25; such inferences also apply with respect to the teleconnections associated with ENSO precursors26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Histogram of projected hydrological events change in California.Histogram of the extreme hydrological events change including excessively drydefined as SPI less_than 2, moderate dry (2SPI less_than 1), normal (1SPI less_than 1), moderate wet (1SPI less_than 2) and excessively wet (SPI2) in three sub-regions of California with the CESM1 (a) and the CMIP5 models (b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bootstrap method36 is used to test statistical significance (see Methods section).Full size image', 'Sensitivity experiment without oceanic feedbacks', 'The increased association between ENSO teleconnections and California precipitation suggests an increase in the occurrence and intensity of water cycle extremes in California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two sets of sensitivity experiments with a 1% CO2 increase per year, one with oceanic feedbacks and the other without, are performed to further substantiate the connection between the ENSO and the intensification of water cycle extremes in California (Fig 4) and the role of the anthropogenic GHG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Without oceanic feedbacks in the global ocean (black lines), no significant change in precipitation variation is found, while, with a full dynamic ocean model, a consistent intensification occurs (Fig 1d, RCP8.5 scenario).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: A figure of sensitivity experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Annual precipitation averaged over California from the 1% of CO2 ramping experiment (red) and 1% CO2 ramping experiment without global ocean feedback (black).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) 30-year running variance of annual precipitation averaged over California.Full size image'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Water cycle extremes in California, in terms of both drought and flood, will likely intensify despite the gradual increase of annual mean precipitation that can pose a new challenge in the management of already declining fresh water resources in the future27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The intensified water cycle extremes are linked to strengthened ENSO teleconnections, particularly extreme El Niño and La Niña events, which modulates Californias climate not only through its warm and cold phases, but also ENSOs precursor patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, projections of drought must take into account the coupling within the ENSO cycle and ENSO-related teleconnections and above all, in the context of likely increasing extremes in non-linear fashion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The interplay of the climate dynamics associated with the extreme ENSO events throughout its whole life cycle described form a more complete representation of this particular climate system and, is an integral increment towards improvement in long-lead ENSO predictions28; these ultimately drive more informed management practices that pertain to water resource management and supervision practices in California if not the Western US.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'CESM1 model output', 'Thirty ensemble members were produced by the CESM1 with spatial resolution of 0.9 degrees longitude × 1.25 degrees latitude through the Large Ensemble Project29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The simulations cover two periods: (1) 19202005 with historical forcing, including greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone, land use change, solar and volcanic activity, and (2) 20062080 with RCP8.5 forcing30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ensemble spread of initial conditions is generated by the commonly used round-off differences method29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CESM1 was used here partly because it well captures the ENSO cycle, ENSO precursors31, the associated teleconnections towards North America16, and as a result, precipitation variability in California.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Detailed analysis on the performance of the CESM1 in terms of simulating the ENSO life cycle and rainfall over California is provided in Supplementary Figs 1115 and Supplementary Note 4 for summary.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'CMIP5 model output', '25 out of 38 coupled climate models (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) in CMIP5 are selected with a criteria previously used24,25, that is, the skewness of rainfall over Niño-3 region (5°S5°N, 150°W90°W) has to be larger than 1.0.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using satellite-based precipitation estimation32, the skewness of rainfall over Niño-3 region is 2.75 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the first ensemble member in each model is used here, though all the ensemble members of the CESM1 do produce the skewness larger than 2 (Supplementary Table 2 bottom showing median, minimum, and maximum values).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Number of excessively dry and wet events', 'Numbers of excessively dry and wet events are determined using the SPI33, which is routinely used in drought monitoring and prediction by operational centres34, averaged over three sub-regions of California (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPI is computed using monthly time series of accumulated precipitation, accumulated precipitation departure, and its percentile.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we accumulate the months per year if SPI-12 values, SPI based on 12-month accumulated precipitation, exceed 2 (extremely wet) or 2 (extremely dry).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, one excessively dry event means at least one of the three sub-regions experienced an extremely dry month in a year and it can have values from 0 to 36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SPI-12 indicates a long-term drought on a 12-month time scale, which has more severe impacts on society and hydro-ecosystems.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Reanalysis data', 'Geopotential height and sea surface temperature (SST) from the twentieth century reanalysis project35 were utilized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advantage of the twentieth century reanalysis project is that it provides multiple ensemble members (56 total) to account for the uncertainty in the observation and data assimilation system, and this complements the evaluation of the large-ensemble CESM1 simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'GAR index', 'The GAR index was computed from the geopotential height at 200 hPa averaged within the domain (145°W135°W, 45°N55°N) over the North Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This domain refers to the anomalous high center associated with the 20132014 NDJ anomaly, as shown in Fig 1 inset map, and depicts the associated ridge-trough dipole described in Wang et al16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sensitivity experiment', 'To isolate the effect of the oceanic feedback in the global ocean on water cycle extremes, we designed idealized sensitivity experiments: 1% CO2 ramping experiment;
