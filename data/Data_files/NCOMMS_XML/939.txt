A brain-sparing diphtheria toxin for chemical genetic ablation of peripheral cell lineages  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Conditional expression of diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) is widely used for tissue-specific ablation of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, diphtheria toxin (DT) crosses the bloodbrain barrier, which limits its utility for ablating peripheral cells using Cre drivers that are also expressed in the central nervous system (CNS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report the development of a brain-sparing DT, termed BRAINSPAReDT, for tissue-specific genetic ablation of cells outside the CNS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We prevent bloodbrain barrier passage of DT through PEGylation, which polarizes the molecule and increases its size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We validate BRAINSPAReDT with regional genetic sympathectomy: BRAINSPAReDT ablates peripheral but not central catecholaminergic neurons, thus avoiding the Parkinson-like phenotype associated with full dopaminergic depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regional sympathectomy compromises adipose tissue thermogenesis, and renders mice susceptible to obesity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide a proof of principle that BRAINSPAReDT can be used for Cre/DTR tissue-specific ablation outside the brain using CNS drivers, while consolidating the link between adiposity and the sympathetic nervous system.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Conditional expression of the diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) using the Cre/lox system is a widely used tool for tissue-specific ablation of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this tool is of limited utility for targeted genetic ablation of peripheral cells because diphtheria toxin (DT) crosses the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) and many peripheral Cre drivers have additional expression in the central nervous system (CNS), thus driving ablation in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ability of a molecule to cross the BBB depends on two critical molecular properties: polarity and size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small uncharged molecules tend to cross the BBB, whereas those that are large and/or polarized tend to have limited permeability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To limit DT action and prevent it from entering the brain, we chemically modified DT by PEGylation to develop a brain-sparing DT (BRAINSPAReDT).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This chemical modification increases the size and polarity of DT and spares DTR-expressing cells in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To validate this tool in vivo, we implemented a genetic method for regional sympathectomy using BRAINSPAReDT.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'General sympathectomy has been traditionally performed with systemic injection of chemicals such as guanethidine or 6-hydroxydopamine1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the chemical ablation, which is systemic, surgical sympathectomy is a localized intervention that affects the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) innervation of a confined anatomical region or organ2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, surgical sympathectomy damages nerves of unknown identity that are mixed within the SNS bundles5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, neither a surgical nor a chemical approach is amenable to specifically sympathectomize organs such as the adipose tissue, which covers a large body region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Thus, genetic ablation via expression of Cre-inducible DTR and diphtheria toxin injection would be a feasible strategy to achieve a regional sympathectomy and tissue specificity6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using a catecholaminergic Cre driver (TH-Cre), we conditionally express the DTR in the SNS and dopaminergic neurons in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these mice, BRAINSPAReDT successfully ablates peripheral catecholaminergic neurons, but not dopaminergic neurons in the brain, and thus avoids the Parkinson-like phenotype that is a consequence of dopaminergic depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that PEGylated DT (PEGyDT)-regionally sympathectomized mice have defective thermogenesis, which is a key mechanism of energy dissipation from brown and beige adipose tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, mice regionally sympathectomized with BRAINSPAReDT are prone to obesity, despite having normal eating behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results are consistent with the role of the SNS in lipolysis and thermogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that BRAINSPAReDT can generally be used for Cre/DTR ablation in the periphery, thus circumventing off-target cell ablation in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, BRAINSPAReDT may now be used for genetic loss of function of subsets of SNS neurons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This tool should enable systematic molecular study of the SNS as well as a plethora of peripheral neurons or cells that may be labelled by CNS markers.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'The conditional Cre; LSL-DTR system is widely used for tissue-specific loss of function and genetic ablation of cell lineages6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The use of this system is contingent on a tightly

also reflect cell lineage or biological function when the same gene is expressed in peripheral and central populations of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Brain expression in many peripheral Cre drivers is a recurrent problem that has been limiting the use of the Cre; LSL-DTR system for ablating peripheral tissues, due to off-target effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, TH is an enzyme in the

such, whole-body applications that require the systemic delivery of a toxin, like in the Cre; LSL-DTR system, have limited power because DT crosses the BBB.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To address this general problem, we developed a chemical genetic approach, named BRAINSPAReDT, in which we chemically modified DT by PEGylation (PEGyDT), so that it spares an action in DTR-expressing cells in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PEG is a non-toxic, non-immunogenic and non-antigenic biocompatible polymer that has been used as an excipient in many pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations8,9,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  PEGylation increases hydrodynamic radius, polarity and molecular weight21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Permeability across the BBB is contingent on polarity and molecular weight, favouring non-polar and smaller molecular weight molecules22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increased molecular weight and polarity is a known problem for CNS drug delivery, but a unique advantage for keeping DT away from the brain23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, as shown here, increasing the polarity and the molecular weight of DT by PEGylation is a feasible way to prevent DTs action in the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'PEGyDT had an average increase in molecular weight by 436 Da, but it was just as efficient as DT in mediating tissue-specific cell death, both in vitro and in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The latter was herein validated by analysing a Cre driver line, labelling populations of neuronal cells in the brain and in the periphery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We verified that genetic ablation of catecholaminergic neurons in the CNS led to a Parkinson-like phenotype, which is a major impairment for analysing the effect of regional SNS loss of function in a metabolic/obesity context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Parkinson-like mice have deteriorating health that leads to an emaciated state, which could be confused with healthy weight loss.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, PEGyDT-mediated genetic regional ablation of the SNS spared catecholaminergic neurons in the CNS, and created a suitable rodent model system with which to study SNS function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our previous studies only probed the local role of SNS fat innervation in mediating lipolysis locally, in a single fat pad5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we probed whether this effect generalizes to systemic levels such as to control whole-body adiposity and metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To achieve this, we performed a regional genetic loss of function of the SNS, that is, a regional genetic sympathectomy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sympathectomy procedures that have been used in the past included chemical ablation with guanethidine or 6-hydroxydopamine24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the experimental differences, we are able to draw parallels between classical studies and our findings, as follows: if not challenged by a HFD or cold, mice treated with BRAINSPAReDT present normal BW, and other metabolic parameters, which is consistent with results reported in classical studies involving chemical sympathectomy24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When challenged with a HFD, we then see an effect in obesity and thermogenesis that is similar to results previously reported27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it was also reported that mice chemically sympathectomized with guanethidine do not become obese after a human supermarket diet26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, another study disclosed that guanethidine treatment lead to pruritus, open sores and skin necrosis25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed that chemical sympathectomy caused malaise (data not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, chemical ablation with 6-hydroxydopamine is classically used as a parkinsonian agent, and thus ablates beyond the SNS, affecting dopaminergic neurons in the brain28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  BRAINSPAReDT does not cause any malaise or side effects, due to its tissue specificity and deficient access to the brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Studies using surgical techniques (ganglia removal or axotomy) reported findings similar to ours in several species (rats, rabbits, cats and hamsters).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several of these studies report localized fat accumulation and impaired fat mobilization2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taking the classical literature and our results into account, genetic ablation via BRAINSPAReDT, with expression of Cre-inducible DTR and PEGyDT injection, is an amenable way to combine tissue specificity for the SNS, and a regional action enabled by the Cre driver line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used a sympathetic Cre driver that has a mosaic pattern of expression, which preferentially marks SNS neurons innervating fat and avoids other organs such as heart and lungs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mosaicism of this TH-Cre driver mouse line may be due to insertional effects of the transgene, which alter the activity of the promoter in a tissue-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This restricted Cre expression within the SNS enabled regional sympathectomy with BRAINSPAReDT, rendering mice extremely vulnerable to metabolic challenge, while compromising several key elements in mechanism for energy dissipation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with the known role of NE in driving thermogenesis, mice sympathectomized with BRAINSPAReDT have deficient adaptive thermogenesis, which is accompanied by a downregulation of thermogenic genes and NE content in adipose tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, sympathectomy with BRAINSPAReDT rendered mice extremely prone to metabolic syndrome and obesity, as seen during a HFD challenge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mice regionally sympathectomized were glucose intolerant and did not normalize excess weight upon HFD withdrawal, as it would be expected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, increased weight plateaued upon HFD withdrawal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas we cannot exclude a role of the adrenals in the phenotype we see, leptin action does not depend on intact adrenal glands29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the persistence of adiposity in regionally sympathectomized mice, as well as the defective responses to leptin, is consistent with the known role of sympathetic neuro-adipose junctions in driving lipolysis and fat mass reduction5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of WAT mobilization in regionally sympathectomized mice is consistent with the lack of adaptive thermogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, under HFD, regionally sympathectomized mice have reduced nocturnal activity, which further reduces energy dissipation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence of regional SNS loss of function, mice appeared to have sustained obesity, even though eating behaviour was normal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Future studies will attempt to develop versions of DT that can ablate the innervation to specific organs or specific peripheral tissues/cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may be achieved by using Cre driver mice, where the expression is restricted to neurons innervating specific organs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'While consolidating the appetite-independent link between adiposity and the SNS, our results provide a proof of principle that BRAINSPAReDT can generally be used for Cre/DTR tissue-specific ablation outside the brain using CNS Cre drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, several subpopulations of immune cells express neurotransmitter or CNS receptors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the functional role of such neuro-like immune cells remains elusive30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this regard, BRAINSPAReDT can now be used for loss-of-function studies using CNS Cre drivers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, BRAINSPAReDT will promote the advancement of emerging fields of research such as neuroimmunology, which lay at the interface between neurobiology and physiology.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
