Three-dimensional structural dynamics and fluctuations of DNA-nanogold conjugates by individual-particle electron tomography  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'DNA base pairing has been used for many years to direct the arrangement of inorganic nanocrystals into small groupings and arrays with tailored optical and electrical properties.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The control of DNA-mediated assembly depends crucially on a better understanding of three-dimensional structure of DNA-nanocrystal-hybridized building blocks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Existing techniques do not allow for structural determination of these flexible and heterogeneous samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report cryo-electron microscopy and negative-staining electron tomography approaches to image, and three-dimensionally reconstruct a single DNA-nanogold conjugate, an 84-bp double-stranded DNA with two 5-nm nanogold particles for potential substrates in plasmon-coupling experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By individual-particle electron tomography reconstruction, we obtain 14 density maps at 2-nm resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these maps as constraints, we derive 14 conformations of dsDNA by molecular dynamics simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conformational variation is consistent with that from liquid solution, suggesting that individual-particle electron tomography could be an expected approach to study DNA-assembling and flexible protein structure and dynamics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Organicinorganic-hybridized nanocrystals are a valuable class of new materials that are suitable for addressing many emerging challenges in biological and material sciences1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanogold and quantum dot conjugates have been used extensively as biomolecular markers3,4, whereas DNA base pairing has directed the self-assembly of discrete groupings and arrays of organic and inorganic nanocrystals in the formation of a network solid for electronic devices and memory components5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Discretely hybridized gold nanoparticles conjugated to DNA were developed as a molecular ruler to detect sub-nanometre distance changes via plasmon-coupling-mediated variations in dark-field light scattering3,6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For many of these applications, it is desirable to obtain nanocrystals functionalized with discrete numbers of DNA strands7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all of these circumstances, the soft components can fluctuate, and the range of these structural deviations have not previously been determined with a degree of rigour that could help influence the future design and use of these assemblies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Conformational flexibility and dynamics of the DNA-nanogold conjugates limit the structural determination by X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and single-particle cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) reconstruction because they do not crystallize, are not sufficiently small for nuclear magnetic resonance studies and cannot be classified into a limited number of classes for single-particle EM reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, three-dimensional (3D) structure averaged from tens of thousands of different macromolecular particles obtained without prior knowledge of the macromolecular structural flexibility could result in an absence of flexible domains upon using the single-particle reconstruction method, for example, two ankyrin repeated regions of TRPV1 were absent in its atomic resolution 3D density map9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'A fundamental experimental solution to reveal the structure of a flexible macromolecule should be based on the determination of each individual macromolecules structure10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Electron tomography (ET) provides high-resolution images of a single object from a series of tilted viewing angles11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ET has been applied to reveal the 3D structure of a cell section and an individual bacterium at nanometre-scale resolution12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, reconstruction from an individual macromolecule at an intermediate resolution (13 nm) remains challenging due to small molecular weight and low image contrast.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although, the first 3D map of an individual macromolecule, a fatty acid synthetase molecule, was reconstructed from negative-staining (NS) ET by Hoppe et al.13, serious doubts have been raised regarding the validity of this structure14, as this molecule received a radiation dose hundreds of times greater than the reported damage threshold15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recently, we investigated the possibility based on simulated and real experimental NS and cryo-ET images10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We showed that a single-protein 3D structure at an intermediate resolution (13 nm) is potentially achieved using our proposed individual-particle ET (IPET) method10,16,17,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IPET, an iterative refinement process using automatically generated dynamic filters and soft masks, requires no pre-given initial model, class averaging or lattice, but can tolerate small tilt errors and large-scale image distortion via decreasing the reconstruction image size to reduce the negative effects on 3D reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IPET allows us to obtain a snapshot single-molecule 3D structure of flexible proteins at an intermediate resolution, and can be even used to reveal the macromolecular dynamics and fluctuation17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we use IPET, cryo-EM and our previously reported optimized NS (OpNS)19,20 techniques to investigate the morphology and 3D structure of hybridized DNA-nanogold conjugates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These conjugates were self-assembled from a mixture of two monoconjugates, each consisting of 84-bp single-stranded DNA and a 5-nm nanogold particle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dimers were separated by anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and agarose gel electrophoresis as potential substrates in plasmon-coupling experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By OpNS-ET imaging and IPET 3D reconstruction, we reconstruct a total of 14 density maps at a resolution of 2 nm from 14 individual double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-nanogold conjugates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using these maps as constraints, we derive 14 conformations of dsDNA by projecting a standard flexible dsDNA model onto the observed maps using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The variation of the conformations was largely consistent with that from liquid solution, and suggests that the IPET approach provides a most complete experimental determination of flexibility and fluctuation range of these directed nanocrystal assemblies to date.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The general features revealed by this experiment can be expected to occur in a broad range of DNA-assembled nanostructures and flexible proteins.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cryo-EM and NS images of DNA-nanogold conjugates', 'The sample of HPLC-purified 84-bp dsDNA (molecular mass= 52 kDa) and two 5-nm nanogold conjugates (Supplementary Fig 1) were examined by two methods, that is, cryo-EM (native buffer, vitreous ice, no staining) and OpNS19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cryo-EM, a method often used to prevent artefacts induced by fixatives and stains, can be used to study protein structures under near-native conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, small proteins ( less_than 100 kDa) are challenging to be visualized or 3D reconstructed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NS, a historical method, can be used for high-contrast imaging of small proteins through heavy metal salts coating the proteins surfaces20,21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, heavy metal reaction can also cause a potential artefact by conventional protocols, including rouleaux formation of lipoproteins19,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used cryo-EM as a control, investigated the parameters related to lipoprotein rouleaux artefact19 and reported an OpNS protocol19,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The OpNS protocol has been tested by structure-known proteins, including 53-kDa cholesteryl ester transfer protein23, GroEL and proteasomes20, and the flexible proteins with structure partially known, including immunoglobulin (Ig)-G1 antibody and its peptide conjugates16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The surrounding heavy metal atoms provide more electron scattering and radiation damage resistance than the protein light atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we used cryo-EM and OpNS methods to examine the same sample under -178 °C and room temperature, respectively, (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Cryo-EM and OpNS-EM images of dsDNA-nanogold conjugates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Cryo-EM images (vitreous buffer, no staining) of

NS images of the particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The polygonal-shaped nanogold particles were bridged by a fibre-shaped density, and their surfaces were coated with a layer of extraneous PEG for surface protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g) A few pairs of nanogold particles were significantly closer in distance to each other, whereas their bridging fabric-like densities were thicker (indicated by arrows), likely due to the supercoiling of the dsDNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bars=30 nm.Full size image', 'Survey cryo-EM and OpNS-EM micrographs (Fig 1a,e) showed that each pair of nanogold particles was near one another.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A statistical analysis of 1,032 nanogold particles from cryo-EM showed that the particles had a diameter of 63.5±6.7 Å (mean±s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and a peak population (25.1%) diameter of 63.6±1.0 Å (black solid line in Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This measurement is consistent with those from OpNS, that is, 606 nanogold particles from NS micrographs showed a diameter of 63.0±6.4 Å (mean±s.d.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and a peak population (25.5%) diameter of 62.8±1.0 Å (blue dashed line in Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To quantitatively identify whether the pairs of

with previous transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations of the same sample in liquid solution (that is, rx,x=0.934 and ry,y=0.943; ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The high PCC

cryo-EM nanogold particles yielded a length of 255.3±48.7 Å (mean±s.d., measured from the centre to centre of the nanogold particles) with a peak population (19.7%) distance of 286.4±10 Å (black solid

287.0±10 Å (blue dashed line in Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, both lengths were consistent with those measured from liquid solution by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), that is, 2830 nm (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  25) and a standard model of 84-bp dsDNA (2 nm wide and 30 nm long).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, several pairs of nanogold particles presented abnormally closer to one another in both cryo-EM and NS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher-contrast NS images showed that their fibre-shaped bridging densities appeared thicker, but had lengths ranging from 20 to 30 nm, thus seeming similar to those of the full-length dsDNA (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We suspected that these particles may be formed by two conjugates, in which each conjugate lost one nanogold, but met and formed a supercoil via their two dsDNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the mass is only 52 kDa above that of the regular conjugates, these particles are too small to be identified or isolated by our filtration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#

reconstruction method or sub-volume averaging method because these conjugates were not guaranteed to share the same structure (DNA is naturally flexible and dynamic in structure).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IPET

conjugates by IPET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) The OpNS samples of DNA-nanogold conjugates were imaged using ET from a series of tilt angles (from 60° to +60° at 1.5° intervals).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three targeted particles (yellow circled) with their orthogonal views are indicated by the linked dashed arrows in the three selected ET tilt micrographs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative tilt angles are indicated in each image, and the axis of the tilt is vertical to the images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Nine representative tilt images of the first targeted individual particle are displayed in the first column from the left (SNR of DNA portion: 0.31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using IPET, the tilt images (after CTF correction) were gradually aligned to a common centre for 3D reconstruction via an iterative

images could be barely visible under a dose of 20e Å2, beyond this dose limitation, the contrasts rapidly disappeared, which prevents us from a full ET data acquisition (80 micrographs) and further 3D reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we used OpNS-EM for 3D reconstruction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the nanogold portion of ET images (from 60° to +60° at 1.5° increments) were only 0.19 to 0.41 with an average of 0.31, the overall shape of dsDNA was still visible (Fig 2b and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After contrast transfer function (CTF) correction, the tilt images were iteratively aligned to a global centre before achieving a final ab initio 3D reconstruction (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  During the iterations, SNR of the dsDNA portion

are provided in the Methods section; black line in Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To avoid the potential overestimation of resolution by nanogolds instead of correctly reflecting the resolution of the dsDNA, we masked out the dsDNA portion only to repeat the FSC analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The FSC curve was nearly identical to that for nanogolds (red versus black lines in Fig 2e), suggesting that the resolution is not overestimated by nanogolds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The nanogold particle surface appeared with a layer of densities, which is possibly thiolated short-chain polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules used to stabilize the particles against aggregation at high ionic strength (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the nanogold particles were in opposite image contrast to the dsDNA, we reversed the image contrast of the final 3D (coloured in gold) and overlaid it with original 3D to display both the dsDNA and nanogold particles in a same 3D map (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This overlaid map showed the nanogold particles with diameters of 73.0 and 72.0 Å bridged by a high-density fabric with dimensions of 242.0 Å × 18.0 Å × 18.0 Å (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nanogold

dsDNA, the overall shape could be used as a constraint to flexibly dock a standard structure of an 84-bp dsDNA into it to achieve a dsDNA conformation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By satisfying both the best fit to the density map and the chemical minimal energy requirements, we obtained a dsDNA conformation via gently bending the straight dsDNA structure into the density map using the CHARMM force field for

of bending angles, that is, i and i, which could cause a 50% difference on the computed bending energy from the experimental DNA conformations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the EM observed DNA is more flexible than predicted, it is worthy to evaluate whether other factors may also influence the measurement of the DNA length and bending energy, such as the fluctuation of distal ends, DNA modelling methods, noise bias in the EM density map, initial model bias and temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional analyses were performed as the following: (i) the bending energy based on the central 42 bp was recalculated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was because 84-bp DNA is relatively short and the ends of the chain exhibit greater fluctuations than the middle portion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results obtained from the calculation showed that the bending energy is 15% less than when using all 84 bp (Supplementary Table 2), suggesting that DNA is still more flexible than the WLC prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ii) The initial model of DNA was obtained by manually fitting a standard DNA model to each EM configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that the manual operation may lead to kinks, which are difficult to be repaired by MD simulation, we used another method to generate a smooth curved model of DNA whose structure was as close as possible to the canonical B-form DNA double helix (details are in Methods section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before conducting any simulation, we calculated its bending energy, which is only 10% of the above bending energy, and only 20% of the WLC prediction, suggesting that the smooth DNA is more stiff than the WLC prediction, and EM configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iii) After submitting this smooth model for energy minimization using the nanoscale molecular dynamics version 2 (NAMD2) software package30, we found that the bending energy was increased 45 times, thus nearly approaching the WLC prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (iv) However, after submitting the model to further MD simulations for only 0.1 ns, the calculated energy jumped up to 80% of the energy from the EM configuration, thereby confirming that the DNA is more flexible than the WLC prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result suggests that the MD simulations may be the key role to increase the bending energy and result in a more flexible DNA model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (v) To evaluate how the noise in the density map may influence the bending energy, we conducted MD flexible fitting (MDFF) based on the smooth model to constrain its structure with the EM density map.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The calculated bending energy immediately jumped up to an even higher level, that is, 10% more than that from the EM configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This test suggests that the MDFF and noise in the EM density could be critical in causing the DNA model to be more flexible than it should be.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (vi) To avoid a potential influence to the energy from the given initial models, a standard and straight model of DNA was used for MD simulations under the same condition, that is, under 0.15 M physiological salt solution, temperature of 298 K and a pressure of 1 atm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using NAMD2 for 20 ns of simulation without any constraint for DNA conformational changes, the equilibration of DNA in a box of 347.3 Å × 93.4 Å × 50.8 Å was monitored using the root mean square deviation by visual MD (VMD)31 (Supplementary Fig 14a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bending energies (Supplementary Fig 14b) and the distances between the two distal ends (Supplementary Fig 14c) revealed that the system became nearly balanced after 8 ns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical analyses of the bending energies of the DNA in its last 10-ns simulations showed that the average energy was 99.1±10.9 kcal mol1 with a peak population (7.1%) energy of 97.4±1.0 kcal mol1 based on the bending angles of the i calculation, whereas the average energy was 152.1±16.1 kcal mol1 with a peak population (4.6%) energy of 151.3±1.0 kcal mol1 based on the bending angles of the i calculation (Supplementary Fig 14b,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This energy is surprisingly similar to that of the EM configuration (1015% lower) (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical analyses of the length between the two distal ends of equilibrated DNA in the last 10 ns of the simulations showed that the average length was 268.5±2.1 Å with a peak population (18.5%) length of 267.9±0.5 Å (Supplementary Fig 14c,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distance is similar to the length at the peak population measured from TEM images.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (vii) To evaluate how temperature influences the bending energy measurement using MD simulations, the above processes were repeated under a higher temperature, that is, 310 K instead of 298 K (Supplementary Fig 15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bending energies calculated under the higher temperature in the last 10 ns showed that the average energy was 120.8±14.7 kcal mol1 with a peak population (6.1%) energy of 115.1±1.0 kcal mol1 based on the bending angles of the i calculation, whereas the average energy was 177.9±15.6 kcal mol1 with a peak population (5.1%) energy of 177.5±1.0 kcal mol1 based on the bending angles of the i calculation (Supplementary Fig 15b,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy is increased by 20% from those under 298 K and becomes more similar to that of the EM configuration, suggesting that the temperature is related, but not critical.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The statistical analyses on the length showed that the averaged length was 269.5±2.9 Å with a peak population (13.3%) length of 271.1±0.5 Å (Supplementary Fig 15c,e), which is similar to those measured from the EM configurations and 298 K MD simulation, suggesting that the length is insensitive to the temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (viii) To further confirm that the length is insensitive to bending energy, one EM configuration with the DNA length of 241.0 Å was performed by MD simulations under a length constrain (Supplementary Fig 16).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This length is close to the mean length of the DNA portion estimated from solution using SAXS25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bending energy in the last 10 ns was 105.8±10.7 kcal mol1 with a peak population (7.3%) energy of 102.7±1.0 kcal mol1 based on the bending angles of the i calculation, whereas the average energy was 163.6±17.4 kcal mol1 with a peak population (5.0%) energy of 158.4±1.0 kcal mol1 based on the bending angles of the i calculation (Supplementary Fig 16b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This energy is similar to that of the other EM configurations and simulations, suggesting that the length cannot reflect the bending energy and flexibility of DNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Above tests showed, although EM density maps contain noise, that the bending energy can be influenced limitedly by the initial models and the EM map configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The similar bending energies calculated from different MD simulations and initial models suggested that the DNA is more flexible than WLC prediction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we cannot exclude those MD simulations that may result in DNA, which presents more flexibility than WLC prediction.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Although the direct imaging of dsDNA has been previously reported using heavy metal shadowing32,33 and NS methods34,35,36, to the best of our knowledge, the 3D structure of an individual dsDNA strand has not previously been achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been thought that individual dsDNA would be destroyed under the high energy of the electron beam before a 3D reconstruction, or even a 2D image, is able to be achieved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our NS tilt images showing fibre-shaped dsDNA bridging two conjugated nanogold particles demonstrated that the dsDNA can in fact be directly visualized using EM, which is consistent with the recently reported single-molecule DNA sequencing technique via TEM36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resolutions of our density maps ranged from 14 to 23 Å, demonstrating that an intermediate-resolution 3D structure can be obtained for each individual macromolecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This capability is consistent with our earlier report of a 20-Å resolution 3D reconstruction of an individual IgG1 antibody using the same approach16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Notably, a total dose of 2,000e Å2 used in our ET data acquisition is significantly above the limitation conventionally used in cryo-EM (80100e Å2), which can be suspected to have certain artefact from radiation damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In cryo-EM, the radiation damage could cause sample bubbling, deformation and knockout effects; in NS, only the knockout phenomena is often observed, in which the protein is surrounded by heavy atoms that were kicked out by electron beam.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the sample was coated with heavy metal atoms and were dried in air, the bubbling and deformation phenomena were not usually observed.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The heavy metal atoms that coat the surface of the biomolecule can provide a much higher electron scattering than from a biomolecule only inside lighter atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scattering is sufficiently high to provide enough image contrast at our 120-kV high tension; thus, a further increase to the scattering ability by reducing the high tension to 80 kV may not be necessary for this NS sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the heavy atoms can provide more radiation resistance and allow the sample to be imaged under a higher dose condition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The exact dose limitation for NS is still unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The radiation damage related artefact in NS samples is knockout, which could reduce the image contrast and lower the tilt image alignment accuracy and 3D reconstruction resolution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our study, a total dose of 2,000e Å2 did not cause any obvious knockout phenomena, but provides a sufficiently high contrast for the otherwise barely visible DNA conformations in each tilt series.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The direct confirmation of visible DNA in each tilt image is essentially important to us to validate each 3D reconstruction, especially considering this relatively new approach.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our 3D reconstruction algorithm used an ab initio real-space reference-projection match iterative algorithm to correct the centres of each tilt images, in which the equal tilt angle step for 3D reconstruction of a low contrast and asymmetric macromolecule was used.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This method is different from recently reported Fourier-based iterative algorithm, termed equally sloped tomography, in which the pseudo-polar fast Fourier transform, the oversampling method and internal lattice of a targeted nanoparticle are used to achieve 3D reconstruction at atomic resolution37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is generally challenging to achieve visualization and 3D reconstruction on an individual, small and asymmetric macromolecule by other conventional methods; our method demonstrated its capability for 3D reconstruction of 52 kDa 84-bp dsDNA through these studies: IgG1 antibody 3D structural fluctuation17, peptide-induced conformational changes on flexible IgG1 antibody5, floppy liposome surface binding with 53-kDa proteins38, all of which suggest that this method could be used to serve the community as a novel tool for studying flexible macromolecular structures, dynamics and fluctuations of proteins, and for catching the intermediate 3D structure of protein assembling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'DNA-based self-assembling materials have been developed for use in materials science and biomedical research, such as DNA origami designed for targeted drug delivery.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structure, design and control require feedback from the 3D structure, which could validate the design hypothesis, optimize the synthesis protocol and improve the reproducible capability, while even providing insight into the mechanism of DNA-mediated assembly.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
