Genome-wide identification of splicing QTLs in the human brain and their enrichment among schizophrenia-associated loci  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Detailed analyses of transcriptome have revealed complexity in regulation of alternative splicing (AS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These AS events often undergo modulation by genetic variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we analyse RNA-sequencing data of prefrontal cortex from 206 individuals in combination with their genotypes and identify cis-acting splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) throughout the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These sQTLs are enriched among exonic and H3K4me3-marked regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we observe significant enrichment of sQTLs among disease-associated loci identified by GWAS, especially in schizophrenia risk loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Closer examination of each schizophrenia-associated loci revealed four regions (each encompasses NEK4, FXR1, SNAP91 or APOPT1), where the index SNP in GWAS is in strong linkage disequilibrium with sQTL SNP(s), suggesting dysregulation of AS as the underlying mechanism of the association signal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study provides an informative resource of sQTL SNPs in the human brain, which can facilitate understanding of the genetic architecture of complex brain disorders such as schizophrenia.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Alternative splicing (AS) is the process by which different splice sites in precursor messenger RNA are selected to generate multiple mRNA isoforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AS events are often regulated in a cell type-, condition- or species-specific manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, recent studies have demonstrated that complexity of AS regulation is highest in primates1, and that there is a distinct and more complex pattern of AS in brain tissues2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such highly intricate regulation of AS in the human brain can play an important role in normal function and development of the central nervous system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, a number of genetic mutations that affect global regulation of AS or alter AS of a specific gene are known to be associated with various brain disorders4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, it was reported that a subset of de novo germline mutations, whose important roles in the genetic aetiology of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia has been established6,7,8,9,10, probably contribute to the risk of ASD and schizophrenia by affecting AS11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, dysregulation of AS is reported in multiple postmortem brain studies of ASD12,13 and schizophrenia14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As represented by canonical splice site variants disrupting exonintron boundaries, regulation of AS can be controlled by genetic variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Not only variants directly changing splice site sequences, it has been demonstrated that genetic variants controlling AS events, referred to as splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs), spread throughout the genome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, recent large-scale studies utilizing the data of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have successfully identified sQTLs in a genome-wide manner3,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, these studies are primarily focusing on non-neuronal tissues and thereby sQTLs in the human brain have not yet been well characterized.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although a previous microarray-based study has identified exon-specific QTLs in brain tissues, detectable AS events depend on array design and also are restricted to exon skipping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, a study utilizing RNA-seq data has a particular advantage in identifying more AS events17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To comprehensively detect sQTLs in the human brain, here we analyse RNA-seq data of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissues from  greater than 200 individuals in combination with their microarray-based genotype data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After applying stringent filtering criteria, we identify a total of 1,500 sQTL single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are likely to be independent of each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analysing characteristics of these brain sQTL SNPs, we describe functional properties of these variants and their potential roles in the genetic aetiology of human diseases, particularly in brain disorders such as schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also show an example how the information of sQTLs can be utilized to better understand the complex genetic architecture of human diseases and to specify promising candidates for culprit genes using the data of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) for schizophrenia18.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Identification of cis-acting splicing QTLs in human brain', 'We first analysed RNA-seq data of DLPFC samples (all from Brodmann area 9) from genetically homogenous 206 individuals (Supplementary Fig 1, extracted by using the result of multidimensional scaling) without neuropsychiatric diseases or neurological insults immediately prior to death (downloaded from the CommonMind Consortium Knowledge Portal, summary statistics are available in Supplementary Table 1, see also Methods) to comprehensively identify AS events in the human brain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose we used vast-tools13, a software package designed to identify various types of AS events, including alternative exon skipping (Alt EX), alternative usage of splice sites (Alt SS) and intron retentions (IRs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After applying quality control filters (see Methods for details), we identified a total of 102,469 AS events in autosomes, consisting of 29,271 Alt EX, 3,310 Alt SS (of which 1,265 were at the 5-donor site and 2,045 were at the 3-acceptor site) and 69,888 IRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next analysed this list of AS in combination with quality-controlled SNP genotyping data of the same individuals using Matrix eQTL19 to identify cis-acting (within ±100 kb of the AS event) sQTLs in a genome-wide manner (see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To conservatively define sQTL SNPs, we first applied a standard correction for multiple testing implemented in Matrix eQTL (BenjaminiHochberg procedure) to the P-values for all SNPAS pairs and then the corrected P-values were further subjected to Bonferroni correction with the number of AS events within the ±100 kb window for each SNP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because a SNP with many AS events in the surrounding region should have a higher chance to show significant association (see Methods for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After performing these procedures, we identified a total of 8,966 sQTL SNPs with the double-corrected P-value  less_than 0.05.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The full list of sQTL SNPs along with information of the associated AS events is available in Supplementary Data 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with previous studies of non-neuronal tissues3,16, when we plotted the double-corrected P-value and the distance to the nearest AS event for each SNP, we observed that variants at the proximity of AS are enriched for sQTL SNPs (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Characterization of identified sQTL SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Each blue dot indicates a SNP plotted according to its distance to the nearest AS event and

analysis of these 1,341 genes using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery20, we found highly significant enrichment of SP_PIR_KEYWORDS: alternative splicing (Benjamini-corrected P=8.6 × 1029) and UP_SEQ_FEATURE: splice variants (Benjamini-corrected P=1.1 × 1028), which denote genes with known splicing isoforms (Supplementary Data 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, on the one hand, our result is compatible with the existing knowledge of genes undergo AS and, on the other hand, the list of genes regulated by sQTL SNPs identified here provides new candidates for genes with splicing isoforms, because  greater than 40% of the input genes were not included in SP_PIR_KEYWORDS: alternative splicing or UP_SEQ_FEATURE: splice variants (Supplementary Data 2) but in fact have detectable alternatively spliced regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Functional characterization of sQTL SNPs', 'We consequently attempted to functionally characterize sQTL SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this purpose, we first extracted the best sQTL SNP for each AS event (N=1,595) and then performed linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based pruning (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After performing this procedure, there was a set of 1,539 sQTL SNPs that are likely to be independent of each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we performed LD-based pruning on SNPs with an uncorrected P-value greater than 0.05 (N=170,241) with the same parameters applied to sQTL SNPs, leaving 89,367 SNPs that are unlikely to be associated with AS (we considered these as non-sQTL SNPs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From this list of non-sQTL SNPs, we generated a set of 48,068 SNPs with the distribution of minor allele frequency (MAF) matched to the set of 1,539 sQTL SNPs and used them for comparison (see Supplementary Fig 2 and Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By functionally classifying the SNPs according to the definition in SnpEff21, we found that sQTL SNPs are significantly enriched among variants in exonic regions (that is, nonsense, readthrough, start-loss, frameshift, canonical splice site, missense, synonymous, splice region, 5-untranslated region (UTR), 3-UTR and non-coding exon variants; shown in warm colours in Fig 1b) when compared with non-sQTL SNPs (P=8.6 × 1087, odds ratio (OR)=3.84, two-tailed Fishers exact test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By analysing enrichment of sQTL SNPs among each functional type of variants, as expected, we found significant enrichment with the highest OR among canonical splice site variants (P=0.012, OR=10.4, two-tailed Fishers exact test with Bonferroni correction), followed by 5-UTR and synonymous variants (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there was significant underrepresentation of sQTL SNPs among intergenic variants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By manually inspecting all individual sQTL SNPs at the canonical splice sites (N=9, from the full list of 8,966 SNPs before pruning), we found that 8 out of the 9 SNPs are associated with AS of the adjacent exon.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The remaining one sQTL SNP (rs8873 at chr11: 58,378,424 in ZFP91) is at a splice site that is found in the RefSeq Genes track but not in the Ensembl Gene Predictions track of the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/) (Supplementary Fig 3) and transcripts spliced at this position (chr11: 58,378,426) were not detected in our analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the eight sQTL SNPs associated with AS of the adjacent exon, three variants are contributing to known (annotated by Ensembl Gene Predictions) AS events (Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of rs2276611 at chr2: 170,441,001 in PPIG, alternative splice sites are almost exclusively used depending on the alleles (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Around rs3803354 at chr15: 40,856,989 in C15orf57, there are three different splice sites (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the major isoform is spliced at chr15: 40,857,175 (blue arrow head in Fig 2b), proportion of the isoform spliced at chr15: 40,856,990 (red arrow head) increases in C allele carriers in an additive manner and also there is a minor isoform (average percent-spliced-in (PSI) less_than 1) spliced at chr15: 40,856,965 (green arrow head).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of rs80113248 at chr20: 18,142,462 in CSRP2BP, both the two splice sites 3 bp distant to each other (chr20: 18,142,464 and 18,142,467) are used in A allele carriers, whereas in G/G carriers the transcripts are exclusively spliced at chr20: 18,142,467 (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the other five canonical splice site sQTL SNPs at the proximity of associated AS, we also found that disruption of canonical splice site by the variant allele causes increased proportion of exon skipping or IR (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the number of canonical splice site variants analysed in this study is small, identification of these positive control variants regulating AS in an expected way could support the validity of our analyses.

regulatory annotations; DNase I hypersensitive sites, monomethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1), trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3), acetylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac), acetylated

data of nine individual diseases with the largest numbers of genome-wide significantly associated SNPs in the Catalog (breast cancer, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, prostate cancer, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes), as well as four additional brain disorders (autism, Alzheimers disease, bipolar disorder and Parkinsons disease)

include autism, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis, whereas enrichment among autism-associated loci was not statistically significant (Fig 4a, analyses excluding MHC variants).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among these diseases, most statistically significant enrichment was observed for schizophrenia-associated loci (P=9.9 × 105 after performing Bonferroni correction).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We next focused on this observation and performed several confirmatory analyses to test the credibility of this result.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we repeated the analysis using the data of well-defined 108 schizophrenia-associated loci described in the largest GWAS to date conducted by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium18 (PGC GWAS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was because some of the SNPs identified by PGC GWAS were not included in the GWAS Catalog and the associated loci were defined in a more sophisticated way in PGC GWAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this data set, we confirmed that there was significant enrichment of sQTL SNPs among the risk loci (Fig 4b, P=1.1 × 107, OR=4.01, one-tailed Fishers exact test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, to test whether the enrichment is driven by higher proportion of exonic variants among sQTL SNPs (these variants would be more likely to be functional and thereby associated with schizophrenia regardless of their impacts on AS), we performed an analysis using the data of SNPs in non-exonic (that is, intronic and intergenic) regions (N of SNPs=1,139).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that non-exonic sQTL SNPs are significantly enriched among schizophrenia-associated loci when compared with non-sQTL SNPs in non-exonic regions (Fig 4c, P=0.0030, OR=2.66, one-tailed Fishers exact test).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, there was no statistically significant enrichment of exonic sQTL SNPs among schizophrenia risk loci when compared with exonic non-sQTL SNPs (Fig 4c, P=0.36, OR=1.26), suggesting that non-exonic sQTL SNPs are particularly contributing to schizophrenia risk by their impacts on splicing regulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, we performed an analysis excluding sQTL SNPs associated with IR (N of excluded SNPs=398).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was because often detection of IR is more challenging than Alt EX and Alt SS, and the RNA-seq data set used in this study derives from libraries prepared by ribosomal RNA depletion (not poly-A selection; thus, premature RNA containing intronic regions can be to some extent included in the libraries).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that sQTL SNPs associated with Alt EX or Alt SS are significantly enriched

LD with the index SNP rs12887734 (P for schizophrenia association=2.3 × 1012) at r2=0.86 (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of these SNPs suggests dysregulation of AS at these loci as plausible

that sQTL SNPs are enriched among variants within H3K4me3 marks (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is accumulating evidence that this histone mark is not only associated with transcriptional activation, but also plays a role in AS27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This process can be mediated by physical binding of spliceosome to H3K4me3 via a chromo-helicase protein CHD1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  27), whose binding sites were enriched for sQTLs (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is also known that various epigenetic marks including H3K4me3 can be locally influenced by genetic variants29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, some of the SNPs in H3K4me3 would alter epigenetic status and thereby act as sQTL SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This possible scenario can be related to enrichment of sQTL SNPs among 5-UTR variants, which showed the second highest OR in our analysis of various functional types of SNPs (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is because H3K4me3 marks are enriched in the 5end of gene bodies often including 5-UTRs30, besides well-known enrichment at promoter regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It would be also of note that AS of histone-modifying genes such as KDM1A and EHMT2 themselves are known to play a role in global epigenetic regulation and neuronal differentiation31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it would be worthwhile to take this AS-chromatin feedback loop into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the analysis of binding sites for individual TF, we found the most significant enrichment of sQTL SNPs among variants within binding sites for POLR2A (this protein encoding the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II is included in the list of TF in ENCODE) (Fig 3b), which is known to be involved in AS regulation32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strong enrichment was also observed for binding sites for various chromatin regulators such as PHF8, SIN3A and CHD1 (Fig 3b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As partly discussed above, this observation is in concordance with their roles in regulation of AS27,28,34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Gene-set enrichment analysis of genes regulated by sQTL SNPs found enrichment of genes with known splicing isoforms, whereas it does not mean that all tested genes are involved in regulation by AS nor that all genes in the splicing term could be determined by our analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the enrichment analysis of sQTL SNPs using the data of GWAS, we observed significant overrepresentation of these variants among loci associated with various human diseases, indicating roles of SNPs regulating AS in genetic disease aetiologies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is in agreement with the growing evidence that the majority of SNPs identified in GWAS contribute to the disease risks through their impact on gene regulatory functions36,37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifically, we found that sQTL SNPs identified in this study using the data of human brains are strongly enriched among schizophrenia-associated loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Besides SNPs controlling gene-level expression (eQTL) or DNA methylation (mQTL or meQTL), whose contribution to the schizophrenia risk has been demonstrated in recent studies38,39,40, our results indicate that sQTL SNPs, which are in most cases not overlap with gene-level eQTLs41,42, can explain an additional part of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'By utilizing the list of sQTL SNPs, we could specify four promising candidate disease susceptibility genes for schizophrenia (that is, NEK4, FXR1, SNAP91 and APOPT1), whose AS are regulated by sQTL SNPs in strong LD with the index SNPs identified in the PGC GWAS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NEK4 encodes a member of never-in-mitosis A kinase that regulates cell cycle and response to double-stranded DNA damage43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is of note that this gene is most highly expressed in the brain among multiple adult human tissues44 and plays a key role in stabilization of neuronal cilia44, whose contribution to various neural functions including nervous system development and adult neurogenesis45, as well as possible involvement in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia46,47, have been reported.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  FXR1 encodes a homologue of fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP) that is responsible for fragile X syndrome and the encoded protein (fragile X mental retardation syndrome-related protein 1) is known to interact with FMRP48,49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent large-scale genetic studies have consistently indicated involvement of FMRP targets in the genetic architectures of schizophrenia9,50 and ASD10,51, indicating this gene as a particularly good candidate disease-associated gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SNAP91 encodes the clathrin-associated protein AP180.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AP180 is enriched in the presynaptic terminal of neurons52 and play an essential role in synaptic neurotransmission53,54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AP180 KO mice show excitatory/inhibitory imbalance53, which has been reported in patients and animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  APOPT1 encodes a mitochondrial protein that induces apoptotic cell death56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Causal contribution of this gene in cavitating leukoencephalopathy57, a rare brain disorder, as well as accumulating evidence, suggesting involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders58,59, imply a potential role of APOPT1 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Considering several limitations of this study, first, although the sample size in this study is substantial (N=206), it would not be sufficient to confidently identify all brain sQTL SNPs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, in this study we could only analyse the data of adult brain tissues from the single brain region (DLPFC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analyses of sQTLs using large-scale data sets with higher spatial and temporal resolutions will provide a further informative data resource, especially in the context of identification of genes and variants associated with a disease attributable to deficits in the specific brain region(s) and/or at the particular time period(s).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Third, in this study we only show statistically significant association between SNP and AS, and have not experimentally validated impact of sQTL SNPs on AS, whereas often it is very difficult to determine whether an sQTL SNP associated with AS directly regulates splicing or just tags a functional variant, which is not investigated here (such as a rare splice region variant).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, we in this study comprehensively identified SNPs regulating AS events in the human brain, described the characteristics of these sQTL SNPs and demonstrated that the list of brain sQTL SNPs can be used to identify plausible candidate genes/variants causally associated with schizophreni and will also be useful to generate animal models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results provide a new insight into the genetic architecture of schizophrenia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By integrating various data resources (for example, sQTLs, eQTLs, mQTLs and more), we will obtain a more detailed picture of the genomic landscape of complex brain disorders.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
