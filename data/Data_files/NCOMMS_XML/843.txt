Molecular determinant of the effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein folding stability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Hydrostatic pressure is an important environmental variable that plays an essential role in biological adaptation for many extremophilic organisms (for example, piezophiles).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increase in hydrostatic pressure, much like increase in temperature, perturbs the thermodynamic equilibrium between native and unfolded states of proteins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimentally, it has been observed that increase in hydrostatic pressure can both increase and decrease protein stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that volume changes upon protein unfolding can be both positive and negative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The molecular details of this difference in sign of volume changes have been puzzling the field for the past 50 years.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we present a comprehensive thermodynamic model that provides in-depth analysis of the contribution of various molecular determinants to the volume changes upon protein unfolding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparison with experimental data shows that the model allows quantitative predictions of volume changes upon protein unfolding, thus paving the way to proteome-wide computational comparison of proteins from different extremophilic organisms.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Many extremophilic organisms, the so-called barophiles, evolved to live under high hydrostatic pressure1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These organisms generally populate the deep ocean floor where hydrostatic pressure can reach 1,100 atm3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Evolving to live under high hydrostatic pressure is not exclusive to single cell organisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the segmented microscopic animal tardigrade (water bear) can tolerate in their dormant state pressures up to 6,000 atm5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pompeii worms (Alvinella pompejana) are species of polychaete worms that live at high pressures and temperatures near hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bacterial species have been isolated from 1,351 m into the Earths crust where temperatures reach 102 °C and pressure is estimated to be in excess of 3,000 atm7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also reports of prokaryotic organisms at the bottom of oil well sediments and deep in the Arctic ice9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'What are the potential physicochemical implications for adaptation to high hydrostatic pressure?  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biomacromolecules (proteins, DNA, RNA, lipid membrane) adopt unique three-dimensional structures (native or folded state) that are required for their biological function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stability of these structures is very important for their function and thus biomacromolecules need to evolve to remain folded under the respective living conditions4,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increasing pressure, much like increasing temperature, perturbs the thermodynamic equilibrium between native folded state, N, and denatured unfolded state, U.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '', 'The response of the system to changes in pressure or temperature is governed by Le Chateliers principle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Le Chateliers principle is the tendency of a system to return to equilibrium by moving in the direction opposite to that caused by external perturbation13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a two-state equilibrium between N and U states, the temperature response is described by a well-known vant Hoff equation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', '', 'where H=HUHN is the enthalpy change upon unfolding, K is the equilibrium constant and R is the universal gas constant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For a two-state equilibrium between N and U states, the pressure response is defined by a sign of the volume change upon unfolding, VTot,', '', 'Combining equations (2) and (3) allows deriving the pressuretemperature phase diagram for protein stability14:', '', 'where H, S and VTot are the unfolding enthalpy, entropy and volume changes at a reference temperature, To, and reference pressure, Po, Cp is the heat capacity change of unfolding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reference temperature, To, and pressure, Po, according to the biochemical convention are usually chosen to be 300 K and 0.1 MPa (=1 atm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in compressibility upon unfolding, , defined as =(V/P)T is very small and often ignored15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The change in thermal expansivity upon unfolding, , defined as =(V/T)P is known to be positive16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, VTot is the key parameter in defining the effect of hydrostatic pressure on protein stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  According to Le Chateliers principle, if VTot=VTot,UVTot,N less_than 0, the increase in pressure will shift the equilibrium from N to U, that is, will lead to a decrease in stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, if VTot=VTot,UVTot,N  greater than 0, the increase in pressure will shift the equilibrium from U to N, that is, will lead to an increase in stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we will limit our discussion to only one type of biopolymersproteinsbut some of the issues can be pertinent to nucleic acids and to a lesser degree biological membranes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental studies of the effects of hydrostatic pressure on protein stability have shown that most proteins unfold with an increase in pressure (negative VTot), although some are actually stabilized (positive VTot).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The volume changes estimated from these experiments and also from direct measurements using pressure perturbation calorimetry are very small and range from 4% to +0.5%, relative to the total volume of the protein, that is, VTot/VTot,N16,17,18,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such small in amplitude and variable in sign changes in VTot have been puzzling the field for the past 50 years20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the first high-resolution structures of proteins have been solved, it has become evident that the native state of proteins contains a large number of voids (space inside protein that is not occupied by protein atoms) and cavities (voids large enough to accommodate a water molecule but may or may not be occupied by water)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that the volume fraction of the native protein that is occupied by voids ranges between 20 and 30%23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of voids in the native state qualitatively explains the higher volume of the native state relative to the unfolded state.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the magnitude of the negative volume changes due to the voids is much larger than the total negative volume changes observed experimentally and, moreover, cannot explain the experimentally observed positive volume changes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This led to a suggestion that possibly the volume changes due to the hydration of atoms inaccessible to the solvent in the native state and becoming exposed upon unfolding might lead to the positive contribution that offsets the negative void volume changes26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the transfer of model compounds from non-polar solvent into aqueous solution was also shown to be accompanied by negative volume changes27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This discrepancy between experimental volume changes and volume changes expected from protein structure and transfer studies has been termed the Protein Volume Paradox27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We performed detailed analysis of the two major assumptions ((1) all voids in the native state contribute to the total volume change upon unfolding and (2) hydration leads to a decrease in volume) that led to the formulation of this apparent paradox and showed that they are both oversimplified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the volume changes upon protein unfolding can be calculated by explicitly modelling the volumes of the unfolded state ensemble and using a proper thermodynamic transfer model to account for the volume changes upon hydration.'

described by the properties of the ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This allows the determination of not only the average property, but also the width of the distribution of volumes as reported by the s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering that molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a well-established method to provide information about protein conformational fluctuations, we have used this method to model the fluctuations of native proteins29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a test case for all calculations we have selected a non-redundant set of over 200 proteins of different size for which structures were solved with ultra-high (0.731.2 Å) resolution (see Supplementary Table 1 for the information on Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures used).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each protein, all-atom explicit solvent MD simulation was run starting from the X-ray coordinates as provided in the PDB file (see Methods for experimental details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The criterion for equilibration was the stable values of all-atom RMSD

it is necessary to explicitly model the unfolded state ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Experimental characterization of the structural properties of the unfolded state remains very challenging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Available indirect data suggest that the unfolded state can contain residual helical structure, hydrophobic clusters and native-like contacts31,32,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies showed that the dimensions of the unfolded state ensemble have properties characteristic of a random coil polymer or even statistical coil34,35,36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The random and/or statistical coil representation of the unfolded state can, arguably, be considered the most extended conformational ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There are a number of ways to generate unfolded state ensembles35,36,37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is well known that all-atom explicit solvent MD simulations produce overly compact or even highly helical structural ensembles that has been attributed to the artefacts of the current force-fields40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The empirical models or polymer-based models are free from such artefacts39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, the unfolded state ensembles, even those that differ by over 50% in the radius of gyration (Rg), have very similar volumes (see Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This includes unfolded ensembles that incorporated significant fraction of helical structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This underlines the fact noted by Fitzkee and Rose35 that Rg is a very coarse property to describe the unfolded state ensemble and is not a sufficient criterion to assess the lack of or presence of, for example, secondary structure in the unfolded state ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This also suggests that the use of any of these ensembles will produce qualitatively similar volumetric results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these initial observations and on the fact that three computational models, statistical coil model of the unfolded state (SC)36, trajectory directed ensemble sampling (TraDES)37 and flexible-meccano (FM)38, have been benchmarked against NMR-derived parameters such as chemical shifts and J-coupling constant36,41,42, we generated 1,000 unfolded conformations for each protein in our data set (see Supplementary Table 1 for the list of proteins).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, all ensembles show a lack of specific long-range contacts or secondary structure (see Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, Rg compares well with the experimentally determined power-law dependence of Rg on protein size (that is, number of amino acid residues, see Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SC ensemble produces somewhat higher values of Rg36,39, while TraDES and FM produce smaller values of Rg and show remarkable agreement with the experimental values.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is ample evidence that pressure and chemical unfolding of proteins results in similar volume change43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus the unfolded state ensembles generated this way are consistent with the only currently available experimental data, that is, power law scaling of Rg for polymers in a good solvent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although TraDES and FM show the closest agreement with experimental Rg values (Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig 4), due to limitation in the maximum sequence length in FM, TraDES was selected for all detailed calculations

state (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This lower VvdW of the native state is mainly associated with the extensive intramolecular hydrogen bonding in the native state30,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, there is direct correlation between the difference in the average number of hydrogen bonds in the native and unfolded ensembles and the VvdW (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the VvdW will not

of void volume to the total volume changes upon protein unfolding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Calculating volume of hydration VHyd', 'When a protein unfolds, groups buried in the native state become exposed and will interact with water.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These interactions can possibly lead to volume changes and thus must be accounted for when considering volume changes upon protein unfolding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Historically, this unfolding reaction was modelled as a transfer from non-polar solvent to water20,21,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been shown that volume change upon such transfer, usually attributed to the volume changes upon hydration, is always negative, that is, volume of a solute in aqueous solution is always smaller than that in non-polar solvent20,21,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, transfer from non-polar solvent to aqueous solution has been proven to be inadequate to model thermodynamics of hydration (see for example, refs 45, 46).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of volume changes, the larger size of non-polar solvent than that of water leads to an overestimation of the volume that a solute occupies in the non-polar phase47 (see Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has been well established that transfer from gas phase into aqueous solution is a more appropriate way to model thermodynamics of hydration46,48,49,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also the case for modelling the volume changes upon hydration (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To understand the volume changes upon hydration in more detail, we analysed the experimentally measured volume change upon transfer of over 150 different model solutes (aromatic and non-aromatic compounds, oligopeptides and N-acetyl amides of amino acids) from gas phase into aqueous solution at 25 °C51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydration volume upon transfer from gas phase into water, VHyd, is equal to the experimentally measured partial volume of a solute in water minus the geometric volume of this solute (that is, VSE) (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This volume will, in a first approximation, depend on the number of water molecules that can directly interact with the solute and thus is proportional to the molecular surface area of the solute molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 6a shows the dependence of the hydration volume, VHyd, on the total molecular surface area (MSA) of various solutes, MSATot.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Two major observations can be made from the plot shown in Fig 6a.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the hydration volume is always positive, that is, transfer of any (polar or non-polar) solute into aqueous solution leads to an increase in volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the increase in the molecular surface area leads to an increase in the corresponding hydration volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, there is a large spread in this trend (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, the correlation becomes much more pronounced (R2=0.94) if we plot only non-polar MSA (MSANP) as a function of VHyd (see Fig 6b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that the solvent interactions with non-polar surfaces make up a major contribution to the volume changes upon hydration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This observation is in line with some previous reports52; however, present analysis has been done on a much larger and more diverse data set.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, not all variance in VHyd can be explained by MSANP.

modelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Native state all-atom explicit solvent MD simulations were carried out in GROMACS 4.6.3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  59) using the CHARMM27 force field and TIP3P water model60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The native crystal structure was solvated in a dodecahedron box, with dimensions such that all protein atoms are at least 10 Å deep in the box, and neutralized with 0.1 M excess NaCl, followed by energy minimization for 1,000 steps.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All simulations underwent 200 ps of constant volume equilibration, 100 ps of constant pressure equilibration and 50 ns of production simulation at 300 K and 1 bar.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used the ParrinelloRahman61 pressure control with a 2 ps relaxation time and a compressibility of 4.6 × 105 atm1, and v-scale temperature coupling59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LINCS62 and SETTLE63 algorithms were used to constraint high-frequency bond vibrations that allowed the use of a 2 ps integration step.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electrostatic interactions were modelled by the smooth particle mesh Ewald method64, using a 75 × 75 × 75 grid, with fourth-order charge interpolation and a real space cutoff of 1.0 nm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A native ensemble of 50 structures was extracted from the production trajectory (1 structure per ns).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Equilibration criteria were stable all-atom r.m.s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  with respect to the crystal structure ( less_than  2 Å) and stable values (drift 0.5%) of solvent-excluded volume throughout the production trajectory.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low-frequency motions are expected to introduce only small corrections to the solvent-excluded volume, though further study would be warranted for proteins that undergo large-scale conformational fluctuations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Sampling of the unfolded state ensembles was carried out using three generators: TraDES37, SC36 and FM38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each unfolded state ensemble consisted of 1,000 structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TraDES ensembles were generated with the all-coil sampling flag (-c T) to remove all secondary structure propensity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Coil and FM ensembles were generated using default settings.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SC and FM generate only the protein backbone, and hence Scwrl4 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  65) was used to add side-chains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Before volume calculations, the structures generated by TraDES, SC or FM were energy minimized in implicit solvent, using the Generalized Born surface area (GBSA) model with protein and solvent dielectric constants of 80 in GROMACS 4.6.3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This step also explicitly incorporates all hydrogen atoms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The disulfide bridges for three individual proteins (BPTI, RNase and Lyz) modelled into the TraDES unfolded state ensemble by performing restrained all-atom MD simulations using the following protocol in GROMACS 4.6.3 with TIP3P water and CHARMM27 force field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the structures were energy minimized for 800 steps before enabling distance restraints.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Distance restraints were gradually shortened in four 5 ps steps, where distance restraints were 3, 1, 0.5 and 0.2 nm, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon reaching 0.20.3 nm distance between sulfur atoms, the structure was energy minimized in the CHARMM27 force field for 1,000 steps in implicit solvent, using the steepest descent algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Model compounds', 'The experimentally measured at 25 °C partial molar volumes in aqueous solution, V,aq, of 150 model compounds relevant to proteins (alkanes, aromatic compounds, alcohols, diols, amines, amides, diamines, diamides, dicarboxylic acids, hydroxyamides, hydroxy acids, ketones, polyethylene glycols and ureas) were taken from refs 51, 66.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each of these model compound PDB structures were generated using the CORINA webserver67.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we included into our analysis more complex model compounds such as oligopeptides (3-5 residues), N-acetyl amino acid amides and N-acetyl amino acids that represent protein components, for which the experimentally measured partial molar volumes in aqueous solution, V,aq, are also reported15,68,69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For these compounds, structures were generated using the same protocol as for the native proteins (see above).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The hydration volume is calculated as a difference between partial molar volume of a compound in aqueous solution, V,aq, and corresponding solvent-excluded volume, VSE, (see also Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MSMS software package70 was used to analytically calculate MSA per atom for all structures of model compounds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each structure had its MSA broken down into carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur surface areas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrogen surface areas were combined with the surface area of their parent heavy atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Carbon and sulfur molecular surface areas were combined into non-polar MSA (MSANP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nitrogen and oxygen molecular surface areas were combined into polar MSA (MSAPol).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'ProteinVolume calculations', 'The ProteinVolume software package has been described by us previously71.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, it uses a flood-fill algorithm to first calculate the molecular surface based on the coordinates, and then fill the enclosed volume with 0.02 Å probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sum of all volume probes is calculated and reported as the solvent-excluded protein volume (VSE).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Van der Waals volume (VvdW) is also calculated during the same step as the solvent-excluded volume calculation procedure, but with an additional check of whether the volume probe is within the van der Waals radius of a protein atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A probe that lies on top of a van der Waals boundary is stochastically accepted with the acceptance probability based on its magnitude of overlap with the atom.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This increases the accuracy of the van der Waals volume calculation and reduces the volume underestimation of numerical integration methods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sum of all van der Waals volume probes is calculated and reported as van der Waals protein volume (VvdW).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Void volume, VVoid, is calculated as the difference between the solvent-excluded volume and the van der Waals volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ProteinVolume uses all-atom Bondi radii set72.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  United atom radii are slightly larger to represent the additional radius of bonded hydrogen atoms averaged across the entire atom surface and this leads to an overestimation of van der Waals volume.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Volume changes upon ionization (electrostriction) vary between different protein groups (see Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, most charged groups are on the surface of native proteins, and thus at most 12 protons will be released or absorbed upon protein unfolding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This might have an effect for smaller proteins  less_than 100 residues, but small proteins rarely have buried charged groups73.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Continuum electrostatics calculations using h++ server74 of net charge in the native and unfolded ensembles for eight proteins that were quantitatively compared with the experimental V values (for example, Fig 9) show that there is no change in the net charge upon unfolding of these proteins (see Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.'
