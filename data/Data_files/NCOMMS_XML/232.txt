Transcriptional silencing of long noncoding RNA GNG12-AS1 uncouples its transcriptional and product-related functions  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate gene expression via their RNA product or through transcriptional interference, yet a strategy to differentiate these two processes is lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To address this, we used multiple small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to silence GNG12-AS1, a nuclear lncRNA transcribed in an antisense orientation to the tumour-suppressor DIRAS3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that while most siRNAs silence GNG12-AS1 post-transcriptionally, siRNA complementary to exon 1 of GNG12-AS1 suppresses its transcription by recruiting Argonaute 2 and inhibiting RNA polymerase II binding.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptional, but not post-transcriptional, silencing of GNG12-AS1 causes concomitant upregulation of DIRAS3, indicating a function in transcriptional interference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This change in DIRAS3 expression is sufficient to impair cell cycle progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the reduction in GNG12-AS1 transcripts alters MET signalling and cell migration, but these are independent of DIRAS3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, differential siRNA targeting of a lncRNA allows dissection of the functions related to the process and products of its transcription.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The mammalian genome encodes many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that play pivotal roles in gene regulation during development and disease pathogenesis1,2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LncRNAs can regulate gene expression through transcriptional interference (TI)4,5 or through the RNA product itself1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TI occurs when the act of transcribing a gene directly interferes with the transcription of an adjacent gene in cis, either at its initiation site or at an essential cis-regulatory element6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcription of lncRNA has been shown to interfere with the transcription of adjacent genes by altering the binding of transcription factors8,9,10 and/or RNA polymerase II (Pol II)11, nucleosome remodelling12 or inducing changes in histone modifications13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'So far, the strategies for demonstrating TI in mammalian cells have relied upon genetic engineering methodologies that remove the promoter region or insert premature transcriptional termination sites within the transcriptional unit4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An alternative approach would be to leave the DNA template intact and directly target the lncRNA with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is widely perceived that RNA interference (RNAi) is a cytoplasmic pathway for post-transcriptional gene silencing15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, RNAi-based technology has been used to post-transcriptionally deplete a lncRNA Kcnq1ot1 in the nucleus and demonstrate that this lncRNA product is not required to maintain imprinting of adjacent genes16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  RNAi has also been shown to induce transcriptional gene silencing (TGS)17,18,19. siRNA-directed TGS can lead to epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone methylation at the target promoters17,20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, promoter-targeting siRNAs can induce TGS by blocking the recruitment and the activity of Pol II (refs 23, 24, 25).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all these cases, Argonaute proteins (AGO1 and AGO2) were shown to be key players of TGS21,24,26,27,28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, it has been shown that siRNAs can be used to knockdown small-nuclear ncRNA 7SK30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations prompted us to investigate whether siRNAs can be used to inhibit lncRNA transcription and to explore the functional consequences of this process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, we postulated that by targeting different regions of the lncRNA, we could uncouple the act of transcription from the function of the transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would enable us to investigate how lncRNAs regulate adjacent genes in cis through TI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a model, we used the imprinted tumour-suppressor DIRAS3 locus, where we have recently characterized a novel lncRNA known as GNG12-AS1 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GNG12-AS1 is transcribed in an antisense orientation to DIRAS3 and its neighbouring non-imprinted genes GNG12 and WLS (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that this lncRNA is allele specifically silenced in cancer cell lines depending on the imprinted state of DIRAS3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIRAS3 (also known as ARHI and NOEY2) is a Ras-related imprinted tumour suppressor involved in the inhibition of growth, motility and invasion via several signalling pathways including RAS/MAPK, STAT3 and PI3K32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIRAS3 is downregulated in 70% of breast and ovarian cancer33,34,35, and its loss of expression correlates with cancer progression and metastasis34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism responsible for DIRAS3 downregulation to date involves different epigenetic mechanisms and loss of heterozygosity32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We hypothesized that TI by GNG12-AS1 could represent an additional layer of regulating DIRAS3 dosage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: GNG12-AS1 is a stable lncRNA in the nucleus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic representation of the GNG12-AS1 genomic locus (chr1:

transcriptionally silenced with siRNAs complementary to a region proximal to its transcriptional start site (TSS).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transcriptional silencing of GNG12-AS1, which is mediated by AGO2, leads to upregulation of DIRAS3 transcription in cis, indicating a function in TI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, targeting GNG12-AS1 at the 3 end did not affect its nascent transcription, but reduced the lncRNA through post-transcriptional gene silencing and, importantly, did not affect DIRAS3 transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further show different phenotypic effects in cell cycle and migration depending on whether we target the 5 or 3 end of GNG12-AS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our results demonstrate that strategic targeting of siRNA to different regions of an lncRNA can enable the discrimination between functions related to its active transcription and that of the RNA product.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'GNG12-AS1 is a stable lncRNA localized in the nucleus', 'In this study, we used three non-cancer cell lines (HB2, HS27, MCF10A), which we have previously shown to have normal imprinted DIRAS3 expression, and breast cancer cell lines (SUM159, MCF7), where loss of DIRAS3 imprinting leads to biallelic expression (SUM159) or biallelic silencing of DIRAS3 (MCF7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-cancer cell lines expressed GNG12-AS1 from both alleles, whereas the cancer cell lines expressed GNG12-AS1 from one allele31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We confirmed the relative expression of DIRAS3, GNG12, GNG12-AS1 and WLS in these cell lines (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Actinomycin D chase experiments indicate that GNG12-AS1 is a stable lncRNA with a half-life between 20 and 25 h (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIRAS3 expression remained unchanged in HB2 and increased in HS27 when cells were treated with Actinomycin D, suggesting an inverse relationship between DIRAS3 and GNG12-AS1 transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite being a stable lncRNA, GNG12-AS1 has a low transcript volume (2080 molecules per 100 cells; Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression analysis following cell fractionation indicated that GNG12-AS1 is localized within the chromatin (Fig 1b), similar to MALAT1, a lncRNA known to be associated with chromatin36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH; as described in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37), we confirmed that GNG12-AS1 is nuclear in HB2 and SUM159 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Exonic probes complementary to all exons showed that GNG12-AS1 transcripts accumulate in the nucleus in discrete foci in 19% of SUM159 and 25% of HB2 cells (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Intronic RNA FISH probes complementary to the first intron of GNG12-AS1 were found to co-localize with the exonic signals in about two-thirds of cases where both probes were present in the same cell (6.8% in HB2 cells; 2.8% in SUM159 cells; Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As intronic probes are usually indicative of nascent transcription and exonic probes can detect both primary and mature transcripts, their co-localization may indicate that the processed transcript remains at its site of transcription, which would fit with GNG12-AS1 being co-transcriptionally spliced, as previously reported31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as we also see separate signals for exonic and intronic probes, it is likely that some GNG12-AS1 also accumulate at other sites in the nucleus away from its site of transcription (3.3% in HB2 cells; 1.7% in SUM159 cells; Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A caveat to the interpretation of FISH data is that intronic and exonic RNA FISH probes might not hybridize to nascent and mature lncRNA transcripts in a mutually exclusive way.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nascent RNA contains exons and the mature lncRNAs may be present as unspliced isoforms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In SUM159 cells, the intronic probe mostly produced a single FISH signal (13% of cells being monoallelic, Supplementary Fig 1e), which fits with previous pyrosequencing data reporting allele-specific GNG12-AS1 expression in cancer cells31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, in HB2 cells, even though pyrosequencing showed an allelic ratio of 50% (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31), we observed cells with both single and double intronic signals (8 and 6% of cells, respectively; Supplementary Fig 1e), suggesting that GNG12-AS1 is heterogeneously biallelic and randomly monoallelic at the cellular level in HB2 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these data confirm that GNG12-AS1 is a stable lncRNA that is present in the nucleus at distinct foci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'TI between GNG12-AS1 and DIRAS3', 'To investigate the role of GNG12-AS1, we depleted GNG12-AS1 using siRNAs (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GNG12-AS1 has multiple isoforms31, thus we designed siRNAs against several different exons and found that siRNA targeted to exons 1, 5 and 7 reduced GNG12-AS1 by 5070% in HB2 and SUM159 cells (Supplementary Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These exons are common to all of the known splice forms of GNG12-AS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using several primer sets to capture the various GNG12-AS1 isoforms, we confirmed that siRNAs against exons 1 and 7 efficiently knockdown GNG12-AS1 (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further confirmed that the knockdown occurred in all cellular compartments (Supplementary Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we are able to deplete GNG12-AS1 in the nucleus with siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', "Figure 2: Transcriptional

SUM159 cells showed that although siRNAs to either exon 1 or exon 7 effectively ablated GNG12-AS1 detectable with exonic probes, siRNA targeting exon 1 reduced GNG12-AS1 detectable with intronic probes (nascent transcripts) more efficiently than siRNA to exon 7 (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that although both siRNAs can efficiently reduce GNG12-AS1 levels in different cellular compartments, siRNA complementary to the 5 end of GNG12-AS1 may preferentially inhibit its nascent transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We next asked whether depletion of GNG12-AS1 affects the transcription of its neighbouring genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed the expression of GNG12, DIRAS3 and WLS after depleting GNG12-AS1 with siRNAs against exon 1 and exon 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIRAS3, but not GNG12 or WLS, was upregulated after targeting exon 1 of GNG12-AS1 in four cell lines (Fig 2c,d and Supplementary Fig 3af).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIRAS3 upregulation was consistent in different cell lines when GAPDH (Fig 2c,d and Supplementary Fig 3a,b) or the geometric mean of GAPDH and RPS18 were used (Supplementary Fig 3cf).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, for further quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) experiments, we used GAPDH as the reference gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a fifth cell line MCF7, despite a 60% reduction in GNG12-AS1, expression of DIRAS3 could not be reactivated (Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In MCF7 cells, DIRAS3 is more hypermethylated at its promoter compared with SUM159 cells31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Off-target effects were excluded by the use of additional siRNAs against exon 1 and exon 7 of GNG12-AS1 (Supplementary Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we used the randomized nucleotide sequence (scrambled siRNAs) of exon 1 and exon 7 siRNAs (Supplementary Fig 4c,d), as well as C911 mismatch siRNA controls38, all of which failed to affect GNG12-AS1 and DIRAS3 levels (Supplementary Fig 4e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To exclude the possibility of GNG12-AS1 regulating DIRAS3 expression in trans, we ectopically introduced GNG12-AS1 in SUM159 and HB2 cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overexpression of the most common splice variants of GNG12-AS1 had no effect on expression of DIRAS3 or the surrounding genes (Supplementary Fig 5a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As DIRAS3 is an imprinted gene, we examined whether allele-specific expression changed after GNG12-AS1 depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIRAS3 imprinting and its methylation status were unaltered (Supplementary Fig 5ce).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Taken together, these results suggest that GNG12-AS1 modulates the expression of the already active DIRAS3 allele in cis and that siRNA to exon 1 of GNG12-AS1 disrupts this function without affecting expression of neighbouring genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'siRNA against 5 end of GNG12-AS1 blocks RNA Pol II', 'Next, we examined whether inhibition of DIRAS3 in cis can be achieved by targeting GNG12-AS1 exons closer to the DIRAS3 gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to when we targeted exon 7, siRNA to exon 5 efficiently reduced GNG12-AS1 (Supplementary Fig 2b,c), but did not upregulate DIRAS3 (Supplementary Fig 6a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In one of the cell lines, siRNA to exon 5 led to WLS downregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNAs to exons 2 and 3, which flank DIRAS3 on either side, reduced GNG12-AS1 isoform specifically (Supplementary Fig 2f,g), suggesting that these siRNAs function post-transcriptionally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These siRNAs had no effect on DIRAS3 expression further supporting modulation via the act of transcription rather than through a specific GNG12-AS1 isoform (Supplementary Fig 6c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To prove that the cis function of GNG12-AS1 is modulated by siRNA targeting exon 1, which leads to the inhibition of TI between GNG12-AS1 and DIRAS3, we profiled Pol II and histone modifications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 3a,b, a significant reduction in Pol II binding was observed at the TSS of GNG12-AS1 when exon 1, but not exon 7, was targeted by siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Concomitantly, an increase in Pol II binding was observed at the DIRAS3 TSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nuclear run-on assays showed that the reduction in Pol II binding was associated with reduced nascent GNG12-AS1 transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, a reduction of GNG12-AS1 and increased DIRAS3 run-on transcripts were observed with siRNA targeting exon 1, but not exon

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'LncRNAs can function via their RNA product and through the act of their transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  So far it has been challenging to tease apart these two processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we employed an siRNA-based strategy targeting different regions of GNG12-AS1 and found that siRNA selectively targeting the first exon of GNG12-AS1 resulted in increased expression of DIRAS3 in cis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings, together with inverse relationship between GNG12-AS1 and DIRAS3 during the cell cycle and Actinomycin D treatment, indicate that the act of transcribing GNG12-AS1 regulates expression of the active DIRAS3 allele by TI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently showed that this transcriptional targeting by siRNA to the 5 end of GNG12-AS1 is mediated by AGO2, which binds to the GNG12-AS1 TSS as well as to its transcript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, distinct functional consequences were uncovered, depending on whether GNG12-AS1 transcription was disrupted or whether its product was depleted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The first suggestion that siRNA targeting exon 1 of GNG12-AS1 reduced its nascent transcription was with RNA-FISH, where we observed reduced hybridization with intronic probes after treating cells with this siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More concrete biochemical evidence of transcriptional inhibition were demonstrated by decreased Pol II binding at the GNG12-AS1 TSS with ChIP and reduced nascent transcription with nuclear run-on experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNA targeted to exon 7, while still reducing the overall GNG12-AS1 product, does not upregulate DIRAS3 and does not change Pol II binding, making this siRNA an excellent internal control for our experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Consistent with the data on Pol II binding and nascent transcription, we detected a reduction in the active histone modification, H3K4me3 at the GNG12-AS1 TSS when GNG12-AS1 was depleted using siRNA against exon 1, but not with exon 7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, the histone modification mark H3K36me3, which normally accumulates in gene body where it is associated with transcriptional elongation39, was reduced at the 3 end of GNG12-AS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our findings suggest that siRNA targeting the 5 end of GNG12-AS1 led to inhibition of transcriptional initiation and elongation of GNG12-AS1 by directly interfering with Pol II dynamics without inducing changes in DNA methylation and repressive histone marks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To date, all reported cases of exogenous TGS in human cells have used siRNAs against the gene promoter regions or the TSS17,20,24,25,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study is, therefore, the first to show that targeting the first exon interferes with the transcription of a lncRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, with GNG12-AS1, targeting regions upstream of the TSS had no effect on its transcription, suggesting that transcription needs to be initiated in order to be targeted by siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This may also explain why, although we found a reduction in active histone modifications, we did not observe an increase in repressive chromatin marks.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As TGS is achieved through the RNAi machinery24,25,27,28, we investigated the engagement of AGO2 in the inhibition of GNG12-AS1 transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  siRNAs are known to form a complex with AGO2 in the cytoplasm and then shuffle between the cytoplasm and nucleus43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Small-RNA loading is a cytoplasmic process necessary for the nuclear import of AGO2 (refs 18, 43, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has further been suggested that small RNAs can guide AGO2 to the promoters of ncRNAs and affect their transcription45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on these precedents, we would expect that all siRNAs in our experiments would have a similar knockdown efficiency in different cellular compartments, and once the AGO2siRNA complex was in the nucleus, the functional consequences of the GNG12-AS1 depletion would depend on the region targeted.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of AGO2siRNA complexes in the nucleus and cytoplasm would explain why we could rescue the GNG12-AS1 expression in double knockdown experiments between GNG12-AS1 and AGO2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, AGO2-siRNA-GNG12-AS1 complexes at the GNG12-AS1 TSS could only be detected in the nucleus when the siRNA was directed to exon 1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As described above, GNG12-AS1 could only be reduced when sequences downstream of its TSS were targeted by siRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This finding, together with the RIP results, showing that AGO2 associates with the GNG12-AS1 when cells are treated with siRNA to exon 1, suggest that transcription needs to have been already initiated for siRNA-mediated repression of transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although AGO2siRNA interactions with chromatin and the lncRNA could be demonstrated by ChIP and RIP, respectively, we do not have direct evidence for siRNAAGO2 attaching the nascent lncRNA to the chromatin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We propose a model described in Fig 7, where exogenous siRNA complementary to the 5 end (exon 1) of GNG12-AS1 recruits AGO2 to GNG12-AS1 and to the chromatin at its TSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This complex, containing the siRNA and GNG12-AS1 and possibly other proteins, stalls transcription of GNG12-AS1 by Pol II.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIRAS3 expression is enhanced as a consequence of reduced GNG12-AS1 transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 7: Inhibition of transcriptional interference with siRNA.The top panel depicts how GNG12-AS1 modulates the expression of the active DIRAS3 allele through transcriptional interference.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GNG12-AS1 may act as a rheostat for DIRAS3 transcription rate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lower panel depicts how exogenous siRNA molecules in a complex with AGO2 can bind to both the TSS and GNG12-AS1 to inhibit Pol II, and block further transcription initiation and elongation of GNG12-AS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result of transcriptional silencing of GNG12-AS1, transcriptional interference is reduced leading to increased transcription of DIRAS3.Full size image', 'There are two possible mechanisms whereby an exogenous siRNA in a complex with AGO2 could lead to decreased GNG12-AS1 transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AGO2 has slicer activity47 and this could promote cleavage and degradation of the nascent GNG12-AS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, the AGO2siRNA complex could present a physical block for Pol II initiation and elongation at the GNG12-AS1 TSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, AGO2 has been shown to guide small RNAs to inhibit Pol II recruitment and elongation in human cells24,48 independently of its slicer activity24,27,45,46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  AGO2 has been reported to form a complex with different chromatin-modifying proteins to mediate gene silencing49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is therefore possible that AGO2siRNAGNG12-AS1 complexes at the TSS may include further proteins that influence Pol II kinetics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our model does not distinguish between these different but not necessarily mutually exclusive mechanisms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Silencing of imprinted genes is frequently achieved by TI of an antisense lncRNA11,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these cases, the lncRNA is reciprocally imprinted relative to its target gene and is expressed on the opposite allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike, the other imprinted genes, we found that it was the already actively expressing DIRAS3 allele being upregulated after GNG12-AS1 knockdown, indicating that GNG12-AS1 has a role in modulating DIRAS3 expression in cis, rather than maintaining its imprinting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A reduction of Pol II and H3K4me3 at the TSS of GNG12-AS1 was associated with a concomitant increase at the DIRAS3 TSS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These shifts reflect the change in dynamics between these two genes as transcription inhibition by the GNG12-AS1 is eased and DIRAS3 transcription is augmented.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TI between GNG12-AS1 and DIRAS3 could only be consistently inhibited when siRNAs were target within the first exon of GNG12-AS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Targeting the adjacent intron did not lead to DIRAS3 upregulation in both of the cell lines tested.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As GNG12-AS1 was efficiently reduced, we presume the nascent transcript was targeted, but GNG12-AS1 may also be present as mature unspliced transcripts that can be targeted post-transcriptionally.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are several enhancer signature peaks (histone H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac)) within this intron as annotated in the ENCODE database (Supplementary Fig 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is possible that although the nascent RNA can be inhibited by siRNA targeted to this region, enough transcription has already occurred through the region to prevent DIRAS3 upregulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a region with multiple enhancers, some are likely to be tissue specific, which could explain why DIRAS3 expression is differentially upregulated in two different cell lines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of enhancer marks at this locus would fit with GNG12-AS1 being an enhancer-like, cis regulator of DIRAS3 transcription51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The location of these enhancers and their potential specificity for DIRAS3 might explain why GNG12 is not affected by GNG12-AS1 depletion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another possibility is that GNG12-AS1 expression is limited by GNG12 transcription and its further reduction has no impact on GNG12 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An alternative strategy to siRNA for analysing the cis functions of GNG12-AS1 would have been to use CRISPRi, a new technology involving small guide RNAs to recruit a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) fused to the KRAB transcriptional repressor domain to specific loci52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to RNAi, CRISPRi does not affect the underlying gene sequence and was shown to induce transcriptional repression of lncRNAs52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, KRAB-mediated silencing can spread to adjacent genes53, which would confound the detection of genes influenced by TI by a lncRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transcription of lncRNA provides an important mechanism for fine-tuning the expression of genes in cis54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is evidence for lncRNAs having a threshold-depended role in moderating gene regulation rather than an activating or repressive role54.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, MALAT1, a lncRNA with several roles in gene regulation, has subtle effects on the expression of its neighbouring genes55.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A fine-tuning mechanism could explain why small changes in gene expression observed after depletion of some lncRNAs could be relevant upon specific stress or environmental conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Imprinted genes are exquisitely regulated for gene dosage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that in vivo, the cis regulatory function of GNG12-AS1 in fine-tuning DIRAS3 expression is limited to specific developmental stages or environmental conditions as shown for HOTTIP lncRNA56, which has similarly low abundance and expression levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  GNG12-AS1 is not imprinted in non-cancer cell lines, as shown previously by pyrosequencing SNP analysis31, but our RNA-FISH results indicate that in a substantial proportion of HB2 cells it may be randomly monoallelic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A growing number of autosomal genes are being shown to be randomly monoallelic at single-cell level57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If 50% of cells with GNG12-AS1 expression are expressing transcripts from the paternal allele, these would be repressing DIRAS3 in cis by TI, whereas on the other 50% of cells where GNG12-AS1 expression is maternal, DIRAS3 would already be silent on this allele.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This would be consistent with the suggestion that random monoallelic expression refines gene expression levels in a population of cells58,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition to GNG12-AS1 having a cis function in moderating DIRAS3 transcription, GNG12-AS1 also regulates cell cycle progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcriptional upregulation of DIRAS3 induced by GNG12-AS1 depletion led to G1 delay associated with the downregulation of cyclin E1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the G1 delay and cyclin E1 levels were rescued by simultaneous depletion of exon 1 siRNA of GNG12-AS1 and DIRAS3, these data suggest that TI between GNG12-AS1 and DIRAS3 contributes to the regulation of G1 phase of the cell cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  DIRAS3 was shown to be involved in cell cycle progression40,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The upregulation of DIRAS3 by inhibiting GNG12-AS1 transcription in our study does not have the same effect on cyclin genes as previously reported, where DIRAS3 was ectopically overexpressed40,59,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These differences could be due to the modest upregulation of DIRAS3 induced by transient repression of GNG12-AS1 with siRNA, whereas the latter study ectopically expressed DIRAS3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, our results are consistent with a role for DIRAS3 in cell cycle progression through G1 phase40,59.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, these results indicate that disruption of TI between GNG12-AS1 and DIRAS3 can have effects on the cell cycle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'RNA-FISH analysis indicated that, in addition to co-localization between intronic and exonic probes, we also found cells in which the signals were separated, suggesting that there may be additional functions for GNG12-AS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our cell cycle analysis revealed that GNG12-AS1 depletion with siRNAs to 5 end and 3 end resulted in a G2/M delay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect is most likely due to a DIRAS3-independent function of GNG12-AS1 RNA product.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is further supported by our microarray experiments where both siRNAs induced changes in genes involved in cell cycle progression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In addition, we found that reducing the levels of GNG12-AS1 transcripts whether by siRNAs directed to exon 1 or various other exons of GNG12-AS1 resulted in increased cell migration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenotype was observed upon GNG12-AS1 knockdown even in cells where DIRAS3 expression was absent.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression profiling of GNG12-AS1-depleted cells showed an enrichment for genes involved in cell adhesion, migration and actin cytoskeleton pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We were able to validate the upregulation of MET signalling pathway after siRNA-mediated reduction of GNG12-AS1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MET controls many biological functions such as cell migration, invasion and motility, and its aberrant activation can lead to cancer41,42,61.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have previously shown that GNG12-AS1 is downregulated in breast cancer tumours together with DIRAS3 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, it is possible that GNG12-AS1 extends the tumour-suppressor function of this locus by regulating oncogenes such as MET.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In keeping with this, MET was recently shown to be regulated by MEG3 lncRNA in pancreatic tumours62.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, MET could be a common target of lncRNAs involved in the regulation of cellular processes important for tumour growth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further experiments are necessary to investigate whether the GNG12-AS1 transcript directly interacts with distant genes, and if so whether this interaction is isoform specific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, GNG12-AS1 is similar to several other lncRNAs that have both cis and trans functions63,64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the trans function may be to regulate genes involved in cell cycle and cell migration through direct interaction, the cis function has a role in fine-tuning regulation of DIRAS3 transcription.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, our results demonstrate that an siRNA-based strategy can be employed to successfully separate functions that are due to
