Redox-freezing and nucleation of diamond via magnetite formation in the Earths mantle  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Diamonds and their inclusions are unique probes into the deep Earth, tracking the deep carbon cycle to  greater than 800 km.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding the mechanisms of carbon mobilization and freezing is a prerequisite for quantifying the fluxes of carbon in the deep Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show direct evidence for the formation of diamond by redox reactions involving FeNi sulfides.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction identifies an arrested redox reaction from pyrrhotite to magnetite included in diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetite corona shows coherent epitaxy with relict pyrrhotite and diamond, indicating that diamond nucleated on magnetite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, structures inherited from h-Fe3O4 define a phase transformation at depths of 320330 km, the base of the Kaapvaal lithosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The oxidation of pyrrhotite to magnetite is an important trigger of diamond precipitation in the upper mantle, explaining the presence of these phases in diamonds.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The Earths mantle contains 200 g g1 sulfur on average1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite this elements rarity, iron-nickel (FeNi) sulfides form by far the most abundant inclusions in natural diamond2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This extreme overabundance in comparison to the mantle xenolith record is enigmatic, particularly because the mobility of low-volume sulfide melts in the mantle is limited4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'An increasing body of evidence indicates that the majority of diamonds form from mobile carbon-bearing fluids and melts in the Earths mantle5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clues for diamond formation mechanisms are found in minerals and fluids included in various diamond species, which provide different perspectives of the same process.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fast-growing fibrous diamonds directly sample mantle metasomatic fluids in abundant micro-inclusions6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, rapidly formed polycrystalline diamond aggregates encase a range of solid products representative of their formation process7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combined evidence from these rapidly formed diamond species emphasizes the importance of redox gradients as a controlling parameter for the immobilization of carbon as diamond in the mantle6,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The most effective redox couple in the Earths mantle consists of carbon and iron, which controls the onset of carbonate melting with depth by reduction of Fe3+ and oxidation of graphite or diamond9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, oxidation of Fe2+ may lead to freezing of mobile carbon species in the form of graphite or diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fe2+ in FeNi sulfides in the Earths mantle thus present a reservoir with considerable oxidation potential.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While rare in the mantle overall1, billions of years of subduction10,11 have created patches that are highly enriched in crustal material that contain abundant sulfides, carbon and volatiles and provide a very reactive environment in the Earths mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this work we investigate the microstructure and composition of FeNi-sulfide inclusions in a polycrystalline diamond aggregate that display a nanogranular magnetite reaction corona.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assemblage demonstrates that diamond formed and nucleated by a redox reaction involving the diamond-forming fluid and the FeNi sulfide that formed magnetite and diamond.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epitaxy between sulfide, the magnetite corona and diamond host shows that diamond nucleated on the magnetite, establishing syngenicity between the phases, and demonstrating magnetite formation at the expense of the FeNi sulfide to diamond formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the magnetite corona, characteristic and systematic orientation relationships between the magnetite grains are indicative of a phase transformation from a high-pressure h-Fe3O4 phase, which is stable only above 10 GPa, placing the origin of this assemblage unequivocally at the base of the subcratonic lithosphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study provides direct evidence for the involvement of FeNi sulfides in diamond formation and emphasizes the importance of locally sulfide-enriched areas in the Earths mantle as diamond factories.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Our knowledge about ages and formation of diamond comes primarily from the minerals it includes and relies on the prerequisite that these minerals are syngenetic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Epitaxy between inclusions and diamond hosts is an unambiguous indicator for syngenicity, but as of yet studies have yielded ambiguous results for inclusion suites within the same diamonds.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, while olivine inclusions in diamond are generally randomly oriented with respect to the diamond, some olivines within one diamond host can be iso-oriented, implying that these may be fragments of a protogenetic larger crystal25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The microstructural observations in this study show that epitactic relationships do indeed identify nucleation centres for diamond and thus establish syngenicity sensu stricto.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as illustrated by the very similar sulfide-magnetite assemblage of inclusion 2 separated only by a few microns from inclusion 1 (Fig 1), the lack of epitaxy does not discount syngenicity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It simply shows that these phases did not serve as nucleation centres, but were accidentally encapsuled.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although sulfides are the most common inclusions in diamond and it has long since been speculated that they may be directly involved in diamond formation26,27,28, direct evidence for this has been lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our key sample preserves the critical mineral assemblage and microtexture, thus establishing unambiguously the link between diamond, sulfide and Fe-oxides as partners in and products of an arrested redox reaction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sulfides are locally enriched in the mantle, where subduction processes govern the flux of sulfur and carbon into the Earths interior29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subducted compositionally heterogeneous crustal material has been shown to be common over large depth ranges into the lower mantle in modern subduction zones30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Fossil-subducted crust in the subcratonic lithosphere leaves its legacy in the kimberlite xenolith record5 and may be particularly abundant at the base of cratonic lithosphere, because the shape of the cratonic roots in the overriding plate plays an active role in causing permanent underplating by subducted ocean crust32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These highly reactive areas contain the ingredients and the strong oxidation gradients in close spatial vicinity and have served as diamond factories throughout the major part of Earths history10.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
