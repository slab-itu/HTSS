Highly-conducting molecular circuits based on antiaromaticity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Aromaticity is a fundamental concept in chemistry.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is described by Hückels rule that states that a cyclic planar -system is aromatic when it shares 4n+2 -electrons and antiaromatic when it possesses 4n -electrons.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antiaromatic compounds are predicted to exhibit remarkable charge transport properties and high redox activities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it has so far only been possible to measure compounds with reduced aromaticity but not antiaromatic species due to their energetic instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we address these issues by investigating the single-molecule charge transport properties of a genuinely antiaromatic compound, showing that antiaromaticity results in an order of magnitude increase in conductance compared with the aromatic counterpart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single-molecule currentvoltage measurements and ab initio transport calculations reveal that this results from a reduced energy gap and a frontier molecular resonance closer to the Fermi level in the antiaromatic species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conductance of the antiaromatic complex is further modulated electrochemically, demonstrating its potential as a high-conductance transistor.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The concept of aromaticity1,2,3 is of fundamental importance in the chemistry of -electrons that play an essential role in many organic materials relevant for nanoscale chemical, physical and biological studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stability and electronic properties of the -system depend sensitively on the geometry and connectivity of the molecule.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, when a linear -conjugated system adopts a cyclic and planar framework, the molecule gains additional energetic or resonance stabilization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This resonance or aromatic stabilization energy represents the energy difference with the best canonical structure that can be drawn for the molecule and is thus a measure of molecular stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The greater this energy, the more stable the compound is.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to topology, this quantity also depends on the number of -electrons in the cyclic conjugated system.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cyclic and planar molecules with 4n+2 -electrons present the highest resonance energy (stability) and are referred to as aromatic within Hückels rule4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, cyclic and planar molecules sharing 4n -electrons feature a remarkable energetic destabilization and are referred to as antiaromatic1,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, the lower resonance energy in cyclobutadiene makes it more energetic (and far more reactive) than its open-chain counterpart 1,3-butadiene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Higher stability and lower reactivity are reflected in larger molecular gaps and aromatic molecules generally have larger gaps than antiaromatic ones6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From a fundamental and simplified viewpoint, cyclic molecules with 4n+1 and 4n+3 -electrons obviously possess unpaired electron(s) and become nonaromatic.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These compounds exhibit open shell character and cannot be chemically isolated in a controlled manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Aromatic and antiaromatic -systems have attracted wide attention in the field of the organic synthesis and materials science8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Aromatic molecules such as oligoacenes8, porphyrins9, tetrathiafulvalenes10,11 and related compounds play an important role in organic electronic components such as electroluminescent devices and organic photovoltaic devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the characteristic instability and smaller gap of antiaromatic molecules brings to the -system a great ability to donate and accept charge carriers and eases electrochemical tunability of the molecular orbitals, making antiaromatic compounds well suited for organic electronic components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, antiaromatic compounds had been predicted by Breslow to be more conducting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Early electrochemical measurements of oxidation/reduction potentials had shown that electron transfer from donor to acceptor groups in a molecule was amplified when connected through an antiaromatic structure12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Advances in electronic characterization make it possible to measure an electronic current through individual molecules, probing their inherent charge transport properties at the single-molecule scale14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent single-molecule electronics studies of a series of molecules with varying degrees of aromaticity established a negative relation between aromaticity and conductance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More aromatic rings with higher resonance energies were seen to correlate with HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) positions further from the Fermi level and lower conductance (which in these molecules is HOMO dominated)17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Subsequent transport calculations verified this trend and reported smaller molecular gaps and HOMO positions closer to the Fermi level with decreasing aromaticity18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the chemical instability of the antiaromatic molecules and unfavourable intermolecular interaction in the bulk has restricted transport studies to aromatic systems or species with no aromaticity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While these works clearly established the negative relationship of aromaticity with conductance, the positive relationship of conductance and antiaromaticity remained to be demonstrated19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The present study aims to address the long-standing issue of the electronic properties of antiaromatic molecules by investigating the single-molecule transport properties of an antiaromatic compound and exploring the effect of antiaromaticity on the charge transport properties at the single-molecule scale.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To that end, a recently developed, antiaromatic norcorrole-based Ni(II) complex is studied (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ni(nor) features a chemically stable, structurally rigid antiaromatic porphyrinoid moiety20,21,22 where antiaromaticity can be preserved due in no small part to its molecular rigidity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The electronic properties of Ni(nor) are benchmarked against a porphyrin-based aromatic counterpart, Ni(porph) (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The antiaromatic molecule Ni(nor) exhibits enhanced charge transport properties in which single-molecule conductance is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of its aromatic counterpart.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This makes Ni(nor) the most conductive organometallic complex reported to date, to the best of our knowledge.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ab initio transport calculations show that the remarkable conductance of Ni(nor) originates from the smaller gap and more favourable frontier orbital alignment with respect to the aromatic species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Through electrochemical gating, the conductance of the antiaromatic molecule Ni(nor) is further modulated by more than a factor of five.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This work ultimately expands the current synthetic guidelines for the design of highly conducting and functional organic electronic materials using antiaromaticity.

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Conductance studies', 'To assess the impact of antiaromaticity in molecular conductance, single-molecule transport studies were performed on two structurally similar complexes, Ni(nor) and Ni(porph) (Fig 1, Supplementary Figs 1,2, and Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The thioacetate groups bind to Au electrodes through the S lone pair, a strategy that has been shown to result in selective bonding and clear experimental conductance signatures (see Supplementary Note 3 for further details)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The scanning tunnelling microscope-based break-junction (STM-BJ) technique was used to obtain 2,500 conductancedistance traces for each molecule (see Methods and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Measurements were repeated on analogue samples of both complexes to ensure reproducibility.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All recorded traces were employed to build logarithmically binned conductance histograms with no data selection (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conductance histograms display well-defined peaks denoting the most probable molecular conductance value at 4.2 × 104 and 1.7 × 105 G0 for Ni(nor) and Ni(porph), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  No additional molecular signatures were observed in the high conductance regime 1021 G0 (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The measured conductance of the antiaromatic complex Ni(nor) was found to be an order of magnitude higher than that of Ni(porph).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparatively low conductance of the aromatic counterpart is in good agreement with previous studies on closely related porphyrin-based complexes24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The structural similarities between both complexes suggest that the enhanced conductance of Ni(nor) arises from the antiaromatic nature of the norcorrole moiety.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A two dimensional conductancedistance histogram constructed with traces featuring Ni(nor) molecular plateaus extracted from the same data set reveals junction lengths of 0.81.0 nm (Fig 2b; Supplementary Figs 6 and 7), ruling out the possibility of molecular junctions being formed perpendicularly to the norcorrole plane26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Slightly longer junction dimensions of 1.01.2 nm were typically observed for Ni(porph) (Supplementary Fig 8) in good agreement with previous reports25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar junction lengths were obtained for both complexes at different voltages (Supplementary Figs 9 and 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The comparatively shorter length of Ni(nor) junctions reflects the marked structural constraints of the antiaromatic norcorrole moiety, in sharp contrast with porphyrin moiety known to adopt both buckled and twisted conformations (Supplementary Fig 11)20,27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Additional STM-BJ experiments were performed in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) to confirm the remarkable charge transport properties and chemical stability observed for Ni(nor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In UHV, a well-defined molecular conductance peak was observed at 4.6 × 104 G0 (Supplementary Note 9), demonstrating the robustness of the electronic transport probabilities of the chemically stable antiaromatic compound of Ni(nor).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Measured

of the antiaromatic Ni(nor) complex and understand the effect of antiaromaticity on the charge transport properties, transmission calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and nonequilibrium Greens functions, including corrections to the DFT resonance positions, were performed (see Supplementary Notes 4,5 and Supplementary Figs 1215).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed in the previous section, the Ni(nor) and Ni(porph) molecules bind to Au electrodes using acetyl groups at the molecular termini and form single-molecule junctions (see also Supplementary Note 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 3a shows the DFT spectra of the Ni(nor) and Ni(porph) species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spectrum of the Ni(porph) complex shows a peak slightly above +0.6 eV while that of the Ni(nor) features a low-lying peak at +0.1 eV.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For both Ni(porph) and Ni(nor), zero-bias conductance is determined by an unoccupied molecular frontier orbital that tails into the Fermi level and the current is carried by a single transmission channel.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The width of the transmission peaks measures the degree of electronic coupling of the conducting orbital to the electrodes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the spectra, we obtain full-width at half-maximum of Ni(nor)=16 meV and Ni(porph)=10 meV (Supplementary Table 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of the most conducting transmission channel at that energy shows that it is a state delocalized over the conjugated core and linker rings (Fig 3b) deriving from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that the series of peak-dip features in the occupied part of the Ni(nor) spectrum close to the Fermi level are very sharp and do not influence zero-bias conductance (Supplementary Note 4).

corrections to the DFT molecular-level positions are taken into account.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The corrections to the molecular resonance positions bring the calculated values into very good agreement with

characteristics of Ni(nor) and Ni(porph) were measured using a variation of the STM-BJ technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, upon formation of a single-molecule junction, the tip is momentarily held in position and the tunnelling current is monitored as the voltage is swept in the ±1 V range (see Methods, Supplementary Fig 16 and Supplementary Notes 68 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The process is

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have used STM-BJ and IV measurements, supported by theoretical calculations, to explore the effect of antiaromaticity on the charge transport properties of single-molecule junctions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rational molecular design of the antiaromatic Ni(nor) and aromatic Ni(porph) featuring weakly interacting thioacetate linkers enabled direct comparison between the single-molecule junctions of antiaromatic and aromatic characters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We compared an antiaromatic compound with its aromatic counterpart and showed that the antiaromatic species is an order of magnitude more conducting.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antiaromatic destabilization results in a smaller molecular gap and drives the LUMO closer to the Fermi level.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The conductance of the antiaromatic species was further modulated by a factor of five by means of electrochemical gating.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our work demonstrates the potential of analogue derivatives as highly conducting molecular materials and provides relevant guidelines for the design of molecular materials for highly conducting single-molecule electronics.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

layer and optimized the vertical separation between the electrodes, relaxing the position of the molecular and tip atoms until all forces were  less_than 0.02 eV Å1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then carried out transmission calculations at optimized geometries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Monkhorst-Pack grids (5 × 5 × 1 and 15 × 15 × 1) were used for the calculations of the electronic structure and transmission spectra, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transmission eigenchannels were computed at the centre of the Brillouin zone49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Data availability', 'The data that support the findings of
