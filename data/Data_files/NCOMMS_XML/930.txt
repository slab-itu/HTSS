Neutrophil stunning by metoprolol reduces infarct size  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The 1-adrenergic-receptor (ADRB1) antagonist metoprolol reduces infarct size in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The prevailing view has been that metoprolol acts mainly on cardiomyocytes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate that metoprolol reduces reperfusion injury by targeting the haematopoietic compartment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metoprolol inhibits neutrophil migration in an ADRB1-dependent manner.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metoprolol acts during early phases of neutrophil recruitment by impairing structural and functional rearrangements needed for productive engagement of circulating platelets, resulting in erratic intravascular dynamics and blunted inflammation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Depletion of neutrophils, ablation of Adrb1 in haematopoietic cells, or blockade of PSGL-1, the receptor involved in neutrophilplatelet interactions, fully abrogated metoprolols infarct-limiting effects.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The association between neutrophil count and microvascular obstruction is abolished in metoprolol-treated AMI patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metoprolol inhibits neutrophilplatelet interactions in AMI patients by targeting neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identification of the relevant role of ADRB1 in haematopoietic cells during acute injury and the protective role upon its modulation offers potential for developing new therapeutic strategies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Heart attack (acute myocardial infarction, AMI) is one of the principal manifestations of cardiovascular disease and a chief contributor to mortality and morbidity worldwide.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The main determinant of poor outcome post AMI is the extent of irreversible injury (infarct size).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mainstay of AMI treatment is rapid reperfusion to restore blood flow, which reduces complications and improves survival.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, reperfusion itself accelerates and exacerbates the inflammatory response associated with myocardial injury1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the injury inflicted on the myocardium during AMI is the result of ischaemia and reperfusion processes, and is known as ischaemia/reperfusion (IR) injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The development of effective therapies to reduce myocardial IR injury is an unmet clinical need2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The injured myocardium is infiltrated by circulating neutrophils, and these cells are critically involved in myocardial IR injury3,4,5,6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In an inflammatory milieu, neutrophils bind to platelets and red blood cells, forming plugs7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Upon reperfusion, these plugs are dispersed into the microcirculation, where they form embolisms, precluding tissue perfusion despite blood flow restoration in the large coronary arteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This phenomenon, known as microvascular obstruction (MVO), is a major contributor to IR injury and infarct size1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, neutrophil infiltration into acutely damaged organs is dependent on their interaction with platelets8, and these interactions are critical to the formation of harmful co-aggregates and the initiation of inflammatory-like responses before tissue infiltration3,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, neutrophil dynamics (including neutrophilplatelet interactions) are an attractive therapeutic target for the prevention of IR injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The intravenous (i.v.)  #@NEW_LINE#@#  administration of the selective 1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) antagonist metoprolol has been shown to reduce infarct size and improve long-term cardiac function after AMI in the recent METOCARD-CNIC trial9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The mechanism underlying metoprolols cardioprotective effect remains unclear11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Identifying this mechanism could have significant implications for the understanding of IR and the development of novel infarct-limiting therapies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The adrenergic system is critically involved in inflammatory reactions12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the inflammatory response of neutrophils involves the de novo production and release by these cells of catecholamines12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Induced catecholamine stress (as during ischaemia) alters neutrophil trafficking14,15,16 and promotes formation of neutrophilplatelet co-aggregates17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We hypothesized that pre-reperfusion i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  metoprolol administration alters neutrophil dynamics, resulting in a dampened inflammatory response, less severe reperfusion injury and smaller infarcts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that pre-reperfusion administration of i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  metoprolol to AMI patients significantly reduces the incidence of MVO, and moreover that metoprolol inhibits deleterious neutrophil inflammatory responses both in patients and in animal models of IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The infarct-limiting effect of metoprolol is abolished in neutrophil-depleted mice and when neutrophils are prevented from interacting with platelets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The beneficial effects of metoprolol are also abolished by genetic ablation of Adrb1 and are rescued by restitution of Adrb1 expression only in haematopoietic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results identify the neutrophil dynamics as the target of the cardioprotective effect of metoprolol against myocardial IR injury.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Intravenous metoprolol reduces MVO in AMI patients', 'The METOCARD-CNIC trial recruited patients with an ongoing acute ST-segment elevation AMI and randomized them to receive i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  metoprolol (15 mg) or control before reperfusion18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 220 AMI patients underwent a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging exam 1 week after AMI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the potential mechanisms underlying the infarct-limiting effect of metoprolol9, we analysed the 1-week CMR data to evaluate the extent of MVO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MVO was defined as the absence of contrast wash-in inside the delayed gadolinium-enhanced area19, and was quantified as grams of left ventricle (LV) (Fig 1a,b and Supplementary Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patients treated with metoprolol during ongoing AMI had a 40% lower extent of MVO (Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This significant effect was maintained after adjusting for factors potentially affecting MVO by performing linear multiple regression analysis and including sex, age, ischaemia duration, diabetes, and use of thrombectomy or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors as covariates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude the possibility that this effect simply reflected the reduction in total infarct size9, MVO was further assessed as a percentage of the infarcted area (total late gadolinium enhanced area).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metoprolol-treated patients had 24% less infarct-normalized MVO than control patients (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, the extent of MVO was significantly associated with poor long-term outcome, evaluated as chronic ventricular performance (Supplementary Fig 1c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data suggest that MVO reduction might be involved in the cardioprotective effect of metoprolol administration in patients during ongoing AMI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Metoprolol administration during ongoing AMI reduces MVO in patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) METOCARD-CNIC trial scheme: patients with ongoing ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) were recruited and randomized to receive metoprolol (15 mg i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  doses) or control before reperfusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A total of 220 patients were evaluated for MVO by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging 1 week after AMI and 202 patients for an additional CMR at long-term LVEF 6 months after AMI for ventricular function assessment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Representative CMR exams (short-axis covering the entire left ventricle (LV) from base to apex), showing significant differences in 1-week MVO between a control patient (left) and a metoprolol-treated patient (right).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lower panels show detailed views of the boxed images, revealing MVO (blue area, automatic quantification), defined as the absence of contrast wash-in inside the delayed gadolinium-enhanced area (red, semiautomatic quantification).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yellow arrowheads indicate MVO in the LV wall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Quantification of MVO in grams of left ventricle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) Quantification of MVO relative to the infarcted area (%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dots represent values for individual patients: 114 in the control group (grey) versus 106 in the metoprolol group (blue).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data are means±s.e.m.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and compared by unpaired Students t-test.Full size image', 'Intravenous metoprolol dampens neutrophilialMVO association in AMI', 'White blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts during an AMI are known to be associated with larger infarct sizes and extensive MVO20,21,22.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We explored these associations in AMI patients from the METOCARD-CNIC trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a significant positive correlation between absolute leukocyte count on admission and the extent of MVO on CMR: the higher the leukocyte count, the larger the extent of MVO (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We further studied the association of the different WBC subpopulations and MVO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, neutrophil count was significantly correlated with the extent of MVO (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, there was no sign of association between other WBC subpopulations and MVO: lymphocyte, monocyte, eosinophil or platelet counts did not correlate with the extent of MVO (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we studied the effect of metoprolol on WBCs and on the association between these and MVO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metoprolol treatment was not associated with any different in WBC count nor in any WBC subpopulation (Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, we found a significant interaction between metoprolol treatment and the correlation between leukocyte count and MVO: the significant positive correlation between neutrophil count and the extent of MVO was only present in control patients (that is, not receiving metoprolol); in patients receiving i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  metoprolol before reperfusion there was no sign of association between total leukocyte or neutrophil counts and the extent of MVO (Fig 2c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results suggest that the administration of i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  metoprolol during ongoing AMI do not affect the circulating levels of WBCs but modulates the impact of neutrophils on MVO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Metoprolol abrogates neutrophil count positive association with extent of MVO.Sensitivity analysis of the association between MVO and leukocyte and subpopulations count on admission from METOCARD-CNIC trial patients.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Association between MVO and absolute leukocyte or neutrophil count on admission.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Grey dots represent individual values and line linear relationship.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c,d) Linear regression comparison between MVO and leukocytes and neutrophils in the subsets of METOCARD patients indicating loss of correlation in the metoprolol treated group (green) as compared to control group (white).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P, stands for interaction P value.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Association between MVO and rest of white blood cells subpopulations: Platelets, lymphocytes, eosinophils and monocytes showing no correlation in the extent of MVO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  P stands for P value and R, for Pearsons correlation coefficient.Full size image', 'Metoprolol blunts neutrophil infiltration in experimental IR', 'To identify the factors underlying the metoprolol-induced reduction in MVO within the reperfused myocardium, we examined a mouse model of in vivo myocardial IR injury (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the observed modulator effect of i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  metoprolol in the association between neutrophil count and MVO in patients suffering an AMI, we focused our attention into this cell population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first tested the infarct-limiting effect of metoprolol in wild-type mice by occluding the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery for 45 min followed by reperfusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mice were randomized to receive a single i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  bolus (50 l) of metoprolol (10 mM) or vehicle (saline) 35 min after ischaemia onset (10 min before reperfusion).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Infarct size was evaluated at 24 h reperfusion by TTC staining and normalized to area at risk (AAR, negative Evans blue staining).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metoprolol-treated mice had significantly smaller infarcts (as % of AAR) than vehicle-treated mice (Fig 3bd).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Next, we examined mice carrying a GFP reporter in myeloid derived cells (LysM-GFP).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  LysM-GFP mice underwent the myocardial IR procedure and were randomized to receive i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  metoprolol or vehicle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Capillary obliteration (a histological surrogate for MVO) and leukocyte infiltration were quantified at 6 h post-reperfusion (Fig 3em).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metoprolol administration during ongoing AMI resulted in a significant reduction of capillary obliteration by circulatory cell plugins when evaluated at 6 h post-reperfusion (Fig 3e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Confocal microscopy analyses revealed a significant reduction in the number of myeloid cells plugins (LysM-GFP+ particles) and percentage of LysM-GFP+ area within the LV sections, indicating rapid inhibition of leukocyte recruitment and protection of lumen vessel patency (Fig 3g, Supplementary Fig 2ad and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Temporal (6 and 24 h) evaluation of myeloid-derived cells infiltration into injured myocardium showed a persistent abrogation of neutrophil infiltration (Fig 3hm and Supplementary Movie 2) and a differential relative proportion of different myeloid cells in hearts from metoprolol and vehicle-treated mice (Fig 3j and Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mouse experiments confirm the clinical findings that pre-reperfusion metoprolol administration during ongoing AMI limits infarct size and reduces MVO, and further show that metoprolol reduces neutrophil infiltration, suggesting neutrophils as a potential target in this cardioprotective effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Metoprolol reduces neutrophil infiltration and capillary obliteration in murine IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Mouse model of myocardial IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b, c) Histological evaluation of left ventricle (LV) area at risk (AAR) and infarct size (IS) in mice subjected to IR and randomized to receive metoprolol (blue) or vehicle (white);

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Early metoprolol administration during AMI, given as an adjunct to mechanical reperfusion has been shown to reduce infarct size and ameliorate post-infarction severe cardiac dysfunction11,38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defining the mechanisms underlying this cardioprotection is therefore of great medical relevance since more efficient and specific protective strategies could be identified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ability of ADRB1 selective blockers to reduce infarct size was tested decades ago in several clinical trials, but the results were inconclusive1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, most of these early studies were performed in the context of non-reperfused AMI.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The advent of reperfusion as the treatment of choice for AMI changed the mode of myocardial death: from unrelieved ischaemia to a combination of ischaemia and reperfusion processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore the potential cardioprotective effects of ADRB1 selective blockers needed to be revisited in light of the current evidence of IR injury during AMI (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of metoprolol to reduce infarct size in the context of reperfused AMI was recently evaluated in the METOCARD-CNIC trial.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this trial, early i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  metoprolol administration during ongoing AMI resulted in a significant reduction of infarct size9,39, and also significantly reduced the incidence of severe ventricular dysfunction and heart failure readmissions10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Large animal studies conducted before the METOCARD-CNIC trial showed that metoprolol reduces infarct size only when administered before reperfusion40,41, suggesting that metoprolol might reduce infarct size by inhibiting reperfusion injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The early studies, testing the infarct-limiting properties of metoprolol in non-reperfused AMI, were undertaken under the hypothesis that ADRB1-blockers would reduce the extent of damage by a direct effect on cardiomyocytes via reducing oxygen consumption.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although our large animal study40 did not investigate the mechanism of metoprolol-mediated protection, it did show that oxygen consumption was similar in metoprolol- and vehicle-treated pigs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the infarct-size reduction in metoprolol-treated pigs was associated with reduced myeloperoxidase activity in the post-ischaemic myocardium 24 h after reperfusion41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings challenged the idea that metoprolol could reduce cardiac damages simply by reducing myocardial oxygen consumption directly in the heart and prompted us to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying the reperfusion-related injury-limiting effect of metoprolol during IR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'There is ample evidence supporting the critical implication of neutrophils in IR injury4,25,27,29,42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Neutrophils have two deleterious effects in this context.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, neutrophils and neutrophilplatelet plugs occlude microvessels, preventing efficient tissue perfusion: MVO.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, neutrophils adhering to the newly reperfused injured vessels infiltrate the myocardium1, prompting deleterious processes associated with reperfusion25,33.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our study confirms these associations in AMI patients: neutrophil count positively correlated with the extent of MVO as evaluated by state-of-the-art MRI 1 week after reperfusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There exist weak pre-existing evidence linking the action of metoprolol to neutrophils, including reductions in post-IR myeloperoxidase activity in pig myocardium41 and rat spinal cord44, and inhibition of sepsis-induced inflammation in mice45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The data here presented from patients randomized in a controlled clinical trial are the first human evidence linking metoprolol with altered neutrophil behaviour in vivo.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the strong positive correlation between neutrophil count and MVO was abolished in patients receiving i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  metoprolol before reperfusion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that metoprolol-treated patients high neutrophil count was not associated with the extent of MVO suggests an altered neutrophil dynamics during acute injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Some preclinical studies have suggested an association between metoprolol exposure and altered neutrophil dynamics41,44,45; however, the cellular mechanism responsible for this effect has remained unknown.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results from the in vitro transwell migration assays confirm previous studies showing the ability of metoprolol to inhibit migration of isolated neutrophils46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, our in vitro data confirm previous studies showing that metoprolol was able to inhibit ROS production from neutrophils47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our in vitro results showing migration inhibition by metoprolol are reinforced by the acute in vivo murine peritonitis model, in which a single metoprolol i.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  injection abrogates neutrophil infiltration into the peritoneal cavity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the studies with Adrb1KO mice provide evidence for a critical involvement of the ADRB1 axis in the effects of metoprolol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the transwell assays, metoprolol had no effect on the migration of Adrb1KO neutrophils, and in the peritonitis assay, the inhibitory effect of metoprolol on neutrophil infiltration was lost in Adrb1KO mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The rescue of this inhibitory effect in chimeric animals in which Adrb1 is expressed only in circulating cells demonstrates that the cellular target of metoprolol action is of haematopoietic origin, and rules out an involvement of other compartments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the findings in the peritonitis model were confirmed in the myocardial IR model, with metoprolol significantly reducing neutrophil infiltration into the injured myocardium of wild-type but not Adrb1KO mice, and rescue of the protective effect in the Adrb1KO after wild-type BM transplant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we ruled out any involvement of ADRB2 on the effect exerted by metoprolol.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results demonstrate the essential role of neutrophil ADRB1 blockade in the protective effect of metoprolol against myocardial IR injury.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data are in discrepancy with a prior study suggesting that metoprolol abrogated neutrophil migration in vitro in an apparently ADRB1-independent manner46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that study authors reported that metoprolol was able to inhibit neutrophil migration even in the presence of the -adrenergic receptor agonist orciprenaline, while in our study we have used a genetic ablation toll (that is, Adrb1KO mice), which ensures the absence of ADRB1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Upon acute injury, neutrophils recruited to injured vessels initiate inflammation by scanning for activated platelets present in the circulation, establishing interactions with them through PSGL1 exposed on neutrophil protrusions8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The IVM confocal imaging analysis demonstrated that metoprolol prevents the exposure of functional PSGL1 clusters, which are essential for interaction with platelets.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These events correlated with alterations in neutrophil properties essential for infiltration, including migratory velocity and directionality.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In agreement with these data, in the mouse myocardial IR model, metoprolol altered neutrophil 3D structure and reduced the numbers of neutrophilplatelet co-aggregates that occluded myocardial vessels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inability of metoprolol to provide additional protection after blockade of neutrophilplatelet interactions with the anti-PSGL1 mAB is compelling evidence for interference in this interaction as the mechanism underlying the infarct-limiting action of metoprolol during myocardial IR in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The demonstration that metoprolol inhibits neutrophilplatelet interactions in healthy volunteers and ACS patients suggests that this mechanism also operates in humans.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There is controversy on the direct effect of metoprolol on platelet aggregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some studies suggested that metoprolol was able to inhibit ADP- and epinephrine-mediated platelet aggregation48, but recent studies did not show any anti-platelet effect of metoprolol49.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with the latter evidence, in our study we found that metoprolol had no effect on platelet aggregation or in platelet activation in healthy volunteers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data strongly suggest that the inhibitory effect of metoprolol on neutrophilplatelet co-aggregates was driven by a direct effect on neutrophils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In our flow cytometry studies we defined a positive neutrophilplatelet interaction as CD14neg, CD45+, CD61+ particles.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted that there are more specific neutrophil markers and thus our selection is a limitation of these experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, given that all data (human and mouse) point to the same direction, we think this limitation did not have an impact on the conclusions obtained in these experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The role of neutrophils in experimental IR injury is well established; however, the negative results of clinical trials with anti-inflammatory therapies (for example, C5a (refs 50, 51), CD-18 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  52)) dampened hopes for this pharmacological strategy3, and suggested that parallel mechanisms driving myocardial injury were at play.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The demonstration that neutrophil dynamics in general and neutrophilplatelet interactions in particular are the target for the protective actions of metoprolol administered to patients during AMI reinstates neutrophils as a potential target for the therapeutic reduction of infarct size.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
