Iron isotopic fractionation between silicate mantle and metallic core at high pressure  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The +0.1 elevated 56Fe/54Fe ratio of terrestrial basalts relative to chondrites was proposed to be a fingerprint of core-mantle segregation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the extent of iron isotopic fractionation between molten metal and silicate under high pressuretemperature conditions is poorly known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that iron forms chemical bonds of similar strengths in basaltic glasses and iron-rich alloys, even at high pressure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the measured mean force constants of iron bonds, we calculate an equilibrium iron isotope fractionation between silicate and iron under core formation conditions in Earth of 00.02, which is small relative to the +0.1 shift of terrestrial basalts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This result is unaffected by small amounts of nickel and candidate core-forming light elements, as the isotopic shifts associated with such alloying are small.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study suggests that the variability in iron isotopic composition in planetary objects cannot be due to core formation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Iron, as one of the most abundant non-volatile elements in the Solar System, plays a major role in every stage of planetary formation and differentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Much information can be gained on these processes by studying iron isotopic variations1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A striking feature of the Earth is the manner in which it is stratified into a core dominated by metallic Fe0, a mantle that is rich in ferrous Fe2+, and surface oxidative environments where iron is found mostly as ferric Fe3+ (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Understanding how this stratification was established has important bearing on several questions in Earth and planetary sciences, such as the nature of the material accreted by the Earth as a function of time10,11 and the cause for the Great Oxygenation Event12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The abundance and redox state of iron in Earths mantle reflects the redox conditions that prevailed during and after core formation13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Iron isotopes add a new dimension to this system but progress in interpreting Fe isotope variations has been hampered by the paucity of equilibrium isotopic fractionation factors under the PT conditions relevant to core formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs), which constitute the bulk of Earths oceanic crust, are enriched in the heavy isotopes of iron by +0.1 relative to chondrites (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6; 56Fe is the deviation in permil of the 56Fe/54Fe ratio relative to the IRMM-014 standard, whose composition is indistinguishable from chondrites).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, basalts from Mars and Vesta have the same 56Fe value as chondrites within uncertainty2,4,5,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The non-chondritic Fe isotope composition of terrestrial basalts has been interpreted as resulting from iron vaporization into space during the Moon-forming giant impact2, high-temperature and high-pressure equilibrium fractionation between metal and silicate during core formation7,8, or iron isotopic fractionation during partial mantle melting to produce Earths crust17,18,19,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supporting the last explanation is the observation that mantle peridotites have an iron isotopic composition that is close to that of chondrites17,19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mantle peridotites are imperfect proxies of the mantle composition, as they have been affected by partial melting and metasomatism17,21,22, which can fractionate Fe isotopes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To test the core-mantle segregation mechanism and set constraints on the conditions of core formation, it is critical to know how iron isotopes are partitioned at equilibrium between metal and silicate under conditions relevant to core formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies have investigated metal-silicate Fe isotopic fractionation at high temperature and relatively low pressure, reaching the conclusion that the fractionation would be negligible23,24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, pressure is an important intensive parameter that affects the strength of iron bonds and the structure of silicates, so iron isotopic fractionation between silicate and metal might differ at high pressure7,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Polyakov7 used previously published results from nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy (NRIXS) to conclude that the equilibrium iron isotopic fractionation between metallic iron and silicate post-perovskite under Earths core-mantle boundary conditions may be sufficiently large to impart a measurable isotopic shift to the mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The NRIXS data used to support this claim are of insufficient precision at the low- and high-energy ends of the spectrum to derive reliable force constant values20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, silicate post-perovskite would not be stable in the hot lowermost mantle of early Earth26 and its role in setting the present Fe isotopic signature of MORBs is uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Shahar et al.25 investigated iron isotope fractionation between bridgmanite and iron alloys (FeO, FeHx and Fe3C) at pressures relevant to core formation in a typical magma ocean setting, up to 60 GPa, by using NRIXS spectroscopy complemented by theoretical calculations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They found that the effect of pressure on iron isotopic composition is different among iron-light element alloys investigated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, the 56Fe value of the current terrestrial mantle would be fractionated by +0.02 relative to the bulk Earth composition for a pure iron core and this fractionation would increase to +0.04 for an FeHx or Fe3C core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hydrogen and carbon are, however, unlikely major light element candidates in Earths core27,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oxygen is more probable but Shahar et al.25 showed that it would induce a limited shift in the Fe isotopic composition of the mantle (+0.02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The studies done so far have focused on crystalline phases as analogues to the magma ocean silicate melt7,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the effects of Si, S (two of the major light element candidates in the Earths core) and Ni alloying with Fe on iron isotopic fractionation remain uncertain.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is crucial to examine iron isotopic fractionation between silicate glasses of basaltic composition and iron-rich alloys of Fe-Ni-Si, Fe-Si and Fe-S, to evaluate whether core formation could have fractionated the iron isotopic composition of Earths mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we report the experimental determination of the mean force constant  of iron bonds in synthetic samples of basaltic glass, metallic iron and iron-rich alloys of Fe-Ni-Si, Fe-Si and Fe-S up to 206 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that all  values increase with pressure, and that the  values of silicate glass are comparable to those of metal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results suggest that the interplanetary variability in iron isotopic composition cannot be due to core formation.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

#@NEW_LINE#@#  Conventional Mössbauer spectroscopic data, electron microprobe analyses and NRIXS data collected on the basaltic glass at ambient conditions were reported elsewhere20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Metal iron and the iron-based alloys were examined by X-ray diffraction and most were in a body-centred cubic structure at ambient conditions, except for Fe3S, which was in the tetragonal structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reported  values for Fe92Ni8, Fe85Si15 and Fe3S are based on newly acquired NRIXS data combined with previous data from Lin et al.34,35, who did not report the  values for Fe92Ni8 and Fe85Si15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For previously acquired data, the uncertainties on the  values are large due to the relatively narrow energy scans acquired, as those studies focused on the determination of the Debye sound velocity for seismological applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although the phases relevant to core formation conditions are molten, direct measurements of vibrational properties on silicate and metallic liquids under ultrahigh pressure conditions are currently beyond experimental capabilities.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Still, the behaviours of silicate melts under high PT conditions can be understood by examining silicate glasses, because both exhibit similar microscopic and macroscopic properties29,30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the inelastic vibrational properties of silicate glasses are close to their molten counterparts36 and changes in the SiO coordination number of molten basalt are in excellent agreement with those observed in silica glass at pressures up to 60 GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  37).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, for lack of better alternatives, crystalline iron is often used as proxy for molten iron in deep Earth studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Molten iron is described as a simple close-packed liquid38 and exhibits comparable density and compressibility relative to its solid phase under core conditions39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a first pass on this question and following Polyakov7 and Shahar et al.25, we take the  values of iron bonds in solid Fe and Fe-rich alloys to be proxies of those in their liquid counterparts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We use new data for the most relevant candidate light elements Si and S, and for the main alloying element Ni, together with literature data for FeHx, Fe3C and FeO alloys from Shahar et al.25, to fully evaluate how alloying and light elements affect iron -factors of pure iron under high-P, T conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'High-T harmonic extrapolation', 'Measurements of the force constant of iron bonds at room temperature were used to calculate the iron -factors using equation (1), which assumes harmonic behaviour7,20,25,32,40 (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At the high temperatures relevant to core formation on Earth, the iron -factors could be affected by anharmonic effects, but such effects may be largely suppressed by the associated high pressures7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, theoretical caculations25,41,42,43 support the validity of the harmonic approximation for calculation of -factors at high temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For instance, the correction on the iron -factors between 0 K and mantle temperatures is thought to be negligible25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NRIXS predictions have previously been shown to be in agreement with independent determination of equilibrium fractionation factors based on mass spectrometry analyses of coexisting phases thought to have achieved equilibrium.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is the case for magnetite and olivine at 8731,073 K (refs 40, 44).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is also the case for basaltic glass and iron, for which NRIXS data20 agree with equilibration experiments performed in the molten silicate-metal system at 1,573 K and 1 GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  24), and 2,273 K and 7.7 GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These agreements support the use of solid phases (silicate glass and crystalline alloys) as proxies for melts.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The temperature of metal-silicate equilibration in the early Earth is uncertain, because it is usually calculated from the pressure of equilibration assuming that Earths mantle was close to the liquidus temperature of the silicate.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The liquidus temperature itself is uncertain and it is possible that the silicate mantle was superheated in the aftermath of giant impacts, so that the temperatures were higher than those given by the liquidus48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous studies on the partitioning behaviour of moderately siderophile elements constrain the pressuretemperature conditions for high-pressure core formation in the Earth to be 4060 GPa and 3,0004,000 K, possibly accompanying deep magma oceans extending to  greater than 1,000 km depth45,46,47.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the Earth, 87% of the iron inventory is in the core, meaning that the silicate-metal equilibrium fractionation would be expressed in the mantle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Assuming a chondritic bulk Earth composition, the shift imposed on the mantle 56Fe value by core formation would depend on the alloy composition (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 4: Predicted shifts in the iron isotopic composition of the silicate mantle due to core formation.Schematics for 56Fe isotope signatures in the bulk silicate Earth (primitive mantle) with regard to varying compositional models of Earths core.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The segregating metal was assumed to equilibrate with the silicate mantle at the base of the magma ocean at 50 GPa and 3,500 K based on refs 45, 46, 47.Full size image', 'The theoretically derived iron -factor of bridgmanite obtained by Shahar et al.25 are larger by 20% than the -factor measured on the basaltic glass at 4060 GPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the fractionation values that they calculated were systematically heavier than ours by 0.010.02 at approximately 4060 GPa and 3,500 K. For instance, for the Fe-C core model, the calculated 56FeMantle value is +0.010.03 using basaltic glass data from the present study, whereas Shahar et al.25 calculated a 56FeMantle value of +0.030.05 based on first-principles calculations of iron -factor of bridgmanite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we agree with Shahar et al.25 that FeHx and Fe3C would lead to the largest shifts in 56Fe values, we find that the shift would be smaller than what they predicted by 0.010.02.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Earths core is unlikely to contain much H and C27,28 and the most probable alloying elements, in addition to Ni, are O, Si and S. Our results agree with the conclusion by Shahar et al.25 that FeO alloy would induce a negligible shift in the 56Fe value of the mantle (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An important conclusion of the present work is that other alloys of Fe-S, Fe-Si and Fe-Ni-Si would also produce minimal isotopic fractionation in the silicate mantle relative to the bulk Earth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The inferred core-mantle Fe isotopic fraction at 4060 GPa and 3,0004,000 K for O, Si and S alloys is approximately five to ten times smaller than the observed Fe isotope composition for MORBs (56Fe of +0.1 relative to chondrites)6.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results thus indicate that high-pressure mantle-core equilibration cannot be responsible for the heavy Fe isotopic composition measured in basalts (Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, our results reveal that the Fe isotopic composition of the mantle is representative of the bulk Earth and provides a baseline with which to compare the composition of extraterrestrial samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Our results also have some bearing on the iron isotopic compositions of rocks from Mars (SNC meteorites), Vesta (HED meteorites) and the angrite parent body.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The PT conditions of core formation in those planetary bodies are inferred to be 6 GPa1,900 K for Mars49, 0.0001 GPa1,873 K for Vesta49 and  less_than 0.5 GPa2,173 K for the angrite parent body50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under these conditions, we calculate that as on Earth, the equilibrium iron isotopic fractionation should be small ( less_than 0.02).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even if significant S is present in cores of these bodies, the results for Fe3S indicate that the fractionation would be minimal.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is consistent with the fact that SNC and HED meteorites have near-chondritic Fe isotopic compositions2,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It does not explain, however, the heavy Fe isotopic composition of angrites (+0.1 relative to chondrites)51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that case, other interpretations must be sought, which based on Si isotope systematics may involve isotopic fractionation during condensation in the solar nebula52 or impact-induced vaporization53.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The emerging picture from this study supports the notion that core formation of planetary bodies in the Solar System is unlikely to fractionate significantly stable isotope ratios for elements such as Si, Cr and Fe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other processes such as gassolid fractionation in the nebula, impact-induced vaporization, or magma generation must be responsible for explaining the isotopic diversity of terrestrial and extraterrestrial rocks.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
