Telomeric RNAs are essential to maintain telomeres  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Telomeres are transcribed generating long non-coding RNAs known as TERRA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deciphering the role of TERRA has been one of the unsolved issues of telomere biology in the past decade.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This has been, in part, due to lack of knowledge on the TERRA loci, thus preventing functional genetic studies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we describe that long non-coding RNAs with TERRA features are transcribed from the human 20q and Xp subtelomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of the 20q locus by using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology causes a dramatic decrease in TERRA levels, while deletion of the Xp locus does not result in decreased TERRA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Strikingly, 20q-TERRA ablation leads to dramatic loss of telomere sequences and the induction of a massive DNA damage response.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings identify chromosome 20q as a main TERRA locus in human cells and represent the first demonstration in any organism of the essential role of TERRA in the maintenance of telomeres.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'TERRA transcripts are nuclear long non-coding RNAs that are transcribed from the subtelomere towards the telomere1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, giving rise to transcripts that contain UUAGGG-repeats, being the presence of this repeat their main features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They are also heterogeneous in size (0.210 kb in humans and mice) as indicated by the smear detected in TERRA northern blots1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, detection of TERRA by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) renders a clear spotted pattern in the nucleus and the number of spots varies in different cell types.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Approximately 30% of these spots co-localize with telomeres1,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Lack of TERRAs subtelomeric sequence information has been an important shortcoming to understand the role of TERRA, as most the functional studies published to date are based on the use of the UUAGGG-tract to detect TERRA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, TERRAs have been implicated in telomere protection3,4,5, heterochromatin formation4, telomere replication by sequestering hnRNPA1 from telomeres to allow RPA-to Pot1 switching, a process that it is altered in alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) cells lacking ATRX6,7, and in telomere elongation by homologous recombination through the formation of DNA-TERRA hybrids8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TERRAs are also proposed to bind the telomerase core components, TERC and TERT, but their role in telomerase function is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On one hand, TERRA can inhibit telomerase activity in vitro2,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, in yeast, TERRAs are induced at short telomeres and form TERRA-TERC RNA clusters that co-localize with the telomere of origin during S phase, suggesting that TERRA may play a role in the spatial organization of telomerase activity at telomeres11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In yeast, several TERRA transcription start sites have been identified at different chromosome ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the mouse, by using a genome wide RNA-seq approach, we recently identified that transcripts showing bona fide TERRA features mainly arise from the chromosome 18 subtelomere, and to a lesser extent from the subtelomere of chromosome 9 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we found that chromosome 18-TERRA associate in trans with the remaining telomeres and are important for telomere protection3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TERRA loci in human cells have been more elusive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, a putative TERRA promoter was proposed to consist of a 61-29-37 repeat (a conserved region that contains three different repetitive DNA tracts of 61, 29 and 37-bp), which is present at 20 different chromosomes12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, transcript sizes and their regulation were not identical to those of TERRA, suggesting that they may constitute a fraction of TERRA molecules12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More recently, a similar RNA-seq approach to that used by us in mice, identified 10 distinct human chromosome ends where putative TERRA transcription started as far as 510 kb away from the telomere, as well as eight additional chromosome ends where transcription started in close proximity to the telomere13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The authors, however, did not address whether these transcripts showed TERRA features, defined as the presence of UUAGGG-repeats within their sequence, their heterogeneity in size and the nuclear spotted pattern in which some spots co-localize with the telomere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we study whether these human transcripts have the above-mentioned TERRA features with the final goal of functionally deleting them to unveil the role of TERRA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, out of the 18 proposed TERRA loci in humans, only transcripts arising from 20q and Xp loci have TERRA features.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then used the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to genetically delete these two potential TERRA loci in humans to study whether they are indeed the origin of TERRA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only deletion of the 20q locus caused a dramatic decrease in TERRA levels, while deletion of the Xp locus did not result in decreased TERRA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, deletion of the 20q-TERRA locus leads to telomere shortening and telomere uncapping as indicated by increased telomere damage foci or TIFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These unprecedented findings demonstrate that TERRA transcripts are essential for the maintenance of a functional telomere cap.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Identification of the human TERRA locus', 'A number of subtelomeric transcripts identified in samples that underwent UUAGGG-transcript enrichment have been recently proposed to represent the human TERRA transcriptome, although further confirmation that these transcripts had TERRA features (see the first section) was lacking13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These RNAs arose from 10 distinct chromosome ends where transcription started as far as 510 kb upstream of the subtelomere-telomere boundary (referred here as 10-kb TERRA) and from 8 chromosome ends in which transcription started in close proximity to the telomere (referred here as 1-kb TERRA)13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we set out to study whether these subtelomeric transcripts have indeed TERRA features (see the first section), and if so, to generate functional knock-outs by using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With this approach, we aimed to unravel the role of TERRA in human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'First, we studied the genetic structure of the different identified sequences by aligning them against two different human assemblies, the UCSC human browser GRch37/hg19 and the subtelomeric specific assembly14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Bioinformatic analysis revealed that 83.3% of these transcripts arise from DNA regions that are structurally conserved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the 10-kb TERRA loci contain three different conserved DNA elements, a repetitive region known as TAR1 (UCSC RepeatMasker track; Smit AFA, Hubley R, Green P. RepeatMasker Open-3.0, www.Repeatmasker.Org.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  19962010) and two additional conserved DNA regions which encode for two long non-coding RNA families of pseudogenes derived from the primate genes WASH and DDX11 (refs 15, 16), respectively (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From now on, we will refer to these three conserved DNA regions as TAR1, WASH and DDX regions/loci, and to the transcripts arising from these regions as TAR1, WASH and DDX transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 1-kb TERRA contained only the TAR1 repetitive region (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surprisingly, the DDX region is transcribed in the opposite direction from what expected for a TERRA transcript15,16 (TERRA is transcribed from the subtelomere towards the telomere)1, thus suggesting that they are not likely to correspond to TERRA (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, transcripts arising from the subtelomeres of chromosomes 1p, 9p, 12p, 15q, 16p, 19p, Xq are unlikely to be bona fide TERRAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Transcripts arising from the subtelomere of chromosomes 20q and Xp co-localize with TERRA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Schematic of the three motifs in the structurally conserved TERRA loci proposed in Porro et al.,13, the repetitive region TAR1 and the two lncRNA families, DDX11L and WASH.

and northern blot probes against the transcripts arising from each of the DNA structurally conserved regions, TAR1, DDX and WASH (Fig 1c) and compared their signals to that of a probe detecting the TERRAs-UUAGGG-tract, as it is the TERRA main feature (see the first section).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sequence degeneration at subtelomeres allowed us to simultaneously detect transcripts arising from various subtelomeres (see probe specificity in Supplementary Tables 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In double RNA-FISH experiments, we failed to see co-localization of sense (S) and antisense (AS) probes against TAR1, DDX and WASH RNAs with transcripts detected with the TERRAs-UUAGGG probe (Supplementary Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Sense and antisense probes were used since TAR1, DDX and WASH transcripts are not transcribed with the same orientation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, probes against TAR1 transcripts rendered a strong cytoplasmic signal, in contrast to the known nuclear localization of TERRA transcripts (Supplementary Fig 1A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, in the case of the DDX locus, whose transcripts are transcribed in the opposite direction than what is expected for a TERRA transcript, we failed to see co-localization with TERRA when using either the sense or the antisense DDX probes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As control, RNAse treatment erased all these different RNA-FISH signals confirming the specificity of the different probes to defect RNA and not DNA (Supplementary Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using the northern blot analysis, we confirmed that transcripts arising from the TAR1, DDX and WASH loci did not show the expected TERRA pattern (Supplementary Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, we did not detect any specific signal from the TAR1 probe, only the unspecific cross-hybridization with the 18S and 28S rRNAs (Supplementary Fig 1C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Next, we took advantage of the known effect of DNA methylation on regulating human TERRA levels to evaluate TERRA features in WASH, TAR1 and DDX transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, DNA demethylating agents are known to increase human TERRA levels12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we studied TERRA levels in the HCT116, Hela and U2OS human cell lines before and after treatment with the demethylating agent 5 azacytidine (Aza), as well as in HCT116 cells double deficient for DNMT1 and DNMT3b (double knockout, DKO cells) as a positive control17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In marked contrast to TERRA transcripts, which were upregulated on Aza treatment, we failed to see induction of DDX, WASH and TAR1 transcripts on Aza treatment (Supplementary Fig 1C,D), indicating that they do not show the expected TERRA behaviour12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As none of the transcripts arising from the DNA structurally conserved loci TAR1, DDX and WASH showed features of TERRA (see the first section), we next studied the TERRA properties in the transcripts arising from the remaining non-conserved loci located at chromosomes 17p, 20q and Xp, which also showed read enrichment in the described TERRA-IP13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in double RNA-FISH experiments, we found co-localization of transcripts arising from 20q and Xp subtelomeres with TERRA transcripts (detected with a probe against TERRAs-UUAGGG), suggesting that they could correspond to genuine TERRA transcripts (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, 40% of signal spots from the 20q locus co-localized with TERRA signals, reaching 60% in the case of the Xp locus (Fig 1d, top graph).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  From the total TERRA spots, 40% co-localized with spots from either 20q or Xp loci (Fig 1d, bottom graph).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transcripts arising from the 17p locus, however, did not show co-localization with TERRA transcripts (Fig 1d), thus ruling out that they contribute to TERRA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the co-localizations were counted as positive only when detected in the individual confocal layers (see graphs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Apparent co-localizations between Chr17-RNAs and TERRA in the representative images of Fig 1d were not counted, as they are the result of a visual effect of image superposition of individual confocal layers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Real co-localization events for Chr20q and Xp-RNAs with TERRA are indicated with arrowheads and were detected in individual confocal layers (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As control, RNAse treatment also erased these RNA-FISH signals, thus confirming the specificity of the different probes (Supplementary Fig 1B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transcripts arising from the 20q locus are bona fide TERRA', 'To further demonstrate that transcripts arising from 20q and Xp loci are genuine TERRA transcripts, we set to genetically delete the loci from which they are transcribed by using the CRISPR-Cas9 system in the HCT116, Hela and U2OS human cancer cell lines, as well as in the non-transformed IMR90 human fibroblast cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, we performed a detailed transcriptional analysis of the regions to be deleted (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previously reported chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq data showed the presence of active RNA polymerase II and CTCF binding sites at both the 20q and Xp loci14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we assessed the presence of promoter activity in these regions by cloning different fragments upstream of the RNA-seq read enriched regions into promoter-free luciferase reporter vectors (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a strong promoter activity for the 20q locus in the vicinity of the telomere (region Pr1) and to a lower extent in a region 4.7-kb away from the telomere (region Pr2) both in HCT116 and U2OS human cell lines (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The p21 promoter was included as positive control (Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the Xp locus, we were unable to clone fragments of interest to assess its promoter activity owing to the highly repetitive content of this region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Collectively, these findings confirm strong transcriptional activity within the 20q locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Deletion of the 20q-TERRA locus in different human cell lines

Supplementary Fig3A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, we were unable to isolate viable clones with deletions in either 20q or Xp in both Hela and HCT116 cell lines, indicative of strong lethality of the deletions (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only in the case of U2OS cells, we were able to expand three clones out of six bearing the 20q-deletion (only six clones were expanded from the original 37 KO clones obtained; Table 1) and one clone out of four with the Xp deletion, which were confirmed to be homozygous both by PCR and by Sanger sequencing (clones A2, B4 and C4 for the 20q locus and clone D8 for the Xp) (Fig 2e,f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The smear observed in the detection of the CRISPR-Cas9 alleles in clones A2 and B4 can be resolved in two distinct bands (Supplementary Fig 3B) and it is due to two different deletions in each of the alleles of these clones within the 20q locus (see sequences displayed in Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we observed that U2OS cells display higher basal levels of TERRA compared with Hela and HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig 1B,C), which may explain the differential effects of TERRA abrogation on cell viability of the three different human cell lines studied.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Table 1 Number and percentage of clones obtained for each genotype on deletion of the 20q and Xp loci with the CRISPR-Cas9 system.Full size table', 'Next, we checked the expression of total TERRA levels by RNA dot-blot and northern blot in the individual clones deleted for the 20q and Xp loci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of the 20q locus resulted in a dramatic reduction in total TERRA levels in all three clones isolated from U2OS cells (see clones A2, B4 and C4 deleted for the 20q locus in Fig 3a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, deletion of the Xp locus did not result in changes in total TERRA expression (Fig 3a,b; Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The lack of TERRA downregulation as the result of the Xp deletion, may indicate that this is not a major locus for TERRA production in human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, this may be related to the fact that the region deleted in the Xp locus was smaller than that deleted in the 20q locus, owing the impossibility to design gRNAs in the vicinity of the Xp telomere due to its highly repetitive nature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Deletion of the TERRA-20q locus dramatically affects TERRA expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) RNA from the U2OS cells WT or from the three 20q-KO clones (A2, B4 and C4) and the Xp-KO (D8) clone was isolated and used for TERRA detection by RNA dot-blot with a probe against the TERRA-UUAGGG-tract;

probes that detect the TERRAs-UUAGGG-tract also demonstrated a dramatic decrease of the total TERRA spot intensity per nucleus in the 20q locus deleted clones but not in the Xp locus deleted one when compared with wild-type (WT) cells (in Fig 3c,d, left graph).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was paralleled by a significant decrease in TERRA spots per nucleus in the 20q locus deleted clones but not in the Xp deleted one (Fig 3d, right graph).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Downregulation of TERRA levels in the 20q-deleted clones but not in the Xp deleted clone, was also confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Fig 3e; Supplementary Table 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To ascertain whether the changes in TERRA levels and in the phenotype observed (see below) could be due to the presence of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target mutations, we performed TIDE (Tracking of Indels by DEcomposition) analysis for each of the gRNAs used to generate the 20q-deletion (named Start1 and End1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We selected for study the five regions with the highest off-target mutation score but only the first four could be studied because of the impossibility to amplify the fifth region for each gRNA, probably owing to sequence differences between the U2OS genome and the human reference genome (GRCh38/hg38).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The analysis was performed on DNA pools from either WT cells or cells bearing the 20q-deletion, named C3 (from which the clones A2, B4 and C4 were obtained).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We did not find off-target mutations for any of the gRNAs except for the gRNA END1/off-target3 (Supplementary Fig 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To verify whether this off-target mutation was present in the 20q-KO clones A2, B4 and C4, we carried out TIDE analysis on DNA from these clones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 20q-KO clone A2 was free of gRNA END1/off-target3 but the clones B4 and C4 revealed 37% presence of off-target mutations (Supplementary Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unlikely that this was a real off-target mutation (vs the result of poor quality sequencing) because: (i) if an off-target mutation was present in these clones the percentage of off-targets should be 50 or 100% owing to the clonality of the cells, and (ii) comparison with DNAs from cells untreated with CRISPR revealed a similar percentage of off-target mutations (Supplementary Fig 5B).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, to confirm absence of off-target mutations, we performed T7-endonuclease digestion on DNA PCR amplified from the region of interest in both non-CRISPR-treated cells and from the CRISPR 20q-KO pool and clones (pool C3 and clones A2, B4 and C4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a positive control, we used two identical DNAs except for a C to G mutation (DNAs were named C and G).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, two digestion bands were seen in the C+G digestion but no digested bands were observed neither in the C+C digestion nor in the cells that underwent the CRISPR deletion of the 20q locus (pool C3 and clones A2, B4 and C4) (Supplementary Fig 5C).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This assay confirms the absence of off-target 3 in the 20q-KO clones treated with the END1 gRNA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the sequence alignment for the START2/off-target2 and for the END1/off-target4 regions was poor due to technical problems during sequencing because of the presence of long tracks of C or G within the sequences of these regions (Supplementary Figure 5A).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we did not find off-targets mutations in the TIDE analysis of these regions, we further confirmed this finding with the T7-endonuclease assay (Supplementary Figure 5C).

set to assess the impact of the 20q-TERRA locus deletion in telomere length and telomere protection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 4a, deletion of the 20q-TERRA locus resulted in a dramatic loss of telomeric sequences in all three clones (A2, B4 and C4) as seen by a significant decrease in individual telomere fluorescence intensity as determined by quantitative telomere FISH (Q-FISH) on single telomeres from metaphase spreads (see lack of detectable telomere signals in metaphasic chromosomes in Fig 4a, and the dramatic change in the distribution of individual telomere signals), as well as by a significant increase in the percentage of signal-free ends per metaphase and in the percentage of short telomeres as determined by low telomere fluorescence (short telomeres are considered those in the 10% percentile of the total telomere length distribution) (Fig 4a and graphs).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given that U2OS cells lack telomerase activity and elongate telomeres via a telomerase-independent mechanism that relies on homologous recombination, the so-called ALT19,20, we set to address whether the dramatic telomere shortening induced by deletion of 20q-TERRA locus was accompanied by decreased recombination events between telomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To this end, we measured the rates of telomeric sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCE) by using chromosome orientation FISH or CO-FISH21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although we found T-SCE events in all the 20q-TERRA KO U2OS clones, their frequency was significantly decreased compared with the non-deleted U2OS controls (Fig 4b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also observed a significant decrease in telomere-containing double minute chromosomes on 20q-TERRA deletion in all three clones, a chromosomal aberration also associated with ALT (Fig 4c)22.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here, we identified a major locus for human TERRA transcription at the subtelomere of the chromosome 20q.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genetic deletion of this locus allowed us to demonstrate for the first time in any organism the essential role of TERRA in the maintenance of functional telomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In a previous report, eighteen different human subtelomeres were proposed to contain TERRA loci, although the authors did not study whether these transcripts had indeed TERRA features13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we found that only two out of the eighteen loci have TERRA features, in particular, those corresponding to 20q and Xp subtelomeres.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, on genetic deletion of these loci by using CRISPR-Cas9, only the 20q locus was confirmed to be a bona fide TERRA locus since it resulted in almost complete abrogation of TERRA expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Failure to decrease TERRA levels on Xp deletion may be explained by the impossibility to delete the entire Xp locus due to the highly repetitive nature of this region, or may indicate that this is not a bona fide TERRA locus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, our finding that 20q-TERRAs are increased on deletion of the Xp locus, may also explain the fact that Xp deletion did not result in decreased TERRA levels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In any case, the fact that deletion of the 20q locus results in dramatically reduced TERRA levels demonstrates that this locus is a major TERRA locus in human cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, the finding of one (or two at most) TERRA locus in human cells resembles the situation recently described by us in the case of mouse TERRA3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, by using a similar approach to that used in humans (RNA-seq following UUAGGG-transcript enrichment), we identified mouse transcripts arising from thirteen different chromosome ends but only those transcribed from the subtelomere of chromosome 18 and 9 were confirmed to be bona fide TERRA transcripts, being the chromosome 18 locus responsible for the majority of TERRA transcripts3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, both in human and mouse, TERRAs are transcribed from one or two subtelomeres, a finding that was not anticipated since it was widely accepted that TERRA were arising from all chromosome ends.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be deciphered whether TERRA transcripts play different roles depending on the locus of origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, here we describe the first genetic deletion of TERRA performed in any organism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings are striking as they clearly demonstrate an essential role of TERRA in cellular viability as well as in telomere maintenance and telomere capping.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In particular, the impossibility to expand most of the homozygous clones for the 20q-deletion in three independent human cell lines (Hela, HCT116 and U2OS) suggests an essential role of TERRA for cell survival in the majority of cell lines studied here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only the U2OS cell line, which expresses higher basal levels of TERRA (this paper; refs 7, 8), could bear the 20q-deletion suggesting that the cell needs to maintain a minimum amount of TERRA levels to survive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, we found a dramatic loss of telomeric sequences in U2OS cells on deletion of the 20q-TERRA locus, indicating that TERRA is essential for telomere maintenance.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This dramatic telomere shortening was accompanied by telomere uncapping as indicated by increased telomeric damage and increased telomere fusions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, U2OS cells are known to maintain telomeres by homologous recombination, a process in which TERRA has been suggested to participate7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with this, we found detectable but significantly decreased telomere recombination frequencies as indicated by T-SCE frequency.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Together, these results indicate an essential role for TERRA in cellular viability and in the maintenance of telomeres, even in cells that maintain telomeres by recombination.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Interestingly, deletions and amplifications of the 20q subtelomere have been found in patients with different types of hematopoietic malignancies and with mental retardation24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although some of these deletions also include coding genes, it is tempting to speculate a specific role of the 20q-TERRA on these malignancies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, the finding of the human 20q-TERRA locus described here warrants future studies to analyze of a possible association of 20q-TERRA to these and other human diseases.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
