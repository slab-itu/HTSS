A genetic network that suppresses genome rearrangements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and contains defects in cancers  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) play an important role in human diseases, including cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The identity of all Genome Instability Suppressing (GIS) genes is not currently known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here multiple Saccharomyces cerevisiae GCR assays and query mutations were crossed into arrays of mutants to identify progeny with increased GCR rates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  One hundred eighty two GIS genes were identified that suppressed GCR formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Another 438 cooperatively acting GIS genes were identified that were not GIS genes, but suppressed the increased genome instability caused by individual query mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of TCGA data using the human genes predicted to act in GIS pathways revealed that a minimum of 93% of ovarian and 66% of colorectal cancer cases had defects affecting one or more predicted GIS gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These defects included loss-of-function mutations, copy-number changes associated with reduced expression, and silencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, acute myeloid leukaemia cases did not appear to have defects affecting the predicted GIS genes.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genetic instability is seen in most cancers and is thought to play a critical role in the development and progression of tumours1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are two general types of genetic instability seen in cancer2: the accumulation of large numbers of mutations and the accumulation of genome rearrangements such as translocations, copy-number changes and aneuploidy2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The study of cancer susceptibility syndromes like Fanconi Anemia and the BRCA1- and BRCA2-defective breast and ovarian cancer syndromes provided the first evidence for a causal link between defects causing increased genome rearrangements and the development of cancer4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, this understanding is incomplete in part because most relevant studies have focused on a limited number of genes and the lack of genetic screens to identify Genome Instability Suppressing (GIS) genes in mammalian cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Due to the availability of quantitative genetic assays that can detect gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs), genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided considerable information about the spontaneous formation of genome rearrangements6,7,8,9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The observed GCRs depend in part on the features of the specific GCR assay but include (1) terminal deletions healed by de novo telomere addition, (2) monocentric translocations, (3) interstitial deletions and (4) complex GCRs resulting from multiple cycles of rearrangement secondary to the formation of dicentric chromosomes by multiple processes6,7,12,13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, the GCRs observed parallel to those being identified by whole-genome analysis in human diseases including cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, GCR assays have been used to identify genes that prevent GCRs from occurring and genes that act in the formation of GCRs6,7,8,9,10,15,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Even in S. cerevisiae, our knowledge of GIS genes is incomplete.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is in part because most known GIS genes have been identified through limited candidate-gene approaches6,7,8,10,15,18,19,28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Only a small number of additional GIS genes have been identified in systematic screens9,20,21,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reasons for the limited success of these screens include: (1) the use of assays that were not specific for GCRs; (2) the low GCR rates detected in GCR assays are not well suited for large-scale genetic screens; (3) the use of only a single GCR assay; and (4) the lack of analysis of sufficient numbers of interacting mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we used a two-stage screen design in which an in silico approach was used to develop a highly enriched candidate gene list sorted into candidate pathways29 followed by an extensive genetic screen utilizing three different GCR assays and 43 query mutations to identify genes and interacting pairs of genes that act to suppress GCRs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results have provided a much more detailed picture of the genetic network that acts to prevent GCRs than previously available, and analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data30,31,32,33 has suggested that the genes in this network are potentially altered in a large proportion of ovarian and colorectal cancers but not in acute myeloid leukaemia.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Design of the systematic genome instability screen', 'Our strategy for identifying new GIS genes was to generate mutant strains using an adaptation of the Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) method34 and test them for increased genome instability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We crossed a collection of candidate mutant strains (described below) against strains containing one of three GCR assays (GCR query strains; Fig 1a) and against strains containing a GCR assay and one of 43 mutations (GCR+mutation query strains).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 43 GCR+mutation query strains were included in the crosses because some genes are cooperating Genome Instability Suppressing (cGIS) genes in which mutations only affect genome stability when combined with other mutations10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 43 mutations affected known GIS genes and genes that clustered with known GIS genes29 and were selected to maximize the number of gene clusters surveyed (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Details of the systematic screen.(a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The sGCR, dGCR, and tyGCR assays involve simultaneous selection against the CAN1 and URA3 genes inserted into the terminal non-essential region of the left arm of chromosome V. The GCR breakpoint region is the region between the telomeric CAN1 and URA3 genes and the most telomeric essential gene, PCM1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Homologies within the GCR breakpoint regions, including the 100 bp fragment of YCLWdelta5 sequence introduced by can1::PLEU2-NAT, the DSF1/HXT13 segmental duplication, and the inserted Ty912 element, are indicated with grey boxes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The query mutations were primarily selected from the previously described gene clusters 3, 4, 32, 55, and 60 that were generated by clustering the candidate GCR-suppression genes by genetic interactions29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Clusters 3, 4, and 32 had the greatest number of GCR-suppressing genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Triangles indicate the relative size of the cluster in terms of the number of genes, and the darker triangles are the clusters from which query mutations were selected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Query mutations (indicated by the boxes) in non-essential genes in cluster 4 were selected to provide the greatest genetic diversity by picking 1 or 2 mutations from most sub-clusters.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Query mutations were similarly selected from clusters 3 and 32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The semi-quantitative scoring strategy assigns a number between 0 and 5 to each patch depending on the number of papillae (0: no papillae; 1: 15 papillae; 2: 615 papillae; 3: 16- a countable number of papillae (150200); 4: papillae that were too many or too close together to count; 5 (not shown): a lawn of papillae covering the entire patch).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each strain, a minimum of 3 individual GCR patch scores were averaged to calculate the GCR strain score.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Increases in the GCR strain score were paralleled by increases in GCR rates measured by the fluctuation method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Patch tests documenting genetic interactions involving mutations in either CKB2 or EXO1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The status of CKB2 or EXO1 is indicated across the top of each set of patches, and the bait mutations tested are indicated to the left of each set of patches.Full size image', 'The GCR assays select haploid cells resistant to both canavanine (Can) and 5-fluoroorotic acid (5FOA) due to loss of the CAN1 and URA3 genes on the left arm of chromosome V (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These GCRs have a breakpoint between the CAN1 and URA3 genes and the most telomeric essential gene on the left arm of chromosome V (PCM1); genomic features in this breakpoint region influence the types of GCRs that are formed7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The short repeated sequence GCR (sGCR) assay contains single-copy sequences in the breakpoint region and 100 bp of YCLWdelta5 sequence in the can1::PLEU2-NAT locus that has homology to the long-terminal repeats from Ty1 and Ty2 retrotransposons (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The segmental duplication GCR (dGCR) assay contains the 4-kb DSF1-HXT13 segmental duplication with divergent homology to regions of chromosomes IV, X and XIV (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  8) in addition to the YCLWdelta5 fragment (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Ty912-containing GCR (tyGCR) assay detects GCRs mediated by homologous recombination (HR) with the other Ty-related sequences in the genome (Fig 1a)7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Single and double-mutant haploid strains generated by the SGA procedure were tested for increased accumulation of GCRs by determining the number of CanR 5FOAR papillae observed after growing patches from independent spore clones and replica plating the patches onto GCR selection media (Fig 1d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A numerical score (05) was assigned to each patch by counting the total number of papillae per patch, and a GCR strain score was calculated by averaging the scores for all of the patches analysed for each mutant (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GCR strain scores are not the direct equivalent of GCR rates; doubling of the strain score corresponds to an increase in GCR rate of an average of fivefold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As determining GCR strain scores is labour intensive, we implemented a two-stage genetic screening strategy to focus on a subset of non-essential S. cerevisiae genes that were enriched in GIS and cGIS genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The first stage was our previous genome-wide in silico screen that identified 1,041 candidate GIS genes29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A preliminary investigation of 10% of these 1,041 genes identified 34 new GIS genes and 1 new cGIS gene, revealing that this group of genes was enriched for GIS genes but that not all of the 1,041 genes were GIS genes29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the second stage of the screen, which is described in the present study, we eliminated all essential genes from the candidate list of GIS genes and added in all additional non-essential genes known to function in the pathways identified by the 1,041 genes (see Methods; Supplementary Data 1) resulting in 1,055 genes/mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we added two additional mrc1 and rad53 alleles and a leu2 control deletion for a total of 1,058 strains.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The first-generation set of 1,058 mutant strains was crossed to the wild-type dGCR, sGCR and tyGCR query strains and dGCR+query mutation strains containing dia2, exo1, rrm3 and rtt107 mutations, and the resulting progeny were evaluated for increased GCR rates using patch tests (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the basis of these results, we generated a second-generation set of 639 mutant strains (see Methods and Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This collection of mutants contained all of the mutations that either increased the GCR rate in at least 1 GCR assay or interacted with at least 1 of the dia2, exo1, rrm3 and rtt107 mutations in the dGCR assay.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dia2, exo1, rrm3 and rtt107 mutations were selected for evaluating candidate enhancing mutations because together they interacted with the largest number of bait mutations in a subset of the first-generation set of mutant strains (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The 419 bait mutations excluded were identified in the in silico screen on the basis of causing increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents29, which can reflect processes unrelated to DNA repair like small molecule export and detoxification.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this, the 419 excluded genes showed little if any genetic similarity to bona fide GIS genes29 and were enriched for roles in the endosome, Golgi complex, the ESCRT complex, the retromer complex and general metabolism but not in DNA or chromosome metabolism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Crossing of the second-generation set of mutants to the remaining 39 dGCR+query mutation strains was then continued, and the resulting double-mutant progeny were evaluated for increased GCR rates using patch tests (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Identification of GIS genes', 'Crossing the wild-type dGCR, sGCR, and tyGCR query strains to the first-generation mutant set generated 1,002, 995, and 1,009 single-mutant strains, respectively (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The GCR strain scores for the leu2 control strains were 0.1, 0.94, and 2.67 for the sGCR, dGCR, and tyGCR assays, respectively, and were consistent with quantitative GCR rate measurements (Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distribution of strain scores for all of the mutations tested in each GCR assay peaked around the strain scores for the leu2 control strains, suggesting that most of the individual mutations tested did not strongly affect genome instability (Fig 2ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Assaying single-mutant strains using GCR strain scores.(ac).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Histograms of the distribution of GCR strain scores for single-mutant strains from the sGCR (a), dGCR (b) and tyGCR (c) assays reveal that the average GCR strain score increases with the GCR rate for each GCR assay and that the score of the leu2 control strain (grey triangle) generally lies at the peak of each histogram, suggesting that many of the mutations tested do not substantially affect the GCR strain score as single mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fold increase in the GCR rate is correlated with the GCR strain score for systematically generated strains containing the dGCR assay.Full size image', 'To determine a cutoff score for identifying mutations causing increased GCR rates, we determined GCR rates for 101 single-mutant dGCR strains and all 43 leu2 query double-mutant dGCR strains from crosses with the dGCR+query mutation strains (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found a robust correlation between the GCR strain scores and GCR rates (Fig 2d), despite a small but consistent increase in dGCR rates that was observed in strains from the systematic crosses, which was potentially due to GCRs mediated by the YCLWdelta5 fragment at the can1::PLEU2-NAT locus (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3; Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using the GCR strain scores and rates for the 144 systematically generated dGCR assay-containing strains, we determined that a cutoff score of 1.4 (0.4 above the wild-type score) balanced the false-positive and false-negative errors in identifying mutations in GIS genes (Supplementary Fig 2; Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We generated a comprehensive list of GIS genes by combining the GIS genes identified here with those previously known.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Initially, we selected all single mutations that caused GCR strain scores that were 0.4 or more above the wild-type score in any GCR assay (Supplementary Data 1; Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We then removed mutations that caused less than a threefold increase in GCR rate and included mutations that caused at least a threefold increase in rate, regardless of GCR strain scores (Supplementary Tables 2, 4 and 5; Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we included mutations previously shown to increase the GCR rate by threefold or more, including mutations in essential genes not studied here and mutations in genes identified in studies using GCR assays lacking repetitive sequences in the GCR breakpoint region (single-copy or unique sequence GCR assays; designated here as uGCR assays6,8 and previously summarized29; Supplementary Data 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We observed 75 genes that suppressed GCRs in the dGCR assay, 71 genes in the tyGCR assay, 80 genes in the sGCR assay and 105 genes in the uGCR assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The higher number of GCR suppressing genes identified in the uGCR assays is primarily the result of candidate gene studies that included alleles of essential genes not tested here and mutations that cause small but significant increases in quantitative GCR assays, which were too small to reliably detect by the semi-quantitative scoring method used here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, we identified 182 S. cerevisiae GIS genes, 50 of which suppress genome instability in at least 3 of the 4 GCR assays (Fig 3;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here we developed methods to screen the S. cerevisiae systematic deletion collection to identify new GIS genes, identify genes that interact to suppress the formation of GCRs and identify candidate human genes for the analysis of cancer genomics data to identify potential GIS gene defects in human cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis increased the total number of known GIS genes to 182, including 98 new GIS genes identified here and during our targeted validation of the starting 1,041 candidate genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also identified 438 cGIS genes and an extensive catalogue of genetic interactions affecting genome stability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of ovarian and colorectal cancer TCGA data31,32 showed that the majority of the cancer cases analysed (a minimum of 93% of ovarian and 66% of colorectal cancer cases) appeared to have defects affecting one or more genes that were homologues of the S. cerevisiae GIS genes or act in the pathways identified by the GIS genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, AML, a cancer with little genome instability33, did not appear to have defects affecting GIS genes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, genetic or epigenetic changes causing increased genome instability are likely common in some types of cancer, but due to the large number of GIS genes, the defect signature for any single gene can be weak.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Almost half of the 182 S. cerevisiae GIS genes suppress the formation of GCRs detected in multiple GCR assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The common pathways identified typically include genes involved in DNA metabolism, including DNA replication and repair, and genes involved in checkpoint signalling in response to DNA damage and replication errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Some of the genes identified, such as RAD27 and TSA1, likely function by suppressing the formation of DNA damage27,40.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other genes, such as those encoding the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 and Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 complexes, likely process DNA damage generated by other mechanisms41, such as DNA replication errors.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of genes have less clear roles in suppressing genome instability, such as VID22, YDJ1, SSZ1 and CKB2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fact that many GIS genes suppress GCRs detected in multiple assays that probe different genomic contexts indicates that these genes can suppress the formation of many types of GCRs7,8,10,12,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A notable exception are pif1 mutations that cause a defect in suppression of de novo telomere additions, which appears insensitive to genomic context8,18,42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a number of genes suppress GCRs detected by subsets of GCR assays (Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In most cases, the mechanisms underlying this specificity are not yet understood; however, in the case of MSH2 and MSH6, the heteroduplexes formed by non-allelic homologous recombination (HR) during the formation of duplication-mediated GCRs are likely to contain a higher density of mispairs and hence be better recognized by MMR and subjected to heteroduplex rejection7,8 than heteroduplexes formed in the tyGCR and sGCR assays.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mutations that enhance the accumulation of GCRs can in principle act in compensatory or parallel pathways or can have more complicated relationships involving genes within pathways43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, mutations can result in increased levels of DNA damage that can lead to GCRs when repair mechanisms are defective or are saturated by the increased levels of DNA damage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many mutations showing genetic interactions, such as exo1, cause increased GCR rates as single mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mutations like these could affect the response to normal levels of spontaneous DNA damage as well as DNA damage that is either induced in the absence of other pathways or is normally repaired in part by other pathways.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, a number of enhancer mutations, such as tel1 cause no increase in GCR rates as single mutations10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These mutations may either result in increased DNA damage that is efficiently repaired so long as the relevant repair mechanisms are functional and not overwhelmed by other sources of damage or inactivate a redundant pathway.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defects in the genes encoding complexes can show the same types of interactions, regardless of whether defects in all of the genes encoding a complex behave similarly (such as RNH201, RNH202 and RNH203 as well as MMS2 and UBC13) or whether defects in only a subset of the genes encoding a complex have similar properties (for example, SPT3, SPT8 encoding part of SAGA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The systematic identification of S. cerevisiae GIS genes has facilitated a pathway-based analysis of human cancer genomics data.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have focused on ovarian and colorectal cancer, two cancers with genome instability that appear to have different relative frequencies of copy-number changes and mutation driver alterations30, as well as AML, a cancer that is associated with little if any genome instability30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of the ovarian cancer TCGA data, 23% of the samples with any data had LOF mutations in GIS gene homologues, with 65% of the samples with LOF mutations having LOF mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 as previously reported31; no other individual GIS gene homolog had a LOF mutation in  greater than 0.5 to 1% of the samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, there was a high frequency of copy-number alterations, including both copy-number reductions and homozygous deletions, associated with reduced expression of GIS gene homologues in ovarian cancer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This included 17% of the samples that had homozygous deletions of 1 to 9 GIS gene homologues per sample, approximating the frequency of samples with BRCA1 or BRCA2 LOF mutations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the colorectal cancer TCGA data showed a higher proportion of samples and GIS gene homologues with LOF mutations and a lower yet high proportion of samples and GIS gene homologues with copy-number alterations associated with reduced expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A minimum of 93% of ovarian cancer TCGA cases and 66% of colorectal cancer TCGA cases had alterations (not considering predicted deleterious missense mutations) affecting one or more GIS gene homologues, with only 5 and 8% of the samples, respectively, having alterations in genes expected to cause a strong MMR defect (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1 and PMS2) and hence a mutator phenotype.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these results suggest that a high prevalence of alterations in GIS genes can explain how genome stability is compromised in these two cancers.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consistent with this view, there was no evidence for significant alteration of GIS genes in AML, a cancer that is not associated with high levels of genome instability30.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Defects in some of the human genes identified here have been implicated in cancer (for example, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BLM, REV3L and PBRM1), and some of the genes have been associated with the suppression of genome instability (for example, WRN, BLM, ATM, ATR, BRCA1 and BRCA2) or with pathways thought to act in the suppression of genome instability (for example, RAD17, RAD50, XRCC6 and TP53BP1)44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our functional studies in S. cerevisiae provide evidence that many of the human GIS gene homologues likely act in the suppression of genome instability in human cells and provide a restricted, prioritized list of human genes for genetics and functional validation studies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

the number of papillae observed with the leu2 control strain for the dGCR assay); 2, 615 papillae; 3, 16a countable number of papillae (150200); 4, papillae that were too many or too close together to

rates and average GCR patch scores for single mutants in the dGCR assay and 43 strains resulting from the crosses of mutant dGCR query strains with the leu2 control strain, we determined an optimal cutoff score as described50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Briefly, for any given cutoff value, ci, we calculated the sensitivity, which is the fraction of mutations causing increased GCR rates that we include as SENSi=TPi /(TPi +FNi), where TPi is the number of true positives (mutants with a GCR rate at least threefold higher than wild-type with a score ci) and FNi is the number of false negatives (mutants with a GCR rate at least threefold higher than wild type with a score less_than ci).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For each cutoff value, we also calculated the specificity, which is the fraction of mutants that do not have increased GCR rates that we reject: SPECi=TNi/(TNi+FPi), where TNi is the number of true negatives (mutants with a GCR rate less than threefold higher than wild-type with a score less_than ci) and FPi is the number of false positives (mutants with a GCR rate less than threefold higher than wild-type with a score greater than ci).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An optimal cutoff for balancing sensitivity and specificity can be determined by optimizing the cost function w1SENSi +w2SPECi as a function of ci.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we weighted sensitivity slightly higher than specificity (w1=2, w2=1) with the rationale that false negatives were more problematic because false positives could be identified by subsequent quantitative rate testing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the optimal cutoff ci was 1.38 for the set of 101 rate/score pairs solely from the wild-type dGCR cross and for the set of 144 rate/score pairs from the wild-type dGCR cross and the leu2 double mutants from the mutant dGCR crosses (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With equal weights, the optimal cutoff was slightly higher, 1.69.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, analysis of Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves51 showed that mutations causing higher GCR rates were clearly better detected by these patch-based GCR strain scores than mutations that only weakly increased the GCR rates (Supplementary Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We also used the KolmogorovSmirnov test as extended for discrete null distributions as implemented in R52 to calculate P-values for differences between the distribution of patches from the leu2 control strain and each single mutant.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike calculations based on the average GCR patch score, this test included the number and distribution of all observed patches.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the list of mutant strains with significantly different patch scores that were higher than the leu2 control strain (P less_than 0.01) was essentially the same as the list of strains identified by minimizing the false-positive and false-negative errors as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Analysis of S. cerevisiae modules', 'Protein complex and pathway
