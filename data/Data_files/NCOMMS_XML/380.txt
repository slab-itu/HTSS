Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The ability to conduct image-based, non-invasive cell tagging, independent of genetic engineering, is key to cell biology applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we introduce cell labelling via photobleaching (CLaP), a method that enables instant, specific tagging of individual cells based on a wide array of criteria such as shape, behaviour or positional information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLaP uses laser illumination to crosslink biotin onto the plasma membrane, coupled with streptavidin conjugates to label individual cells for genomic, cell-tracking, flow cytometry or ultra-microscopy applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We show that the incorporated mark is stable, non-toxic, retained for several days, and transferred by cell division but not to adjacent cells in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To demonstrate the potential of CLaP for genomic applications, we combine CLaP with microfluidics-based single-cell capture followed by transcriptome-wide next-generation sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we show that CLaP can also be exploited for inducing transient cell adhesion to substrates for microengineering cultures with spatially patterned cell types.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Cellular labels are essential components in the toolbox to build our current understanding of biological function.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, a versatile, efficient and non-invasive approach to tag individual cells chosen upon observation is still lacking.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The vast majority of methods for generating fluorescently labelled cells rely on biochemical characteristics that are common to an ensemble of cells in a sample, and lack the specificity given by imaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Widely used methods include transfection of genes encoding fluorescent proteins, membrane-permeable dyes or antibody labelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These approaches do not allow targeting specific cells among a large population of the same type.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, their efficiency and specificity are highly dependent on stochastic events and molecular affinity properties, often yielding a sub-optimal fraction of correctly labelled cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Spatially targeted methods, such as single-cell electroporation1,2, microinjection3, laser capture microdissection3,4,5 or transfection of photo-switchable proteins that change properties upon illumination6,7,8 are often invasive, labour-intensive or lack accuracy, rendering them impractical for a wide range of applications9,10.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we introduce a novel laser-based technique, cell labelling via photobleaching (CLaP), for labelling individual cells in culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specific cells can be chosen based on their morphological characteristics, dynamic behaviour, localization in the sample at a given time, or any visible feature that distinguishes the cells of interest from an ensemble.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLaP allows combining the accuracy and versatility of image-based selection with the high throughput of automated cell-sorting methods, thus permitting experiments that account for cellular context or temporal dynamics, such as transcriptomic profiling preserving spatial information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method does not require previous knowledge of cell surface markers, uses off-the-shelf reagents, and may be implemented on a standard confocal microscope without hardware or software modification.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Cell labelling', 'CLaP is related to laser-assisted protein adsorption by photobleaching11,12,13, a method developed to engineer cell culture substrates by creating protein patterns of optical resolution at a high dynamic range of concentrations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In LAPAP, a laser is used to bind fluorescent biotin conjugates to solid surfaces and hydrogels via free radicals generated by photobleaching.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead of focusing on inert surfaces, CLaP tethers biotin molecules to the plasma membrane of living cells using a low-intensity laser beam (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biotin-4-fluorescein (B4F) is added to the cell culture medium and a laser, tuned near the absorption peak of the dye, is then focused on individual cells of choice, generating reactive oxygen species in close vicinity of the plasma membrane that lead to biotin crosslinking (Supplementary Note 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Since the entire process occurs in a small region outside the cell, significant phototoxicity is avoided.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The irradiated cells are then revealed by incubating the culture with streptavidin conjugates.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By choosing among different types of such streptavidin conjugates, cells can be tagged with fluorescence (Fig 1be), electron-dense molecules (Fig 1f and Supplementary Fig 1) or other labels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The procedure can be repeated sequentially using different colour streptavidin conjugates to obtain distinct colour tags within the same sample (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tethered biotin spreads along the cell surface via lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane, resulting in a relatively uniform cell staining (Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Cell labelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Outline of the method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cells are incubated with B4F, a small molecule that can easily reach the cell membrane, including the space between the glass surface and the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A laser beam photobleaches and crosslinks fluorescein-conjugated biotin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After rinsing, only illuminated cells retain biotin molecules on their plasma membrane and are revealed with fluorescent streptavidin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Biotin molecules attached to the plasma membrane freely diffuse along the lipid bilayer to yield a rather uniform distribution of fluorophores throughout the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Examples of labelled cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Low-magnification image of confluent MDCK cells labelled with Alexa-647-Streptavidin (magenta) overlaid on the bright-field image.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 200 m.

widely-available fluorescence-activated flow cytometry (FACS), a common technology used to sort cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Three standard gates were defined to count exclusively events originated from isolated viable cells (see Supplementary Fig 4 for details).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLaP-tagged cells were detected using the Alexa Fluor 647 signal solely from events going through the three previous gates

potential of the method for single-cell genomic applications, we combined CLaP with microfluidics-based single-cell capture followed by PCR assays and transcriptome-wide next-generation sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We first evaluated the specificity of CLaP and subsequent capture by a co-culture experiment where we tagged only one cell type, captured individual cells, visualized them and analysed their DNA by PCR.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For this, we co-cultured mouse 3T3 fibroblasts expressing mNeonGreen and dog MDCK cells (Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We exclusively tagged MDCK cells with a far-red fluorescent streptavidin label, targeting 5% of the total number of cells in the dish.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Viability test using calcein-AM/ethydium homodimer before loading the microfluidic device confirmed the non-toxicity of CLaP (Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We isolated 96 cells using the Fluidigm C1 microfluidic system, among which five were CLaP tagged (Fig 3a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On-chip cell lysis, followed by DNA amplification, allowed us to confirm by PCR the correct species of origin for all tagged cells (Fig 3b and Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We then demonstrated that single-CLaP-positive cells can be isolated from a large population for single-cell transcriptomic analyses, using a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After single-cell capture, RNA-Seq was obtained from CLaP-tagged (n=9) and untagged (n=10) individual cells, in addition to bulk samples consisting of (i) 200 cells pooled and (ii) cDNA from 5 ng total RNA extracted from the bulk culture.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We computed a number of quality control metrics to verify that CLaP does not interfere with protocols of sample preparation for transcriptomic experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Comparisons of tagged versus untagged cells revealed no significant differences regarding total coverage, GC content and coverage distribution over the genome structure (Supplementary Data and Supplementary Figs 8 and 9).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More importantly, gene expression profiling indicates no major changes associated with the procedure, as unsupervised clustering of samples based on expression profiles (principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering with bootstrapping) consistently groups tagged and untagged cells together (Fig 4 and Supplementary Figs 10 and 11).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  More subtle effects on gene expression levels were assessed through a differential expression analysis, which showed statistically significant differences in only 24 genes, representing 0.34% of all detected genes (Supplementary Data).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Altogether, these results are consistent with the viability and proliferation assays, indicating that CLaP does

spatial distribution of cells', 'The same photochemistry used to tether biotin molecules to the plasma membrane induces transient adhesions of cells to the substrate, which are resistant to EDTA and trypsin treatment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As previously shown14, small fluorescent molecules can diffuse between the glass substrate and the cell membrane, allowing crosslinking of the cells to the cover slip upon photobleaching14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These adhesions can thus be exploited to tailor the spatial distribution of cells by automating both laser illumination and sample movement (Fig 5a,b), and subsequently detaching non-tagged cells using proteases or chelators.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell adhesions induced by CLaP are transient, and cells keep proliferating and migrating away from the initial region where they were attached, spreading to cover the full field of view of a × 10 objective at day 5 (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The transient nature of cell adhesions and the limited impact of the procedure on cell proliferation are probably due to the choice of CLaP fluorophores and the use of low-intensity visible light.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method, thus, constitutes a practical way to select

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this work, we introduced a method to tag individual cells with a laser, and demonstrated the potential for fluorescence and electron microscopy, as well as FACS and single-cell next-generation sequencing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The most important characteristic of CLaP is the image-based criteria for cell selection, which presents two critical advantages: versatility and potential for automation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This opens the door for experiments that interrogate the transcriptional profiles of cells depending on their microenvironment and spatiotemporal dynamics, permitting to tag, for instance, only fast, large, round, granular, isolated or distant cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It also enables to study cell-to-cell communication, in contexts such as immune cell activation or synaptic interactions, where cellular cross-talk induces context-specific molecular changes for which no marker is available.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The method allows isolation of cells that have undergone a transient event detectable in a microscopy field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This novel capability is particularly relevant in areas where tissue heterogeneity plays a major role, including development, cancer biology, immune response, stem cells or neurobiology9,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, a few approaches have been developed for transcriptome sequencing preserving spatial information.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ methods include performing mRNA capture (TIVA16) or sequencing reactions (FISSEQ17) directly inside intact cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While CLaP does not have the potential of providing subcellular information or in situ expression profiling, it presents several advantages that make it a convenient choice for a number of applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  First, the protocol is short and simple, without requiring special probes, and a standard confocal microscope can be used for tagging, making it a very accessible method.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of course, a dedicated system with more powerful lasers is useful to accelerate the procedure, and programmable motorized stages allow creation of arbitrary illumination patterns.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Second, the method is not tied to any particular library preparation protocol or sequencing technology, an important feature in a field that is evolving at a very fast pace.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While emerging in situ approaches have great potential, practical testing and information on biases and reproducibility are still lacking, and limitations on sequencing depth have to be overcome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  CLaP-labelled cells, on the other hand, can be analysed using standard, widely tested capture and sequencing protocols.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Several extensions to the method can be envisaged.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tags are not restricted to fluorescent modalities; here we also used electron-dense labels, and bound molecules can easily be extended to magnetic particles, antibodies, nucleotide sequences, drugs or functional macromolecules.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further extensions include colour barcoding, to allow separation of more than one group of cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown that at least two distinct fluorescent tags can be added to a sample (Fig 1e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The maximum number of simultaneous labels is, however, limited by emission cross-talk between image channels, non-specific background of B4F, which adds noise to green Streptavidin conjugates, and the diversity of commercially available fluorophores.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We have here demonstrated the use of CLaP on monolayers of cultured cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The cellular specificity of CLaP is particularly high using cell lines, but it may be slightly decreased in primary cultures, which often include dead cells with permeable membranes and dissection debris that can yield non-specific staining due to adsorbed B4F and streptavidin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, in tissue CLaP would open a number of exciting possibilities, even if diffusion of reagents through the extracellular matrix for both tagging and rinsing may slow down the procedure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Changing continuous laser illumination for ultrashort laser pulses as a way to spatially confine photobleaching by two-photon absorption in three-dimensional environments will potentially extend this approach to ex vivo and in vivo applications.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
