Uniaxial stress control of skyrmion phase  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Magnetic skyrmions, swirling nanometric spin textures, have been attracting increasing attention by virtue of their potential applications for future memory technology and their emergent electromagnetism.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite a variety of theoretical proposals oriented towards skyrmion-based electronics (that is, skyrmionics), few experiments have succeeded in creating, deleting and transferring skyrmions, and the manipulation methodologies have thus far remained limited to electric, magnetic and thermal stimuli.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we demonstrate a new approach for skyrmion phase control based on a mechanical stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By continuously scanning uniaxial stress at low temperatures, we can create and annihilate a skyrmion crystal in a prototypical chiral magnet MnSi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical stress is merely several tens of MPa, which is easily accessible using the tip of a conventional cantilever.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The present results offer a new guideline even for single skyrmion control that requires neither electric nor magnetic biases and consumes extremely little energy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Magnetic skyrmions and their crystalline form called skyrmion crystals (SkX; Fig 1a,b), have been observed in bulk materials1,2,3,4, thin films5,6,7 and nanowires8,9 of P213-type chiral magnets such as MnSi, Fe1xCoxSi and Cu2OSeO3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They have also been observed quite recently in non-P213-type chiral magnets of GaV4S8 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  10) and Co-Zn-Mn alloys11, and even at the interfaces of magnetic thin films12,13 and nanoscopic-patterned discs14,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As schematically illustrated in Fig 1a, a skrymion has a particle-like swirling spin configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Unlike the conventional spin textures such as helical or conical states (Fig 1c) that appear in chiral magnets, skyrmions have spin configurations characterized by a topological index called the skyrmion number16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nontrivial topology of skyrmions gives rise to emergent electromagnetic responses as exemplified by the topological Hall effect18, skyrmion magnetic resonance19 and thermally induced ratchet motion20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Conceptual representations of magnetic phases in MnSi and the experimental set-up.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Single skyrmion, (b) skyrmion crystal and (c) conical phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  H and Qi represent the magnetic field and propagation vectors, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colours of the arrows indicate the out-of-plane components of the spins in the skyrmion spin texture, whereas they represent the directions of the in-plane components (perpendicular to the Q-vector) in the conical structure.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d,e) The set-up for AC magnetic susceptibility measurements under (d) longitudinal and (e) transverse uniaxial stresses with respect to an external magnetic field.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The (green) cuboids represent a cubic unit cell, and  represents the compressive stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the transverse configuration, several ZrO2 pistons converted longitudinal forces into lateral ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetic susceptibility was monitored by coils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Typical results for  as a function of the magnetic field at 0 MPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red and blue curves correspond to the longitudinal and transverse AC magnetic susceptibilities, which were measured in configurations (d,e), respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data are shown separately by an offset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternating magnetic fields (Hac) were applied by a coil parallel to the  axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical fields corresponding to the phase transitions from the helical phase to the conical phase and from the SkX phase to the induced ferromagnetic phase are represented by Hc1 and Hc2, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The SkX phase can be clearly assigned, as represented by the shaded regions between HA1 and HA2.Full size image', 'In addition to these intriguing physical responses, skyrmions have been attracting extensive attention for their potential applications in future solid-state memory technology or storage devices21,22 because of their small size (3100 nm)21 and topological stability16 as well as ultralow electric currents required to drive their motion23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pursuing arbitrary control of skyrmions as information carriers towards the attempt to develop skyrmion-based electronics (that is, skyrmionics), a number of theoretical simulations have recently been performed, yielding schemes for controlling skyrmions based on electric currents22,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33, electric fields32,34, magnetic fields32, thermal stimuli35 or conversions between a skyrmion and domain walls36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Compared with these theoretical simulations, experimental demonstrations such as the creation13,37, deletion13, transfer23,24,25 and rotation20,38 of skyrmions seem to be limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it remains necessary to establish and expand a framework for skyrmion manipulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Herein, we present a new approach for manipulating a SkX in a bulk single crystal of a prototypical chiral magnet MnSi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although any continuous deformations of the spins cannot connect topologically different skyrmion and conical states, we find that a simple mechanical stress can overcome the energy barrier to switch between these two states in both directions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The critical stress needed to trigger this topological switching is merely several tens of MPa, and the corresponding strain is of the order of 104.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This perturbative mechanical stimulus is easily achievable using conventional scanning probe techniques, offering a new guideline for skyrmion manipulation, even at the single skyrmion level, that is essentially free of Joule heating.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Experimental set-up for the application of mechanical stress', 'We continuously applied and released compressive uniaxial stress over broad ranges of temperature and magnetic field strengths using a previously developed special uniaxial stress probe39 that was improved for the present study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As shown in Fig 1d,e, longitudinal ( || H) or transverse (  H) uniaxial stress was introduced, and the longitudinal or transverse AC magnetic susceptibility was simultaneously monitored by coils.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here,  and H represent the compressive stress and magnetic field, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In both configurations, a DC magnetic field was applied in the 001 direction, and the uniaxial stress and AC magnetic field were set parallel to each other.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1f presents a typical evolution of the AC magnetic susceptibility of a MnSi single crystal under a magnetic field sweep at 0 MPa for these two configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The red and blue curves correspond to the longitudinal and transverse AC magnetic susceptibilities, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the magnetic field in 001 direction increases, a transition from the multi-domain helical phase to the single-domain conical phase occurs at Hc1, followed by another transition from the conical phase to the induced ferromagnetic phase at Hc2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the intermediate range between HA1 and HA2, as represented by the grey regions, the longitudinal susceptibility shows a clear suppression, whereas the transverse susceptibility exhibits a clear enhancement.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This behaviour is ascribable to the SkX phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the case of proper helices, the susceptibility parallel to the propagation vector Q is expected to be larger than that perpendicular to the Q-vector.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Q direction of the conical phase is parallel to the H direction, whereas that of the SkX phase is orthogonal (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This difference in Q-vector direction qualitatively explains the opposite trends exhibited by the longitudinal and transverse susceptibilities in the SkX and conical phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slight discrepancies between the critical fields for the two configurations are attributed to the demagnetizing effect.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Mechanical creation and annihilation of SkX', 'We measured the uniaxial stress dependence of the magnetic susceptibilities at low temperatures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Figure 2a,b present the AC susceptibilities near 0.2 T with increasing mechanical stresses, which unambiguously demonstrated that the SkX phase is created by a transverse stress and annihilated by a longitudinal stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 27.0 K in the absence of stress, there is no SkX phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the application of a stress in the transverse configuration (  H), as shown in the inset of Fig 2(a),  begins to increase at 0.2 T, indicating the emergence of the SkX phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 27.6 K, however, the SkX phase exists at 0 MPa, as indicated by a reduction in  (Fig 2b) in the longitudinal configuration ( || H).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This reduction is continuously suppressed with increasing uniaxial stress up to 200 MPa, indicating that the SkX phase becomes unstable on the application of longitudinal uniaxial stress and that the conical phase survives between HA1 and HA2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrate that even moderate longitudinal or transverse stresses of up to 200 MPa are sufficient to control the competition between the SkX and conical phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Mechanical creation and annihilation of SkX.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Emergence of the SkX phase at 27.0 K. With increasing transverse stress, as schematically shown in the inset, the magnetic susceptibility near 0.2 T begins to increase, as indicated by the grey-shaded region.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The appearance of a convex structure in the transverse magnetic susceptibility indicates the emergence of the SkX phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Annihilation of the SkX phase at 27.6 K. With increasing longitudinal stress, the concave structure (shaded in grey) in the longitudinal magnetic susceptibility nearly disappears.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This indicates suppression of the SkX phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Both sets of data are shown separately by offsets.Full size image', 'Figure 3 exhibits an evolution of the magnetic phase diagram under several fixed uniaxial stresses up to 200 MPa in the transverse and longitudinal configurations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The magnetic phase diagrams shown in Fig 3af were obtained in the same settings represented in Fig 1d,e, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that Fig 3gi were obtained in a H ||  || 111 configuration; this is the only instance of data collected in this different setting in the manuscript.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At 0 MPa, the SkX phase exists in a small HT region surrounded by the conical and intermediate40 phases.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  With a magnetic field along the 111 direction, the SkX phase exists in a narrower region than it does in the case of a magnetic field along the 001 direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This anisotropy is consistent with a previous report41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The slight discrepancy between Fig 3a,d originates from the demagnetization effect, which depends on the sample shape used in the uniaxial stress experiments (see Methods).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative stability of the SkX phase can be varied by applying a transverse or longitudinal stress: the SkX phase extends to lower temperatures on the application of a transverse stress (Fig 3ac), whereas its temperature range narrows on the application of a longitudinal stress (Fig 3df,gi).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the collapse of the SkX phase is incomplete even at 200 MPa with the application of stress along the 001 axis, the SkX phase disappears throughout the entire HT region when a longitudinal stress is applied along a magnetically hard axis, that is, the 111 axis (Fig 3i).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A large response also arises in the helical phase in both the transverse and longitudinal configurations, as seen from the colour changes between 0 and 0.1 T. This indicates a stress-induced reorientation of the Q-vector of the helix from the weakly locked  less_than 111 greater than  axes to the stress axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Regardless of whether the configuration is transverse or longitudinal, a uniaxial stress causes a slight decrease in Tc at 0 T. This can be attributed to the effect of volume contraction introduced by the compressive uniaxial stress, which is similar to a hydrostatic pressure effect, as confirmed by Ritz et al.42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Evolution of the magnetic phase diagram under mechanical stress at 0, 100 and 200 MPa.The relative stability of the SkX phase can be controlled by applying a transverse or longitudinal stress along different crystallographic axes, as schematically illustrated here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ac) Expansion of the SkX phase region induced by a transverse stress along the 110 axis with H || 001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (df) Shrinkage of the SkX phase region induced by a longitudinal stress along the 001 axis with H || 001.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (gi) Collapse of the SkX phase induced by a longitudinal stress along the 111 axis with H || 111.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The colour contour maps correspond to the  values obtained in a series of H-increasing scans at fixed temperatures and stresses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The demagnetization effects were not corrected.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  IFM and IM indicate the induced ferromagnetic and intermediate phases, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The dotted lines in (h) and (i) are guides for the eye.Full size image', 'Stress-driven topological phase transition', 'The central results of the present paper are presented in Fig 4, revealing a stress-triggered topological phase transition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we continuously applied and released stresses between 0 and 100 MPa at fixed temperatures and magnetic fields.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Shown in Fig 4a is a colour map of  in the H plane at 27.0 K for the transverse configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This figure clearly reveals the emergence of the SkX phase in the background of the conical phase at several tens of MPa.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The stress-mediated topological phase transition is displayed as susceptibility stress curves in Fig 4c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The large nonlinear responses correspond to a conical-to-SkX phase transition at a critical stress c.

Because the coefficient L is positive for MnSi44,48, a compressive strain (ezz less_than 0) induces an easy-plane anisotropy perpendicular to the stress axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a result, the Q-vector of the proper helix preferentially aligns along the compressive stress direction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, the conical phase (Q || H) should be stabilized by a longitudinal stress, whereas the SkX phase (Q  H) should be stabilized by a transverse stress (Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This explains the creation and annihilation of the SkX by transverse and longitudinal stresses, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Recently, Shibata et al.49 reported that strain also modulates the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), inducing large-shape deformations of skyrmions in FeGe.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Theoretical calculations50 have revealed that a uniaxial strain caused the DMI to be large along the compressive axis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effectively induces an easy-plane anisotropy, similar to the effect of stress-induced magnetic anisotropy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, modulation of the DMI may also provide a qualitative explanation of the results of this study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, a preliminary SANS measurement of MnSi suggests that the magnetic modulation period remains unchanged under the application of a uniaxial stress42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, our SANS measurement presented in Fig 5b reveals that the magnetic modulation period in the SkX phase remains almost unchanged on the application of a uniaxial stress; the change is  less_than 0.5%.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings suggest that the effect of strain on the DMI is less relevant in the case of MnSi.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we interpret the effect of a uniaxial stress on the SkX phase stability in terms of a stress-induced magnetic anisotropy.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Advances in recent nanofabrication technologies and nanoelectromechanical devices have made it possible to utilize simple mechanical forces, instead of the conventional electrical or magnetic biases, to write information bits on a minute scale51,52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nanoscopic mechanical imprinting has now been developed using a cantilever-based configuration51, which simultaneously satisfies the requirements for high densities of up to 1 Tbit in2 and high speeds of up to Gbit s1 in a scaled-up device called Millipede memory52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The concept of mechanically recordable memory, therefore, can provide an alternative architecture to various types of magnetically or electrically operated devices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we propose that magnetic skyrmions can be a suitable medium for mechanical imprinting on the nanometric scale, providing the basis for a technology that can be operated at an extremely low energy cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The small critical stress of several tens of MPa that is needed to create/annihilate the SkX phase opens the possibility of the selective erasing of single skyrmions by simply pushing the tip of a cantilever in scanning probe microscopy (SPM).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This scenario corresponds to the longitudinal configuration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By using a conventional sharp tip with a radius of 10 nm, one can introduce highly localized deformations comparable to the size of a single skyrmion in MnSi (20 nm).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By approximating the contact area as r2 (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51, where r is the tip radius), one finds that 318 MPa can be achieved with a moderate force of 100 nN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This exceeds the threshold stress for skyrmion annihilation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, nanometric ferroelectric polarization writing via SPM in a BaTiO3 thin film has been demonstrated to require a contact force of 1,500 nN, with a corresponding stress as large as 5 GPa (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  51).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, although the behaviour may not be simple as that demonstrated here because of strain gradient induced by such a local force, single skyrmion deletion via SPM is plausible.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'On another front, the mechanical energy needed to erase single skyrmions is estimated to be surprisingly low.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This stems from the scalability of the phenomenon; the mechanical energy per bit greatly decreases with the reduction of the bit size down to the size of skyrmions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The energy cost for erasing a skyrmion can be expressed as , where zz is the stress, C11 is the elastic constant, r2 is the deformation area and d is the deformation depth.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, r and d are assumed to be the tip radius and the thickness of the film, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Supposing that zz=100 MPa, C11300 GPa (refs 43, 44), r=10 nm and d=10 nm, one can obtain Ecost=5 × 1020 J per single skyrmion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although this is a rough estimate, the mechanical energy required is far smaller than the energy cost of 9 × 1014 J incurred for writing to state-of-the-art spin-transfer-torque magnetic random access memory53 or that of 2.25 × 1017 J for current-induced single skyrmion creation as calculated in ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, we demonstrated mechanical control of the SkX phase in a bulk MnSi single crystal, which can be achieved with a small critical stress and a low energy cost.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This offers a new methodology for manipulating single skyrmions based on the conventional SPM technique.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As discussed from a phenomenological perspective, the proposed mechanical approach is applicable in a broad range of skyrmionic systems with magnetoelastic coupling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By combining simple mechanical imprinting with other approaches such as a racetrack-type architecture, one may achieve novel memory or storage functions using skyrmions.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
