Endothelial Dicer promotes atherosclerosis and vascular inflammation by miRNA-103-mediated suppression of KLF4  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'MicroRNAs regulate the maladaptation of endothelial cells (ECs) to naturally occurring disturbed blood flow at arterial bifurcations resulting in arterial inflammation and atherosclerosis in response to hyperlipidemic stress.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we show that reduced endothelial expression of the RNAse Dicer, which generates almost all mature miRNAs, decreases monocyte adhesion, endothelial CXC motif chemokine 1 (CXCL1) expression, atherosclerosis and the lesional macrophage content in apolipoprotein E knockout mice (Apoe/) after exposure to a high-fat diet.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endothelial Dicer deficiency reduces the expression of unstable miRNAs, such as miR-103, and promotes Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)-dependent gene expression in murine atherosclerotic arteries.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MiR-103 mediated suppression of KLF4 increases monocyte adhesion to ECs by enhancing nuclear factor-B-dependent CXCL1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibiting the interaction between miR-103 and KLF4 reduces atherosclerosis, lesional macrophage accumulation and endothelial CXCL1 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, our study suggests that Dicer promotes endothelial maladaptation and atherosclerosis in part by miR-103-mediated suppression of KLF4.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Endothelial cells (ECs) are perfectly adapted to conduct blood through high-shear stress, high-pressure environment in unbranched segments of arteries1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  High-shear stress at the endothelial surface induces the transcription factors Krüppel-like factors (KLF) 2 and KLF4, which promote a quiescent EC phenotype characterized by a low turnover rate, tight intercellular junctions with low permeability, reduced inflammatory activation and antithrombotic properties2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, distribution of blood throughout the body requires branching of arteries where blood flow is naturally disturbed and consequently shear stress is low5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disturbed flow at arterial bifurcations constantly damages the endothelium by activating the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, suppresses EC-specific transcriptional programmes by downregulating KLF2/4, and increases the activity of the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-B (NF-B)6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the deposition of chemically modified lipoproteins in the subendothelial space aggravates the maladaptive response of ECs and results in the accumulation of macrophages derived from circulating monocytes in the arterial wall during atherosclerosis9,10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inflammatory activation of macrophages triggers the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) and interleukin-1, which further promotes endothelial maladaptation by activating NF-B12,13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endothelial chemokines, such as chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and chemokine (CX3C) ligand 1 (CX3CL1), have key roles in the accumulation of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ECs secrete CXCL1 and CCL2 from intracellular storage compartments upon activation by thrombin or lipoprotein oxidation products15,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whereas CXCL1 is immobilized on the endothelial surface and triggers monocyte adhesion by activating integrins on the monocyte surface15,19, CCL2 contributes to macrophage infiltration probably by regulating hypercholesterolemia-induced monocytosis17,20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The membrane-bound chemokine CX3CL1 is upregulated in inflamed ECs and promotes atherogenic monocyte adhesion by activating platelets21.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Constitutive and induced expression of CXCL1, CCL2 and CX3CL1 are controlled by the activity of NF-B22,23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs of 22 nucleotides that regulate a number of processes related to atherogenesis, such as macrophage activation and the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), by translational repression or degradation of their target mRNAs24,25,26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Mature miRNA sequences are embedded in the stem-loop structure of their primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcripts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nuclear RNAse III Drosha crops the pri-miRNA stem at the 5 and 3 sides to release a 65-nucleotide-long, hairpin-shaped precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the cytoplasm, the RNAse III endonuclease Dicer cleaves all pre-miRNAs, except pre-miR-451, near the terminal loop of the hairpin into 21 to 25-nucleotide-long miRNA duplexes, which are subsequently loaded onto Argonaut proteins27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although one strand of the miRNA duplex is selected during the loading step to generate the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), the second strand is usually removed and degraded.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Binding to Argonaut proteins protects miRNAs from degradation by exonucleases and thus greatly increases their stability compared with that of mRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the expression level of a small subset of miRNAs is highly dependent on continuous biogenesis because of a fast turnover rate28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Deletion of the gene encoding Dicer in mice compromises blood vessel formation and causes embryonic lethality, indicating an essential role of this endonuclease in vertebrate development30,31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In adults, Dicer is essential for the function of various cell types, such as pancreatic beta cells and cardiomyocytes32,33, and reduced Dicer expression contributes to aging and promotes cancer development34,35.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although deletion of Dicer in SMCs results in embryonic lethality36, mice with deficiency of Dicer in ECs develop normally and have no overt phenotype37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, reduced endothelial Dicer expression severely impairs postnatal angiogenesis and limits the proliferation and migration of ECs37,38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, knockdown of Dicer induces upregulation of EC-specific genes, such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), Angiopoietin-1 receptor (Tie2) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (KDR), indicating that Dicer generates miRNAs that impair endothelial differentiation38.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Disturbed blood flow increases the expression of several endothelial miRNAs, including miR-92a and miR-712, which promote atherosclerosis by targeting KLF2/4 and by increasing shedding of membrane-bound TNF-, respectively7,40,41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, several miRNAs have been implicated in NF-B pathway regulation in ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, miR-10a, miR-146a and miR-181b promote an anti-inflammatory phenotype in ECs by inhibiting the NF-B pathway, whereas miR-19a has a proinflammatory role in ECs42,43,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although individual miRNAs affect endothelial inflammation, it is unclear which role Dicer-dependent miRNA biogenesis in ECs plays in atherosclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here, we investigated the role of endothelial Dicer in monocyte adhesion and atherosclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  EC-specific deletion of Dicer in apolipoprotein E-knockout (Apoe/) mice reduced monocyte adhesion to the early atherosclerotic endothelium by downregulating CXCL1, resulting in diminished lesion formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MiR-103 is downregulated in Dicer-deficient ECs and promoted CXCL1-mediated monocyte adhesion by targeting KLF4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Blocking the interaction between miR-103 and KLF4 in arteries reduced atherosclerosis, lesional macrophage accumulation and CXCL1 expression, similar as the deletion of Dicer in ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Overall, these data indicate that Dicer can enhance atherosclerosis and endothelial inflammation by increasing miR-103 expression.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'Endothelial Dicer regulates miRNAs during atherosclerosis', 'Although many miRNAs are downregulated in atherosclerotic arteries26, Dicer expression in the aortas of Apoe/ mice was not affected by 12 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding compared with mice fed a normal diet (Supplementary Fig 1a), indicating that miRNA biogenesis by Dicer is not generally impaired during early atherosclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the expression of Dicer in ECs was not affected by low-shear stress and did not differ between the aortic arch and thoracic aorta, indicating that Dicer is not regulated by blood flow (Supplementary Fig 1b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To study the role of endothelial Dicer in atherosclerosis, we generated Apoe/ mice containing a loxP site-flanked Dicer sequence (Dicerflox) and a transgene with Tamoxifen (TMX) inducible Cre recombinase under control of the EC-specific VE-cadherin (Cdh5) promoter.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TMX administration reduced aortic Dicer mRNA expression in EC-Dicerflox mice by 66% and 58% compared with EC-DicerWT mice after 4 and 12 weeks of HFD feeding, respectively (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In ECs isolated from the aortas of EC-Dicerflox mice injected with TMX, Dicer mRNA expression was decreased by 87% compared with ECs isolated from EC-DicerWT mice (Fig 1b), whereas the expression of Dicer was not affected in myeloid cells from EC-Dicerflox mice (Supplementary Fig 1d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results indicate that TMX treatment of EC-Dicerflox mice effectively reduced Dicer expression in ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Effect of endothelial Dicer on miRNA expression during atherosclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Quantitative RTPCR analyses of Dicer mRNA expression in the aortas from TMX-treated EC-DicerWT and EC-Dicerflox mice fed a HFD for 4 or 12 weeks (wks;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Here, we demonstrate that deficiency of Dicer in the endothelium of Apoe/ mice diminishes endothelial inflammation, which reduces monocyte adhesion to atherosclerosis-prone endothelium and the development of atherosclerotic lesions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Deletion of Dicer in ECs primarily decreased the expression of a small subset of unstable miRNAs, including miR-103, and promoted KLF4-dependent gene expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MiR-103 expression was upregulated by NF-B and mildly oxidized LDL in human ECs and increased the expression of CXCL1 by targeting KLF4, thereby enhancing monocyte adhesion to ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Inhibition of the miR-103-KLF4 interaction reduced atherosclerosis, lesional macrophage accumulation and endothelial CXCL1 expression in the arteries of Apoe/ mice, indicating a proinflammatory and proatherogenic role of miR-103 by targeting KLF4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The normal functions of various differentiated cell types, such as cardiomyocytes, pancreatic beta cells and SMCs, requires Dicer activity and fully functioning miRNA biogenesis32,33,50.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, mice with a deletion of the Dicer gene in ECs develop normally, indicating that permanent Dicer activity is of less importance in EC homeostasis37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Notably, knockdown of Dicer in ECs in vitro reduces the expression of CXCL1 and upregulates endothelial genes, like eNOS and Tie2, indicating that Dicer promotes inflammatory activation and impairs endothelial differentiation38,51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ECs at arterial bifurcations are primed by disturbed flow for inflammatory activation in response to hyperlipidemic stress, which results in NF-B-dependent upregulation of CXCL1 and atherogenic monocyte adhesion8,15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Accordingly, we found that endothelial Dicer deficiency downregulates CXCL1 in murine arteries and reduces the adhesion of monocytes to the endothelium during the early stage of atherosclerosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with its effect on monocyte adhesion, deficiency of Dicer in ECs reduced the development of atherosclerosis and the accumulation of lesional macrophages, suggesting that the generation of miRNAs in ECs during atherosclerosis promotes lesion formation by increasing CXCL1-dependent monocyte adhesion.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The detrimental role of endothelial Dicer during atherogenesis may be due to the key role of miRNAs in the maladaptive response of ECs to disturbed flow.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The miRNA expression profile in ECs exposed to disturbed blood flow at arterial bifurcations differs substantially from that in ECs at unbranched arterial segments42 and is characterized by downregulation of atheroprotective (such as miR-126-5p)52 and upregulation of pro-atherogenic miRNAs (such as miR-92a)41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, ECs at arterial bifurcations proliferate more frequently than quiescent ECs at unbranched segments52.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to proliferating cells, the majority of miRNAs in quiescent cells is stable (persistence of miRNAs up to 2 months following Dicer ablation in neurons in vivo have been reported)53, stored in Argonaut complexes and functionally silent probably due to their sequestration by polysomes29,54,55,56.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, reduced endothelial miRNA biogenesis at predilection sites of atherosclerosis may cause the protective effects of endothelial Dicer deficiency on lesion formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although miRNAs are generally stable, a small subset of miRNAs that associates with Argonaut proteins demonstrates fast turnover rates in a highly dynamic and cell type-specific manner28,29,57.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  After silencing of Dicer in ECs, let-7 family miRNAs, miR-103, miR-221 and miR-27b have a higher turnover rate than miR-126-3p, miR-21, miR-23a and miR-26a39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the expression levels of four miRNAs, including miR-103, were highly dependent on endothelial Dicer activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, downregulation of unstable miRNAs, like miR-103, following Dicer deletion may limit monocyte adhesion and atherosclerosis in mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MiR-103 has a key role in regulating insulin sensitivity in adipocytes by targeting caveolin-1, and in cancer cell growth and metastasis by repressing different targets, including KLF4 (refs 48, 58, 59).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MiR-103 is one of the most highly expressed miRNA in ECs cultured under static conditions and downregulated by high-shear stress38,60.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In vivo, miR-103 is upregulated at predilection sites for the development of atherosclerosis characterized by disturbed flow-induced endothelial NF-B activation42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented here show that NF-B activation upregulates miR-103 and thereby promotes the expression of chemokines, such as CXCL1, CCL2 and CX3CL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MiR-103 increased CXCL1-dependent monocyte adhesion and rescued the decreased chemokine expression caused by knockdown of Dicer in ECs, indicating that reduced endothelial miR-103 levels limit monocyte adhesion and atherosclerosis in EC-Dicerflox mice by downregulating CXCL1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The reduced endothelial inflammation in atherosclerotic arteries of EC-Dicerflox mice was associated with enhanced KLF4 activity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although KLF4 is closely related to KLF2, only 30% of the KLF4-regulated genes in ECs are also controlled by KLF2, indicating non-redundant roles of KLF2 and KLF4 in endothelial function46.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, KLF4 but not KLF2 upregulates Cdh5 and Claudin-5 by direct interaction with their promoter and thus reduces endothelial permeability61,62,63.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, both KLF4 and KLF2 attenuate endothelial inflammation by inhibiting NF-B activation through competitive binding to the p300 coactivator2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An atheroprotective role of endothelial KLF4 was demonstrated by gain-an-loss-function studies in mice64.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The expression of KLF2 and KLF4 is transcriptionally upregulated by the MEK5/Erk5/MEF2 signalling pathway and posttranscriptionally silenced by disturbed flow-induced miR-92a3,65.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In accordance with previous reports in cancer cells, we found that miR-103 represses the translation of KLF4 mRNA by direct interaction with a conserved binding site in its 3UTR, which results in NF-B-mediated upregulation of CXCL1 in ECs48.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, miR-103 might act as a molecular switch for the inflammatory activation of arterial ECs by fine-tuning the functional antagonism between KLF4 and NF-B.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The findings that inhibition of the interaction between miR-103 and KLF4 reduced atherosclerosis and increased endothelial KLF4 expression in Apoe/ mice demonstrates a proatherogenic role of this interaction and suggests that derepression of KLF4 due to downregulation of miR-103 contributes to the atheroprotective effect of Dicer deficiency in ECs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, deficiency of Dicer in the endothelium of Apoe/ mice reduced monocyte adhesion to the early atherosclerotic endothelium by downregulating CXCL1, and thereby diminished lesion formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, endothelial Dicer activity at arterial sites predisposed to atherosclerosis may play a pro-atherogenic role by generating proinflammatory miRNAs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This effect of Dicer is attributable to reduced endothelial miR-103 expression and the subsequent restoration of KLF4 expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, selective inhibition of the targeting of KLF4 by miR-103 using antisense oligonucleotides may represent a novel approach to treat atherosclerosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
