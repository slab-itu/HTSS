A developmentally regulated switch from stem cells to dedifferentiation for limb muscle regeneration in newts  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The newt, a urodele amphibian, is able to repeatedly regenerate its limbs throughout its lifespan, whereas other amphibians deteriorate or lose their ability to regenerate limbs after metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be determined whether such an exceptional ability of the newt is either attributed to a strategy, which controls regeneration in larvae, or on a novel one invented by the newt after metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we report that the newt switches the cellular mechanism for limb regeneration from a stem/progenitor-based mechanism (larval mode) to a dedifferentiation-based one (adult mode) as it transits beyond metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We demonstrate that larval newts use stem/progenitor cells such as satellite cells for new muscle in a regenerated limb, whereas metamorphosed newts recruit muscle fibre cells in the stump for the same purpose.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We conclude that the newt has evolved novel strategies to secure its regenerative ability of the limbs after metamorphosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In contrast to mammals, the newt, a urodele amphibian classified into the family of Salamandridae, has the ability to repeatedly regenerate its limbs independently of its age.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When the limb is amputated, the newt generates at the stump a cell mass called the blastema, from which a new functional limb is eventually regenerated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, other amphibians, which also have the ability to regenerate limbs in larval stage, deteriorate or lose such ability after metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be determined whether such an exceptional ability of limb regeneration in the newt is either attributed to a strategy, which controls regeneration in larvae, or on a novel one invented by the newt after metamorphosis1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In urodeles, either skeletal muscle fibre cells (SMFCs) or muscle stem/progenitor cells (MPCs) such as satellite cells have been suggested to be contributing to new muscle in regenerated limbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A recent study revealed that the adult newt uses SMFCs, whereas the axolotl (a neotenic species of the family Ambystomatidae) uses satellite cells even after artificially metamorphosed by administration of thyroid hormone, raising the argument that such a difference in the origin of muscle is attributed to differences in species2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is still not determined whether pre-metamorphosed newt limbs employ dedifferentiation of muscle fibres or not.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the idea of species differences makes sense, it is imperative that other questions are asked.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, to address this issue, we created transgenic newts (Cynops pyrrhogaster) carrying a cassette, CreERT2 less_than CarA-CAGGs greater than EGFPmCherry, using the I-SceI protocol3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these animals, SMFCs that differentiate in the larval stage (between St 34 and St 53) are labelled by mCherry after tamoxifen administration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using this system, we tracked SMFCs during limb regeneration in both larval and metamorphosed newts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that larval newts did not require muscle fibre cells to regenerate their amputated limbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  New muscle in a regenerated limb seems to originate from stem/progenitor cells, because Pax7+ cells such as satellite cells, which are muscle progenitors, are recruited to the blastema.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, after metamorphosis, the muscle fibre cells in the stump were mobilized to form the blastema, eventually giving rise to new muscle in the regenerated limb.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To receive a whole picture of tissue fate during limb regeneration and to compare with similar studies in axolotl, we further followed regeneration of all other tissues in adult newt via grafting experiments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the principal tissues of the adult limb such as the skin, bone, muscle and nerves strictly regenerate the same type of tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our current results demonstrate that the newt developmentally switches cellular mechanism of limb regeneration, revealing novel strategies that have evolved in the newt to secure its regenerative ability of the limbs after metamorphosis.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

'SMFC tracking in larval newt limb regeneration', 'In larval newts at St 5657 (3 months old; Fig 1a), whose forelimbs had grown with four digits, we found that SMFCs did not contribute to restoration of the missing part of the forelimb after amputation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When mCherry was monitored in living animals, it did not appear in the regenerating part of the limb (neither as cells from fragmented fibres nor as fibres) until 30 days when the amputated limb structure had almost been restored (Fig 1b,c and Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We subsequently examined satellite cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We carried out immunohistochemistry with Pax7 antibody (a marker of MPCs including satellite cells)2 and found that Pax7-immunoreactive (Pax7+) mononucleated cells appeared in the blastema by day 12 post amputation (Fig 1df; 317 cells per blastema, n=3) and increased in number in the next few days (Fig 1g; 55144 cells per blastema, n=3), suggesting that MPCs (potentially satellite cells) were recruited for new muscle during limb regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, these results suggest that SMFCs were not the primary source of new muscle in larval newts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Consequently, they also revealed close similarity between the larval newt and the axolotl, at least in terms of muscle regeneration (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: SMFC tracking in larval newt limb regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Larva (3 months old).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It has four limbs, as well as the gills and tail fin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 4 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Monitoring of SMFCs (mCherry+) during limb regeneration (n=6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  mCherry was not detected in the regenerating part of the limb until 30 days when the amputated limb had almost been recovered (see Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Arrowheads: flexor muscle for digits (see Fig 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 1 mm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Sections of regenerating limbs (n=3 for each stage).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  SMFC-derived mCherry+ cells were not observed in the blastema.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lines: amputation site.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  m: muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Scale bar, 100 m.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'This study provides evidence that the newt is capable of recruiting both Pax7+ MPCs, such as satellite cells, and SMFCs, to restore muscle during limb regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the former was the source in the larval stage and the later in the adult stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In other words, a stem/progenitor-based mechanism is taken over by a dedifferentiation-based one as development proceeds beyond metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, differences in the origin of new muscle between the newt and axolotl should not be attributed to differences in species but rather explained by differences related to developmental processes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It remains to be studied whether the switching of cell source takes place abruptly or gradually after metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It must be noted here that lineage tracing of Pax7+ satellite cells cannot be achieved at this point with the technical limitations in newts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The genome of the newt is not sequenced yet and the Pax7 locus is not available; thus, production of transgenic newts is not possible at this point.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The axolotl displays neoteny, heterochronically preserving its larval properties even after sexual maturity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, in metamorphosed axolotls, satellite cells still contribute to the blastema but there is no SMFCs contribution2, and this could be viewed either as a difference among species, as a difference in time after metamorphosis (in axolotls, maybe  less_than 10 months) or as a result from a virtual condition for metamorphosis (hormone injection), which may have been insufficient for the switching of cell source or inhibited it.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, our results clearly indicate a degree of plasticity that urolele amphibians could exhibit, to achieve regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to note here that in a recent paper it was demonstrated that although preaxial dominance is characteristic of limb regeneration in the larval newt, it changes after metamorphosis with anterior and posterior digits forming together7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is another example of plasticity in limb regeneration mechanism depending on metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Most amphibians studied thus far can regenerate limbs in the larval stage, but after metamorphosis this ability deteriorates or is lost1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is true for the axolotl whose metamorphosis can be induced by thyroid hormone8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, the newt can regenerate limbs regardless of metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In general, for animals whose sources of cells for tissue repair and regeneration (for example, stem/progenitor cells and premature cells, which still have potency to change their fate) decrease in number and/or activity during development, it would be advantageous to have the ability to recruit comparable cells through dedifferentiation or reprogramming of mature cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In amphibians, stem/progenitor cells for muscle regeneration may decrease or deteriorate, or specialize to muscle growth/repair during metamorphosis when the bodys system is drastically remodelled to adapt to a terrestrial environment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, in adult newt limbs, the ratio of satellite cells to SMFC nuclei decreases (mean± s.d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  : larvae, 14.7±4.9%, n=8; adult, 9.3±4.8%, n=5; Students t-test, P=0.039).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, plenty of satellite cells are still present in the muscle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, the property of satellite cells and/or surroundings of them that allow them to mobilize into the blastema must change during or after metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a frog (Xenopus laevis), it has been suggested that growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor, which recruit satellite cells into the blastema may decrease during metamorphosis9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It may be valuable to examine whether this is true for metamorphosed newts.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Possibly, dedifferentiation of SMFCs evolved to enable SMFCs to regenerate the muscle more efficiently in such conditions of adults.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a recent paper10, it was shown that newts have the ability to clear senescent cells, so that they do not interfere with regeneration.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This mechanism could account for the ability of the newt to regenerate many times at old ages as well11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should also be noted that generation of progenitor cells by dedifferentiation of muscle fibres during adult newt limb regeneration could be attributed to programmed cell death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it will be interesting to see whether that is the case in larvae limb regeneration as well12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In summary, both newts and axolotls seem to have the same basic master plan for limb regeneration: tissues in the regenerating limb originate from the parental ones.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, when it comes to muscle, the newt switches from stem/progenitor cells to SMFC dedifferentiation as it transits from metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This could bear significance for the loss of regenerative ability in metamorphosed amphibians, such as frogs and other urodele species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frogs lose their ability for limb and lens regeneration after metamorphosis13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Axolotls also lose their ability for lens regeneration as they develop14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Perhaps different animals invent new strategies or modify existing ones to suit their regenerative needs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is interesting to speculate here that the newt overcame loss of limb regeneration after metamorphosis by resorting in part to dedifferentiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Delineating the mechanisms of these strategies will undoubtedly provide clues for regeneration in other species including mammals.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

from M11 Cardiac Actin Promoter pCarA, Addgene 17148), which is known to be activated in both SMFCs and cardiac muscle fibre cells15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each construct is flanked by chicken -globin HS4 2 × core insulators (kindly provided from Dr Gary Felsenfeld at the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), to minimize possible cis interactions within the cassette and between the constructs and functional elements on the chromosome.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We prepared transgenic newts by the I-SceI protocol3: one-cell-stage embryos were injected with a construct/enzyme mixture (DNA construct, 80 ng l1; I-SceI (catalogue number: R06945; New England Biolabs, Tokyo, Japan), 0.5 U l1; I-SceI buffer (New England Biolabs), 1 × ; Phenol red, 0.01%) at 12 l per embryo and reared until a juvenile stage beyond metamorphosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we used swimming larvae (St 5657) that had developed forelimbs with full digits (total body length: 18 mm, age: 3 months; Fig 1a) and metamorphosed juveniles (total body length: 6 cm, age: 16 months; Fig 3a) (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig 10).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For the study of larval limb regeneration (Figs 1 and 2), we selected swimming larvae that expressed EGFP in their whole body almost evenly and treated them at St 4753 (age: 12 months) in a tamoxifen-containing solution (13 M (Z)-4-hydroxytamoxifen (H7904-5MG, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO; master mix: 100300 M in dimethylsulphoxide) in rearing solution (0.1 × Holtfreters solution)3) for a few weeks (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Figs 10 and 11a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For the study of juvenile limb regeneration (Fig 3), we used mosaic animals, which expressed EGFP in the muscle only, as well as non-mosaic ones (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig 11b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such mosaic animals were selected at the swimming larval stage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The reason that we used these mosaic animals is to preclude possible contamination of other kinds of cells in SMFC lineage tracing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In swimming larvae, we carried out amputation in the middle of the forearm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In juveniles, we carried out the first amputation in the middle of the forearm; after the blastema had formed (3040 days after amputation), we carried out the second amputation in the middle of the upper arm of the same limb, to collect the blastema for histological analysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These animals were kept for longer than 3 months, to examine later stages of regenerating limbs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The primary reason that we adopted a second amputation on the upper arm is that if we amputated on the forearm, it would be difficult to prove that mCherry+ SMFCs participate in muscle regeneration via dedifferentiation, because similar results can be presumed even when the cells originating from other tissues fuse to the remnant mCherry+ SMFCs in the stump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Amputation in the middle of the upper arm ensures discontinuity between muscles in the regenerated forearm and those in the stump of the upper arm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The secondary reason is that animals to be used, which must be mosaic (see above), were limited.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Transplantation of reporter-expressing tissues', 'CAGGs greater than reporter transgenic newts of 12 months after metamorphosis were used as donors (Supplementary Figs 13 and 14).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The tissues that exhibited intense mCherry/EGFP fluorescence uniformly were transplanted into a wild-type animal (recipient) by fine scissors, pins and forceps under a fluorescent dissecting microscope (M165 FC; Leica).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The skin was grafted to a recipient of the same age (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The muscle and bone were transplanted individually into the corresponding regions of different recipients 3 years old (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The nerve (Schwann cells) was implanted in between muscles of a forelimb of a 3-year-old recipient (Supplementary Fig 7).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In these recipients, after the wound was closed (0.51 month after surgery), the limb was amputated so that the grafted tissue remained in the stump.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, to track the epidermis, we also transplanted the mCherry+ ectoderm on the presumptive forelimb of a tail bud embryo (St 2426) to a wild-type embryo at the same stage (Supplementary Fig 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this case, when the recipient reached 69 months of age, the forelimb was amputated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Microscopic observation of living newts', 'EGFP/mCherry fluorescence of tissues in living animals was monitored during development, limb regeneration and tissue transplantation under a dissecting microscope (M165 FC;
