Explosive cell lysis as a mechanism for the biogenesis of bacterial membrane vesicles and biofilms  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Many bacteria produce extracellular and surface-associated components such as membrane vesicles (MVs), extracellular DNA and moonlighting cytosolic proteins for which the biogenesis and export pathways are not fully understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that the explosive cell lysis of a sub-population of cells accounts for the liberation of cytosolic content in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Super-resolution microscopy reveals that explosive cell lysis also produces shattered membrane fragments that rapidly form MVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A prophage endolysin encoded within the R- and F-pyocin gene cluster is essential for explosive cell lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endolysin-deficient mutants are defective in MV production and biofilm development, consistent with a crucial role in the biogenesis of MVs and liberation of extracellular DNA and other biofilm matrix components.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our findings reveal that explosive cell lysis, mediated through the activity of a cryptic prophage endolysin, acts as a mechanism for the production of bacterial MVs.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria produce membrane vesicles (MVs) that have been shown to contribute to diverse biological processes, including biofilm development, virulence, quorum sensing, phage decoy and horizontal gene transfer.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MVs are bi-layered spheres which, at least in Gram-negative bacteria, are thought to be produced through blebbing of the outer membrane and hence are often referred to as outer-membrane vesicles1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MVs derived from planktonic cultures have been the most extensively studied and have been found to be comprised of outer-membrane proteins, lipopolysaccharide and to encapsulate periplasmic components including peptidoglycan and virulence factors1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, MVs also contain numerous inner membrane and cytoplasmic proteins, as well as DNA and RNA1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  MVs are also present in biofilms where they interact with extracellular DNA (eDNA) in the biofilm matrix to enhance structural integrity and to serve as decoys to protect biofilm cells from antibiotics1,2,3,4.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The matrix of bacterial biofilms is a complex mixture of exopolysaccharides, nucleic acids, proteins and MVs that serve as public goods for the biofilm community by providing important functions including self-organization, surface adhesion, intercellular connectivity, structural integrity, cellcell communication, virulence, nutrient acquisition and antibiotic resistance1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  A number of cytosolic proteins have also been shown to have moonlighting roles in biofilm formation or virulence when released from the cytosol of the cell10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is currently unclear how many of these biofilm matrix components and moonlighting proteins are liberated into the extracellular milieu or transported to the cell surface.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is now evident that eDNA is a common feature of biofilms formed by many bacterial species and its production has been attributed to autolysis, phage-mediated cell lysis or active secretion systems8,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have shown previously that eDNA is essential for biofilm formation by the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)9 and that eDNA facilitates the self-organization of P. aeruginosa biofilms as they actively migrate across surfaces via twitching motility7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we show that eDNA is produced by P. aeruginosa through explosive cell lysis events mediated by a cryptic prophage endolysin encoded in the R- and F-pyocin gene cluster.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using live-cell super-resolution imaging we show that these explosive cell lysis events also produce MVs through vesicularization of shattered membrane fragments.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Explosive cell lysis occurs in interstitial biofilms', 'We have observed that in actively expanding interstitial biofilms of P. aeruginosa strain K (PAK), eDNA is distributed as numerous bright foci throughout the active migration zone of the biofilm7 (Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This pattern suggests that eDNA is produced by discrete cells rather than generalized secretion by the whole population.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine the mechanism by which eDNA is produced in interstitial biofilms we followed 150 eDNA release events and found that all were associated with the rapid transition of rod-shaped cells to round cells that subsequently exploded resulting in the annihilation of the cell and release of eDNA into the environment (Fig 1b; Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Explosive cell lysis occurs in P. aeruginosa interstitial biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Phase-contrast (left) and TOTO-1-stained eDNA (green, right); scale bar, 50 m.

Supplementary Movie 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We analysed the survival times of 150 P. aeruginosa PAK round cells and found that 86% of these survived for  less_than 60 s with 35% surviving for  less_than 5 s, although some round cells had much longer survival times (Fig 1df; Supplementary Movie 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The bacterial cell wall is the primary stress-bearing structure that dictates and maintains cell shape and protects the cytoplasmic membrane against turgor and lysis13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our observations suggest that the transition from rod to round cell morphotype involves the rapid loss of structural integrity of the cell wall peptidoglycan, which in most instances results in immediate explosive cell lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We investigated the viability of round cells by culturing P. aeruginosa interstitial biofilms in the presence of the live-cell impermeant nucleic acid stain ethidium homodimer-2 (EtHD-2) which is a sensitive marker of dead microbial cells as it only enters cells with damaged membranes14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that round cells excluded EthHD-2 indicating that they have intact membranes and are likely to be viable until the explosion event (Supplementary Movie 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analyses also revealed that many of the rod cells that subsequently became round cells were frequently longer than the surrounding cells, including some extremely long cells that were up to 34 times longer than the average size of the neighbouring rod cells (Fig 1g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of 156 rod cells that became round cells, 33 were clearly undergoing cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that some round cells originated from rod cells that were either undergoing cell division or were blocked in cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To determine if explosive cell lysis was a conserved phenomenon in P. aeruginosa strains, we cultured interstitial biofilms of the common laboratory strains PAK, PAO1, PA103, PA14, ATCC27853, five CF clinical isolates and two non-CF clinical isolates, and quantified the frequency of round cells and sites of eDNA release as a marker for explosive cell lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To quantify the frequency of round cells in P. aeruginosa interstitial biofilms, randomly selected fields of view of the interstitial biofilm monolayer were imaged with phase contrast microscopy and analysed via computer vision to identify cells and categorize their morphotypes as rod or round cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Round cells were observed in all strains, although the frequency of round cells varied from about 1 per 3,000 to 1 per 100,000 rod cells in different strains (Supplementary Fig 1a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar frequencies of punctate eDNA sites were observed in the interstitial biofilms of all strains (Supplementary Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These observations suggest that while eDNA release through explosive cell lysis occurs in many P. aeruginosa strains, the survival times of round cells appear to vary between strains that is reflected in the number of round cells visible in the population at any instant in time.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Explosive cell lysis is induced by stress', 'Interestingly, we noted that fluorescence imaging in the presence of the eDNA stain TOTO-1 to detect eDNA release events yielded more frequent explosive cell lysis events than when fluorescence imaging was not involved (Fig 2a) although the process appeared identical (Supplementary Movie 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This suggests that phototoxicity due to exposure to high-intensity excitation light stimulated explosive cell lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if other sources of exogenous stress induce explosive cell lysis, we examined the effect of exposing P. aeruginosa interstitial biofilms to antibiotic stress (ciprofloxacin; CPFLX) or genotoxic stress (mitomycin C; MMC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that as the biofilm approached CPFLX or MMC gradients, round cells were induced and large quantities of eDNA released through explosive cell lysis (Fig 1b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine if induction of explosive cell lysis by these exogenous stresses is mediated by the RecA-mediated SOS stress response regulon of P. aeruginosa, we examined the response of a PAO1recA mutant and found no evidence of explosive cell lysis in this strain under either inducing or non-inducing conditions (Fig 2c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Stress induces explosive cell lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Frequency of explosive cell lysis events in the absence (FL) or presence (+FL) of fluorescence imaging, mean±s.e.m., #P less_than 0.0001, Unpaired t-test with Welchs correction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Phase-contrast (top) and TOTO-1-stained eDNA (green, bottom) of P. aeruginosa PAO1 interstitial biofilms cultured in the presence of filter discs saturated in water, MMC or CPFLX;

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'In this study, we have shown that explosive cell lysis accounts for the efficient liberation of a variety of cellular components including cytosolic proteins, eDNA and MVs that may serve as public goods in P. aeruginosa biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We have determined that explosive cell lysis in P. aeruginosa is due to an endolysin-encoding gene (lys) which is located on the genome within a cryptic prophage gene cluster that encodes the R- and F-type pyocins.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Expression of genes in the R- and F-pyocin gene cluster, including lys, is known to be upregulated by exposure to exogenous stresses through the RecA-dependent SOS response12,17,18,19,20,21 and we found that explosive cell lysis and lys expression is induced by exposure to exogenous stresses and that this is regulated through RecA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, it is yet to be determined if explosive cell lysis under non-stress conditions is a programmed cell death pathway induced by fratricide or altruistic suicide36.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that P. aeruginosa recA strains were significantly abrogated in explosive cell lysis events even in the absence of exogenous stress, which suggests that there may be endogenous cues that induce RecA-mediated lys expression.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Endogenous stress that activates RecA is known to occur in P. aeruginosa biofilms37.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the RecA-mediated SOS stress response can lead to a block in cell division in some bacteria38 and we observed that many of the cells that go on to become round cells appeared to be blocked in cell division.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore it is possible that endogenous stress may act as a trigger to stimulate Lys-mediated explosive cell lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Alternatively, explosive cell lysis in P. aeruginosa may be a consequence of stochastic expression of the pyocin gene locus (including lys) to enable release of pyocins from the cell.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that the pyocin structural genes are not required for explosive cell lysis to occur.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, it is possible that lys may also be expressed independently of the structural genes of the R- and F-pyocin locus and that explosive cell lysis can occur independently of pyocin release.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whatever the mechanism by which explosive cell lysis is triggered, it is clear from our observations that this process liberates public goods including eDNA, cytosolic content and MVs that can be exploited by other cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, we found that populations of lys mutants that are unable to undergo explosive cell lysis are severely abrogated in biofilm formation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Also encoded in the R- and F-pyocin gene cluster is the putative holin, Hol (PA0614)17, overexpression of which has been shown to cause increased lysis of P. aeruginosa39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While we have not examined the contribution of Hol in explosive cell lysis in this study, we expect that Hol facilitates translocation of Lys across the inner membrane to degrade the cell wall peptidoglycan leading to explosive cell lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, here we showed that in trans expression of both hol and lys were required to elicit cell lysis in E. coli (Supplementary Fig 2) indicating that Hol facilitates translocation of Lys across the E. coli inner membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as other putative P. aeruginosa holins CidA40 and AplB41 have previously been reported to be associated with lysis of P. aeruginosa cells, it is possible that these may also contribute to translocation of Lys across the inner membrane.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The R- and F-pyocin gene cluster is part of the P. aeruginosa accessory genome as it is not present in all strains42.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that lys is highly conserved in all complete genomes of P. aeruginosa strains available in the public genome databases (EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ), with 88100% nucleotide identity over the full length of the 630 bp gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is likely that other prophages also encode the endolytic activity required for explosive cell lysis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, genes with high similarity to lys were also found in the genomes of other Pseudomonas species and many other bacterial genera indicating that this might be a conserved phenomenon in bacteria.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using live-cell super-resolution microscopy, we have determined that explosive cell lysis is a mechanism for bacterial MV biogenesis and MV cargo packaging.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the vesicularization of shattered membrane fragments that are produced by exploding bacteria are likely to capture cellular components released into the extracellular milieu as they self-anneal into MVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To our knowledge, this is the first direct observation in live bacterial cells of either MV biogenesis or the process by which cellular content is liberated into the extracellular matrix of bacterial biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although MV biogenesis via explosive cell lysis is unlikely to control the cargo of MVs precisely, this mechanism provides a convincing explanation as to why cytoplasmic material such as DNA, RNA and cytoplasmic proteins are present in MVs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Interestingly, we found that lys mutants were significantly reduced in MV production in biofilms and in stressed planktonic cultures indicating that most MVs are produced through explosive cell lysis events under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast, however, we found that lys mutants were not defective in MV production in non-stressed planktonic cultures, which suggests that other mechanisms such as outer membrane blebbing may account for the majority of MV biogenesis under these conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, as our RNA-Seq data was obtained from MVs obtained from non-stressed planktonic cultures and showed upregulation of SOS response genes including recA and lys, it is likely that explosive cell lysis also accounts for the production of some MVs that contain cytoplasmic content (including RNA) in non-stressed planktonic cultures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, during our submerged biofilm formation assays, we observed explosive cell lysis events in the planktonic phase.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Taken together, our data demonstrate a novel role for bacteriophage-associated endolysins in MV biogenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results not only imply that the ability to produce MVs can be conferred via bacteriophages as a consequence of the bacteriophage lytic cycle but also may explain why MVs can harbour complete viral genomes43 and DNA associated with MVs isolated from open ocean samples are strongly enriched for viral sequences28,44.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As many species of bacteria and archaea produce MVs, moonlighting proteins and/or a biofilm matrix comprised of eDNA, lipids and cytoplasmic proteins1,6,8,45, and prophage and prophage-like elements are a common feature of bacterial genomes46, phage-mediated explosive cell lysis may be a ubiquitous mechanism for the production of MVs and release of cytosolic public goods in bacterial biofilms.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  At low levels, phage-mediated explosive cell lysis is likely to be beneficial to bacterial communities through the provision of a mechanism for the efficient release of cell-derived public goods.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, prophage and prophage-like elements have been associated with increased fitness of bacterial populations12 and the endolysin genes of cryptic prophages appear to experience purifying evolution, which suggests that they are under positive selection pressure47.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
