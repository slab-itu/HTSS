T follicular helper and T follicular regulatory cells have different TCR specificity  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Immunization leads to the formation of germinal centres (GCs) that contain both T follicular helper (Tfh) and T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Whether T-cell receptor (TCR) specificity defines the differential functions of Tfh and Tfr cells is unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we show that antigen-specific T cells after immunization are preferentially recruited to the GC to become Tfh cells, but not Tfr cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tfh cells, but not Tfr cells, also proliferate efficiently on restimulation with the same immunizing antigen in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ex vivo TCR repertoire analysis shows that immunization induces oligoclonal expansion of Tfh cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, the Tfr pool has a TCR repertoire that more closely resembles that of regulatory T (Treg) cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our data thus indicate that the GC Tfh and Tfr pools are generated from distinct TCR repertoires, with Tfh cells expressing antigen-responsive TCRs to promote antibody responses, and Tfr cells expressing potentially autoreactive TCRs to suppress autoimmunity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Thymus-dependent humoral immune responses are not only critical for protection against pathogens but are also a central protective mechanism of most vaccines.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These antibody-mediated responses depend on germinal centres (GCs)anatomical structures inside the B-cell zonewhere T follicular helper (Tfh) cells interact with and provide help to B cells, enabling affinity maturation and isotype switching1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Affinity maturation is a critical event in the GC reaction in which B cells edit their B-cell receptor (BCR) and undergo a selection process leading to higher receptor affinity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, during affinity maturation, autoreactive BCRs may be generated, resulting in production of autoantibodies and the potential for autoimmune disease.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Several autoimmune diseases are characterized by formation of ectopic GCs and production of autoantibodies2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tfh cells are required for GC formation and maintenance3,4,5,6,7, and Foxp3+ T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells participate in the regulation of GC reactions8,9,10,11,12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lack of Tfr cells or an altered Tfr:Tfh ratio can increase the risk of autoimmunity and autoantibody production13,14,15,16.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This contribution of Tfr cells to the prevention of autoimmunity has been detected in several experimental models of autoimmunity and inferred from human pathology13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we test the hypothesis that populations of Tfh and Tfr cells have different T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, leading to different antigenic targets for effector versus regulatory action.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Protective immune responses are promoted by Tfh cells, which, with a TCR repertoire specific for an immunizing antigen, provide help to B cells and enable BCR affinity maturation, whereas the Tfr cell TCR repertoire, which is predominantly autoreactive, enables these cells to suppress autoreactive affinity-matured B-cell clones, thus preventing autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Using antigen-specific CD4+ T cells from TCR-transgenic mice, we demonstrate that recruitment of Tfh cells into GCs is predominantly controlled by specificity for the immunizing antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  By contrast, recruitment of Tfr cells for the same GCs was not biased towards specificity for the immunizing antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These findings are confirmed in wild-type (WT) mice using major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II tetramers: while we detect a large population of tetramer-positive Tfh cells, almost no tetramer-positive Tfr cells are found.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we use an independent approach, analysing the TCR diversity from sorted T-cell subsets (including Tfh and Tfr) to demonstrate that Tfh cells from GCs induced by immunization with a defined antigen present oligoclonal expansions that are not observed on the Tfr subset.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the Tfr cell TCR repertoire closely resembles the thymic regulatory T (Treg) cell repertoire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, our data not only confirm that Tfh cells differentiate predominantly from naive Foxp3 T cells and that Tfr cells originate from thymic Foxp3+ Treg cells but also show that the ontogeny of Tfh and Tfr cells corresponds to a distinct TCR usage.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tfr cells differentiate from thymic Foxp3+ Treg cells', 'We had previously shown that under lymphopenic conditions, immunization with a foreign antigen leads to GC formation containing Tfr cells that differentiate from adoptively transferred thymic Foxp3+ Treg cells8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude a potential artefact elicited from lymphopenic conditions we now investigated, using congenic markers, the precursors of Tfr cells following immunization in two distinct genetic backgrounds (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS)-purified OVA-specific TCR-transgenic CD4+ T cells from OT-II.Rag/ or DO11.10.Rag/ mice, devoid of thymic Foxp3+ Treg cells, were adoptively transferred into naive C57BL/6 or Balb/c hosts, respectively (Fig 1a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recipient mice were subsequently immunized with OVA in incomplete Freunds adjuvant (OVA-IFA) in the footpad and draining popliteal lymph nodes (LNs) were analysed by flow cytometry, at the peak of GC response, when higher numbers of Tfh and Tfr cells can be obtained (day 11)8,18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Popliteal LNs were found to contain Tfh populations derived to a great extent from transferred TCR-transgenic cells, while Tfr cells derived exclusively from endogenous T cells (Fig 1c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, TCR-transgenic CD4+ T cells from OT-II.Rag+ mice that, unlike Rag-deficient counterparts, harbour a population of TCR-transgenic thymic Foxp3+ Treg cells (Fig 1e), can support the differentiation of Tfr cells, following adoptive transfer into T-cell-deficient mice (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, when OT-II.Rag+ cells were transferred into TCR/ mice we found that they readily gave rise to a population of Tfr cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Note that the popliteal LN allows the study of GCs driven by the immunizing antigen since Tfh and Tfr cells, abundant in immunized mice, are virtually absent on equivalent LNs of non-immunized C57BL/6 mice (Fig 1g,h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results show that while adoptive transfer of thymic-derived Foxp3+ Treg cells can differentiate into Tfr cells Foxp3 T cells only differentiate into Tfh.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Tfr cells do not

cells', 'To assess the specificity requirements of Tfr cells, we took advantage of OT-II.Rag+ mice.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  OVA-specific TCR-transgenic CD4+ T cells from these mice were transferred into congenic C57BL/6 mice subsequently immunized with OVA-IFA or a control antigen (-lactoglobulin, LG; Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Again, using congenic markers, it was possible to quantify the frequency of TCR-transgenic cells within the Tfh and Tfr populations (Fig 2a,b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that a large fraction of Tfh cells in mice immunized with OVA were derived from OVA-specific precursors, while those TCR-transgenic precursors were almost excluded from Tfr cells even in OVA-immunized mice (Fig 2b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To exclude that the low number of TCR-transgenic Foxp3+ Tfr cells observed was due to competition by a much larger number of endogenous cells, we performed adoptive cell transfers into T-cell-deficient mice, allowing competition of the same number of TCR-transgenic and WT T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Thus, the same number of CD4+ T cells from OT-II.Rag+ and WT mice was co-transferred into TCR/ mice followed by immunization with OVA or a control antigen (Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Under those conditions, and 11 days after immunization, TCR-transgenic cells became vastly over-represented among Tfh cells in mice immunized with OVA (Fig 2e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, we found that TCR-transgenic cells were able to differentiate into Tfr, but their frequency (1/5 of Tfr cells) did not change significantly regardless of the immunizing antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the percentage of OT-II.Rag+ Treg cells that differentiated into Tfr is 8% in both immunizations although, as expected, in OVA-immunized mice the percentage of OT-II.Rag+ conventional T (Tconv) cells that differentiate into Tfh is higher than in LG-immunized mice (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: No preferential accumulation of OVA-specific cells

(b) Popliteal LNs were analysed for the presence of OT-II.Rag+ TCR-transgenic cells within Tfh and Tfr populations based on Thy1.2 staining.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tfh cells were defined as CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+Foxp3 and Tfr cells as CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+Foxp3+.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same gating strategy was applied on Treg (CD4+CXCR5PD-1Foxp3+) and Tconv (CD4+CXCR5PD-1Foxp3) cells to determine the percentage of Thy1.2+ OT-II.Rag+ TCR-transgenic T cells within those two populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) OVA-specific TCR-transgenic cells were over-represented within Tfh and Tconv populations in mice immunized with OVA (*P less_than 0.05 using two-tailed non-parametric MannWhitney U-tests).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within Tfr and Treg cells there was no significant increase in OVA-specific cells in mice immunized with OVA, compared to LG-immunized animals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d) An equal number (107) of CD4+ T cells from OT-II.Rag+ and C57BL/6 mice were transferred into T-cell-deficient TCR/ mice, subsequently immunized as described above.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (e) Under these conditions there was an even greater representation of OVA-specific cells within Tfh and Tconv populations (*P less_than 0.05 and **P less_than 0.01 using two-tailed non-parametric MannWhitney U-tests).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although 20% of Tfr cells derived from the OVA-specific TCR-transgenic population, that frequency remained similar in mice immunized with OVA or LG.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar results were obtained in two additional independent experiments, all with n=5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) Frequency of V2 V5 double-positive

as Treg cells19.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, WT T cells can also express more than one TCR, due to recombination of both TCR chains20.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that, as previously described, a proportion of Treg cells (30%) do not co-express the transgenic TCR chains V2 and V5 unlike Tconv cells, which are virtually all double-positive.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, on adoptive transfer into TCR/ mice and immunization, the percentage of OT-II.Rag+ Treg and Tfr cells co-expressing V2 and V5 remained unchanged (Fig 2f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, we could not find a preferential enrichment of V2 V5 double-positive cells, more likely to be specific for the immunizing antigen, within the regulatory populations after OVA immunization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'As the above observations may question the ability of Foxp3+ cells from OT-II.Rag+ mice to properly respond to OVA stimulation, we confirmed that OT-II Treg cells can be activated by OVA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We cultured sorted Treg (CD4+CD25+GITR+) cells from OT-II.Rag+ and C57BL/6 WT mice in presence of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and OVA-pulsed bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs; Fig 2g,h and Supplementary Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that OVA-loaded DCs, unlike DCs loaded with a control antigen, promoted proliferation of OT-II Treg cells to similar extent as stimulation with anti-CD3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, WT Treg cells show lower proliferation and cell numbers when cultured in the presence of both antigens compared to cultures with anti-CD3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, it was previously described that some unspecific proliferation is induced on Treg cells when cultured with activated DCs in the presence of exogenous IL-2 (refs 21, 22), which is in line with what we observed in the cultures of WT Treg cells with OVA/LG-loaded DCs and OT-II Treg cells with LG-loaded DCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These data demonstrate that OT-II Treg cells, in spite of the co-expression of endogenous TCR chains, specifically recognize and proliferate in presence of OVA stimulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the poor differentiation of OT-II Treg cells into Tfr cells following OVA immunization does not appear to be due to loss of OVA reactivity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The low recruitment of OT-II.Rag+ Treg cells as Tfr cells could be due to an intrinsic characteristic of OT-II transgenic cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To test this possibility, we repeated the experiment with a second TCR-transgenic model.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We transferred, simultaneously, an equal number of CD4+ T cells from OT-II.Rag+ and P25.Rag+ mice (TCR-transgenic specific for the residues 280294 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ag85B) that also have thymic-derived Treg cells (Fig 3a,b)23.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recipient mice were immunized in the footpad with OVA323339 or Ag85B280294 peptides coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) in IFA.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We used peptides coupled to a carrier protein (BSA) because it has been reported that immunization with linear epitopes may fail to generate optimal antibody responses24.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Tfh cells from the draining LNs have a substantial frequency increase of TCR-transgenic cells specific for the immunizing antigen (a high frequency of OT-II cells in mice immunized with OVA323339BSA, and P25 cells in mice immunized with Ag85B280294BSA; Fig 3c,d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Within the Tfr population there was only a small increase of TCR-transgenic cells specific for the immunizing antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: P25 cells are not

Tfr cells, those cells are not preferentially selected into the Tfr pool.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Tfr cells do not recognize the immunizing antigen', 'To obtain an independent validation of our findings without the use of TCR-transgenic mice, we used two MHC-II I-Ab tetramers: a phycoerythrin (PE)-labelled tetramer containing an OVA peptide sequence (AAHAEINEA) to identify OVA-specific T cells and an allophycocyanin (APC)-labelled tetramer containing the Ag85B peptide sequence (FQDAYNAAGGHNAVF) to identify Ag85B-specific T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Antigen-specific tetramer+ cells were detected on draining LNs of C57BL/6 mice 11 days after immunization with several combinations of antigens and adjuvants (Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In all immunizations with OVA323339, the number of OVA-tetramer+ cells was increased among the Tfh population compared to mice that were not immunized with this peptide (Fig 4b,c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same pattern was observed in mice immunized with Ag85B280294, where we found larger populations of Ag85B-tetramer+ Tfh cells (Fig 4d,e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, in neither case did we observe an enrichment of tetramer+ cells within the Tfr population (Fig 4be).

(CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+Foxp3), Tfr (CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+Foxp3+) and Treg (CD4+CXCR5PD-1Foxp3+) cells stimulated with DCs loaded with the immunizing antigen to verify whether they specifically proliferate with these signals (Supplementary Fig 2b).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tfh cells from OVA-immunized C57BL/6 Foxp3 reporter mice (Foxp3hCD2)25 were cultured with DCs loaded with OVA or LG as a control antigen.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tfh cells showed higher proliferation and survival on OVA cultures compared to DCs loaded with LG or unloaded DCs, demonstrating that this population specifically recognizes antigen signals (Fig 4f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the contrary, Tfr cells cultured with OVA presented some proliferation (probably due to the same nonspecific effect observed on Treg cell cultures on Fig 2g,h) but that proliferation was not higher than in the presence of LG or unloaded DCs (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The presence of anti-CD3 induced a higher proliferation rate and survival of Tfr cells that translated into higher number of cells at the end of culture compared to the other conditions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, if Tfr cells were specific for the immunizing antigen, TCR signalling would have led to higher proliferation and cell numbers in the end of culture (Fig 4g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note, follicular T cells seem to be fragile, with low survival capacity when they are not receiving

performed TCR usage analysis in C57BL/6 mice, bearing a Foxp3gfp reporter system, immunized with a model antigen (OVA-IFA).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To minimize the contamination with pre-existent Tfh and Tfr

was then analysed by CDR3 spectratyping/Immunoscope26.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The TRBV CDR3 length profiles (or spectratypes) of naive polyclonal CD4+ T cells resemble Gaussian distributions26 (Supplementary Fig 3).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Therefore, by comparing the CDR3 length usage for each TRBV of the four sorted populations to naive CD4+ T cells (used as control population), we can detect variations to this polyclonal distribution.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, in the Tfh population there is an over-representation of specific CDR3 lengths (in red, Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  There are also some over-representations for the Tfr cells but the majority of these, besides not being common to Tfh cells, are also present in Treg cells (Fig 5a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, detailed analysis of specific TRBV segments can identify clonal expansions among Tfh cells that are absent in the other T-cell subsets (Fig 5b, arrows).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Also, we calculated a perturbation score27 for every TRBV segment between all samples and the Tfr group average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) were performed using the calculated perturbation scores to reveal the divergent TRBV usage of all cell populations compared to Tfr group average.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the heatmap, Tfh cells present the higher perturbation scores (more divergent TRBV CDR3 length distributions from Tfr cells) and are clustered separately, while we observe a proximity between Tfr and Treg cells (Fig 5c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, the same relation between sample populations can be observed when we perform PCA: the first two principal components, which describe 77.3% of the samples variability, separate the Tfh from the remaining samples, while clustering Tfr, Treg and Tconv together (Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Analysis of variance and multiple comparison analysis with HolmBonferroni correction for multiple sampling established the significance of the differences observed

(CD4+CXCR5+PD-1+Foxp3); Treg (CD4+CXCR5PD-1Foxp3+); activated CD4+ T (Tact: CD4+CXCR5PD-1Foxp3CD44+); and non-activated CD4+ T (Tconv: CD4+CXCR5PD-1Foxp3CD44) cells (Supplementary Fig 2d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  TRA gene was then specifically amplified and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To perform an unbiased analysis, 9,000 TCR sequences were randomly selected from each data set per sample (9,000 being the lowest number of TCR sequences identified on a sample).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We started by verifying the number of common clonotypes between Tfr cells and other populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The number of shared clonotypes is higher between Tfr and Treg cells than any other population (Fig 6c and Supplementary Fig 4a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, we found that from the 9,000 TCR sequences the number of identifiable clonotypes was lower for Tfr, Tfh and Tact when compared to Treg and Tconv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To determine whether this observation was in line with different clonality in the populations, we calculated a clonality score for each sample (Fig 6d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, the clonality score was higher for the populations with lower numbers of identifiable clonotypes, as expected, given the fact that Tfh, Tact and Tfr have undergone cell proliferation, unlike Treg and Tconv.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When we checked the frequency distribution of the 20 most frequent clonotypes for each sample across all samples, we observed that the 5 most abundant clonotypes represented in average up to 50% of the total frequency for Tfh and Tact, and 40% for Tfr cells (Fig 6e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This was somehow expected since Tfr, Tfh and Tact almost do not exist before immunization and must expand on immunization, in contrast to Treg and Tconv (Fig 6a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Remarkably, the most common clonotypes from Tfh cells are shared in different mice (yellow), and the same happens for the most common Tfr clonotypes (green), although without a significant overlap between Tfh and Tfr clonotypes (Fig 6e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To further investigate the proximity between Tfr and Tfh TCR repertoire, we investigated whether the 20 most predominant clonotypes from each Tfr sample are shared with other populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that the cell population that shares more clonotypes with the predominant Tfr clonotypes is the Treg population (Fig 6f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Among the most abundant clonotypes there is only one shared between all Tfr and Tfh samples, but that clonotype is also present on all Treg samples.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The same approach was performed to obtain the 20 most predominant clonotypes for each Tfh sample (Supplementary Fig 4b), where it is shown that Tfh cells present more shared clonotypes with Tact.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, we wanted to establish the closeness between all samples regardless of the observed expansions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For that we performed hierarchical clustering using HornMorisita index28.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This index has been described as appropriate to compare immune repertoires since it is able to access the similarity between samples while taking into account the abundance of each clonotype in each sample.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We found that Tfr and Treg samples are clustered together (approximately unbiased=96%), indicating that Tfr samples have a repertoire closer to that of Treg cells, rather than to that of any of the other populations (Fig 6g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'These results indicate that although Tfr cells undergo proliferation, their TCR is not specific for the antigen driving the GC reaction since the TCR usage has little in common with Tfh cells repertoire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Instead, Tfr cells present a TCR repertoire that closely resembles to that of Treg cells.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'During GC reaction the BCR undergoes affinity maturation leading to formation of higher-affinity receptors selected by Tfh cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, some mutations may lead to autoreactive receptors or receptors that are cross-reactive with autoantigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Given the documented capacity of Tfr cells to prevent autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity13,14,15,16,17, we investigated the possibility that the TCR usage by Tfh and Tfr populations from the same GCs is different: only the Tfh repertoire is biased towards the immunizing antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We used three distinct approaches to address that issue: one approach based on cell transfer of T cells with defined TCR specificity; another approach using tetramers to identify antigen-specific Tfh and Tfr cells in WT mice; and a final approach based on the analysis of the TCR repertoire.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All experiments led to similar conclusions, showing that T-cell clones specific for the immunizing antigen are enriched within the Tfh pool, but not within the Tfr cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our experiments do not directly show that Tfr cells recognize self antigens and, as a consequence, the antigen specificity of Tfr cells remains to be established.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Nevertheless, as the TCR repertoire of Tfr cells is closer to that of Treg cells, rather than to that of any of the other populations, we speculate that Tfr cells share the same specificity as the Treg population, which is biased towards self antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We cannot exclude that under certain conditions, Tfr cells may be specific for the immunizing antigen and differentiate from peripherally induced Treg cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, a recent report claims that Tfr cells can differentiate from Foxp3 T cells and can be specific for the immunizing antigen29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, even under those conditions tested, the percentage of tetramer-binding Tfr cells was only 3% of total Tfr cells (which we did not observe on our experiments even after enrichment) and only a percentage of those Tfr cells presented markers indicating their differentiation from Foxp3 T cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, these cells alone do not seem to substitute Tfr cells that originate from thymic Treg cells: Tfr cells seem to influence the affinity maturation process30,31 and it has been also shown that mice lacking Treg cells able to migrate into the GC have impaired affinity maturation31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'We studied popliteal LNs in mice immunized in the footpad.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In that location nearly all Tfh and Tfr cells are derived from GCs induced by the immunizing antigen (with negligible contaminants).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a consequence, the different TCR usage between Tfr and Tfh cells, as shown in Figs 5 and 6, suggests different antigen-specificity requirements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, the fact that Tconv and Treg from draining LNs have Gaussian-like TRBV distributions and a low clonality score is in line with our observations with adoptively transferred TCR-transgenic cells: adoptive transfer of TCR-transgenic T cells into non-lymphopenic hosts (Figs 2c and 3d) leads only to a minor expansion of antigen-specific cells among Tconv (46%), unlike what is observed within Tfh cells (3040%).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, the results obtained with tetramers corroborated our hypothesis: we could detect antigen-specific tetramer-binding Tfh, but not Tfr, cells indicating a different TCR usage.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The ontogenic origin of Tfh and Tfr cells has remained an important issue as it may be related to the distinct functional specialization of the two T follicular populations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Indeed, following immunization with an antigen in adjuvant, a process similar to what is observed following vaccination, Tfr cells associated with those induced GCs originate from pre-existing thymic Treg cells (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such ontogenic proximity between Tfr and Treg has a repercussion on the TCR usage by the two populations: the TCR usage by Tfr cells remains largely similar to the TCR usage of Treg cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The different ontogeny of Tfr and Tfh cells suggests an attractive model for distinct functions of the two populations: while Tfh cells predominantly promote humoral responses targeting non-self antigens, Tfr cells prevent the generation of autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  An expected consequence of this model is a different TCR repertoire of Tfh versus Tfr cells, which is confirmed by our present results.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability of Tfr cells to regulate non-antigen-specific B-cell clones has been suggested9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The distinct range of antigen targets of Tfh and Tfr cells from the same GCs provides a molecular basis for such differential behaviour.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It should be noted, however, that such distinction is not complete: it was shown that Tfr cells can partially regulate the amount of antibodies produced targeting a foreign antigen8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In conclusion, our data establish a different antigen specificity of Tfr and Tfh populations from the same GCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tfh cell repertoire comprises oligoclonal expansions in response to immunizing antigens.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Such expansions are not observed in Tfr cells that bear a TCR repertoire resembling that of Treg cells, and thus, possibly, biased towards autoreactivity.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
