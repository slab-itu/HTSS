Observed variations in U.S. frost timing linked to atmospheric circulation patterns  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Several studies document lengthening of the frost-free season within the conterminous United States (U.S.) over the past century, and report trends in spring and fall frost timing that could stem from hemispheric warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the absence of warming, theory and case studies link anomalous frost timing to atmospheric circulation anomalies.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent efforts to relate a century of observed changes in U.S. frost timing to various atmospheric circulations yielded only modest correlations, leaving the relative importance of circulation and warming unclear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, we objectively partition the U.S. into four regions and uncover atmospheric circulations that account for 2548% of spring and fall-frost timing.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These circulations appear responsive to historical warming, and they consistently account for more frost timing variability than hemispheric or regional temperature indices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reliable projections of future variations in growing season length depend on the fidelity of these circulation patterns in global climate models.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Changes and trends in the timing of seasonal transitions, such as the start, end and duration of the frost-free season are important effects and indicators of climate change1,2.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Even though the timing and duration of the frost-free season is important for natural and managed environments, including agricultural production and the phenologies of plant and animal species3,4,5, the relative importance of climatic factors that drive changes in components of the frost-free season over the past century is not well understood.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'It is generally recognized that global warming results in an increase in daily minimum temperatures and subsequently an earlier onset of spring and a delayed end to the frost-free period, resulting in a longer growing season1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to these radiatively induced effects, forecasters have for decades recognized dynamically induced effects, whereby frost-triggering temperature extremes are associated with excitement of atmospheric circulation patterns conducive to delivery of anomalously cold-air masses9, and this is supported by numerous case studies10 and regionally focused composite analyses11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Frost timing is thus responsive to radiatively and dynamically induced temperature variations, and intertwining of these signals and mechanisms in the historical record12,13 contributes to challenges in understanding their respective impacts on growing season length.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The timing of frost or seasonal transitions in specific regions is modestly correlated with teleconnections such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)14, the Northern Annular Mode (NAM)15 and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)8.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Studies focused on regions of the western United States (U.S.) have reported correlations between frost timing and the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern16,17, which is characterized in its positive polarity by troughing over the eastern Pacific, ridging over the Rocky Mountains and troughing over eastern North America18.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, recent work extending frost-timing analysis to a century of data with coverage over the conterminous U.S. found statistically significant linkages to only the AMO5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The roles and relative importance of large-scale warming and dynamically induced atmospheric circulation effects in regulating observed variations in U.S. frost timing are thus not clear.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In this study, objective-clustering algorithms and optimization techniques were used to discover the atmospheric circulations that regulate conterminous U.S. frost timing for fall and spring during the period 19202012.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The importance of these circulation patterns relative to effects from large-scale warming and regional seasonal mean temperature variability was then assessed via statistical modelling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We find that these circulations appear responsive to historical warming, and they consistently account for more frost timing variability than hemispheric or regional temperature indices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The finding that circulation consistently accounts for more frost timing variance than hemispheric annual mean or regional seasonal mean temperature was robust to the number of regions used in the clustering algorithm.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our results indicate that reliable projections of future variations in growing season length depend on the fidelity of the uncovered circulation patterns in global climate models.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'It is often stated, quite logically, that global warming lengthens the frost-free or growing season6,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The results presented here confirm that the timings of spring and fall frost in four objectively identified regions are significantly correlated with hemispheric-scale temperature indices conventionally used to represent greenhouse gas-driven warming, with the Central region during fall being the one exception.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eight frost timing indices analysed here were also significantly correlated with more local indices of temperature constructed by averaging over the season and region corresponding to each frost index.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, the more profound relationship between frost timing and the atmosphere was dynamical in origin and intermediate between hemispheric and local, consisting of circulation anomaly patterns signalling waveform variations associated with atmospheric teleconnections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The relative importance of dynamically versus radiatively induced temperature variations investigated here may also help to explain contrasting trends in spring onset indices that use growing degree day-based measures which are likely responsive to large-scale warming, versus freeze timing-based measures which are likely responsive to shorter term dynamical variability26,27.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The atmospheric teleconnections presented here provide circulations conducive to delivery of anomalously warm or cold air masses to the analysis regions, depending on the sign of the circulation index in a particular year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circulation indices accounted for 2548% of the frost-timing indices, with the regional temperature indices accounting for negligible amounts of additional variance above and beyond the circulation indices.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The frost-driving circulation patterns were broadly PNA-like, meaning that most featured at least three centres of action organized as a wavetrain emanating from the Pacific Ocean.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The centres of action associated with the regions over the eastern U.S. were displaced incrementally toward the south as we would expect progressing from the North region into the Central and South regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The circulation patterns best aligned with the PNA pattern were those driving frost timing in the West region during spring and the South region during fall.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The teleconnections impacting frost timing in the North and Central regions during spring, and also the Central region during fall, featured poor alignment and correlation with the PNA, suggesting that these are distinct teleconnections.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Circulation and warming effects are of course intertwined in the observational record because atmospheric circulation modes both affect and are influenced by large-scale air and sea-surface temperature variability28,29.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The fall circulation patterns identified here are modes of variability (principal components) whose positive polarity signalled anomalous ridging in the respective analysis regions, and all four fall patterns had significant positive correlations with hemispheric-scale temperature suggesting they were amplified by warming.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spring circulation patterns were modes of variability whose positive polarity signalled anomalous troughing in the respective analysis regions, and these modes tended to exhibited weaker negative correlation with hemispheric-scale temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although frost timing is strongly associated with circulation by theory and case study, there is no a priori assurance that circulation patterns can be found that account for more variance than temperature, particularly regional seasonal temperature.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The eight patterns identified here are clearly physically plausible drivers of frost timing based on the geographic positioning of their ridging and troughing anomalies, and the importance of these circulation patterns relative to warming speaks to the variance structure of the frost timing indices (that is, trends and low frequency fluctuations we might associate with warming account for less than half the variance of observed frost timing based on spectral decomposition).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the sensitivity analysis presented above, the principal finding that circulation consistently accounts for more frost timing variance than hemispheric annual mean or regional seasonal mean temperature does not depend on the number of clusters (k) chosen over the test range .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'For future climate change, many studies have investigated how lengthening of the frost-free season could impact ecosystems30 and agricultural productivity31.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pan-continental teleconnections will likely remain important drivers of frost timing variability, even if large-scale warming shifts their effects toward different days of year.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Reliable projection of future variations in growing season length thus depends on global climate model fidelity in representing the spatiotemporal properties of this class of teleconnections32 and how they will respond to large-scale warming.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#

alternatives such as .  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Specifying k=3 instead of k=4 would have merged the North and Central regions, which are both Df-type KöppenGeiger climate zones, and would not have changed the fundamental conclusions of the study.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further analysis of the sensitivity to k is presented at the end of results (Section Sensitivity to number of regions).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Considering the foregoing reasoning and the strength of the findings presented in results, the specification k=4 provides a useful analysis framework.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'To eliminate outlier points present in the initial clustering of S (Supplementary Fig 4a), each station was assigned the mode of the cluster assignments of its seven nearest neighbours, altering 9% of the cluster assignments and yielding the refined clusters shown in Supplementary Fig 4c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resultant analysis regions for spring are shaded in Fig 1c.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This two-step clustering procedure was then implemented for F (Supplementary Figs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  4b,d), with the resultant anlaysis regions for fall shaded in Fig 1d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each station was assigned an area by Dirichlet tessellation for which the associated polygons are evident in Fig 1a,b, the area-weighted mean S time series were then calculated for each of the four spring regions, and the area-weighted mean F time series were calculated for each of the four fall regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Because the spring and fall sets of regions shared similar boundaries, we use the same region naming convention for both seasons (North, South, Central and West) as indicated in Fig 1c,d.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Climate data', 'From the Twentieth Century Reanalysis38 (20CR) Version 2c, we used ensemble mean 500-hPa geopotential heights (Z)

over March through May (ZMAM) or September through November (ZSON) at each of the n grid point within a region of the Northern Hemisphere defined by a spherical quadrangle.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The spherical quadrangle for each PC analysis was optimized via genetic algorithm40 to maximize correlation between the given frost index and one of the first two PCs of ZMAM or ZSON.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The optimization was constrained to the Northern Hemisphere and to regions with at least 15° of latitudinal extent and 62.5° of longitudinal extent to avoid identification of correlation pockets over implausibly small regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To ensure that the algorithm did not hone in on arbitrary domains lacking physical meaning, we visually verified that the loading pattern of each optimized PC aligned with the ridge-trough structures identified in the mapped correlations between geopotential height and frost timing (that is, the contours and shading align well on the maps in Figs 3 and 4).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Each time series was of length m=93 years, we assembled these variables into a m × n matrix, and each PC was an eigenvector of the associated n × n spatial correlation matrix,
