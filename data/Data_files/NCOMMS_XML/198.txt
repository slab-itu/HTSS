A pervasive role for biomass burning in tropical high ozone/low water structures  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Air parcels with mixing ratios of high O3 and low H2O (HOLW) are common features in the tropical western Pacific (TWP) mid-troposphere (300700 hPa).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here, using data collected during aircraft sampling of the TWP in winter 2014, we find strong, positive correlations of O3 with multiple biomass burning tracers in these HOLW structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ozone levels in these structures are about a factor of three larger than background.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models, satellite data and aircraft observations are used to show fires in tropical Africa and Southeast Asia are the dominant source of high O3 and that low H2O results from large-scale descent within the tropical troposphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Previous explanations that attribute HOLW structures to transport from the stratosphere or mid-latitude troposphere are inconsistent with our observations.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study suggest a larger role for biomass burning in the radiative forcing of climate in the remote TWP than is commonly appreciated.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Tropospheric O3 is an important greenhouse gas.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ozone has exerted an increase in the global radiative forcing of climate of 0.4 Wm2 between 1750 and 2011, almost equal to that of CH4 over the same time period1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The largest contribution to the climatic influence of O3 is due to enhancements over background in the tropical troposphere2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated surface O3 adversely affects human health and agriculture4,5.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Legislation enacted to protect public health has significantly reduced emissions of O3 precursors from automobiles, factories and power plants throughout the industrialized world, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes6,7.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Surface O3 levels in the industrialized extra-tropics have plateaued or fallen dramatically in response to these actions8,9.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  It is unclear whether the measures taken to reduce surface O3 in the extra-tropics will reduce the climatic impact of O3, since its largest radiative influence is in the tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'In the marine boundary layer (MBL) of the tropical western Pacific (TWP), O3 is removed by photochemical reactions involving halogen radicals of marine biogenic origin, resulting in O3 abundances of 20 p.p.b.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  or lower10,11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Local convection can transmit this low O3 air throughout the tropospheric column12, resulting at times in O3 profiles that have mixing ratios of 20 p.p.b.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  over an extended altitude range13,14.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Air masses with elevated O3 are frequently accompanied by water vapour mixing ratios depressed with respect to the local background, particularly in the mid-troposphere15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These high ozone/low water (HOLW) structures inhibit mixing and convection16, alter the local radiative heating profile17, and affect the atmospheres oxidative capacity13.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Large increases in O3 relative to these low background values have frequently been observed in the TWP mid-troposphere12,14,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Many of these studies note that water vapour tends to be depressed, with respect to the local background, for these high O3 air parcels12,14,18,19,20,21,22,24, often attributing the HOLW structures to sources outside the tropical troposphere.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Stoller et al.19 conclude that stratospheric air is the dominant source of HOLW air parcels observed over the TWP during multiple aircraft campaigns conducted in September and October 1991, February and March 1994 and September and October 1996.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This conclusion was mainly based on the co-location of high potential vorticity (PV) with a few HOLW structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These early campaigns lacked the instrumentation to measure the suite of chemical compounds sampled during modern campaigns, particularly the biomass burning tracer HCN.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Newell et al.18 reach a similar conclusion, analysing the same data as Stoller et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  in addition to observations from the MOZAIC campaign from between 1994 and 1997.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They note elevated CO and CH4 in some of their observed HOLW structures, citing entrainment of biomass burning emissions into stratospheric air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Using back trajectory analysis in addition to sonde measurements of O3 and H2O from 6 years of Southern Hemisphere ADditional OZonesonde Experiment (SHADOZ) data at three Pacific sites, Hayashi et al.20 argue that transport from the mid-latitude upper troposphere (mlUT) is the dominant source of high mid-tropospheric O3 in the TWP, with biomass burning only a minor contributor in some months.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Kley et al.12 likewise hypothesize a mlUT origin for HOLW features near 700 hPa measured by ozonesondes in the equatorial western Pacific during the CEPEX and TOGA-COARE campaigns conducted during fall 1992.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Ridder et al.25 attribute enhancements in O3 and CO observed remotely in the Northern Hemisphere TWP during October and November 2009 to fossil fuel combustion in Asia, Europe and North America (that is, the mid-latitudes) and in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) to both fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Numerous other studies claim that low H2O in the TWP mid-troposphere, defined here as 300700 hPa, is dominated by the transport of dry air from the mid-latitudes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yoneyama and Parsons26 conclude horizontal advection from the mid-latitudes, likely through Rossby wave breaking, creates the observed distribution of dry air during the TOGA-COARE experiment.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Combining satellite data and trajectory simulations, Waugh27 finds that high PV intrusions in the subtropics lead to low relative humidity (RH) in the intrusion itself and high RH ahead of the intrusion, consistent with transport from the lower stratosphere and the deep tropical troposphere, respectively.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cau et al.28 conclude that a dominant dry air source in the TWP is dehydration of air parcels via poleward movement of tropical, upper tropospheric air into the jet followed by slow descent driven by radiative cooling.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This study relied on 24-day back trajectories and did not account for the presence of convective precipitation, which is known to greatly alter air mass composition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Galewsky et al.29 conclude, using a tagged tracer method and reanalysis data, that mid-latitude eddies and isentropic transport are the dominant source of low H2O in the subtropics in DecemberFebruary 2001/2002.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This analysis focused on the zonal mean distribution of H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The subtropical location of their water minimum is coincident with earths major deserts, which means this region is decoupled from convective precipitation that rehydrates other regions of the tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Conversely, Dessler and Minschwaner30 concluded that deep convective outflow associated with the Hadley circulation is the largest source of low H2O in the tropical eastern Pacific.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our analysis, which focuses on the tropics (20° N20° S) of the western Pacific, similarly suggests low water is controlled by outflow of the Hadley circulation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Other studies cite the importance of biomass burning in controlling tropical O3, particularly over the Atlantic Ocean and in the SH, but fail to account for the origin of low H2O in HOLW air parcels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Jacob et al.31 find that tropical processes alone, including in situ photochemical production from biomass burning emissions and lightning NOx (NOx=NO+NO2), can reproduce observed tropical O3 distributions using measurements over the South Atlantic during the TRACE-A campaign in September and October 1992.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other studies have attributed high O3 observed in the TWP to photochemical production in biomass burning plumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Oltmans et al.14 investigated the O3 climatology over three locations (Fiji, Samoa and Tahiti) in the TWP from the SHADOZ network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Elevated, mid-tropospheric O3 was found at these sites, particularly in September and October.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Back trajectory analysis connected some of these O3 enhancements in Fiji and Samoa to biomass burning in Indonesia, and it was noted that air parcels descended 3 km in transit.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In the PEM-Tropics A mission conducted in the Eastern and Central Pacific of the SH in August and September 1996, both Blake et al.21 and Singh et al.22 attribute elevated O3 in HOLW parcels to photochemical production from biomass burning in Africa and South America based on elevated mixing ratios of biomass burning tracers (C2H2, NOx, CO, CH3Cl, PAN and C2H6) in the structures.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similar to Oltmans et al., Blake et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  and Singh et al.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  posit large-scale subsidence as a possible cause of the low H2O but offer no quantitative support for this supposition.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Folkins et al.24 observed HOLW air over Fiji (18° S) at 120 hPa during the ASHOE/MAESA campaign in October 1994.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These air parcels were enhanced in reactive nitrogen compounds and had high N2O mixing ratios, indicative of a tropospheric origin.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  They attributed the low H2O to transport from the mlUT using 10-day isentropic trajectories but did not provide any quantitative analysis of the effect of thermodynamics or descent on observed H2O.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Finally, Kondo et al.23 attribute increases in O3 of 26 p.p.b.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  over a 31 p.p.b.v.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  background in the western Pacific to biomass burning during the TRACE-P campaign (FebruaryApril 2001).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies either ignore the low H2O (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  23), offer limited explanation14,21,22, attribute low H2O to extra-tropical transport24, or do not describe H2O (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  31).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The source of high O3 as well as the dynamical processes controlling the low H2O in HOLW structures prevalent in the TWP is clearly unresolved.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we analyse aircraft and ozonesonde observations, model output, and satellite data to understand the origin of the HOLW air parcels observed in the TWP during winter 2014.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The Coordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics (CAST) and CONvective TRansport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) aircraft campaigns based in Guam (13.5° N, 144.8° E) provide a comprehensive suite of chemical measurements.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We examine the 17 CAST and 11 CONTRAST flights that provided unprecedented sampling of the TWP mid-troposphere during January and February 2014 (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These in situ observations are supplemented by satellite measurements of water vapour and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) from the daily Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) product as well as fire counts from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Ten day, kinematic back trajectories were initialized along the CAST and CONTRAST flight tracks using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model to connect observed air parcels to their source regions.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The CAM-Chem chemical transport model was run with tagged biomass burning tracers to further elucidate ozone sources and was evaluated with ozonesonde observations from the SHADOZ network.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Models, satellite data and aircraft observations are used to show that anthropogenic fires in tropical Africa and Southeast Asia are the dominant source of the high O3 and that the low H2O results from large-scale descent within the tropical troposphere, after detrainment of biomass burning plumes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1:

combination of cloud top height and precipitation data from geostationary satellites and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We stop the trajectories at the point of last precipitating convection because convection lofts MBL air into the upper troposphere, where it detrains throughout the column, creating a nearly uniform O3 profile and a water vapour profile controlled by the local saturation vapour pressure15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This convection effectively resets air parcel composition, removing any influence from outside the TWP.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Further,

parcel ages of 10 days.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  NO is also elevated in these air parcels (Supplementary Fig 1), though the correlation with O3 is not as prominent as for other species.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This is

indicates that the majority of the HOLW structures encountered by the CAST and CONTRAST aircraft did not require additional condensation after detrainment to account for the low RH.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, these air parcels moistened (experienced a modest increase in H2O mixing ratio) in transit, likely due to mixing with background air.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The low RH is due to large-scale descent in

by the lack of correlation between C2Cl4 and either high O3 (Fig 7) or CO (Fig 8c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Stratospheric origin is also inconsistent with the observed composition of the HOLW structures.

Discussion  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'We have shown that the high O3 in the HOLW structures sampled in the TWP during winter 2014 is quantitatively consistent with a tropical, biomass burning source and that the low H2O mixing ratio is consistent with large-scale descent in the tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In a sense, low RH acts as a tropospheric age of air indicator in the tropics.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Photochemical O3 production driven by emissions from biomass burning regions, in combination with large-scale descent of tropical, tropospheric air parcels that do not experience active precipitation, leads to a strong anti-correlation of H2O and O3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Prior analyses of HOLW structures, which suggested an extra-tropical tropospheric origin12,18,19,20,25, lacked the chemical sophistication of CAST and CONTRAST, relying primarily on ozonesondes or a limited number of chemical tracers in their analyses.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Dynamical features suggested as possible mechanisms to bring dry air into the tropicsintrusions of high PV27, Rossby wave breaking26, and drying through mixing with the subtropical jet28,29are inconsistent with the results presented here.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These prior studies tend to focus on the subtropics rather than the tropics, use trajectories calculated without consideration of convective precipitation and at times in isentropic coordinates, or provide an interpretation for H2O that is qualitative rather than quantitative.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our aircraft and satellite data indicate, in agreement with Dessler and Minschwaner30, that large-scale descent in the tropics associated with the Hadley circulation exerts primary control on the H2O composition of the TWP troposphere for air parcels that have not experienced recent convection.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The attribution of the high O3 in these HOLW structures suggests a potentially larger role for biomass burning in the radiative forcing of climate in the remote TWP than is commonly appreciated.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Tropical tropospheric O3 is a greenhouse gas, exerting a strong radiative forcing on global climate2,3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  However, present efforts to limit emissions of O3 precursors are primarily focused on industrial activities and fossil fuel combustion that occur outside the tropics51.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  If the high O3 in these structures is primarily of tropical origin, then present legislation to limit the emission of O3 precursors in the extra-tropics may have little, if any, positive impact for the radiative forcing of climate due to tropospheric O3.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  While it is beyond the scope of this paper to estimate the radiative effects of these HOLW structures, biomass burning52 and HOLW18 structures are common features of the tropics throughout the year, implying that these structures could have a substantial impact on both global and regional radiative forcing of climate.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
