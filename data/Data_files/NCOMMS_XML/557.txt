Engineering prokaryotic channels for control of mammalian tissue excitability  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Abstract  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'The ability to directly enhance electrical excitability of human cells is hampered by the lack of methods to efficiently overexpress large mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Here we describe the use of small prokaryotic sodium channels (BacNav) to create de novo excitable human tissues and augment impaired action potential conduction in vitro.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Lentiviral co-expression of specific BacNav orthologues, an inward-rectifying potassium channel, and connexin-43 in primary human fibroblasts from the heart, skin or brain yields actively conducting cells with customizable electrophysiological phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Engineered fibroblasts (E-Fibs) retain stable functional properties following extensive subculture or differentiation into myofibroblasts and rescue conduction slowing in an in vitro model of cardiac interstitial fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-expression of engineered BacNav with endogenous mammalian VGSCs enhances action potential conduction and prevents conduction failure during depolarization by elevated extracellular K+, decoupling or ischaemia.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These studies establish the utility of engineered BacNav channels for induction, control and recovery of mammalian tissue excitability.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Introduction  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) exist in all animal organisms and govern processes fundamental to life including neuronal communication, muscle contractions or hormonal release1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In electrically excitable tissues, VGSCs enable firing and spread of action potentials (APs) and their loss-of-function mutations2 cause a variety of neuronal3,4,5,6, cardiac7,8 and skeletal muscle9,10 disorders.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, acute tissue injuries resulting in permanent excitability loss (for example, stroke, spinal cord injury and heart attack) are associated with long-term disability and death.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition to excitable tissues, the VGSCs are expressed in many unexcitable cells including macrophages, microglia and islet -cells, where they play important roles in phagocytosis, migration, insulin secretion and other cellular processes11.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ion-conducting -subunits of mammalian VGSCs have four structurally homologous domains, each consisting of 300 amino acids12.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These four domains are simultaneously transcribed and translated from a single, relatively large ( greater than 6 kb) gene.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This large gene size precludes stable and efficient expression of mammalian VGSCs in primary cells, a strategy that could potentially lead to new remedies for impaired tissue excitability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'The recent discovery of a large bacterial VGSC family (BacNav) has provided novel insights into the structure and biophysical properties of eukaryotic VGSCs13,14,15,16,17.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In contrast to their eukaryotic counterparts, BacNav13 consist of four identical domains, individually transcribed and translated from single genes of only 900 bp in size.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the small size of BacNav facilitates their overexpression and purification for crystallography studies18, it is plausible that BacNav genes could be efficiently packaged into viral vectors, either alone or with other ion channel genes, and used to stably introduce or modify electrical excitability of mammalian tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, utilization of BacNav orthologues with diverse biophysical properties13,14,15,16,19,20, combined with targeted channel mutations, may allow custom engineering of cellular electrophysiological phenotypes tailored to specific tissue types, diseases and individuals.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Here we combined electrophysiological, computational and genetic engineering techniques to establish a versatile BacNav-based platform that enables stable conversion of unexcitable primary human fibroblasts into AP conducting cells that can successfully recover conduction slowing in an in vitro model of cardiac interstitial fibrosis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Moreover, we demonstrate that direct expression of engineered BacNav channels in mammalian excitable cells can enhance their excitability and prevent loss of AP conduction in pathological conditions when endogenous Na+ channels fail to activate.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#  

Results  #@NEW_LINE#@#  
'Genetic engineering of actively conducting human fibroblasts', 'To stably convert unexcitable primary fibroblasts into actively conducting cells (named engineered fibroblasts or E-Fibs), we first explored a BacNav variant from Roseobacter denitrificans, NavRosD G217A, shown in our preliminary tests to be capable of generating AP propagation when transfected in a monolayer of HEK293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1 and connexin-43 (Cx43).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We generated a high-titre bi-cistronic lentivirus pRRL-CMV-RosDG217A-P2A-eGFP-Kir2.1 encoding both NavRosD G217A and inward-rectifier potassium channel Kir2.1 (gene KCNJ2) fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) (eGFP-Kir2.1), separated by the self-cleaving peptide P2A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Adult human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) transduced with this virus stably expressed inward-rectifier K+ current, IK1 (Fig 1a,b), and bacterial Na+ current, INaRosD G217A (Fig 1c,d), at much higher levels compared with endogenous currents, and exhibited a significantly hyperpolarized resting membrane potential of 78.4±0.2 mV (n=6) compared with that of wild-type (wt)-HDFs (23.3±2.9 mV; n=5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The resulting voltage dependencies of activation and inactivation of NavRosD G217A (Fig 1e) in transduced HDFs were similar to those previously reported in transfected HEK293s (ref.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  15).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Importantly, transduced HDFs became electrically excitable, whereby injection of 1 ms current pulses of increasing amplitude elicited reproducible firing of an all-or-none AP (Fig 1f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These results demonstrated the ability of BacNav to yield creation of de novo electrically excitable cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 1: Generation of actively conducting human E-Fibs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) Voltage-clamp recording of IK1 in E-HDFs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Steady-state IK1V curves in E-HDF and wt (unexcitable) HDF.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (ce) Recording of INa (c), peak INaV curve (d) and voltage dependence of INa activation and steady-state inactivation (e) in E-HDFs expressing NavRosD G217A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In b,d,e: n=810.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Data in ae recorded at 25 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f) All-or-none AP response in E-HDFs induced by current pulses (Im) of increasing amplitude.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (g,h) Stable overexpression of Cx43 in E-HDFs (g) results in formation of functional gap junctions, shown by increased recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching, albeit at a slower rate than that of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (CM) (h, n=6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (i,j) Representative isochrone maps of AP conduction in electrically stimulated isotropic (i) and anisotropic (j) monolayers of E-HDFs stably co-expressing Kir2.1, NavRosD G217A and Cx43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Pulse signs indicate position of stimulating electrode.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Circles denote 504 recording sites.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All electrophysiological data obtained at 37 °C, unless otherwise specified.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Error bars indicate s.e.m.Full size image', 'To enable electrical coupling in excitable HDFs, we co-transduced them with a pRRL-CMV-Cx43-P2A-mCherry lentivirus.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Transduced cells robustly expressed membrane-bound Cx43 gap junctions (Fig 1g), which resulted in improved intercellular coupling compared with wt-HDFs as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching21, albeit not to the same level as measured in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (Fig 1h).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These engineered HDFs (E-HDFs) were then cultured at confluence in 2 cm diameter monolayers in a random or aligned configuration (Supplementary Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  When electrically stimulated by a bipolar platinum electrode, randomly oriented E-HDFs supported circular AP spread at an average conduction velocity (CV) of 3.63±0.23 cm s1 (Fig 1i and Supplementary Video 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As expected, aligned E-HDFs exhibited elliptical (anisotropic) AP spread with higher CVs along (3.86±0.14 cm s1, n=5) versus across (2.07±0.19 cm s1, n=5) cell orientation (Fig 1j and Supplementary Video 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the above approach enabled AP propagation in initially unexcitable human fibroblasts, CVs were low, which could be at least in part attributed to the relatively slow activation kinetics of NavRosD G217A.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Improved E-Fib electrical properties with NavSheP mutants', 'To augment the excitability and conduction of E-HDFs, we developed a combined computational and experimental strategy to screen and identify BacNav variants with more favourable properties (Fig 2a).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We set to explore the BacNav orthologue from Shewanella putrefaciens, NavSheP, for its fast current kinetics15.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As the wt NavSheP channel has a highly hyperpolarized voltage dependency of steady-state inactivation, it does not yield AP firing when co-expressed with Kir2.1.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  We thus proceeded to shift the activation and inactivation curves of NavSheP to more depolarized voltages based on the previous studies of specific residues in NaChBac channels22 and significant homology between different BacNav orthologues (Supplementary Fig 2); we created a library of NavSheP mutants where either the D60 or E43 residue was substituted with other standard amino acids.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  These 38 NavSheP mutants were transiently expressed in a monoclonal HEK293 line stably expressing Kir2.1 and the resulting sodium current was recorded by voltage clamp.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The E43 mutants exhibited highly depolarized voltage dependence of activation (Supplementary Table 1); therefore, we focused on detailed characterization of D60 mutants.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The D60 mutant channels exhibited a wide range of steady-state and kinetic parameters (Supplementary Fig 3 and Supplementary Table 1) and predominantly exhibited fast kinetics compared with the NavRosD channel (Supplementary Fig 3c,d and Supplementary Table 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Based on the recorded parameters, we applied computational modelling to infer AP upstroke, threshold, duration and CV that would result from the same expression level of different NavSheP mutants in an electrically coupled, Kir2.1 HEK293 line (Fig 2be and Supplementary Fig 4) and constructed NavSheP D60X-Kir2.1 lentiviruses for three D60X mutants (D60A, D60N and D60S) that exhibited the steepest AP upstrokes and highest CVs among different BacNav models.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  All three mutants exhibited significantly faster kinetics compared with NavRosD G217A in transduced cells (Fig 2f,g), which allowed generation of APs with shorter duration and sharper upstroke velocity (Fig 2hj).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Co-transduction of these viruses with Cx43 in HDFs yielded a 2.5-fold improvement in CV compared with the use of NavRosD (Fig 2k,l and Supplementary Video 2).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  This demonstrated the potential for combining BacNav mutagenesis and computational modelling, to engineer primary human fibroblasts with desired electrophysiological phenotypes.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 2: Customization of E-Fib phenotype via mutagenesis.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a) BacNav-based strategy for E-Fib customization.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (b) Experimental (n=8) and modelling peak INaV curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell membrane was held at 80 mV before stepping the voltage from 50 to 60 mV in 10 mV increments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (c) Experimental (n=21) and modelling steady-state IKV curves.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Cell membrane was held at 40 mV before stepping the voltage from 90 to 50 mV in 10 mV increments.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (d,e) AP initiation and conduction characteristics of BacNav mutant expressing E-HDFs obtained by computational modeling: upstroke velocity (d) and CV (e).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For modelling, parameters derived from voltage-clamp measurements at 25 °C were scaled for the temperature of 37 °C.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Highly hyperpolarized inactivation of WT and D60E channels prevented AP initiation.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (f,g) Time constants of activation (f) and inactivation (g) of selected NavSheP D60X mutants compared with NavRosD G217A (RosDm), recorded in E-HEK293 cells at 25 °C (n=5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (hj) When co-expressed with Kir2.1 in E-HEK293 cells, NavSheP mutants give rise to APs (h) with faster upstroke (i;

Supplementary Fig 6) and compared resulting CVs with those caused by an increase in INaSheP alone (model 2; Supplementary Fig 6).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Despite the same AP upstroke velocities in both models (Supplementary Fig 6a), CV in model 1 increased less (Supplementary Fig 6b), because more depolarizing current was needed to overcome high IK1, reach threshold and elicit AP (Supplementary Fig 6c).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Examining a wide range of channel conductances ( and ) further revealed that although threshold current required to elicit AP is primarily sensitive to level of IK1 (Supplementary Fig 6d), AP upstroke velocity is mainly dependent on INaSheP (Supplementary Fig 6e), with these two currents inducing opposite effects on CV (Supplementary Fig 6f).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, as E-HDFs were also transduced with pRRL-CMV-Cx43-P2A-mCherry lentivirus, sorting cells based on mCherry fluorescence level (Supplementary Fig 5c) allowed us to vary Cx43 expression and gap junctional coupling of engineered cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Optical mapping revealed that E-HDFs with higher mCherry/Cx43 expression supported faster AP propagation (Fig 3i), whereas contrary to eGFP sorting (Supplementary Fig 5b), mCherry sorting had no effect on APD80 (Supplementary Fig 5d).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Simulation results further revealed that intercellular coupling strength does not influence the relative effects of varying IK1 and INaSheP on CV (Supplementary Fig 6g).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Figure 3: Tuning electrical properties of E-Fibs via FACS.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  (a,b) Steady-state IK1V curves (a;

'Since their discovery 15 years ago13, prokaryotic Na+ channels have contributed greatly to understanding structure16,20, function34,35 and pharmacology36 of the more complex eukaryotic VGSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Yet, it has remained unexplored if large diversity and small gene size of BacNav could be employed to stably modify and augment the excitability of mammalian tissues, a feat difficult to achieve using large mammalian VGSCs.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In this study, we presented a combined experimental and computation strategy for use of BacNav channels in the de novo induction and control of mammalian tissue excitability.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Our goal was to develop a versatile platform that would be cost-effective, applicable to a variety of cell types and amenable to rapid production of large quantities of excitable cells for off-the-shelf use.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Previously, we applied a non-viral stepwise expression of cardiac Na+ channel Nav1.5, inward rectifier K+ channel Kir2.1 and gap junctional protein Cx43, combined with antibiotic selection, to generate a stable monoclonal HEK293 line capable of active AP conduction32.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Other proof-of-concept studies applied adenoviral expressions of mammalian VGSCs to induce or modify excitability in primary tissues37,38,39; however, these effects were transient and unsuitable for long-term studies or the development of antiarrhythmic gene therapies38,39.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Although the use of split-intein-mediated protein trans-splicing strategy40 might be adapted in the future to induce stable expression of mammalian VGSCs in primary cells, efficacy of this approach may be limited due to the need for co-transduction of two or more viruses to reconstitute functional channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  To circumvent the need for expressing large mammalian VGSCs, we exploited much smaller BacNav genes and designed high-titre multi-cistronic lentiviruses coding minimum sets of ion channels required for stable and efficient induction of excitability in primary cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In fact, using BacNav+Kir2.1 lentiviruses, human and rodent fibroblasts were routinely transduced with 90% efficiency without any loss of cell viability (not shown).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Including a fluorescent reporter in the same virus allowed us to further purify transduced cells and fine-tune their electrical properties (Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Importantly, lentivirally expressed ion currents in all engineered fibroblasts were much larger than their endogenous currents (Fig 1).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As such, resulting electrophysiological phenotype of engineered cells was relatively insensitive to the cells epigenetic state and both predictable in silico and for the most part reproducible among different cell types in vitro (Fig 4jl and Supplementary Fig 8).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  The ability to generate actively conducting HVFs, in particular, suggested a potential therapeutic strategy whereby in situ fibroblast engineering could improve impaired conduction in fibrotic heart tissues.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  As a proof of concept, we showed that well-coupled and excitable (but not weakly coupled and/or unexcitable) fibroblasts successfully restored normal neonatal rat cardiomyocyte conduction in an in vitro model of interstitial fibrosis (Fig 5).  #@NEW_LINE#@#  On the other hand, distinct forms of cardiac fibroses, differing in size, and cellular and non-cellular components can result from various types of heart disease or injury41.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In situ engineering of actively conducting fibroblasts, while potentially beneficial in improving cardiac conduction in small regions of interstitial or diffuse fibrosis where these cells come in close contacts with cardiomyocytes, may not prove as effective in large cardiac scars with low cellularity.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Of note is also that without the prominent Ca2+ currents, engineered fibroblasts are unlikely to spontaneously fire APs or be a source of triggered activity, which could potentially make them less arrhythmogenic compared with the use of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes42,43.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Furthermore, transduction of mammalian excitable tissue cultures with specific BacNav mutants augmented or rescued conduction in healthy (Supplementary Fig 10) and pathological (depolarization, decoupling and ischaemia; Fig 6 and Supplementary Fig 11) conditions, suggesting that BacNav-based gene therapies could be targeted directly to excitable cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In addition, previous studies have shown that BacNav could be converted into Ca2+-selective channel (BacCav) by substituting three amino acid residues of the selectivity filter with Aspartate19,44,45.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Hence, stable expression of engineered BacNav channels or their Ca2+-selective derivatives may enable direct therapeutic effects on excitable and unexcitable cells whose function relies on voltage-gated Na+ or Ca2+ channels.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Although in this study we focused on altering specific amino acid residues (E43 or D60) in a particular BacNav orthologue (NavSheP), various combinations of other BacNav orthologues and residues18,46,47 could be explored to customize phenotype of engineered or native excitable cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  For example, mutations in the glycine hinge region in some BacNav orthologues could change channel inactivation rate15, and along with tuning of Kir2.1 expression via an independent promoter, could be used to control AP duration to avoid arrhythmogenic dispersion of refractoriness if E-Fibs were used for cardiac cell or in situ gene therapy.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, replacing the highly conserved negative residues (E70 and D91) of BacNav voltage-sensitive domain with positively charged residues could shift activation to more hyperpolarized voltages48 and be used to reduce AP threshold.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Similarly, substituting the negatively charged residues in the neck region of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the BacNav channel into glycine could destabilize the helix conformation of this region, decrease the depolarization energy required for channel opening49 and further augment cell excitability and conduction.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Furthermore, a recent study by Arrigoni et al.50 showed that BacNav CTD plays a critical role in voltage dependence of activation, suggesting CTD swapping among different orthologues could provide yet another method to control excitability of engineered cells.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  ', 'Basic studies in lower organisms, including prokaryotes, have led to versatile approaches to manipulate and study mammalian biology.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  Recent examples include optogenetics51 and genome-editing techniques52 that, in addition to becoming powerful research tools, have been extensively investigated for potential medical applications.  #@NEW_LINE#@#  In line with these undertakings, our work supports expansion of prokaryotic ion channel research to basic studies of mammalian tissue excitability and development of new human therapies.'  #@NEW_LINE#@#
